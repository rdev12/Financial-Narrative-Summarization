 PROTECTING LIFE AND 
IMPROVING QUALITY
OF LIFE
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 INVESTMENT
PROPOSITION
Halma has an impressive record of creating sustained shareholder value through the 
economic cycle. We have consistently delivered record proﬁts, high returns, strong 
cash ﬂows with low levels of balance sheet gearing and have a 30+ year track record 
of growing dividend payments by 5% or more every year. 
Our ability to achieve record proﬁts through the recent periods of economic turbulence is derived 
from our strategy of having a group of businesses building strong competitive advantage in 
specialised safety, health and environmental technology markets with resilient growth drivers. 
These growth drivers, such as increasing Health and Safety regulation, mean that demand for 
our products is sustained, in both developed and developing regions, through periods of 
signiﬁcant macro-economic change.
Organic growth generates the ﬁnancial and business resources we need to fund acquisitions 
and keep increasing dividends. 
We generate organic growth momentum by increasing levels of investment in people 
development, new product development and establishing platforms for growth in developing 
markets. Here, the need for improving Safety, Health and Environmental regulation is increasingly 
recognised by governments and demanded by the wider population.
Over the long term, we actively manage the mix of businesses in our Group to ensure we 
can sustain strong growth and returns. We acquire businesses to accelerate penetration of more 
attractive market niches, we merge businesses when market characteristics change and we exit 
markets which offer less attractive long-term growth and returns through carefully planned 
disposals.
Halma’s resilient market qualities, organic growth momentum and active portfolio management 
position us strongly to create shareholder value and achieve high levels of performance in 
the future.

Overview  02-09 A glance backwards and a glimpse forwards
As previously announced, I will be stepping down from the Board 
immediately after the AGM on 25 July 2013. Halma has only had two 
Chairmen in the past 40 years, the founder, David Barber, and myself. 
When David stepped down in July 2003 he departed from the annual 
reporting format of commenting on the year’s results and instead 
reﬂected on some of Halma’s achievements over the years. I thought 
I would do the same, as the results are reported fully elsewhere in this 
report, save to say that 2012/13 was another record year and we are 
recommending a dividend increase of 7%, the 34th year of increases 
of 5% or more.
“Welcome to Halma Mr Unwin”
My ﬁrst AGM was in July 2003 and what immediately struck me was 
the number of private shareholders who were there – all passionate 
Halma followers. One gentleman came up to me and said, “I have 
been a loyal shareholder for many years and thanks to the 
progressive dividends from Halma, have been able to educate my 
children. So thank you, welcome to Halma Mr Unwin”. He then ﬁxed 
me with a look that said “and don’t mess it up” (it may have been 
stronger!). It then really struck home what a privileged and onerous 
responsibility I had taken on.
Glancing back
So what has changed over the ten years?
Firstly, what has not changed is the fundamental business model: our 
companies operate in niche markets where demand is underpinned 
by strong growth drivers. They produce high returns on sales and 
capital, and those returns go to pay taxes, dividends and re-
investment in the business, including buying more companies with 
similar characteristics. All this is embraced by strong reporting and 
controls.
One signiﬁcant change was the appointment of Andrew Williams as 
CEO in February 2005, only the third CEO in Halma’s history. Andrew 
provides clear, calm, insightful leadership and the Group’s 
performance under his tenure speaks for itself. He is a pleasure to 
work with.
Our strategy has been sharpened, and the framework under which 
we operate more clearly deﬁned (detailed in this Annual Report).
Delegation and strong autonomy has been re-enforced at the 
subsidiary company level. Our Managing Directors have huge 
freedom to operate and to innovate in response to what their 
customers are telling them. This freedom also generates high 
job satisfaction.
CHAIRMAN’S
ST A TEMENT
“...the performance over
these years is due to a truly 
dedicated team of people
across the Group.”
4Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The necessary ﬁnancial and management resources have been put 
in place to support our strategy. Two examples illustrate this.
• Acquisitions: our Divisional Chief Executives (DCEs) are 
tasked with identifying suitable acquisitions. The pressure on their 
time was such that we found we were not seeing sufﬁcient 
opportunities and when we decided ‘to put money to work’ we 
could not always reach our goals. So, we strengthened our 
acquisition sourcing efforts with a few highly experienced 
executives to support the DCEs. Our recent acquisition history 
illustrates that this is working effectively but, there will continue 
to be times when we decide that the economic climate or prices 
are not favourable and therefore we will stand aside for a while.
• Geographic expansion: we recognised that we were underweight 
in the faster growing economies and unless addressed, our growth 
would suffer. The problem was how to make it easier for our 
companies to enter those markets? Our solution was to create 
hubs in China and India (with other sector-based hubs now 
following) staffed by people with the remit to do whatever was 
necessary to make it easier for our companies to start operating 
there. One can see a logical progression of our business in, say, 
China. We start with a hub, then increase local sales through our 
regional ofﬁces, then local product assembly, then local R&D. As a 
result more MDs are resident in the region and ﬁnally we start to 
acquire companies, e.g. Longer Pump acquired this year in China. 
In 2003 under 10% of our business came from Asia Paciﬁc, this 
year it is over 16% and in China our headcount has moved from 70 
to 770. We have made a signiﬁcant investment and the foundations 
are strong for growth in the future.
Incentives. At the beginning of the period, bonuses were rarely 
achieved and options were under-water. We refreshed the total 
remuneration framework based around Economic Value Added (EVA) 
together with introducing new long-term incentives all aligned with our 
strategy and adding shareholder value. Shareholders can see very 
clearly that in very good years bonuses will hit their maximum and 
in poor years may well be zero. They correlate. No surprises there, 
they are based on EVA. It was also ﬂattering to hear that one of our 
major shareholders cites the Halma remuneration scheme as a model 
for others!
Much emphasis has also been placed on the quality of our company 
boards, particularly against the ever-increasing demands of global 
markets. Formal management training has been introduced tailored 
to our needs. This started with the Halma Executive Development 
Programme and now runs right through to our own graduate 
development programme. This has also encouraged our companies 
to develop training programmes of their own.
We have taken steps on gender diversity at the Board level, although 
at the company level it is much more difﬁcult unless more female 
talent is encouraged throughout our operations. Pleasingly, in 2013, 
the majority of our graduate programme recruits are female. 
A number of promotions have come from within so that people 
can see career opportunities across the Group – not just their 
own company.
There has been a major shift in sharing and co-operation, helped by 
our training programmes and using technology (intranets and social 
media) to enable it. We introduced a Halma Innovation and 
Technology Exposition four years ago, which is now held every two 
years to enable all the companies to share their innovation and 
technology with other Halma companies. This event has become 
more and more powerful and effective; there is a palpable buzz in 
the air.
In the period since March 2003 we have increased our dividend 
per share by 79% declaring £300m of dividends for shareholders. 
Halma’s market capitalisation has increased nearly ﬁve-fold and
we have become one of the top 150 companies on the
London Stock Exchange. 
A glimpse forwards
• The basic model is sound and our strategy, which is kept under 
challenging review, will evolve, just as it has done over the years.
• More and more of our subsidiary boards will have to deal with the 
challenge of moving from domestic, single continent operations to 
global, multi-continent operations. As we know, this is not a trivial 
matter and the model that works best for each company will largely 
be dictated by the structure of their customers.
• To compete we have to have the best teams, so training, 
development and talent spotting will continue to increase 
in importance.
• 2016 or thereabouts will be a key year; the year when China is 
forecast to overtake the USA as the world’s biggest economy 
(according to the OECD after accounting for price differences). This 
will have a profound effect. For Halma, it means that the centre of 
gravity of R&D will change, and that’s only three years ahead!
• These changes will test our structures, but I know Halma will rise 
to these challenges.
• Progress up the FTSE also brings new pressures. More and more 
people will be aware of Halma.
• Finally, for sure, the pace of business and innovation will not get 
any slower. I used to say in a previous life, that what used to take 
us nine months to achieve would shortly be required in nine weeks 
and then, who knows, nine days!
I hope this gives some insight into the way Halma has evolved over 
the last ten years and gives a glimpse to the future.
What is certain is that these changes, and the performance over 
these years is due to a truly dedicated team of people across the 
Group. It is their focus on our customers and the markets they serve 
that make the difference. To everyone in Halma, I say a sincere thank 
you for all that you have achieved, you have made my role a pleasure.
I should also like to thank my predecessor, David Barber, for making 
my induction into the Company he founded so smooth; to all my 
colleagues on the Board, they have been terriﬁc, both challenging 
and supportive as needed.
Finally, in Paul Walker, we have a highly successful international 
businessman with the relevant experience and the right personal 
attributes to chair Halma to even greater heights. I look forward 
to you welcoming him at the AGM.
It has been a privilege.

Business model
What is Halma’s growth objective?
Our business model objective is to double Group revenue and proﬁt 
every ﬁve years. 
We aim to achieve this through a mix of acquisitions and organic 
growth. Return on Sales in excess of 18% and Return on Capital 
Employed over 45% ensure that cash generation is strong enough
to sustain growth and increase dividends without the need for high 
levels of external funding.
Strategy
How do we grow?
We operate in relatively non-cyclical, specialised global niche markets. 
Our technology and application know-how deliver strong competitive 
advantage to sustain growth and high returns. Our chosen markets 
have signiﬁcant barriers to entry. Demand for our products is 
underpinned by long-term, resilient growth drivers.
We place our operational resources close to our customers through 
autonomous locally managed businesses. 
We reinvest cash into acquiring high performance businesses in,
or close to, our existing markets.

Organic proﬁt growth

Strategic focus
Through strategic investment in people development, international expansion and innovation we aim to achieve organic growth 
in excess of our blended market growth rate of 5%.
KPI deﬁnition 
Organic revenue growth measures the change in revenue achieved in 
the current year compared with the prior year from continuing Group 
operations. The effect of acquisitions and disposals made during the 
current or prior ﬁnancial period has been equalised.
Comment
Organic growth in revenue but below our minimum target. At 
constant currency organic revenue growth of 3% was achieved. Over 
the last ﬁve years our average rate of annual organic revenue growth 
has been 6% p.a. which is 1% in excess of our minimum target.
KPI deﬁnition 
Organic proﬁt growth measures the change in proﬁt achieved in
the current year compared with the prior year from continuing Group 
operations. The effect of acquisitions and disposals made during
the current or prior ﬁnancial period has been equalised.
Comment 
Organic proﬁt growth achieved with a strong performance in the 
Medical and Process Safety sectors. Organic proﬁt growth at 
constant currency was 5%. Over the last ﬁve years our average
rate of annual organic proﬁt growth has been 8% p.a.
2014 target
The Board has established a long-term minimum organic growth target of 5% p.a. representing the blended long-term average growth rate
of our markets. This target remains appropriate given the Group’s overall revenue and proﬁt objective of growing by 15% p.a. after acquisition 
revenue and proﬁt are taken into account.
In order to meet the target of organic growth in excess of 5%, the Group must maintain its focus on investment in innovation, people 
development and geographic expansion in order to ensure the momentum developed over recent years is continued.
The primary factors affecting our ability to meet the target relate to competitive innovations overtaking the Group’s technology 
and macro-economic factors.

Comment
High returns achieved representing a further improvement in 
performance against the previous year. The increased rate of 
proﬁtability of three of our four sectors drove this result.
2014 target
We aim to achieve a Return on Sales within the 18% to 22% range 
while continuing to deliver proﬁt growth.

Total sales to markets outside the UK, USA and Mainland Europe 
as a percentage of total revenue from continuing operations.
Comment
Revenue outside the UK, USA and Mainland Europe increased to 
25.4% of the Group total (2012: 23.8%) with revenue from Asia Paciﬁc 
up by 15%. Revenue from China grew by 25% to £37m which is now 
5.6 times the level in 2006 when we established our ﬁrst Halma hubs.
2014 target
Our aim is for revenue outside the UK, USA and Mainland Europe to 
be 30% of the Group total by 2015. Halma corporate hubs were 
established in China and India to assist companies in setting up local 
operations. More operating companies have established a presence 
in South America during 2012/13 and this trend should deliver 
beneﬁts in 2013/14 and beyond.

Comment
Consistently high returns are in excess of our long-term Weighted 
Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 8.4% (2012: 8.0%). 
Earnings increased but not as fast as our asset base with a high level 
of retained earnings despite the increased dividend.
2014 target
The target of 12% was set in 2005 when the Group’s ROTIC was
12. 1% and WACC was 7 .9%. A range of 12% to 17% is considered 
representative of the Board’s expectations over the long term.

KPI deﬁnition
ROCE is deﬁned as the operating proﬁt from continuing operations 
before amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition 
transaction costs, movement on contingent consideration and proﬁt 
on disposal of operations, as a percentage of capital employed.
Comment
Very high returns maintained above the target level. Growth achieved 
with increased investment in operating assets and a continual drive
to sustain high levels of efﬁciency in our operations, and acquire high 
ROCE businesses.
2014 target
The target of >45% is set in order to ensure the efﬁcient generation
of cash at all levels to fund our target level of organic growth, 
acquisitions and dividend growth without Halma becoming a 
highly-leveraged group.

more value-enhancing acquisitions. 
2014 target
2013 ended with sufﬁcient ﬁnancial capacity to ﬁnance further

KPI deﬁnition
Cash generation is calculated using adjusted operating cash ﬂow as a 
percentage of adjusted operating proﬁt.
Comment
Cash generation of 84% (2012: 86%) is very close to the 85% target in 
the current year with good cash performances across the Group but 
work to do in maintaining appropriate debtor and inventory levels.
The methodology used to calculate this KPI has been revised from 
the prior period as part of the Group’s continuous appraisal of its 
ﬁnancial reporting, to ensure comparability with industry best 
practice, and to give the most useful measure of the Group’s cash 
performance.
The main change to the method of calculation is to include capital 
expenditure as an operating cash ﬂow whereas previously the KPI 
followed the accounting treatment, which includes this expenditure
as a cash ﬂow from investing activities.
2014 target
The goal of Group cash inﬂow exceeding 85% of proﬁt is a metric that 
has relevance at all levels of the organisation and aligns management 
action with Group needs. We will ensure that strong internal cash ﬂow 
and availability of external funding underpin our strategic goals of 
organic growth, acquisitions and progressive dividends.

17 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 2014 STRATEGIC
PRIORITIES
1
Innovation
In early May 2013, we held our third HITE event in Florida, USA which included a 
two-day Halma ‘trade-show’ where all the Group’s companies showcased their 
innovation and technologies to one another. HITE is a catalyst for collaboration between 
our businesses and is a visible example of how Halma’s culture has changed, and 
continues to evolve. Collaboration and learning from each other is increasing the rate of 
innovation and, consequently, building competitive advantage in our chosen markets. 
We anticipate that our M&A activity will continue to support increased R&D investment.
2
People Development
Subsidiary company strategic objectives, annual performance goals and management 
incentives are aligned with Halma’s and are underpinned with a relentless commitment 
to attract and develop high quality talent. We will continue to invest in our HEDP , HMDP 
and HCAT programmes as well as the new HGDP . Through HGDP , we aim to increase 
the depth of talent coming through our management ranks and also expect it to 
contribute to an increase in management diversity in the medium term.
3
International Expansion
We choose to operate in niches within markets with robust, long-term growth drivers on 
a global scale. This gives our businesses the opportunity to sustain growth in all regions 
of the world. Our strategic objective is for at least 30% of revenue to come from outside 
the UK, Mainland Europe and the USA by 2015.
4
Portfolio Management
We actively manage our business portfolio through acquiring in (or adjacent to) our 
existing markets, merging companies as market needs change and selling businesses 
where we do not see the medium-term prospects for sustaining high returns or growth.
We are continuing to add new opportunities to our acquisition pipeline process in all four 
of our new reporting sectors. Although the past year has been productive, we are 
working to both integrate these newly acquired businesses and progress further 
opportunities into the later stages of our acquisition process. We remain conﬁdent in our 
ability to ﬁnd and acquire high quality businesses within our chosen markets over the 
medium term.
18 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 “Our four new reporting sectors...
are clearly aligned with our
long-term market growth drivers 
yet offer the potential for Halma
to enter new, adjacent market 
niches within each sector.”
Halma made good progress during the year delivering a strong 
trading performance, signiﬁcant M&A activity and further increases in 
investment in geographic expansion, innovation and people 
development. Our four new reporting sectors, announced earlier this 
year, are clearly aligned with our long-term market growth drivers yet 
offer the potential for Halma to enter new, adjacent market niches 
within each sector. Halma’s record of sustaining short-term ﬁnancial 
success while investing to develop opportunities for the longer term 
gives us conﬁdence for the future.
Record revenue and proﬁt for the tenth 
consecutive year
Full year revenue increased by 7% to £619.2m (2012: £579.9m). 
Organic growth was 2% and 3% at constant currency. Full year 
adjusted
1
 proﬁt increased by 8% to £130.7m (2012: £120.5m) 
with organic growth of 4% which was 5% at constant currency. 
Excluding businesses sold during the current and prior years,
revenue grew by 9% and proﬁt was up by 10%.
We maintained steady growth momentum throughout the year. Order 
intake in the second half remained slightly ahead of revenue enabling 
us to make a positive start to the 2013/14 ﬁnancial year.
Excellent returns and cash generation
We continued to achieve high returns with Return on Sales improving 
further to 21. 1% (2012: 20.8%). Return on Capital Employed at the 
operating level remained high at 71.3% (2012: 7 4.7%) while our 
post-tax Return on Total Invested Capital was 15.8% (2012: 16.8%).
Cash generation was in line with expectations and we ended the 
period with net debt of £1 10m (2012: £19m) having spent £148m 
(2012: £20m) on acquisitions, £15.5m on capital expenditure 
(2012: £16.5m) and paid out £37 .8m and £25.5m on dividends and 
tax respectively.
Strong growth in Asia, steady progress in USA 
and Europe
The relative trading patterns across the major global regions were 
consistent through the year. Growth from Asia Paciﬁc of 15% was 
strong, with revenue exceeding £100m for the ﬁrst time (2012: £87m). 
In aggregate, revenue from outside our traditional ‘home’ markets
of the UK, Mainland Europe and USA grew by 14% to £157m
(2012: £138m), now representing 25% of the Group and maintaining 
progress towards our target of 30% by 2015.
In total, revenue from the UK, Mainland Europe and USA increased 
by 5%. Revenue from the USA increased 20% to £195m (2012: 
£162m) boosted by recent acquisitions and organic growth (constant 
currency) of 4%. Trading conditions were tougher in the UK and 
Mainland Europe. In the UK, revenue decreased by 8% to £1 16m 
(2012: £126m) although excluding the impact of disposals, the organic 
decline at constant currency was only 3%. Revenue from Mainland 
Europe was 2% lower at £152m (2012: £154m) although, here
again, the organic decline in constant currency terms was lower,
at just 0.5%. 
New reporting sectors
For the ﬁrst time Halma’s results are reported under four sectors 
which are clearly aligned with our core markets of safety, health and 
environmental. Full details of the background to this change were 
released in our announcement on 14 February 2013 and can be
seen on our website www.halma.com.
Process Safety performed strongly with revenue up by 3% to 
£125.7m (2012: £122.2m) and proﬁt
2
 increasing by 1 1% to £32.3m 
(2012: £29.2m). Excluding the contribution of Tritech, which was sold 
in August 2012, continuing operations revenue grew by 10% 
and proﬁt by 16%. Organic revenue growth at constant currency 
was 10% with continued strong demand from energy and resources 
markets. Together with process industries these markets contribute 
around 60% of sector revenue and beneﬁt from increasing Health 
and Safety regulation.
Return on Sales increased from 23.9% to 25.7% through a 
combination of strong revenue growth and gross margins supported 
by continuous improvement in new product innovation. 
Organic revenue growth at constant currency for markets outside the 
UK, Mainland Europe and USA was an impressive 29% resulting in 
these fast developing markets now representing 28% of the sector. 
Encouragingly, the performance in our traditional ‘home’ markets was 
robust with mid-single digit organic revenue growth at constant 
currency in Mainland Europe and USA and ﬂat UK organic growth.
Infrastructure Safety delivered another solid year. Revenue 
increased 1% to £205.3m (2012: £204.3m) and proﬁt
2
 grew by 7% to 
£41.8m (2012: £39. 1m). Return on Sales improved from 19. 1% to 
20.3% with a signiﬁcant factor being the improved proﬁtability 
following the reorganisation of our companies selling elevator 
products. Organic revenue growth at constant currency was
1% which, following a ﬂat ﬁrst half, reﬂected a slight improvement 
during the second half. This resilience in demand comes from our 
focus on safety-critical product niches for regulated non-residential 
applications. Approximately two-thirds of sector revenue is installed
in existing infrastructure rather than new construction.
New product introductions and increased investment in sales 
resources contributed to strong growth in the USA where organic 
revenue growth (constant currency) was 18%. Elsewhere we
saw modest rates of growth in the UK and Asia Paciﬁc while, 
unsurprisingly, almost every business in this sector experienced 
difﬁcult conditions in Mainland Europe, resulting in organic revenue 
decline there of 8%.

Medical had an outstanding year, increasing revenue by 36%
to £136. 1m (2012: £100.4m) and proﬁt
2
 by 37% to £35.9m 
(2012: £26.3m). Return on Sales increased further from 26.2% to 
26.4%. The underlying organic revenue growth (constant currency) 
was 12%. As expected, slowly improving demand for ﬂuid control 
components from major medical OEM customers, steady growth in 
ophthalmology markets and our increased product innovation were 
the signiﬁcant contributory factors to this excellent result.
Our strategic focus on small medical devices and components rather 
than high value capital equipment, enabled us to mitigate the negative 
impact from government austerity spending cuts in certain markets. 
The fundamental market drivers of an ageing population in the West 
and a growing and wealthier population in the East, give us continued 
conﬁdence for the future.
Both the USA and Mainland Europe performed well with organic 
revenue growth (constant currency) of 12% and 17% respectively, 
whilst the UK saw organic revenue decline of 3%. Revenue from 
outside these three major territories increased organically by 12%, to 
now represent 25% of the sector. Our real exposure to these faster 
growing markets is greater, as a sizeable proportion of our revenue 
from the USA and Mainland Europe is to global OEMs who 
subsequently export their ﬁnished systems to other global regions.
Environmental & Analysis had a relatively disappointing year as 
revenue declined by 1% to £152.4m (2012: £153.4m) and proﬁt
2
reduced by 4% to £30.4m (2012: £31.6m). Return on Sales was 
19.9% (2012: 20.6%). Organic revenue at constant currency was 
down 6%. Reduced government research spending in the USA and 
lower investment by water utilities in the UK were the two major 
adverse market factors. 
These market factors are clearly reﬂected in the regional trends with 
organic revenue (constant currency) declines of 14% in the UK and 
10% in the USA. Organic revenue from Mainland Europe fell by 4%. 
Our companies continue to invest in growth in markets outside the 
UK, Mainland Europe and USA with revenue from these developing 
markets being 27% of the total sector, contributing organic growth 
of 6%. 
Despite the challenges faced by Environmental & Analysis in the past 
year, we are conﬁdent that the management and organisational 
changes currently being made will improve performance in the future. 
These include simplifying global sales channels and manufacturing 
operations together with increasing senior management resources to 
focus on accelerating growth in Asia and from recent new technology 
innovation. It is expected that the total cost of this reorganisation will 
be around £1m in 2013/14.
Six acquisitions and one disposal completed
During the year we spent £136.8m (2012: £13.3m) on acquisitions 
plus £15.8m (2012: £5.4m) contingent consideration on acquisitions 
made in previous years but excluding £4.6m (2012: (£1. 1m)) of net 
cash/(debt) acquired.
We acquired Accutome, Sensorex and SunTech Medical Group in 
the ﬁrst quarter of the ﬁnancial year for a total initial consideration of 
US$108.6m (£68.7m). Full details of these transactions were included 
in our Annual Report and Accounts 2012. Since acquisition, these 
companies have continued to trade in line with our expectations
with the vendors of SunTech receiving an earn-out payment of 
US$6m and Accutome’s vendors expected to receive an estimated
earn-out of US$5m for proﬁt growth since joining Halma.
In December 2012, we acquired MicroSurgical Technologies (MST) 
for US$57 .4m (£35.5m) plus an earn-out of up to US$43m (£26.6m) 
based on future proﬁt growth. Based in Redmond, Washington, USA, 
the company designs and manufactures ophthalmic surgical 
products with a focus on single-use devices used in cataract surgery. 
MST’s results are reported as part of Halma’s Medical sector.
In January 2013, we acquired Baoding Longer Precision Pump Co 
(Longer Pump) for RMB242m (£24.3m). Longer Pump designs and 
manufactures its own range of precision pumps which are used in 
medical, laboratory and industrial applications, and is also part of 
Halma’s Medical sector. The business is based in Baoding, close to 
Beijing and is Halma’s largest ever stand-alone acquisition in China.
In March 2013, we acquired ASL Holdings for £6.4m and contingent 
consideration of up to £3.5m based on growth over the next two 
years. ASL designs and manufactures remote data monitoring 
solutions for a range of markets including utilities. It has become part 
of HWM-Water which is a global leader in datalogging and leak 
detection products for the water industry within Halma’s 
Environmental & Analysis sector.
Following the year end, in April 2013, we acquired a small technology 
bolt-on for one of our Infrastructure Safety businesses, Fire Fighting 
Enterprises (FFE). Talentum, based in Oldham, UK was acquired for 
£2.6m and adds new ﬂame detection products to FFE’s existing 
range of ﬁre optical beam smoke detectors.
We made one disposal during the year. In August 2012, we sold our 
single Asset Monitoring business, Tritech International, for £22m to 
Moog Components Group (Moog). We concluded that, despite the 
attractive aspects of Tritech’s end markets, we could create greater 
shareholder value by reallocating resources to other Halma sector 
niches and that Moog’s presence in the marine energy markets 
would enable Tritech to make stronger progress under their 
ownership. This disposal, along with the sale of Volumatic in March 
2012, demonstrates the importance of Halma’s ability to manage our 
portfolio in order to sustain ﬁnancial success over the long term.
We are continuing to add new opportunities to our acquisition pipeline 
process in all four of our new reporting sectors. Although the past 
year has been productive, we are working to both integrate these 
newly acquired businesses and progress further opportunities into 
the later stages of our acquisition process. We remain conﬁdent in 
our ability to ﬁnd and acquire high quality businesses within our 
chosen markets over the medium term.
Strategic growth priorities
We have a clear strategy to generate sustained organic growth, 
actively manage our portfolio and deliver increased dividends. The 
average medium-term rate of organic growth determines the rate at 
which we can acquire companies and increase dividends. Our 
management reward structures are clearly aligned with this objective 
of delivering sustained growth and high returns. We actively manage 
our business portfolio through acquiring in (or adjacent to) our existing 
markets, merging companies as market needs change and selling 
businesses where we do not see the medium-term prospects for 
sustaining high returns or growth. 
We drive organic growth through a focus on investing in the three 
areas of: Innovation, People Development and International 
Expansion.
20 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 “We have a clear strategy to 
generate sustained organic growth, 
actively manage our portfolio and 
deliver increased dividends.”
Innovation
Our businesses build market leadership, gain market share or 
create new market opportunities through innovation in products and 
processes. Within Halma, companies have great opportunities to 
collaborate and share know-how with their sister companies. We 
have created a culture and environment to encourage this behaviour 
in a variety of ways including ensuring a diverse mix of representation 
at Halma training programmes and holding a biennial Halma 
Innovation and Technology Exposition (HITE). Network groups and 
forums focused on speciﬁc functional areas such as manufacturing 
and IT have also been established to foster regular benchmarking 
and continuous improvement.
In early May 2013, we held our third HITE event in Florida, USA 
which included a two-day Halma ‘trade-show’ where all the Group’s 
companies showcased their innovation and technologies to one 
another. HITE is a catalyst for collaboration between our businesses 
and is a visible example of how Halma’s culture has changed, and 
continues to evolve. Collaboration and learning from each other is 
increasing the rate of innovation and, consequently, building 
competitive advantage in our chosen markets. We invited institutional 
investors and analysts to join us at HITE 2013 and, following their 
positive feedback, it is something that we will be keen to repeat at 
HITE 2015.
Innovation is formally recognised in Halma through the annual Halma 
Innovation Awards where the ﬁrst prize for the winning employee(s) is 
£20,000.
The Halma Innovation Award 2013, was won by a team from Hanovia 
in Slough, UK who developed a new UV treatment system for 
ensuring water in the ballast tanks of ships can be discharged without 
the risk of invasive species contamination, in compliance with 
impending global regulations. The runners up were a team from 
Oseco in Oklahoma, USA who developed a bursting disk which gives 
market-leading performance for both gas and liquid applications. In 
third place was a team from BEA who developed the new IXIO dual 
technology door sensor which combines BEA’s usual market-leading 
sensor performance with a multilingual LED graphical display, making 
it the ‘easiest to install’ product on the market.
Increased innovation in Halma is reﬂected in the greater investment 
which our companies are making in R&D. This year, R&D expenditure 
grew by over 13% to £31. 1m (2012: £27 .4m) with all four Halma 
sectors increasing R&D spend as a proportion of revenue. Our M&A 
activity over the past year has been supportive of this trend as has 
been our ability to increase R&D spend in those businesses we 
acquired in 201 1/12.
People development
Halma’s decentralised operating structure is successful on a 
sustainable basis because we continue to improve the quality of 
management across our business. We build and develop local 
management teams who thrive on the opportunity to make timely 
decisions for their business as customer needs dictate. R&D, 
manufacturing, sales and marketing, and ﬁnancial control resources 
are managed by our subsidiary boards who have an intimate 
knowledge of their markets and are, therefore, best placed to make 
local resource allocation decisions quickly. Subsidiary company 
strategic objectives, annual performance goals and management 
incentives are aligned with Halma’s and are underpinned with a 
relentless commitment to attract and develop high quality talent.
In support of local employee development initiatives, Halma offers 
a range of training for employees including the Halma Executive 
Development Programmes (HEDP and HEDP+), Halma Management 
Development Programmes (HMDP and HMDP+) and Halma 
Certiﬁcate in Applied Technology (HCAT) programmes. During 
2012/13, 179 employees attended these Halma run programmes. 
In addition, senior executives are encouraged to attend external 
training programmes at top international business schools. In the 
last year, one of our Divisional Chief Executives completed the Global 
CEO Programme run by IESE Business School whilst another has 
just completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard.
A highlight of the year was the successful launch of the ﬁrst ever 
Halma Graduate Development Programme (HGDP). The initial group 
of nine graduates came from a mix of technical and geographic 
backgrounds and have done a fantastic job of making the most 
of the opportunities given to them as well as teaching us new ways 
to innovate and grow our business. The 2013 intake is another 
impressive group from top universities. Through HGDP , we aim to 
increase the depth of talent coming through our management ranks 
and also expect it to contribute to an increase in management 
diversity in the medium term. During HGDP , graduates work at Group 
companies in different global regions and attend residential training 
modules. Halma is an attractive employer for new graduates offering 
them the chance to work in diverse markets and to gain international 
experience in an organisation which is able to offer opportunities for 
signiﬁcant early career progression.
International expansion
We choose to operate in niches within markets with robust, long-term 
growth drivers on a global scale. This gives our businesses the 
opportunity to sustain growth in all regions of the world.
Our strategic objective is for at least 30% of revenue to come from 
outside the UK, Mainland Europe and the USA by 2015 and this year 
we increased this proportion from 23.8% to 25.4%. The signiﬁcant 
growth we have achieved since setting up the ﬁrst Halma hubs in 
China (2006) and in India (2008) has almost all been organic so the 
recent acquisition of Longer Pump in China will add further 
momentum during 2013/14.
Progress in China was excellent with revenue up 25% to £37m 
(2012: £29.5m) compared with just £6.6m when our Halma hubs 
were established in 2006. Today, almost 800 of our 4,995 employees 
are based in China.
Although revenue of £12.7m from South America was in line with the 
prior year, it was very encouraging to see two separate groups of 
Halma companies from our Medical and Process Safety sectors 
creating shared trading companies in Brazil. This is a great example 
of how Halma companies are now collaborating to accelerate their 
expansion into new territories where, in this case, the local healthcare 
and energy markets offer exciting opportunities for growth.

STRATEGIC REVIEW
CONTINUED
Macro-economics, regulatory and
competitive environment
With our focus on the supply of safety, health and environmental 
related products, Halma businesses are positioned in relatively 
non-cyclical markets that have clear, long-term growth prospects. 
Most of our markets are underpinned by regulatory drivers where 
most customer spending is non-discretionary. Our businesses beneﬁt 
from strong market positions providing upgrade and replacement 
sales opportunities. These factors combine to create genuine 
resilience in tough economic conditions and enable us to achieve 
organic growth above prevailing market growth rates.
Against this backdrop, we can invest for the longer term with 
conﬁdence. Our competitive environment is heavily inﬂuenced by 
global, regional and national product approvals or technical 
validations. Compliance with product regulations is a steadily 
increasing cost and technical challenge but our focus on this area 
enables us to build competitive advantage. 
We are exposed to a very diverse range of niche markets, each with 
its own unique market dynamic. Our approach is to empower local 
management to respond to changing market conditions by 
developing their own strategy. More details are given in the sector 
reviews on pages 30 to 45.
In the current macro-economic environment each of our businesses 
is experiencing very different challenges and opportunities according 
to their particular market and geographic exposure. In 2013/14, we 
expect the macro-economic and political circumstances in Europe to 
remain challenging whilst we expect the US economy to maintain a 
relatively low rate of steady growth. We believe that the broader 
socio-economic development of developing regions such as Asia 
and South America will continue to increase demand for a safer 
environment and greater access to healthcare and energy/
water resources.
Our primary market growth drivers
Halma’s strategy is to develop market positions with a horizon of ten 
years or more. Growth strategies within our individual operating 
businesses have three to ﬁve-year horizons.
The markets we select must have robust growth drivers with potential 
for organic growth above the underlying market or GDP growth.
All of our businesses are positioned in markets that are underpinned 
by at least one of the following growth drivers: 
Increasing health and safety regulation
Throughout the world, governments are requiring employers to 
comply with increasingly strict laws and regulations to protect workers 
from workplace hazards. In parallel with government regulation, many 
multinational employers based in the developed world are extending 
health and safety practice to developing regions. This combination of 
increasing safety regulation and globalisation drives demand for our 
Process Safety and Infrastructure Safety products.
The human cost of workplace accidents is enormous. The economic 
impact of poor occupational safety and health practice is lost
working time, compensation, interruption of production and medical 
expenses. These costs are estimated to be about 4% of annual
world Gross Domestic Product.
The International Labour Organisation estimates that every day 
around 6,300 people die as a result of occupational accidents or 
work-related diseases – more than 2.3 million deaths per year. 317 
million work accidents occur annually; many of these resulting in 
extended absences from work. 
Occupational deaths and injuries occur disproportionately in 
developing countries, where a large proportion of the population work 
in hazardous industries. However, signiﬁcant advances have been 
made in occupational safety over the past decade and the number of 
fatal accidents has fallen.
Increasing demand for healthcare
Three demographic trends support increasing worldwide demand for 
healthcare: 
• global population ageing
• global population growth
• rising incomes in the developing world.
Demand for healthcare services and health-related products drives 
growth in our Medical markets. An increase in focus on preventive 
medicine and rising rates of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes 
and hypertension are key trends. Advances in medical technology and 
new medical procedures also stimulate demand for new equipment.
The number of people aged 60 and over is increasing dramatically.
In 2010 there were 759 million people in the world aged 60 and over; 
this is projected to rise to 2 billion by 2050. While the older population 
is growing worldwide, most of the increase is in the developing 
regions. The proportion of the world’s older population living in less 
developed regions is forecast to rise from 65% in 2010 to about 80% 
by 2050.
The global healthcare market is estimated to be over 10% of global 
GDP and rose by 43% over the period 2005 to 2010. Spending on 
healthcare continues to grow rapidly throughout the developed world, 
particularly in the USA (which accounts for 40% of total global 
medical expenditure) where spending is projected to rise by over a 
third between 201 1 and 2016. Population growth and rising incomes 
in the developing world are also strong drivers of healthcare demand. 
China’s healthcare spending, for example, is forecast to grow from 
$357 billion in 201 1 to $1 trillion in 2020.

28 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Increasing demand for life critical resources
Rising energy consumption and water usage, the inevitable 
consequences of social and economic development, are driven by 
three key trends:
• population growth
• rising living standards
• changing patterns of food consumption and agriculture.
Several of our Environmental & Analysis businesses are positioned to 
beneﬁt from the global trend of rising demand for energy and water. In 
both developed and developing regions we see increasing 
competition for water resources between industries and economic 
sectors, and between national governments. The increasing value 
placed on water resources drives demand for our water conservation, 
treatment, monitoring and testing products. 
Global water demand rises relentlessly, predicted to increase by 50% 
by 2025 in developing countries, and by 18% in developed countries. 
Both the quality and availability of clean water continues to decline. 
Eighty per cent of the world’s population lives in areas with high levels 
of threat to water security.
Water is essential to oil, gas and coal production but, increasingly, 
also in irrigation of biofuel crops. Water needs for energy production 
are forecast to grow at twice the rate of energy demand. Global 
energy demand is expected to grow by more than one-third over the 
period to 2035; China, India and the Middle East will account for 60% 
of this increase. 
Continued increases in global oil and gas capital expenditure, 
predicted to rise by about 16% from 2012 to 2013, drives demand for 
our Process Safety products.
Delivering corporate responsibility and sustainability
Our primary market growth drivers mean that Halma companies 
operate in markets in which their products contribute positively to the 
wider community. These market characteristics and our commitment 
to health and safety, the environment and people development are 
reﬂected in the values held by our employees and our operating 
culture. Legislative changes, particularly concerning the environment 
and bribery and corruption, have provided an opportunity to review 
and ensure that our procedures in these important areas are 
accessible, compliant and ﬁrmly embedded within our business.
We review our responsibility and sustainability reporting in 
accordance with best practice. A detailed report on Corporate 
Responsibility is on pages 56 to 59. 
Change of Chairman
In July 2013, Geoff Unwin will step down as Chairman of Halma and
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Geoff for the tremendous 
contribution he has made to Halma’s success over the past decade. 
Geoff had the unenviable task of taking over from Halma’s founder, 
David Barber, who had created a business with an impressive 
30-year track record. Under Geoff’s chairmanship, the Group has not 
only maintained that track record but, as a result of sustained focused 
investment, is now better placed to continue that success in the 
future. Thanks Geoff.
During the year, we welcomed Paul Walker to Halma’s Board.
HITE 2013 provided a great chance for Paul to see the whole Group 
and start to appreciate some of the opportunities and challenges 
ahead. I look forward to working closely with Paul when he takes
up the Chairman’s role after this year’s AGM. Welcome, Paul.
Outlook
During the past year, we have continued to strengthen our business 
by further increasing investment in our drivers of organic growth – 
innovation, people development and international expansion. We 
have signiﬁcantly improved the fundamental quality of our portfolio 
through six acquisitions and one disposal.
Order intake since the start of 2013 has been consistent with our 
expectations of sustaining year-on-year organic growth and high 
returns. We remain conﬁdent that Halma will make further progress 
in the year ahead.

PROCESS SAFETY
Market trends
Rising expectations of workplace safety and increasingly stringent 
environmental and safety legislation continue to be strong demand 
drivers in both developed and developing Process Safety markets. 
We are also beneﬁting from improving enforcement of safety 
regulations. These positive market pressures ensure that our 
investment in quality, customer service, and enhanced-technology 
products maintains competitive advantage and underpins our 
signiﬁcant growth in this sector. 
Increased investment in new methods of oil and gas exploration has 
been a major boost to sales, particularly in hydraulic fracturing in 
shale oil and gas exploration, deep sea drilling, and LNG production 
and storage.
Geographic trends
Despite a challenging political and macro-economic environment, 
worldwide growth in demand for energy, food, chemicals and metals 
is set to continue. In particular, Asia Paciﬁc and the Middle East are 
seeing increasing economic growth ahead of developed western 
economies. North American conditions continue to improve while 
Western Europe, due to recessionary pressures, is relatively ﬂat.

32 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Strategy
Our strategy focuses on driving organic growth through geographic 
diversiﬁcation and investment in new product development to meet 
local market needs. Our companies in this sector now have 18 
manufacturing sites across four continents. These are backed by
22 regional sales and service centres together with localised R&D
to ensure that our products meet the diverse requirements of
our customers.
We continue to develop strategic alliances between companies
in this sector to optimise customer service. Internal collaboration 
delivers consistent product performance, service and applications 
advice worldwide. More partnerships with customers remain a key 
strategic goal.
Performance 
Process Safety performed strongly with revenue up by 3% to 
£125.7m (2012: £122.2m) and proﬁt
1
 increasing by 1 1% to £32.3m 
(2012: £29.2m). Excluding the contribution of Tritech, which was sold 
in August 2012, continuing operations revenue grew by 10% 
and proﬁt by 16%. Organic revenue growth at constant currency 
was 10% with continued strong demand from energy and resources 
markets. Together with process industries these markets contribute 
around 60% of sector revenue and beneﬁt from increasing Health 
and Safety regulation.
Return on Sales increased from 23.9% to 25.7% through a 
combination of strong revenue growth and gross margins supported 
by continuous improvement in new product innovation. 
Organic revenue growth at constant currency for markets outside the 
UK, Mainland Europe and the USA was an impressive 29% resulting 
in these fast developing markets now representing 28% of the sector. 
Encouragingly, the performance in our traditional ‘home’ markets was 
robust with mid-single digit organic revenue growth in Mainland 
Europe and the USA and ﬂat UK organic growth. 
R&D investment rose to 4% of revenue. New products accounted for 
34% of total sales reﬂecting an increased emphasis on new 
product development.
Outlook
Prospects for continued growth in the Process Safety sector are 
positive supported by forecasts of rising investment in oil, gas and 
energy markets. Food and pharmaceutical markets have regained 
resilience in the last year and planned safety legislation will continue
to drive demand. 
Automotive manufacturing has been ﬂat or declining in the last two 
years but, based on industry sources, we anticipate increased 
investment, particularly in emerging markets. 
We expect the strong growth trend in the Process Safety sector
to continue, supported by rising R&D spend and expansion of 
regional operations.
We continue to search for Process Safety acquisition prospects, 
particularly in complementary markets to expand our
product portfolio. 
Driving innovation
At our gas detection business, products 
launched in the last three years accounted 
for 77% of revenue during 2012/13. 
The Crowcon Clip is a new personal 
detector which senses a single gas and has 
a ﬁxed life. Very simple to use, it was 
designed with one thing in mind: 
compliance with health and safety 
regulations in the oil and gas industry. 
Reliable protection for workers in hazardous 
areas, this safeguard against toxic or 
explosive gases is compact, lightweight and 
needs no maintenance.

INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY
Market trends 
Increasing health and safety legislation is the main growth driver 
in our Infrastructure Safety sector. Fire regulations are being tightened 
up throughout Asia and in Europe new Construction Products 
Regulations (CPR) come into force in 2013. 
The principal technology trend in ﬁre detection is the packaging of 
multiple sensor technologies within a single detector to provide 
greater life safety protection and lower installation costs. 
Fire detection system complexity is increasing and demand for 
voice alarms is growing faster than traditional audio-visual devices. 
Customers increasingly specify products with internationally 
recognised, rather than local, approvals.
In 2013 new European standards for visual alarm devices for ﬁre 
systems will take effect. New harmonised European construction 
products regulations will also be implemented during 2013.
We have developed new visual signalling products that meet
the new regulations.
Competitive pressure is rising in our traditional pedestrian door 
markets; we continue to diversify into industrial and transportation 
automatic door control niches. New regulations are driving growth. In 
China, door sensor demand has stabilised, due to the construction 
slow down, but demand is strong in the Asia Paciﬁc region. 
New UK and European intruder detection system standards have 
created rising demand for our security sensors certiﬁed to meet the 
new regulations.

36 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Geographic trends
In our largest regional sector, EMEA, we are seeing tough trading 
conditions continuing. Trading in Southern Europe has required 
enhanced credit risk control. Middle East demand remains strong but 
competitive pressure is increasing. Sales in China, SE Asia and 
Australia continued to grow. Opportunities exist across ASEAN 
countries which have a strong preference for ‘branded systems’ with 
UL or EN approvals, although there is also demand for lower cost 
products approved to less well-known standards. 
In the USA the fast-growing ‘home automation’ market is providing 
opportunities. This market, which is the bundling of security, life 
safety, internet services, healthcare monitoring, energy management 
etc., is focused on existing homeowners and does not depend on 
‘new build’ for growth. 
Strategy
We are developing our presence in higher growth areas such as 
Russia and Eastern Europe, ASEAN nations and Brazil. We have also 
entered adjacent markets, such as life-safety carbon monoxide 
detectors and home automation. We are achieving cost savings in 
our Chinese plants which feed our European and American 
operations. In some undeveloped territories, we are forging new 
partnerships by offering IP-protected, UL -approved technology 
to enable ﬁre market entry by building management and 
security companies.
Our door sensor business is focused on new product development 
for targeted industrial and transport niches to diversify our customer 
base and reduce dependence on the pedestrian doors sector. In 
keeping with other Halma sectors, R&D has also been decentralised 
from headquarters with increased spending on product development 
at our US and Chinese facilities. New sensors developed in China 
and in the USA will contribute signiﬁcantly to sales revenues in 
the future. 
Our technology strategy is to maintain competitive advantage in 
wireless security products designed for commercial environments. 
We are positioning our security business to offer more integrated 
building monitoring solutions via technology partnerships with other 
manufacturers, including those within Halma. 
Performance 
Infrastructure Safety delivered another solid year. Revenue increased 
1% to £205.3m (2012: £204.3m) and proﬁt
1
 grew by 7% to £41.8m 
(2012: £39. 1m). Return on Sales improved from 19. 1% to 20.3% with
a signiﬁcant factor being the improved proﬁtability following the 
reorganisation of our companies selling elevator products. Organic 
revenue growth at constant currency was 1% which, following a ﬂat 
ﬁrst half, reﬂected a slight improvement during the second half. This 
resilience in demand comes from our focus on safety-critical product 
niches for regulated non-residential applications. Approximately 
two-thirds of sector revenue is installed in existing infrastructure rather 
than new construction.
New product introductions and increased investment in sales 
resources contributed to strong growth in the USA where organic 
revenue growth (constant currency) was 18%. Elsewhere we saw 
modest rates of growth in the UK and Asia Paciﬁc while, 
unsurprisingly, almost every business in this sector experienced 
difﬁcult conditions in Mainland Europe, resulting in organic revenue 
decline there of 8%.
Outlook
We anticipate continued Infrastructure Safety growth due to 
technology advances, regulatory pressure and new localised 
products. European demand for certiﬁed products will be a principal 
driver and we are well-placed to beneﬁt from wider adoption of 
integrated building monitoring systems and intruder alarms based on 
wireless communication.
Growth in mature markets will be modest, while developing 
economies will grow strongly. Russia, Eastern Europe, Middle East, 
Latin America, ASEAN nations and China all offer good growth 
potential. In the USA and Western Europe legislation-driven adjacent 
markets offer good growth prospects. 
Driving innovation
In April 2013 we extended the technology 
portfolio of our wide area smoke detector 
manufacturer with the acquisition of 
Talentum, a specialist in ﬂame detection. 
This acquisition brings two of the UK’s 
leading specialist ﬁre protection businesses 
together. 
This Talentum multi-spectrum ﬂame 
detector senses both infrared and ultraviolet 
light. It is sensitive to low frequency, 
ﬂickering radiation emitted during 
combustion. It detects almost all ﬂames, 
including those invisible to the naked eye, 
and can recognise other sources of benign 
radiation such as sunlight, welding and 
lightning.

MEDICAL
Market trends 
Medical market growth drivers are principally worldwide population 
ageing, increasing life expectancy, increasing access to healthcare in 
developing economies, new technologies and improved or new 
surgical or pharmaceutical therapies. 
The proportion of people aged over 60 continues to rise and drives 
demand for healthcare both in developed and developing 
geographies. Population ageing is a key driver for our ophthalmology 
and hypertension management businesses since these health issues 
are age-related.
A key medical niche, the ophthalmic diagnostic equipment market, 
will grow at 2.5% from 2009 to 2016 as new technologies, population 
ageing and rising healthcare expectations and affordability in 
developing economies continue to underpin demand.
The global market for cataract surgery devices is forecast to grow
at a compound annual growth rate of 3% between 2010 and 2017 . 
Growth drivers include rising demand for surgery due to population 
ageing and technological advances such as micro-incision 
eye surgery.
Regulatory compliance and medical product approvals, particularly in 
China and Brazil, continue to get tougher and more costly. This 
delays returns from new products, increases development costs and 
puts pressures on margins. On the plus side, rigorous regulatory 
regimes create higher barriers to entry for new competitors.
The in-vitro medical diagnostic market, our largest ﬂuidic components 
niche, is largely concentrated in the USA. In recent years uncertainty 
over healthcare reforms has dampened demand. The US healthcare 
market has returned to growth with rising sales for existing platforms 
and higher activity in customers’ new product development pipelines. 
Growth in Asia is expected to outpace other geographies, with a 
forecast market growth rate to 2016 of 1 1.8% for the region, and 
18.8% in China.
Geographical trends
The US Government is seeking healthcare budget cuts but the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) will increase 
spending. In 2013 US health costs are projected to rise by 3.8%. The 
situation changes dramatically in 2014 when twenty-two million more 
Americans gain healthcare insurance and spending is predicted to 
rise by 7 .4%. The PPACA also introduces a 2.3% Medical Device Tax 
on medical products.
Financial austerity in Europe continued to depress demand.
Despite recessionary pressure, a return to growth is forecast in the 
medium term. Industry analysts predict average European medical 
device market growth of 1.6% per year between 2014 and 2018.

40 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 We continued to invest in sales resources and new medical 
distribution channels in Asia and South America. Brazil, with a 
population of over 190 million and a well-developed, expanding 
healthcare system, is the largest South American medical equipment 
market and forecast to grow by 12.6% CAGR between 201 1 and 
2015. Our São Paulo facility has now achieved ANVISA
2
 registration 
from the Brazilian government which lets us gain approvals for 
healthcare products in our own name.
Economic development across Asia is rapidly increasing access to 
healthcare. In China, where healthcare is a key social priority, medical 
spending is forecast to rise by almost three times between 201 1 and 
2020. Demographic drivers are producing a rapid increase in chronic 
conditions like diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure) as 
populations age, people move to cities and lifestyles change. About 
130 million Chinese between the ages of 35 and 7 4 suffer from 
hypertension. Increased awareness of this health issue, and 
programmes to combat it, will increase demand for hypertension 
diagnosis devices.
In China we established an R&D unit to drive localised product 
development. Our recently acquired US-headquartered blood 
pressure monitoring business adds an 80 person manufacturing
and R&D centre in Shenzhen. 
Strategy
Our Medical sector strategy is to increase organic growth through:
• innovative new products
• penetration of new geographical markets 
• expansion into adjacent market niches.
Acquisition of additional value-enhancing healthcare businesses
will also add signiﬁcant further growth. We aim to increase R&D 
investment, particularly in ophthalmology and hypertension 
management. Focusing on Asia and South America, market 
extension will be achieved through additional sales resources,
sales intelligence sharing and cooperative marketing between
Group companies, and new channel partnerships.
Our focus on relatively low-cost medical devices avoided the impact 
of government austerity budget cutbacks which mainly affected 
capital equipment.
Local manufacture in emerging markets, to better satisfy local 
customer needs and strengthen competitiveness by avoiding import 
tariffs, is a key strategic medical sector goal. From 2013, we plan to 
assemble health optics products in Brazil.
Our ﬂuidic components businesses aim for increased customer 
diversiﬁcation, focusing on laboratory and health-care markets. They 
now have joint product development teams and sell into the Chinese 
medical diagnostics sector jointly via a new Halma Fluid Technology 
business unit.
Performance 
Medical had an outstanding year, increasing revenue by 36% to 
£136. 1m (2012: £100.4m) and proﬁt
1
 by 37% to £35.9m 
(2012: £26.3m). Return on Sales increased further from 26.2% to 
26.4%. The underlying organic revenue growth (constant currency) 
was 12%. As expected, slowly improving demand for ﬂuid control 
components from major medical OEM customers, steady growth in 
ophthalmology markets and our increased product innovation were 
the signiﬁcant contributory factors to this excellent result.
Our strategic focus on small medical devices and components rather 
than high value capital equipment, enabled us to mitigate the negative 
impact from government austerity spending cuts in certain markets. 
The fundamental market drivers of an ageing population in the West 
and a growing and wealthier population in the East, give us continued 
conﬁdence for the future.
Both the USA and Mainland Europe performed well with organic 
revenue growth (constant currency) of 12% and 17% respectively, 
whilst the UK saw organic revenue decline of 3%. Revenue from 
outside these three major territories increased organically by 12%, to 
now represent 25% of the sector. Our real exposure to these faster 
growing markets is greater, as a sizeable proportion of our revenue 
from the USA and Mainland Europe is to global OEMs who 
subsequently export their ﬁnished systems to other global regions.
Three new US-based businesses acquired in 2012 expanded our 
healthcare technology portfolio and extended our geographic reach. 
We added ultrasound technology to our ophthalmic diagnostic 
instrumentation, new hypertension management technology and new 
single-use surgical devices.
Outlook
Ageing populations in developed economies and rising populations 
with access to affordable healthcare in the developing world should 
create continued favourable conditions for growth. We anticipate 
consistently rising sales into the healthcare and medical diagnostics 
markets driven by enhanced distribution in export markets, new 
products and further acquisitions.
Growth in South East Asia should remain strong as governments 
continue to improve their healthcare systems. China will build 
thousands of new hospitals in the next few years. Investment in 
Chinese product registrations should deliver rising sales. Growth in 
Brazil should accelerate based on our new regulatory status.
Driving innovation
We acquired SunTech Medical, one of the 
world’s leading suppliers of clinical grade 
non-invasive blood pressure monitoring 
products, in May 2012. This business 
complements our subsidiary Riester, which 
also sells blood pressure and vital signs 
monitors.
This ambulatory blood pressure system 
monitors, records and analyses a patient’s 
blood pressure at regular intervals 24 hours 
a day. It is clinically validated by all three 
international standards bodies.

ENVIRONMENTAL & ANALYSIS
Market trends
In the Environmental & Analysis sector our businesses serve a very 
diverse range of end-user markets. The underlying growth drivers are 
rising demand for basic resources such as energy and water, 
increasing environmental monitoring and regulation and demand for 
healthcare.
Water quality, water scarcity and the need to reduce water treatment 
energy costs are the key drivers behind increasingly strict regulation 
and growth in demand for our water analysis and water and 
wastewater treatment systems. These drivers are assuming ever 
greater importance due to population growth, urbanisation and 
climate change. The market for water disinfection systems is 
estimated to be growing annually by 10% to 12% and water 
monitoring demand is growing by 5% per year. 
Independent product validations are becoming increasingly important 
in water treatment. We expect continued investment by industrial 
customers, driven by legislation, but difﬁcult market conditions in the 
municipal segment. We anticipate signiﬁcant sales growth in the 
marine Ballast Water Treatment (BWT) market. The BWT market is 
forecast to grow by over 50% a year between 2009 and 2020.
We anticipate continued steady growth from three core end-user 
markets: environmental monitoring, biotechnology and chemical 
analysis. Worldwide growth in these markets is driven by increasing 
environmental legislation and healthcare initiatives. Rising concern 
over food safety, adulteration and contamination is creating growing 
sales opportunities in both developed and developing economies.
The global environmental monitoring market is predicted to grow by 
6.5% per year between 201 1 and 2016. Strong annual growth of 6% 
is also forecast for the laboratory analytical market over the 
same period.
Concern over climate change is another driver of demand for our 
analytical instruments, water conservation and energy management 
technology. Throughout the world governments are continually 
introducing new legislation and initiatives designed to improve energy 
efﬁciency and reduce carbon dioxide output.

44 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Geographic trends
With such diverse end-markets, the geographic trends are diverse 
too. However, we see opportunities for growth in all global regions 
although the ratio of growth in Asia, and China in particular,
is expected to be higher.
For example, China now has over 30 laws and 1,000 separate 
regulations to prevent pollution and protect natural resources.
China recently introduced stricter air pollution monitoring standards 
which should increase demand for our products that monitor
sources of pollution and measure air quality.
Like many countries, China faces the challenge of rising water 
demand while available water resources are actually falling.
The market for water treatment products in China is forecast
to grow at 10% annually to 2015 with the industrial market
offering the largest growth opportunities.
Strategy
We will maintain world leadership in systems which reduce loss of 
treated water in distribution networks via technological leadership. 
This will be supported by newly acquired ‘machine-to-machine’ 
communication technology which is in increasing demand for 
environmental data collection and is built into smart meters for
remote data recording.
Our strategy for opto-electronic analytical products is to grow organic 
proﬁt by extending our offering in the life sciences and environmental 
monitoring sectors. To reduce the cyclical impact of US federal 
spending programmes, we are repositioning these businesses
to service a higher proportion of end users in non-government 
funded markets.
We work closely with both academic and commercial researchers
to develop innovative new technologies and solutions. In China,
for example, we are involved with 12 university science labs.
This basic science strategy reveals new product niches and
revenue streams when research is commercialised. 
Performance 
Environmental & Analysis had a relatively disappointing year as 
revenue declined by 1% to £152.4m (2012: £153.4m) and proﬁt
1
reduced by 4% to £30.4m (2012: £31.6m). Return on Sales was 
19.9% (2012: 20.6%). Organic revenue at constant currency was 
down 6%. Reduced government research spending in the USA
and lower investment by water utilities in the UK were the two
major adverse market factors. 
These market factors are clearly reﬂected in the regional trends with 
organic revenue (constant currency) declines of 14% in the UK and 
10% in the USA. Organic revenue from Mainland Europe fell by 4%. 
Our companies continue to invest in growth in markets outside
the UK, Mainland Europe and the USA with revenue from these 
developing markets being 27% of the total sector, contributing 
organic growth of 6%. 
Outlook
Despite the challenges faced by Environmental & Analysis in the past 
year, we are conﬁdent that the management and organisational 
changes currently being made will improve performance in future.
These include simplifying global sales channels and manufacturing 
operations together with increasing senior management resources to 
focus on accelerating growth in Asia and from recent new technology 
innovation. It is expected that the total cost of this reorganisation will 
be around £1m in 2013/14. 
Driving innovation
We acquired Sensorex, a manufacturer of 
electrochemical water analysis sensors, in 
April 2012. The company supplies the 
growing environmental, drinking water, 
wastewater, life sciences and 
pharmaceutical markets. Its products are 
used by OEMs making systems for water 
quality monitoring and control. 
This transmitter/analyser monitors industrial 
process ﬂuid parameters like pH, oxidation 
reduction potential and temperature and 
connects with process control or data 
logging systems.

REVIEW
1
  In addition to those ﬁgures reported under IFRS Halma uses adjusted ﬁgures as key 
performance indicators. The Directors believe the adjusted ﬁgures give a more 
representative view of underlying performance. Adjusted proﬁt ﬁgures exclude the 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition and disposal costs, fair value 
adjustments on acquisition contingent consideration and proﬁt on disposal of 
operations, all of which are included in statutory ﬁgures. More details are given
in Note 3 to the Accounts.

 See Financial Highlights.
Halma’s ﬁnancial model sustaining success
Once again Halma delivered record results, achieving growth coupled 
with high returns. Strong cash generation funded the continuation of 
our long-term record of dividend increases. International expansion 
continues to be a key part of our story as does M&A, with considerable 
success in the year in making six acquisitions and one disposal. Our 
ﬁnancial position remains strong. 
Record revenue and proﬁt
Revenue increased by 6.8% to £619.2m (2012: £579.9m), up £39.3m. 
Of this increase, acquisitions in 2012/13 and the prior year, net of 
disposals, contributed £26.5m so organic revenue was up 2.2%. 
There was a small adverse impact from currency translation and 
consequently organic revenue growth at constant currency was 2.9%.
46 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 This is the tenth consecutive year of record results with adjusted
1
proﬁt before taxation growing by 8.5% to £130.7m (2012: £120.5m). 
Organic proﬁt growth was 4. 1% and adjusting for adverse currency 
translation impacts, organic proﬁt growth at constant currency was 
5.3%.
Statutory proﬁt before taxation grew by 9.2% to £122.3m. Statutory 
proﬁt is after charging the amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
of £14.2m (2012: £10.4m), acquisition transaction costs and 
movements on acquisition contingent consideration including related 
foreign exchange movements of £2.3m (2012: £1.6m) and after 
crediting the proﬁt on disposal of Tritech of £8. 1m. 
Revenue growth was 7% in the second half of the year following a 6% 
increase in the ﬁrst half. Adjusted
1
 proﬁt grew by 1 1% in the second 
half, following a 6% increase in the ﬁrst half, so the ﬁrst half/second 
half split of proﬁt was 47%/53%, with the revenue split at 48%/52%. 
This is consistent with previous years, with higher revenue and 
proﬁtability in the second half of the year. 
Sector reporting changes
As announced on 14 February 2013 we are reporting Group 
performance under four market based sectors. This evolution in our 
reporting follows signiﬁcant growth in the former Health & Analysis 
sector. Comparative ﬁgures have been restated (see Note 1 to the 
Accounts).
We saw the highest growth this year in the Medical sector. There was 
a small decline in the Environmental & Analysis sector where we 
anticipate reorganisation costs of approximately £1m in the ﬁrst half of 
2013/14 to underpin improved future performance. In 2012/13 costs 
of £0.8m were charged in the Group Income Statement, mainly in the 
ﬁrst half of the year, in relation to the successful reorganisation of 
certain Infrastructure Safety businesses. 
Central administration costs increased in the year predominantly to 
ﬁnance continued global expansion and people development activity 
including our new Halma Graduate Development Programme.
Strong growth in USA and Asia Paciﬁc
The geographic revenue growth pattern was very consistent between 
the ﬁrst and second half. The USA continues to be our largest sales 
destination growing by 20% this year and accounting for 31% 
(2012: 28%) of Group revenue. Acquisitions boosted the US growth 
and there was 4% organic growth at constant currency. Mainland 
Europe revenue was only 2% below the prior year despite the tough 
economic environment, with the Medical sector achieving more than 
20% growth there. UK revenue declined by 8%, although excluding 
the impact of disposals in the current and prior year the revenue 
decline was only 3%. Asia Paciﬁc grew strongly at 15% with all four 
sectors growing in this region. China revenue was up 25% and is
now almost 6% of Group revenue.
We are targeting to have 30% of Group revenue coming from outside 
the UK/Mainland Europe/USA by 2015 and this percentage increased 
from 23.8% last year to 25.4% this year. This shows good progress 
and compares with a ﬁgure of 19% ﬁve years ago. Half of our revenue 
growth this year came from outside the UK/Mainland Europe/USA.
Increased Return on Sales
Group Return on Sales has been above 16% for the last 28 
consecutive years. Our current target is to operate in the 18% to 22% 
range. We believe that a consistently high Return on Sales is a key 
indicator of the value our customers place on our products and of 
good cost management. In 2012/13 Return on Sales increased once 
again to 21. 1% (2012: 20.8%) due to M&A activity and the mix of 
strong business performances. In the second half of the year Return 
on Sales was 21.8%.
A high Gross Margin (revenue less direct material and direct labour 
costs) remains a stable element of our proﬁtability and this year 
increased to 64.0% (2012: 63.5%), a good achievement against the 
background of cost and price pressures, reﬂecting the value of our 
increasing investment in customer-led innovation. 
Currency impacts
Halma reports its results in Sterling. The most important other trading 
currencies are the US Dollar, Euro, and to a lesser extent the Swiss 
Franc. Approximately 40% of Group revenue is denominated in US 
Dollars and 14% in Euros. 
The Group has both translational and transactional currency exposure. 
Translational exposures arise on the consolidation of overseas 
company results into Sterling. Transactional exposures arise where the 
currency of sale or purchase transactions differs from the functional 
currency in which each company prepares its local accounts.

Business review  10-59 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
We take a neutral view of the future movements of currencies. After 
matching currency of revenue with currency costs wherever practical, 
forward exchange contracts are used to hedge a proportion (up to 
75%) of the remaining forecast net transaction ﬂows where there is a 
reasonable certainty of an exposure. We hedge up to 12 months and in 
certain speciﬁc circumstances 24 months, forward. At 30 March 2013 
over 50% of our next 12 months currency trading transactions were 
hedged. There is a good degree of natural hedging within the Group 
in US Dollars but we typically buy fewer products in Euros than we 
sell and so have a net exposure of approximately €30m at any time.
There was a small negative net currency translational impact on the 
2012/13 results. Relative to Sterling the US Dollar strengthened by 1% 
and the Euro weakened by 6% on average in the year and the net 
currency translation impact was 0.7% adverse on revenue and 1.2% 
adverse on proﬁt. 
Based on the current mix of currency denominated revenue and 
proﬁt, a 1% movement in the US Dollar relative to Sterling changes 
revenue by £2.4m and proﬁt by £0.5m. Similarly, a 1% movement in 
the Euro changes revenue by £0.9m and proﬁt by £0.2m. 
Increased ﬁnance cost
Net ﬁnancing cost in the Income Statement increased to £3.8m 
(2012: £1.4m). Net bank interest and funding costs increased due to 
higher average levels of debt and slightly higher average interest rates 
(see table ‘Average debt and interest rates’ on page 49) as well as the 
higher costs of funding our increased bank facility from October 201 1.
The net pension ﬁnancing charge is also part of our ﬁnancing cost 
and this year it increased from £0.2m to £0.5m. This charge is 
dependent on the level of pension scheme liabilities and assets at the 
start of the year as well as the discount rate/rates of return applied to 
them. In 2012/13 the cost of higher liabilities exceeded the return on 
increased assets. In 2013/14 the pension accounting rules under 
IAS19 (Employee beneﬁts) will change and this change will affect the 
Group Income Statement. The principal change relates to the 
requirement to use the schemes’ discount rate to calculate the return 
on assets rather than using a rate of return appropriate to the various 
asset classes. At current discount rates, the change is expected to 
reduce the adjusted proﬁt by approximately £2m for 2013/14 
onwards. Comparative ﬁgures will be similarly restated, so overall 
Group reported growth rates will be largely unaffected. 
Higher Group tax rate
The Group has its main operating subsidiaries in 14 countries so the 
Group’s effective tax rate is a blend of these different national rates 
applied to locally generated proﬁts. Our approach to taxation is to 
manage the tax burden in a responsible manner, keeping good 
relationships with tax authorities based on legal compliance, 
transparency and cooperation. Intercompany trading is set on a 
commercial arm’s length basis.
The effective tax rate on adjusted
1
 proﬁt increased to 24.2% 
(2012: 23.5%). Approximately one-third of Group proﬁt is generated 
and taxed in the UK and the UK Corporation Tax rate fell from 26% to 
24% this year, with it forecast to fall to 20% in 2016. Offsetting this 
was the tax on increased proﬁts generated in higher tax rate 
jurisdictions, in particular the USA.
We anticipate that the effective tax rate in 2013/14 will be similar to 
that in 2012/13.
Increasing earnings per share and dividends
We have consistently delivered value to shareholders through growth 
in earnings per share and dividend increases. Adjusted
2
 earnings per 
share increased by 7 .2% to 26.22p below the rate of increase in 
adjusted
2
 proﬁt due to the higher effective tax rate compared with the 
prior year. Statutory earnings per share increased by 9.6% with the 
higher acquisition related expense being more than offset by the 
£8. 1m proﬁt on disposal of Tritech. 
An increase in the ﬁnal dividend of 7 . 1% to 6.37p per share (2012: 
5.95p) is recommended which, together with the 7 . 1% increase in the 
interim dividend, gives a total dividend of 10.43p per share (2012: 
9.7 4p). Halma has a long record of growing its dividend, and with this 
latest rise, will have increased the dividend by 5% or more for every 
one of the last 34 years, paying out £300m to shareholders in the last 
decade. The ﬁnal dividend for 2012/13 is subject to approval by 
shareholders at the AGM on 25 July 2013 and will be paid on 
21 August 2013 to shareholders on the register at 19 July 2013. 
We have maintained a progressive dividend policy that balances 
dividend increases with organic growth rates achieved, taking into 
account current and potential acquisition spend and the maintenance 
of moderate debt levels. Dividend cover (the ratio of adjusted proﬁt 
after tax to dividends paid and proposed) remains the same as 2012 
at 2.5 times. Our policy is to maintain dividend cover, based on 
adjusted proﬁt, above two times and we will continue to monitor 
dividend payout each year as dividend cover rises.
Good cash generation
Strong cash generation is critical to the long-term health of the Group. 
Our cash performance in 2012/13 was good. Adjusted operating 
cash ﬂow was £1 13.7m (2012: £105.4m) and represents 84% (2012: 
86%) of adjusted operating proﬁt. This new cash conversion KPI is in 
keeping with best practice amongst our peers and this year’s result is 
in line with our newly revised KPI target of 85% cash conversion.

A summary of the year’s cash ﬂow is shown in the table above. 
Working capital movements, comprising changes in inventory, 
debtors and creditors, totalled £10.9m (2012: £7 .6m). Working capital 
management is the responsibility of each individual subsidiary board 
and therefore receives close attention. This year’s increase in debtors 
reﬂects the growth in our business and receives continued focus to 
ensure cash generation remains strong.
Expenditure on property, plant and computer software this year was 
£15.5m (2012: £16.5m) slightly below the prior year when there were 
some larger capital investment projects. This year’s spend represents 
1 10% of depreciation, falling within the 100% to 125% range we 
expect. 
Taxation paid was £25.5m (2012: £27 .8m) a little below the relatively 
high prior year ﬁgure with a lower UK Corporation Tax rate and higher 
pension contributions contributing to the change. 
Strong ﬁnancial position 
Halma is highly cash generative and has substantial bank facilities. 
We have access to competitively priced ﬁnance at short notice
and spread our risks to provide good liquidity for the Group.
Group treasury policy is conservative and no speculative
transactions are allowed. 
In October 201 1 we reﬁnanced our revolving credit facility. We have
in place a £260m facility for ﬁve years to 2016 with ﬁve international 
banks. The Group continues to operate well within its banking 
covenants. We use debt to accelerate the Group’s development
and review our funding needs regularly to ensure we have
ample headroom. 
At the year end net debt was £1 10.3m (2012: £18.7m), a combination 
of £160.0m of debt and £49.7m of cash held around the world to 
ﬁnance local operations. The increased net debt is a result of our 
success in securing high quality acquisitions during the year offset by 
good cash generation and disposal proceeds. The ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA was 0.73 times (2012: 0. 14 times), well below the level of 1.25 
times within which we feel comfortable operating. Net debt 
represents 5.6% (2012: 1.3%) of the Group’s year-end market 
capitalisation.

Record acquisition spend
Acquisitions and disposals are an important part of our growth 
model. We buy already successful businesses in, or adjacent to, 
niches in our chosen areas of operation. 
During the year we spent £137m on six acquisitions (excluding net 
cash/(debt) acquired of £5m) plus £16m in payment of contingent 
consideration on acquisitions made in previous years. A provision has 
been made for £23m of contingent consideration on current year 
acquisitions, being our best estimate of the amounts likely to be 
payable. Goodwill of £82m and intangible assets of £69m were 
recognised on the acquisitions made in the year and the weighted 
average acquisition multiple was 9.2x EBIT, based on the initial 
acquisition consideration. 
In August 2012 we sold Tritech for £22m. A gain of £8. 1m has been 
recognised in the Group Income Statement after accounting for the 
assets sold, including the associated goodwill. In April 2013 we made 
a further small acquisition for an initial consideration of £2.6m.
The businesses acquired in 2012/13 and in early 2013/14, together 
with the one disposal in 2012/13, are expected to add a net amount 
of £21.7m to revenue and £4.9m (after ﬁnancing costs) to proﬁt in 
2013/14 based on their run rates at the time of acquisition/disposal.
Pension commitments
The Group primarily provides either deﬁned beneﬁt (DB) or deﬁned 
contribution pension arrangements for its employees. The DB 
sections of the Group’s pension plans were closed to new entrants in 
January 2003. There are now fewer than 400 employees retaining 
access to future accrual under the DB plans so our key focus is on 
mitigating the impact of the past service deﬁcit. 
On an IAS 19 basis the deﬁcit on the DB plans at March 2013 was 
£47 .2m (2012: £33.0m) before the related deferred tax asset. Plan 
assets increased to £176.3m (2012: £153.0m) with some further 
recovery in equity values and our additional cash contributions. In 
total, 57% of plan assets are invested in return-seeking assets; 35% in 
equities and 22% in diversiﬁed growth funds providing a higher 
expected level of return over the longer term. Plan liabilities increased 
to £223.5m (2012: £186.0m) mainly due to the reduction in the 
discount rate used to value these liabilities.

Business review  10-59 FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
“Halma has a long record of 
growing its dividend and with this 
latest increase will have increased 
the dividend by 5% or more for 
every one of the last 34 years, 
paying out £300m to shareholders 
in the last decade.” 
We continue to make extra contributions to the plans at a rate agreed 
with the trustees and expect this to be at the rate of £7m per year for 
the immediate future with the objective of eliminating the deﬁcit over 
the next six years. We continue to develop and implement plans to 
reduce the risk in the future cost of our DB pension plans. 
R&D investment
Expenditure on R&D increased to £31. 1m (2012: £27 .4m) an increase 
of 13% and representing 5.0% (2012: 4.7%) of revenue. All four 
sectors increased both the absolute spend and their percentage of 
revenue spent on R&D in the year. Environmental & Analysis has the 
highest spend per £ of revenue at 6.8%. 
We are required under IFRS to capitalise certain development 
expenditure and amortise it over an appropriate period, for us three 
years. R&D by its nature carries risk and all R&D projects, particularly 
those requiring capitalisation, are subject to close scrutiny and a 
rigorous approval and review process. In 2012/13 we capitalised £5.4m 
(2012: £4.7m) and amortised £3.5m (2012: £3.7m). This results in an 
asset carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, after £0.4m of 
foreign exchange movements and disposals, of £12.0m (2012: £10.5m).
Managing risks and going concern considerations
and the year ahead
The main risks facing the Group and how we address them are 
reviewed on pages 53 to 55. The key operating risks are covered
in the Chief Executive’s Strategic Review and Sector Reviews. 
A key risk mitigation is that we spread risk across the Group via 
well-resourced independent operating units. There are extensive and 
regular reviews of operations at local and Divisional levels. These 
reviews are supplemented by Internal Audit. As we expand our 
business internationally, we continue to focus on maintaining the 
quality of people and the controls operating across each country. 
Our policies and processes to mitigate Bribery & Corruption together 
with our Code of Conduct have been rolled out across the Group 
including newly acquired businesses. This supports our long-
standing ethical approach to business. In 2013/14 we will be 
supporting increased growth in subsidiary companies by further 
developing the strategic use of Information Technology having this 
year rolled out a centralised IT disaster recovery solution.
The Board considers all of the above factors in its review of
‘Going Concern’ as described on page 69 and has been able
to conclude its review satisfactorily. 
Halma takes a disciplined approach to managing risk, to sustain high 
returns and deliver growth over the long term. In the year ahead we 
will continue to focus on strong cash generation to enable investment 
in existing and new businesses, ﬁnance dividends and deliver 
signiﬁcant value to shareholders.

50 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 RISK MANAGEMENT
AND INTERNAL CONTROL
Internal control 
The Board meets regularly throughout the year and has adopted a 
schedule of matters which are required to be brought to it for 
decision. This procedure is intended to ensure that the Directors 
maintain full and effective control over all signiﬁcant strategic, ﬁnancial 
and organisational issues.
During the year, actions to strengthen the control environment 
continue to be taken centrally by Group management, particularly in 
the areas of health and safety, anti-bribery and corruption, and export 
controls. The duties and responsibilities of subsidiary management 
are continually refreshed as well as documented in a manual 
circulated to all subsidiary managing directors and available on our 
collaboration platform. A comprehensive induction programme for 
subsidiary ﬁnance directors was launched last year and our internal 
ﬁnancial review procedures are currently being refreshed. We 
strengthened the resources dedicated to identifying and investigating 
potential acquisitions and the policies to ensure a rapid and 
successful integration following acquisition. The scope of the Group’s 
policies and the programme of compliance audits are regularly 
reviewed to ensure they are sufﬁcient to address current risks. The 
Group placed additional emphasis on updating our business 
continuity plans over recent years ensuring that they are mutually 
complementary to our insurance programme. 
The Group’s treasury and hedging policy is kept under review to 
ensure that appropriate accounting and banking arrangements are 
aligned with the Group’s growth and to ensure continued compliance 
with accounting requirements. 
The internal audit function has operated independently since 2004, 
reporting to the Audit Committee. In 2008/09, a dedicated Internal 
Audit manager was added to support the function and during 
2010/1 1 an internal auditor based in China was recruited. Each year 
we implement further improvements to our Internal Audit procedures 
to enhance effectiveness. 
The processes which the Board has applied in reviewing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control are 
summarised below:
• operating companies carry out a detailed risk assessment each 
year and identify mitigating actions in place or proposed for each 
signiﬁcant risk. A risk register is compiled from this information, 
against which action is monitored through to resolution. Group 
management also compiles a summary of signiﬁcant Group risks, 
documenting existing or planned actions to mitigate, manage or 
avoid risks;
• each month the board of every operating company meets, 
discusses and reports on its operating performance, its 
opportunities, the risks facing it and the resultant actions. The 
relevant Divisional Chief Executive chairs this meeting. Divisional 
Chief Executives meet regularly with the Chief Executive and 
Finance Director and report on divisional progress to the Executive 
Board; 
• ﬁnancial and trading ‘warning signs’ are reported to Group and 
divisional management. Weekly data on cash management and 
sales and orders are also reported directly to the Chief Executive, 
the Finance Director and the Group ﬁnance team. This framework 
is designed to provide an early warning of potential risks and to 
direct appropriate action where necessary;
• the Chief Executive submits a report to each Halma plc Board 
meeting which includes ﬁnancial information, the main features of 
Group operations and an analysis of the signiﬁcant risks and 
opportunities facing the Group. The report also covers progress 
against strategic objectives and shareholder related issues;
• regular Director visits to Group companies are scheduled and open 
access to the subsidiary company boards is encouraged; cyclical 
and risk-based internal control visits are carried out by internal audit 
or senior ﬁnance staff resulting in actions being fed back to each 
company and followed up by Divisional Finance Directors and 
Divisional Chief Executives. Reviews are coded in terms of risk and 
a summary of all such reviews is given to the Audit Committee, with 
any signiﬁcant control failings being reported directly to the Audit 
Committee; senior ﬁnance staff also conduct ﬁnancial reviews at 
each operating company before publication of half-year and 
year-end ﬁgures. We have a Groupwide IT policy supported by a 
programme of IT audits; and
• the Chief Executive, Finance Director and Internal Audit function 
report to the Audit Committee on all aspects of internal control. The 
Board receives regular reports from the Audit Committee chairman 
and the papers and minutes of the Audit Committee meetings are 
used as a basis for its annual review of internal control.

INTERNAL CONTROL CONTINUED
Group risk is mitigated by means of an operating structure which 
spreads the Group’s activities across a number of autonomous 
subsidiary companies. Each of these companies is led by a 
high-quality board of directors including a ﬁnance executive.
Group companies operate under a system of controls which includes 
but is not limited to: 
• a deﬁned organisational structure with an appropriate delegation of 
authority to operational management which ensures appropriate 
segregation of key duties;
• the identiﬁcation and appraisal of risks both formally, through the 
annual process of preparing business plans and budgets, through 
an annual detailed risk assessment carried out at local level 
and informally through close monitoring of operations;
• a comprehensive ﬁnancial reporting system, regularly enhanced, 
within which actual and forecast results are compared with 
approved budgets and the previous year’s ﬁgures on a monthly 
basis. Weekly cash/sales/orders reporting including details of 
ﬁnancial institutions are also maintained within the ﬁnancial 
reporting system, all of which is reviewed at both local and Group 
level;
• an investment evaluation procedure to ensure an appropriate level 
of approval for all capital expenditure and other capitalised costs; 
• self-certiﬁcation by operating company management of 
compliance and control issues;
• a robust structure for electronic communication and conducting 
e-commerce to ensure that the Group is not negatively impacted 
by threats to its information technology infrastructure and to 
minimise potential for business disruptions. The Group has a wide 
range of measures, policies and framework in place which includes 
a virtual private network covering over 80 sites worldwide, secure 
ﬁrewalls, information management audits, disaster recovery and a 
mobile devices management system; and
• an acquisitions and disposals framework which governs the due 
diligence, negotiation, approval and integration processes to ensure 
that value enhancing, quality investments are made in order to 
meet our strategic objectives.

global spread of our 
businesses.
 • Weakening of 
ﬁnancial control and 
divergence from 
overall Group strategy 
in remote operations, 
leading to unexpected 
ﬁnancial outcomes
• Failure to comply with 
local laws and 
regulations in 
unfamiliar territories, 
leading to legal or 
regulatory disputes
• Control is exercised locally in accordance with the Group’s policy of 
autonomous management. We seek to employ local high quality 
experts.
• The Group’s acquisition model ensures retention of management and 
staff in acquired businesses meaning that local expertise is maintained. 
• Divisional Chief Executives (DCEs) ensure that overall Group strategy is 
fulﬁlled through on-going review of the businesses. The right balance 
between autonomy and adherence to the overall objectives of the 
Group is a key function of the DCEs and Divisional Finance Directors.
• Regular visits by senior management, ﬁnance staff and Internal Audit 
support local control.

from competitive 
threats 
• By empowering and resourcing innovation in local operations to 
respond to changing market needs, the potential adverse impact of 
downward price pressure and competition can be mitigated and 
growth maintained.
• We recognise the competitive threat coming from emerging economies 
and by operating within these economies, typically using local staff,
we are better placed to make fast progress ourselves.
• The Group operates in specialised global niche markets offering
high barriers to entry.

obsolescence and 
failure to innovate to 
meet customer needs
• By devolving control of product development into the autonomous 
operating businesses, we both spread risk and ensure that the people 
best placed to service the customer’s needs are driving innovation.
• New product development ‘best practice’ is shared between Group 
companies and return on investment of past and future innovation 
projects is tracked monthly. This ensures that the collective experience 
and expertise of the Group can be utilised to maximum effect.
• Large R&D projects, especially those which are capitalised, require 
Head Ofﬁce approval, ensuring that the Group’s signiﬁcant projects are

Information Technology/
Business Interruption
Group and operational 
management depend on 
timely and reliable information 
from our software systems. 
We seek to ensure 
continuous availability, 
security and operation of 
those systems.
 • Delay or impact on 
decision making 
through lack of 
availability of sound 
data
• Reduced service to 
customers due to 
poor information 
handling or 
interruption of 
business
• There is substantial redundancy and back up built into Groupwide 
systems and the spread of business offers good protection from 
individual events.
• We have a small central resource, Halma IT Services, to assist Group 
companies with strategic IT needs and to ensure adequate IT security 
policies are used across the Group.
• We carry out regular IT audits.
• We utilise external penetration testing and have completed the rollout of 
a centralised IT disaster recovery solution to supplement local 
processes. Business Continuity plans are well advanced in each 
business unit.
Strategic Risk
Acquisitions
The identiﬁcation and 
purchase of businesses 
which meet our demanding 
ﬁnancial and growth criteria is 
an important part of our 
strategy for developing the 
Group, as is ensuring the new 
businesses are rapidly 
integrated into the Group.
 •Failure to deliver 
expected results 
resulting from poor 
acquisition selection
• Reduced ﬁnancial 
performance arising 
from failure to 
integrate acquisitions 
into the Group
• Unforeseen liabilities 
arising from a failure 
to understand 
acquisition targets 
fully
• We acquire businesses whose technology and markets we know well. 
Divisional Chief Executives are responsible for ﬁnding and completing 
acquisitions in their business sectors subject to Board approval 
supported by central resources to search for opportunities. We employ 
detailed post-acquisition integration plans.
• Thorough due diligence is performed by a combination of in-house and 
external experts to ensure that a comprehensive appraisal of the 
ﬁnancial position of every target is obtained.
• Incentives are aligned to encourage acquisitions which are value-
enhancing from day one.
Key KPIs: Acquisition spend; ROTIC
Legal Risk
Laws and regulations
Group operations are subject 
to wide-ranging laws and 
regulations including business 
conduct, employment, 
environmental and health and 
safety legislation. There is also 
exposure to product litigation 
and contractual risk.
The laws and regulations we 
are exposed to as our 
businesses expand around 
the world increase each year.
 • Reputational damage 
leading to customer 
loss and brand 
damage
• Diversion of 
management 
resources creating 
opportunity costs
• Penalties arising from 
breach of laws and 
regulations
• The Group’s emphasis on excellent ﬁnancial control, high ethical 
standards, the deployment of high quality management resource and 
the strong focus on quality control over products and processes in 
each operating business help to protect us from product failure, 
litigation and contractual issues. 
• Each operating company has a health and safety manager responsible 
for compliance and our performance in this area is good. Updated 
Health and Safety policies and guidance were issued recently, with 
enhanced monthly reporting. Our well established policies on bribery 
and corruption have been maintained during the year to ensure 
continued compliance with best practice internally, via the Group Code 
of Conduct and externally, via appropriate clauses included in third 
party agreements.
• We carry comprehensive insurance against all standard categories of 
insurable risk. Contract review and approval processes mitigate 
exposure to contractual liability.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND 
UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED
54 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Risk description Trend* Potential impact Mitigation
Financial Risk
Cash
A key risk is that the Group 
may run out of cash or not 
have access to adequate 
cash. In addition, cash 
deposits need to be held in
a secure form and location.
 • Constraints on, or 
inability to, trade
• Inability to deliver on 
growth strategies
•Permanent loss of 
shareholder funds
• The strong cash ﬂow generated by the Group provides ﬁnancial 
ﬂexibility.
• Cash needs are monitored regularly. In addition to short-term overdraft 
facilities the Group renewed and increased to £260m its ﬁve-year 
revolving credit facility during the prior year providing security of funding 
and sufﬁcient headroom for its needs. Debt levels increased this year 
but the Group has adequate funding available to it.
• Cash deposits are monitored centrally and spread amongst a number 
of high credit rated banks. Subsidiaries report their cash status to Head 
Ofﬁce every week.
Key KPIs: Cash generation
Financial Risk
Treasury Risks
Foreign currency risk is the 
most signiﬁcant treasury 
related risk for the Group. In 
times of increased volatility 
this can have a signiﬁcant 
impact on performance. The 
Group is exposed to a lesser 
extent to other treasury risks 
such as interest rate risk and 
liquidity risk.
 • Reduced or volatile 
ﬁnancial performance 
arising from 
translation of proﬁt 
from overseas 
operations or poorly 
managed foreign 
exchange exposures
• Deviation from core 
strategy through the 
use of speculative or 
overly complex 
ﬁnancial instruments
• Financial penalties 
and reputational 
damage arising from 
breach of banking 
covenants
• The risk has increased because more of the Group’s proﬁts are derived 
from non-Sterling currencies. Currency proﬁts are not hedged. 
Currency hedging must ﬁt with the commercial needs of the business 
and we have in place a hedging strategy to manage Group exposures. 
This requires the hedging of a substantial proportion of expected future 
transactions up to 12 months (and in exceptional cases 24 months) 
ahead. Longer term currency trends can only be covered through a 
wide geographic spread of operations.
• The Group does not use overly complex derivative ﬁnancial instruments 
and no speculative treasury transactions are undertaken.
• We closely monitor performance against the ﬁnancial covenants on our 
revolving credit facility and are operating well within these covenants. 
Financial Risk
Pension Deﬁcit
Monitoring the funding needs 
of the Group’s pension plans 
is essential to meeting our 
pension obligations 
effectively. Our UK deﬁned 
beneﬁt pension plans are 
closed to new members.
 •Excessive 
consumption of cash, 
limiting investment
• Unexpected variability 
in company results
• There is regular dialogue with pension fund trustees and pension 
strategy is a regular Halma Board agenda item. The Group’s strong 
cash ﬂows and access to adequate borrowing facilities mean that the 
pensions risk can be adequately managed. 
• The Group has maintained additional pension contributions with the 
overall objective of paying off the deﬁcit in line with the Actuary’s 
recommendations. We monitor and consider alternative means of 
reducing our pension risk in light of the best long-term interest of 
shareholders.
Economic Risk
Economic Conditions
In times of uncertain 
economic conditions 
businesses face additional or 
elevated levels of risk. These 
include market and customer 
risk, customer default, fraud, 
supply chain risk and liquidity 
risk. Uncertainty in the 
Eurozone in particular adds to 
current uncertainty.
 • Reduced ﬁnancial 
performance
• Loss of market share
• Unforeseen liabilities
• Disruption of service 
to customers
• Risks are primarily managed at the operating company level where 
local knowledge is situated. The ﬁnancial strength and availability of 
pooled ﬁnance within the Group mitigates local risks faced by operating 
companies as does the robust credit management processes in place 
across the Group.
• The Halma Executive Board identiﬁes any wider trends which require 
action. Other than potential exposure to the current macro-economic 
uncertainty in the Eurozone, none have been noted.
• The Group’s diversity limits its exposure to economic risk arising in any 
one territory. Group sales to Mainland Europe represent 25% of overall 
sales and sales to southern Eurozone economies and Ireland represent 
fewer than 5% of total Group sales. The Group does not have

Business review  10-59 Governance and commitment to Corporate 
Responsibility
Halma companies are involved in the manufacture of a wide range of 
products that protect and improve the quality of life for people 
worldwide. Therefore, safety is critical to the Group and is a major 
priority for management. Reduction of the Group’s carbon footprint 
has received increased attention since 2007 with the initial objective 
of a 10% reduction in relative carbon usage in the three years to 
March 2010, renewed for the subsequent three years to March 2013 
and again for the three years to March 2016.
Our core values are Achievement, Innovation, Empowerment and 
Customer Satisfaction. These core values have been selected 
following extensive surveying of employees across the Group. Our 
culture is one of openness, integrity and accountability. We 
encourage our employees to act fairly in their dealings with fellow 
employees, customers, suppliers and business partners. We 
recognise that our employees determine our success and therefore 
continue to invest in and encourage their development more and 
more each year, not only with a suite of Halma development 
programmes, but also through clear leadership and decisive action. 
By ensuring that our team has the approach and skills required to 
succeed we are better placed to meet the challenges of the future.
We recognise the necessity of safeguarding the health and safety of 
our own employees while at work and operate so as to provide a safe 
and comfortable working environment for employees, visitors and the 
public. Our policy is to manage our activities to avoid causing any 
unnecessary or unacceptable risks to health and safety and the 
environment.
Halma has an excellent health and safety record and a culture of 
safety is deeply embedded within the Group. We have continued to 
actively promote our safety culture throughout the year through a 
series of independent Health and Safety reviews covering each 
operating company.
We support the concept of sustainability and recognise that, in 
common with all businesses, our activities have an environmental 
impact. Our strategy is not to have capital-intensive manufacturing 
processes and to operate close to our end markets in terms of 
geography, so the environmental impact of our operations 
is relatively low compared to manufacturers in other sectors. We also 
recognise that we can improve our own environmental performance 
and so resources are deployed to actively reduce our own 
carbon footprint. 
Halma has been a member of the FTSE4Good UK index since its 
establishment in July 2001.
A summary of our progress and performance for all areas of 
corporate responsibility follows. Halma has developed meaningful key 
performance indicators (KPIs) that reﬂect the importance the Group 
places on corporate responsibility and enable the Board to monitor 
the Group’s progress in meeting its objectives and responsibilities in 
these areas. Details are given on pages 16 and 17 .
The environment 
We have an excellent long-term record and a clear strategy for 
addressing environmental issues that affect our businesses and for 
developing products that protect the environment and improve safety 
at work and in public places.
Our products
Many of our innovative products play a very positive role in monitoring 
and improving the environment. Halma brands lead the world in a 
number of technologies which help to minimise environmental 
damage. Our principal environmental technologies are water leakage 
detection and wireless monitoring, gas emissions monitoring, water 
and efﬂuent analysis, UV water treatment and optical sensing. We 
promote the use of UV water sterilisation which eliminates the need to 
use dangerous chemicals, as well as products that minimise the 
waste of clean water.
Our commitment to the development of equipment for measuring 
and monitoring environmental changes and controlling the damaging 
impact of industrial activities is long term. We are the major world 
supplier in several of these areas.
Carbon policy
The Group’s policy on carbon is published on our website and has 
been distributed and explained to all Halma business units. A senior 
executive in each of our higher impact business units is responsible 
for implementing the carbon policy at local level. Our Finance Director, 
Kevin Thompson, has principal responsibility for coordinating and 
monitoring the policy. 
Environmental Management System
We are committed to developing and implementing an environmental 
management system (EMS) throughout the Group to measure, 
control and, where practical, reduce our environmental impacts. We 
have developed performance indicators that assist local management 
in implementing the policy and ultimately developing an EMS. The 
requirement for an EMS and the related reporting has been rolled out 
to all UK business units, which represent approximately 36% of 
Group production facilities in terms of external turnover. 
All Group companies are encouraged to undertake ISO 14001, the 
international environmental accreditation, where warranted. The 
requirement to implement an EMS will be extended to the rest of the 
Group in the medium term. In terms of revenue, currently 20% (2012: 
22%) of the Group has ISO 14001 approval.
Our impact
The environmental effect of our operations is relatively low compared 
to manufacturers in other sectors. Our manufacturing model is 
decentralised permitting our operations to be located close to their 
customers. Manufacturing operations are established across the 
world for this very reason rather than to save labour costs. The ethos 
of being close to our customers reﬂects the importance we place on 
the quality of our products and the service levels we provide to our 
customers. It also makes our operations more ﬂexible and responsive 
to their markets and customers. With operations spread around the 
globe, our supplier base is understandably fragmented. Therefore, 
responsibility for vetting and managing suppliers is devolved to local 
management while meeting the Group’s ethical standards.
CORPORATE
RESPONSIBILITY
56 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Nevertheless, Group companies are encouraged to improve energy 
efﬁciency, reduce waste and emissions and reduce the use of 
materials in order to minimise their environmental impact. The Group 
established baseline data in 2004/05 on emissions to air and water, 
water and energy consumption, and waste production, the results of 
which are updated on the Halma website each year. The data 
collected for the past ﬁve years has enabled the Group to set 
comprehensive and quantiﬁable objectives for reducing its 
environmental impacts in those areas and to set and monitor targets 
for reduction in key areas. The collected data conﬁrms that the main 
area of impact on the environment is energy consumption.
The Group does not operate a ﬂeet of distribution vehicles although 
we do own a number of company cars. From May 2007 , we 
implemented a cap on permissible CO
2 emissions of all UK company 
vehicles and have extended an equivalent requirement to the USA 
and Europe. This limit is reduced each year so as to consistently 
reduce our vehicles’ environmental impact. 
We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint. We set a target
in 2007 to reduce the Group’s total carbon emissions relative to 
revenues by 10% over three years. We have worked hard to reduce 
the energy impact of our facilities and maintained that target for 2010 
to 2013.
We are pleased to report that consistently over three years we 
reduced our carbon emissions resulting in an overall reduction of 10% 
in three years. We continue to support a number of carbon reduction 
initiatives, particularly in the UK, which are designed to help us meet 
our targets.
From April 2010, we have worked with a provider of energy efﬁciency 
and carbon reduction solutions to ensure compliance with the new 
Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efﬁciency Scheme (CRC) 
which is the UK’s mandatory climate change and energy saving 
scheme administered by the Environment Agency. We are in full 
compliance with the CRC requirements. Already we have rolled out 
Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) technology to the majority of UK 
sites. All major UK sites have received an energy survey and set an 
action plan for improved energy usage. This initiative is backed up by 
specialist carbon management software and comprehensive training 
on its use. The Group’s environmental performance will continue to 
be reported both in the Annual Report and on our website.
We have plans to step up our activities internationally to comply with 
the incoming mandatory carbon reporting requirements which UK 
public listed companies are subject to under the UK Government’s 
forthcoming Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013. We are in the process of reviewing service 
providers who will assist us in establishing the next stage approach 
for monitoring our environmental performance and future external 
reporting requirements. 
The Group is committed to examining the establishment of ‘green’ 
procurement policies and increasing our use of recycled materials.
Health and safety
Halma companies are involved in the manufacture of a wide range of 
products that protect and improve the quality of life for people 
worldwide. Therefore, safety is critical to the Group and is a major 
priority for management. 
The Group manages its activities to avoid causing any unnecessary 
or unacceptable risks to health and safety to our employees in the 
work place or to the public as a result of our activities. The policy is 
understood by all Group companies and was reinforced in 2010/1 1 
through improved guidance and reporting following a comprehensive 
review led by an external expert. 
To ensure each Group company has appropriately embedded the 
updated Health and Safety procedures in their business, we required 
independent Health and Safety reviews to be performed and these 
will be completed by July 2013. These reviews are conducted with a 
view to ensuring a consistent approach in quality of reporting, internal 
processes, integration in operations, appropriateness of company 
policies, culture of Health and Safety and also as a means of 
identifying any patterns or underlying causes of reported incidents. As 
a result, reporting of Health and Safety incidents and corrective action 
where needed has been given an even higher proﬁle.
Given the autonomous structure of the Group, operational 
responsibility for compliance with relevant local Health and Safety 
regulations is delegated to the directors of each Group company. We 
believe Health and Safety training is important and it is carried out 
within companies as appropriate. Adequate internal reporting exists in 
order that the Group’s Finance Director can monitor each company’s 
compliance with this policy.

Business review  10-59 Our people
The Group has a policy of equal opportunities and preventing 
harassment, which applies in relation to recruitment of all new 
employees and to the management of existing personnel. This gives 
us access to the widest labour market and enables us to secure the 
best employees for our needs. We offer all of our staff training relevant 
to their roles and we believe that this contributes to an increase in 
employee motivation and job satisfaction. The culture alignment 
survey results mentioned below support our efforts.
Periodically we complete a survey of employees to determine whether 
our core values are authentic in our organisation. The survey 
establishes the values individual employees wish to see in our 
operating culture and to what extent they exist in our current culture.
In 2006, our survey of senior managers showed that ﬁve (50%) of the 
values they wanted to see in our business were actually present. In 
2012, our survey of senior managers showed that six (60%) desired 
values were present in our business. This indicated that there was a 
healthy level of alignment between the culture we aspire to have and 
the culture we actually have. For 2013, we increased the participation 
in the survey by 76% by making it available in paper format as well as 
online. This year’s survey still showed a good level of alignment with 
ﬁve (50%) matches.
No survey is capable of capturing all the appropriate sentiments, but 
our executives, who regularly visit all Group companies, agree that 
observable and valuable improvements in the Group culture have 
occurred over recent years. The Group will continue to monitor the 
survey results to enable us to better support our people in bringing 
these values and strengths to work so that they and we may derive 
further beneﬁt from them.
Diversity
Gender diversity
The Board of Directors responded to the consultation document that 
the UK’s Financial Reporting Council issued in respect of ‘Gender 
Diversity on Boards’.
Our experience is that throughout Halma, women are under-
represented at manager and executive levels and we aim to increase 
the proportion of women in senior roles and on the Board of Directors 
by refreshing our policies and behaviours from both a ‘top down’ and 
‘bottom up’ approach. To that end, we issued a Diversity Policy 
during the prior year which is available on our website. We appreciate 
the task ahead of us in sectors where relevant graduates are more 
than 80% male, so part of our strategy will involve ensuring that 
Halma has a culture and working practices that make it more 
attractive to women. The diversity of the current year intake of 
graduates into the HGDP is already demonstrating our success in 
attracting women to Halma.
Racial and geographical diversity
Our efforts are directed towards increasing the proportion of 
individuals with experience in the business and geographic markets 
in which we see our operations trending. 
Our strong preference is to develop policies and actions which 
support our aims rather than establishing measurable targets. We 
believe the former evolves into part of the corporate culture more 
readily than simply setting a target.
DIVERSITY POLICY
Halma believes that the diversity of our staff is a signiﬁcant 
contributor to our success:
• Diversity in our organisation attracts talented people to join the 
Group and to develop to their full potential.
• Diversity within our leadership improves decision making 
processes and effective teamwork.
• Diversity encourages fresh thinking and challenges the status 
quo and boosts innovation.
Our policy’s objectives are:
1.  To build a culture that encourages talented people of all 
backgrounds, beliefs or any form of personal identity to want to 
work for Halma.
2.  To use recruitment, training, development, promotion and 
compensation to increase diversity in our organisation.
3.  To ensure that our procedures, systems and behaviours are not 
discriminatory.
Each year our Board of Directors reviews these policies and our 
implementation to ensure that they create and maintain a diverse 
and inclusive organisation.
Disabled employees
Applications for employment by disabled people are always fully 
considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. 
In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is 
made to ensure that their employment with the Group continues and 
that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that 
the training, career development and promotion of disabled people 
should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Employee consultation
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its 
employees and has continued to keep them informed on matters 
affecting them as employees and on the various factors affecting the 
performance of the Group. This is achieved through formal and 
informal meetings, the Group intranet and the annual Financial 
statements. 
Employee representatives are consulted routinely on a wide range of 
matters affecting their current and future interests. An employee share 
plan has been running successfully since 1980. It is open to all UK 
employees and aligns the interests of all UK employees to those of 
shareholders.
People development
People development is a key part of our organic growth strategy. 
We run a number of people development programmes. The Halma 
Executive Development Programme (HEDP), which is based on our 
recognition of the fundamental part our people play in the success of 
the Group, continued to strengthen in recent years. HEDP is an 
integrated development plan for our senior people – including the 
next generation of Managing Directors and Divisional Chief 
Executives. Our objective is to provide these individuals with the tools 
and training they need to achieve more in their existing role and 
potentially to advance through the organisation if their achievements 
merit it.

Cumulative number of 
candidates that have

candidates that have

HEDP is aimed at employees already serving on subsidiary boards 
but we also encourage applications from senior functional managers 
who can demonstrate they already have equivalent responsibilities 
and will beneﬁt from the programme.
There are approximately 272 such eligible employees in total.
The programme has been developed from a proven course structure 
and is speciﬁcally and continuously tailored to suit Halma’s needs, 
aligning the content to the Group’s four core values of Achievement, 
Innovation, Empowerment and Customer Satisfaction. It focuses 
strongly on strategic and leadership capabilities and developing 
personal attributes – commitment, determination and resilience. 
There is an emphasis on performance management and team 
development. It includes skill based elements such as sales and 
marketing management, project leadership, corporate governance, 
ﬁnance and innovation, but all are presented in a strategic context.
Sixteen programmes have been successfully completed.
Once a signiﬁcant proportion of executives completed HEDP , a follow 
up programme, HEDP+, was introduced to provide updated training 
and to reinforce the original course contents, and four such courses 
were held in the year.
Complementing the HEDP is a programme for subsidiary managers 
and supervisors – the Halma Management Development Programme 
(HMDP). During the year, four HMDP and two HMDP+ programmes 
were completed. Programmes were held in the USA, Europe and 
Asia.
In 201 1, we introduced a new programme, Halma Certiﬁcate of 
Applied Technology (HCAT), targeted at our technical engineers to 
equip them with a broader understanding of Halma’s technology, 
improve their productivity and provide speciﬁc skills training in areas 
such as project management. Three such programmes, with 51 
participants, have been completed with great success.
The Halma Graduate Development Programme (HGDP) was 
introduced during 201 1/12 and the ﬁrst participants started working 
with us in Summer 2012. HGDP is targeted at engineering, science 
and technical graduates with the potential to become future leaders 
of our companies, or next generation specialists driving our 
technology.
The programme lasts 18 to 24 months and is based on placements in 
our various operating companies. Through project work participants 
quickly assume responsibility and learn in detail how businesses 
operate. We support participants through residential training modules 
to help develop communication and teamwork skills alongside a 
mentoring programme for personal development.
Responsible investment
Investing in Halma shares meets the criteria of many professional and 
private investors who base their decisions on environmental, ethical 
and social considerations. The Group is a world leader in several key 
environmental technologies and has a reputation for honesty and 
integrity in its relationships with employees, customers, business 
partners and shareholders.
Social conditions can be improved for all through the creation of 
wealth. Halma creates wealth responsibly allowing our employees, 
customers, business partners and shareholders to determine where 
this wealth is best distributed.
Halma’s policies reﬂect the core requirements of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We do not tolerate 
practices which contravene these international standards. Regulatory 
demands upon us vary considerably around the world, so Halma 
establishes the core structure to ensure that Group companies fully 
comply with legislative and regulatory requirements while permitting 
them to tailor their approach to their particular needs.
Ethics
The Group culture is one of openness, integrity and accountability. 
Halma requires its employees to act fairly in their dealings with fellow 
employees, customers, suppliers and business partners. Halma 
introduced a new Code of Conduct during 201 1/12 which applies to 
all Group employees and our external business relationships. We 
require suppliers to be of high quality and to operate to accepted 
international standards. Halma operates a conﬁdential whistleblowing 
policy with an external call centre, which enables all Group employees 
to raise any concerns they may have.
Halma has a zero-tolerance policy on bribery and corruption which 
extends to all business dealings and transactions in which we are 
involved. This includes a prohibition on making political donations, 
offering or receiving inappropriate gifts or making undue payments to 
inﬂuence the outcome of business dealings. Our robust policy and 
guidance in this area, which was updated during the prior year in line 
with best practice, are routinely reviewed.

62 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
TO GOVERNANCE
“The Board is committed to 
maintaining very high standards 
of corporate governance and 
ensuring values and behaviours 
are consistent across the 
business.”
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to present Halma’s Corporate Governance report 
on behalf of our Board. The report deals with how the Board and 
its committees discharged their governance duties which I hope 
provides you with a clear and meaningful explanation of how we 
apply the principles of good governance enshrined in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code). There have been several 
reviews and consultations on governance matters in the past year. 
Although Halma will report in accordance to the revised September 
2012 Code in its 2013/14 Annual Report, the Board has considered 
the revised provisions when preparing this report. 
The Board is committed to maintaining very high standards of 
corporate governance and ensuring values and behaviours are 
consistent across the business. We have sought to manage the 
affairs of the Company not by merely following regimented rules, 
but by promoting open and transparent discussion, constructive 
challenge and support in the Board and across the Group. I 
continue to be pleased with the progress Halma has made. We 
continually seek to ensure best practice is maintained and that 
governance is integral to our strategy and decision-making 
processes for the beneﬁt of our shareholders.
As I indicated in last year’s Annual Report, we strengthened and 
refreshed the composition of our Board with the appointment of 
Daniela Barone Soares in November 201 1. I am now delighted to 
welcome Paul Walker as our newest non-executive Director and 
Chairman Designate. He will be appointed Chairman upon my 
retirement immediately following the Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
on 25 July 2013. He is a member of the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees and he will succeed me as Chairman of 
the Nomination Committee upon my retirement. Paul was part of 
the original team at The Sage Group plc, a leading worldwide 
provider of business software which has a global footprint, a 
devolved management structure and an entrepreneurial culture. 
Paul also has wide-ranging non-executive director experience. He is 
a valuable addition to the Board and I am sure will be an excellent 
leader and Chairman to our Board and team. I am proud to have 
served as Chairman over the past ten years and am honoured to 
have worked with a team of such high calibre.
I have always maintained that a chairman’s role involves ensuring 
that there is a sufﬁcient cadre of individuals being nurtured 
throughout the Group to enable effective succession planning. 
The promotion of several MDs to the Executive Board during my 
tenure, demonstrates the importance the Group places on 
developing in-house talent. Reviews of management capabilities 
and potential are performed on a routine basis and I am satisﬁed 
that sufﬁcient resources exist within the Group, and that talent 
continues to be developed through programmes such as the Halma 
Executive Development Programme which itself evolves to meet the 
changing needs of the Group. Whenever we identify a need for 
improvement to management resources we take action to ensure 
full strength is attained as soon as practicable.
Lastly, I would like to encourage all shareholders to ﬁnd the time 
to attend our AGM on 25 July 2013. It is an excellent opportunity 
to meet the Board, the Executive Board and a selection of the 
Managing Directors from our operating companies.

Compliance with the Code of best practice
As required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority 
this Report explains how the Company applies the principles and 
complies with the provisions of the Financial Reporting Council UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code) published in June 2010 
which applied to the Company throughout the year ended 
30 March 2013.
Throughout the year, the Company has fully complied with the 
provisions as set out in section 1 of the Code. 
The Board has determined its ideal composition as a Chairman, 
ﬁve independent non-executive Directors and four executive 
Directors. The Board adjudged this composition as an appropriate 
structure for the Company providing valuable direct knowledge of 
operations and effective challenge surrounding the issues facing the 
Group. The Board will revert to its ideal composition following Geoff 
Unwin’s retirement after the 2013 AGM.
Therefore, with the exception of Geoff Unwin, in accordance with 
the Code each of the Directors, being eligible, will offer themselves 
for election or re-election at the AGM.
The Board
The Board considered the independence of the Chairman, Chairman 
Designate and each of the non-executive Directors and subjected 
Stephen Pettit’s term as a non-executive Director to particular 
rigorous review. Details are given on pages 67 and 72. The Board 
continues to regard Stephen Pettit as independent and considers
the Chairman, Chairman Designate and all non-executive Directors
to be independent of management and free from business and other 
relationships which could interfere with the exercise of independent 
judgment now and in the future. The Board believes that any 
shareholdings of the Chairman and non-executive Directors serve
to align their interests with those of shareholders. 
Upon appointment and at regular intervals, all Directors are offered 
appropriate training. Under the Company’s Articles, each Director 
is subject to re-election at least once every three years however, 
commencing in 201 1, the Board has agreed that each Director shall 
stand for annual re-election. The Board conﬁrms that all Directors 
standing for election or re-election continue to be effective and 
demonstrate commitment to their roles.
Details of Directors’ biographies appear on pages 60 and 61
and in the Notice of Meeting.
The Directors retain responsibility for the formulation of corporate 
strategy, investment decisions and treasury and risk management 
policies. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board’s decision and the Board meets at least six times each year 
with further ad hoc meetings as required. Directors are issued an 
agenda and comprehensive Board papers in the week preceding 
each Board meeting. All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary as well as there being an 
agreed procedure for obtaining independent professional advice.

Board constitution 
Halma made further progress in refreshing the composition and 
diversity of our Board with the appointment of Daniela Barone Soares 
in November 201 1 and the recent appointment of Paul Walker as our 
new non-executive Director and Chairman Designate. The Nomination 
Committee appointed for the Chairman succession search comprised 
four non-executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, 
Stephen Pettit. A global search ﬁrm, Korn Ferry Whitehead Mann, 
which has no other connection to Halma was appointed. A wide range 
of high calibre candidates was considered for the role and each 
Director had the opportunity to meet Paul Walker ahead of his 
appointment. The Board conﬁrmed Paul Walker’s independence upon 
appointment and was unanimous in its decision to appoint Paul 
Walker. 
Board induction
Newly appointed non-executive Directors follow an induction 
programme which include scheduled trips to a variety of companies 
in each of the four sectors. All new Directors appointed to the Board 
have a comprehensive induction programme tailored to their 
individual needs. Paul Walker met with the Company Secretary to 
review an induction pack which included Halma’s governance and 
risk management structure, Board evaluations, Board and Committee 
meetings minutes, strategy papers, recent analyst and broker reports 
on Halma, and access to Halma’s policies and procedural notes was 
also provided. As well as providing a schedule of meetings with 
executives and company visits, Paul Walker also attended the biennial 
Halma Innovation and Technology Exposition (HITE) to gain a better 
understanding of the Halma group, our strategy, our operating 
companies, their management teams and their products.
Board diversity
The Board reviewed the report of Lord Davies published in February 
201 1 on Boardroom Diversity and contributed to the FRC review 
of Gender Diversity on Boards noting its support for the beneﬁts 
of greater diversity, which is not just gender speciﬁc, but relates also 
to other factors such as market and international experience and 
diversity of thought. It was agreed by the Board that a manufacturing 
and technology company such as Halma would have to adopt 
policies to attract a greater number of females into management 
roles. The Board hopes to support these aims through the adoption 
and implementation of Halma’s Diversity Policy (detailed on page 58) 
rather than set quotas. Halma aims to improve the representation of 
women in senior roles and on the Board of Directors by refreshing our 
policies and reviewing implementation to ensure that they create and 
maintain a diverse and inclusive culture.
As at year end, the Board has a total of ten Directors. The skill set 
of the non-executive Directors includes ﬁnancial, economics, 
banking, engineering, technology, IT, communications and consumer 
expertise. They include eight British, one American and one Brazilian 
nationals. 20% of the Board are women. 
Halma has the ambition to increase the number of executives based 
outside Europe and the USA to better reﬂect the proportion of our 
revenue generated outside those markets.
Board activity throughout the year 2012/13
During the year the Board received training and brieﬁng updates on our 
sectors, market assessments and changes, acquisition opportunities 
and geographical priorities, succession planning, changes in corporate 
governance, risk management and compliance, audits, bribery 
and corruption, health and safety, environmental matters, city and 
shareholders matters, doing business in Russia, China proﬁtability 
and other relevant legislative and accounting changes. 
The Directors have a programmed schedule of meetings and 
visits with the Executive Board, Group companies and Halma’s 
development programmes to ensure that they are able to engage 
with management and employees at all levels. The Directors also 
have the opportunity to attend the biennial HITE and the associated 
conferences.

66 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Board performance and evaluation 
The Board considers the evaluation of its performance and that of the 
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees annually, with each 
Committee also evaluating its own performance. Last year, the Board 
engaged an external facilitator, Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review, 
for full Board and Committee evaluations. This year, the Company 
Secretary facilitated an internal evaluation of its performance and that 
of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
The key conclusions of the 2012/13 evaluation were ﬁrst discussed 
with the Chairman and subsequently presented to the full Board. 
The evaluation results were discussed by the Board at the February 
2013 Board meeting.
The 2013 internal review supported the 2012 external evaluation 
conclusion that the Board was effective, methodical and thorough 
in the way it approaches its work. There continues to be an open 
and transparent debate and an even contribution from all members 
of the Board and an active and collaborative approach to 
performance management reﬂected in the constructive debates in 
the Remuneration Committee. The Board spent a signiﬁcant amount 
of time considering risks and controls and was assisted by strong 
ﬁnancial information, effective internal and external audit processes 
and a strong Audit Committee. Overall, the process conﬁrmed the 
right blend of behaviours and skills around the Halma Board table. 
The Board freely and openly expresses any concerns which results 
in more considered outcomes emphasising collective responsibility, 
transparency, clarity and integrity. 
The most signiﬁcant issue arising from the 2013 review surrounded 
the importance of Chairman and Senior Independent Director 
succession planning and the preservation of the Group’s positive 
culture during such a transition in these roles. In addition, the Board 
recognises the importance of the non-executive Directors investing 
sufﬁcient time to enable them to operate with a sound knowledge of 
both the Company and to establish relationships with the executive 
Directors. 
To address the above points, the appointment of Paul Walker and the 
extension of Stephen Pettit’s appointment serve to ensure continuity 
and that an appropriate transition process is undergone with the aim 
of preserving the Group’s culture while permitting healthy reﬂection on 
our current structure and processes. Stephen Pettit will remain on the 
Board until such time as his experience of Halma’s culture is 
embodied in his colleagues. The Board and Executive Board have 
also introduced more opportunities for interaction around topics of 
strategic and operational importance.
As in prior years, the Board also met in February 2013 before the 
scheduled Board meeting. There was a meeting of the Chairman and 
non-executive Directors with the Chief Executive. This was followed 
by a meeting of the Chairman and non-executive Directors only. The 
Senior Independent Director also led a meeting with the non-
executive Directors without the Chairman present. The Executives 
were also given the opportunity to meet with the Chairman and/or 
the Senior Independent Director separately. The outcome of these 
meetings was then fed back to individuals by the Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director or Chief Executive, as appropriate.

Committees of the Board
Our Committees are a valuable part of the Company’s corporate 
governance structure. The workload of the Committees includes the 
table of scheduled meetings as well as ad hoc meetings and 
communications frequently requiring considerable amounts of time. 
Halma has six committees and sub-committees of the Board: the 
Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee, the Share Plans Committee, the Bank Guarantees and 
Facilities Committee and the Acquisitions and Disposals Committee. 
Each of these Committees has terms of reference which have been 
recently reviewed and approved by the Board, copies of which are 
available on the website or on request from the Company Secretary.
Minutes of Committee meetings are made available to all Directors 
and the Chairmen of each of the three key Board Committees, the 
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees, provide regular 
updates to the Board.
A chart setting out the Company’s Board and Committees’ structure 
is given above with the Board and Committee memberships and 
Directors’ biographical details shown separately on pages 60 and 61. 
The responsibilities of the key Board Committees and the key issues 
and activities during 2012/13 are set out in the following Committee 
reports on pages 70 to 82.
Investor relations
The Board recognises the importance of effective communication 
with our shareholders. In regular meetings with shareholders and 
analysts the Chief Executive and Finance Director communicate 
the Group’s strategy and results, disclosing such information as is 
permitted within the guidelines of the Listing Rules. Such meetings 
ensure that institutional shareholders representing over 50% of the 
Company’s issued share capital meet or hold discussions with the 
Company on a regular basis. Major shareholders are also offered 
the opportunity to meet the Chairman and/or Senior Independent 
Director. Notes from all investor meetings are circulated to the 
Chairman with investor feedback results from roadshows circulated 
to the whole Board.
All shareholders are encouraged to attend the annual general 
meeting where they can gain a better understanding of the Company. 
Shareholders are able to pose questions to the Board on the matters 
put to the meeting, including the Annual Report and the management 
of the Company. Major shareholders are also invited to brieﬁngs 
following the half-year and annual results. In February 2013, the Chief 
Executive, Finance Director and a Divisional Chief Executive held a 
Capital Markets Day at which an update on the Group’s strategy and 
the new reporting sectors was detailed and the Group’s mergers and 
acquisitions performance was reviewed. In April 2013, approximately 
40 of Halma’s major shareholders were also invited to HITE so they 
could better understand Halma’s culture, strategy and our operating 
companies’ products and markets. The occasion also afforded both 
members of the Board and major shareholders the opportunity to 
develop a better mutual understanding of one another’s views. The 
content of presentations to shareholders and analysts at results 
announcements and all announcements are available on the Group 
website: www.halma.com. 
The Group website also contains electronic versions of the latest 
Annual Report and Accounts, Half-Year Reports, biographical 
information on Directors and the Executive Board, share price 
information, and full subsidiary company contact details as well as 
links to their own websites. The website also features the facility to 
request e-mail alerts relating to announcements made by the Group 
and there is a feedback form to invite suggestions for improvements 
to the website and our investor relations activities.
Shareholders can keep up to date with the latest Halma ﬁnancial 
news, on the move, with our Investor Relations iPad app. This is 
available as a free download from the Apple iTunes store, as detailed 
below. The app is updated at the same time as our website and 
delivers news releases, regulatory announcements, presentations, 
reports, webcasts, videos, ﬁnancial documents and the share price. 
To help investors understand the scope of our business we have 
produced a new ‘Introduction to Halma’ animated video. This can be 
viewed from the home page of our website (www.halma.com) and

68 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility to the shareholders for the 
Group’s system of internal control and risk management, and the 
review of the system’s effectiveness has been delegated to the Audit 
Committee. Whilst not providing absolute assurance against material 
misstatements or loss, this system is designed to identify and 
manage those risks that could adversely impact the achievement of 
the Group’s objectives. The Group’s risk management structure and 
process is detailed on pages 51 and 52. The Group’s principal risks 
and uncertainties are detailed on pages 53 to 55.
The Board conﬁrms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group, 
which has been in place for the year under review and up to the date 
of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. This process has 
been reviewed by the Board and the Board is satisﬁed that the Group 
accords with the Turnbull guidance. The Board made several 
enhancements in the conduct of the process during the year and will 
continue to review the system routinely to ensure that the system of 
internal control and risk management remains ﬁt for purpose.
The Group’s external auditors, Deloitte LLP , have audited the ﬁnancial 
statements and have reviewed the internal ﬁnancial control systems to 
the extent they consider necessary to support their audit report. 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the main trends and 
factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position, and the ﬁnancial position of the Group, its cash ﬂows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities, are set out in the Business 
Review. In addition, note 26 to the ﬁnancial statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital, 
its ﬁnancial risk management objectives, details of its ﬁnancial 
instruments and hedging activities, and its exposures to currency and 
liquidity risks.
The Group has considerable ﬁnancial resources (including a £260m 
ﬁve-year revolving credit facility, of which £105m was undrawn at
30 March 2013) together with contracts with a diverse range of 
customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and 
industries. No one customer accounts for more than 2% of Group 
turnover. The Directors have considered the Group’s potential 
exposure to the Eurozone crisis and have concluded that this is 
minimal due to the fact that less than 5% of sales arise in areas 
experiencing macro-economic uncertainty and the Group does not 
maintain signiﬁcant banking or other business relationships in these 
areas. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well 
placed to manage its business risks successfully.
After conducting a formal review of the Group’s ﬁnancial resources, 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report
and Accounts.

Audit Committee Report
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board from the non-
executive Directors of the Group. The Audit Committee’s terms of 
reference include all matters indicated by Disclosure and Transparency 
Rule 7 . 1 and the Code. The terms of reference are considered annually 
by the Audit Committee and are then referred to the Board for approval. 
The full terms of reference were updated in April 2013 in line with the 
revised recommendations of the September 2012 Code and can be 
found on the Company’s website or can be obtained from the 
Company Secretary.
The primary responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to: 
• monitor the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements of the Group and any 
formal announcements relating to the Group’s ﬁnancial performance 
and review signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting judgments contained therein;
• have oversight of risk management, including the review of the 
Group’s ﬁnancial, operational and compliance internal controls, 
as well as whistleblowing and fraud prevention procedures;
• monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit 
function;
• make recommendations to the Board, for a resolution to be put 
to the shareholders for their approval at the general meeting, 
on the appointment of the external auditors and the approval of the 
remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors;
• review and monitor the external auditors’ independence and 
objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into 
consideration the periodic rotation of audit personnel and relevant UK 
professional and regulatory requirements; and 
• develop and implement a policy on the engagement of the external 
auditors to supply non-audit services, taking into account relevant 
guidance regarding the provision of non-audit services by the external 
audit ﬁrm.
Key issues and activities
The Committee not only reviews the ﬁnancial reporting of the Company, 
but spends a signiﬁcant amount of its time reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control process. Combined with the Committee’s 
review of the internal and external audit functions, it is able to obtain 
sufﬁcient information to discharge its responsibilities. 
More speciﬁcally, during the year the Committee reviewed its own 
effectiveness and looked at its activities as detailed in the table below.
Audit Committee activities
Financial statements and reports

As part of these reviews the Committee 
received a report from the external 
auditors on their audit of the Annual 
Report and Accounts;

70 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Governance
The Audit Committee was in place throughout the ﬁnancial year with 
Jane Aikman as the Chair. All ﬁve members are independent 
non-executive Directors in accordance with provision C.3. 1 of the 
Code. The Chief Executive, Finance Director and representatives from 
the external Auditors attend Committee meetings by invitation in order 
to provide appropriate advice. The Committee meets at least three 
times per year and routinely meets the Auditors without the 
involvement of the executive Directors. The Committee meets with 
the Internal Auditor on a regular basis throughout the year. The 
Finance Director works closely with the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee to ensure open communication between them. The 
Board has designated Jane Aikman as the member of the Audit 
Committee with recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. She is a 
chartered accountant, is a ﬁnance director and has listed company 
experience.
Training
The Audit Committee has extended all of its meetings by an hour to 
incorporate additional time for risk-related topics and training on 
relevant topics, for example valuation of acquisitions and disposals, 
ﬁnancial reporting (including additional coverage of audit procedures, 
scope and methodology), fraud, internal control and governance.
Auditor independence
Deloitte LLP has been the external Auditor of the Group since 2003 
and an annual review of the independence of Deloitte LLP is 
undertaken each year. At the year-end the Auditors formally conﬁrmed 
their independence and that objectivity has been maintained. The 
Committee concluded that the relevant independence continues to be 
met. In addition, the Auditors are required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group audit every ﬁve years. Following a rigorous 
evaluation of the audit service and a change in audit partner in 2010/1 1, 
the Audit Committee agreed that a full tender was not required for the 
201 1/12 audit. The Committee reconsidered its review during 2012/13 
and concluded that a full tender is not currently required. The 
Committee has noted the revisions to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code introduced by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in 
September 2012 and effective for Halma’s 2013/14 ﬁnancial year and in 
particular the recommendation to put the external audit out to tender at 
least every 10 years. The Committee noted the proposed transitional 
arrangements with respect to audit tendering to ﬁt the ﬁve yearly cycle 
of partner rotation. Consequently the Committee will consider its 
external tendering arrangements in anticipation of the next audit partner 
rotation, and provide an update in the 2013/14 Annual Report. The 
Committee will continue to focus on the effectiveness, objectivity and 
independence of the Auditor in its reviews. 
The Group’s ‘Policy on Auditor Independence and Services 
provided by the External Auditor’ sets out restrictions on the 
categories of non-audit services which the external Auditors are 
allowed to provide to the Group. A summary of which is provided in 
the table below. This policy is regularly reviewed and states that the 
Group will only use the appointed external auditor for non-audit 
services in cases where these services do not conﬂict with the 
auditor’s independence. 
The Committee conﬁrms that Deloitte LLP remains best placed 
to advise the Group on matters related to tax compliance and the 
structure of the Group. The Committee accepts that certain work 
of a non-audit nature is best undertaken by the external Auditors, 
and appointments are made taking into account factors including 
expertise and fees. The Committee regularly reviews the amount 
and nature of the non-audit work the external Auditors perform. 
The Audit Committee is notiﬁed of all non-audit services with 
external auditors’ fees between £50,000 and £100,000. The policy 
also sets a fee level per project of £100,000 above which non-audit 
services are subject to a tendering process. The above fee levels 
for non-audit services are also subject to an annual cap equal to 
the audit fee. At each meeting, the Audit Committee also receives a 
summary of all fees, audit and non-audit, payable to the external 
Auditor.
The audit fees payable to Deloitte LLP during 2012/13 were 
£7 40,000 (2012: £660,000) and non-audit service fees were 
£307 ,000 (2012: £210,000). The principal non-audit service is 
tax-advisory related. A summary of fees paid to the external 
auditors is set out in note 6 to the Accounts on page 103. 
In accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK & 
Ireland) 260 and Ethical Standard 1 issued by the Accounting 
Practices Board, and as a matter of best practice, the external 
Auditors have conﬁrmed their independence as Auditors of the 
Company, in a letter addressed to the Directors. 
Accordingly, the Committee unanimously recommended to the 
Board that a resolution for the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as the 
Company’s independent Auditors be proposed to shareholders at 
the AGM in July 2013 and the Board has accepted and endorsed 
this recommendation.

Nomination Committee Report
Governance
The Nomination Committee was in place throughout the ﬁnancial 
year. It is chaired by the Chairman of the Company who was 
deemed to be independent on appointment to the Board. Four of 
the ﬁve members of the Committee are independent non-executive 
Directors in accordance with provision B.2. 1 of the UK Code. 
Key issues and activities
The Committee and the specially formed sub-committee met on 
several occasions during the year and considered:
• the re-election of all Directors at the July 2012 AGM;
• succession planning;
• external board evaluation;
• Geoff Unwin’s proposed retirement;
• Stephen Pettit’s re-election to the Board and its Committees; 
and
• the nomination and post year-end appointment of Paul Walker
as a non-executive Director and Chairman Designate and his 
membership of the Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
When the need to appoint a Director is identiﬁed, a candidate 
proﬁle is developed indicating the skills, knowledge and experience 
required taking into account the Board’s existing composition. 
External search consultancies are retained when recruiting 
non-executive Directors and are used to evaluate internal and 
external candidates for succession planning. 
As disclosed on pages 64 and 66, the Nomination sub-committee 
appointed for the Chairman succession search comprised four 
non-executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director. A 
global search 
ﬁrm with no other connection to Halma was appointed. A wide 
range of high calibre candidates was considered for the role. The 
Board conﬁrmed Paul Walker’s independence upon appointment 
and was unanimous in its decision to appoint Paul Walker. 
As noted on pages 64, 66 and 67 , the process of appointments to 
the Board is paramount in ensuring the Company’s performance is 
maintained and continually improved upon.

Governance  60-86 Activities
During 2012/13, the Committee continued to review the Company’s 
remuneration strategy such that executives remain appropriately 
incentivised to meet the Group’s objectives. Our prudent 
remuneration arrangements seek to support the demands of our 
business model and take into account principles of sound risk 
management and the social climate in which we operate. The 
Company’s strategy is that a substantial proportion of the 
Remuneration of executive Directors should be performance 
related. The strategy relies upon three key components which 
produce an appropriate balance between ﬁxed and variable pay 
over the short and long term:
• setting salaries below median market rate levels; 
• a performance related bonus scheme, rewarding growth in 
economic value added; and
• a performance-granted long-term equity-based incentive 
rewarding relative TSR performance and ROTIC.
Having reviewed the salary trend over the past few years, the 
Committee noted a drift towards and below lower quartile salary 
levels amongst the executives and sought to address an element 
of this trend with salary increases marginally higher than inﬂation. 
The Committee does not expect to make such adjustments each 
year, but periodically as appropriate. Accordingly the Committee 
agreed that: 
• executive Director base salaries for 2013/14 should be increased 
by an average of 5.9% (2012: 3.6%);
• the annual targets for the granting of performance shares were 
set appropriately; and
• the award of bonuses in respect of 2012/13 should only be 
based on objective measures and be related to the Company’s 
performance.
The Committee has reviewed the Remuneration Report for 2012/13 
and the Company’s remuneration strategy, policy and details of 
executive remuneration follow.

74 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Report on remuneration strategy and policy
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. The report also 
meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and describes how the Board has applied the 
principles relating to directors’ remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report 
will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the ﬁnancial statements will be approved. 
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and to state 
whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations. The report has 
therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, retain and motivate the high calibre executives needed to manage the Group 
successfully and align their interests with those of the shareholders by rewarding them for enhancing value to shareholders. 
The packages also seek to reward achievement of stretching performance targets without driving unacceptable behaviours or encouraging 
excessive risk taking.
The performance measurement of the executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual 
remuneration package are undertaken by the Remuneration Committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors and senior management:

*  The maximum pensionable salary on which future pensions are based is capped. The cap is increased each April by CPI. Final pensions are a proportion of the ﬁnal pensionable 
salary based on the number of years of service.
As described above and below, executive Directors may earn annual bonus payments of up to 100% of their basic salary together with the 
beneﬁts of participation in share plans which are subject to a maximum value, in the year of grant, of 140% of basic salary.
Each executive Director currently holds shares in the Company in excess of the guideline of one year’s salary (see page 80).

Executive Director pay mix (2012/13)
The split of the actual package in the year under review reﬂects modest outcomes (of between threshold and target) under the annual bonus 
plan and the full vesting of the 2009 PSP awards in relation to the achievement of top quartile TSR performance and ROTIC of more than 14% 
p.a. over the past three years. The Committee is satisﬁed that this outcome is closely aligned with, and reﬂective of, Halma’s strong underlying 
performance over this period.
Basic salary
Prior to the beginning of each year, each executive Director’s basic salary is reviewed by the Committee against the market, Company 
performance and future strategy and when an individual changes position or responsibility. The Chief Executive is responsible for assessing 
the performance of each senior executive taking account of the complexity of the operations under their control, their opportunities for 
advancement with the Group, their remuneration relative to other executives in the Group and their bonus earning potential. He then 
formulates a remuneration proposal for the Committee’s consideration. In deciding appropriate remuneration levels, the Committee also 
considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective external research which gives information on a comparator group of companies. 
As noted earlier, having reviewed the salary trend over the past few years, the Committee noted a drift towards and below lower quartile 
salary levels amongst the executives and sought to address an element of this trend with salary increases marginally higher than inﬂation. 
The Committee does not expect to make such adjustments each year, but periodically as appropriate. 
Basic salaries are reviewed in February of each year with increases, as appropriate, taking effect from 1 April. Executive Directors’ contracts 
of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual bonus payments
During the year the Committee carefully assessed existing incentive arrangements and determined that incentive levels are appropriately set. 
The Committee established the economic value added (EVA) objectives that must be met for each ﬁnancial year if a cash bonus is to be paid. 
In setting appropriate bonus parameters the Committee determined that bonuses of approximately 60% of salary are payable on the 
achievement of targeted levels of growth. The maximum performance-related bonus that can be paid is 100% of basic annual salary.
For the Chief Executive and Finance Director, bonuses are calculated as above but based on Group proﬁt exceeding a target calculated from 
the proﬁts for the three preceding ﬁnancial years after charging cost of capital, including the cost of acquisitions.
In the case of a Divisional Chief Executive a bonus is earned if the proﬁt of the Division for which they are responsible exceeds a target 
calculated from the proﬁts of the three preceding ﬁnancial years. The proﬁts calculated for this purpose regard each Division as a standalone 
group of companies charging it with the cost of capital it utilises including the cost of acquisitions.
Executive Director bonus payments for 2013 totalled £834,000 versus £725,000 in the prior year reﬂecting the Group’s performance in terms 
of reported proﬁt, EVA and the relative contributions of organic and acquisition growth.
This performance-related bonus plan, which applies to executive Directors and Divisional Chief Executives, is reviewed annually by the 
Committee and approved by the Board.

Value Added (EVA) 
for each year
The elements of the EVA calculation performed for bonus purposes reinforce the Group’s business model as outlined on page 1 1. The proﬁt 
for the year is a function of the extent to which the Company has achieved both its organic growth target and its success in identifying 
appropriate acquisition targets in current and past years. Ensuring that the cost of funding acquisitions is reﬂected in the bonus model means 
that executives share the beneﬁt of an acquisition that outperforms expectations, but equally bears the cost of overpaying for an acquisition – 
all in their bonus. Equally, good or poor management of working capital is reﬂected in the ﬁnal EVA and impacts on the bonus earned in a year. 
As the EVA for each year is utilised for a further three years in the comparator calculations, executives cannot ignore the medium-term 
interests of the Group without the potential for an adverse impact on their capacity to earn a bonus.
Transitional provisions exist for divisional restructuring to ensure Divisional Chief Executives remain appropriately incentivised. Subsidiary 
directors participate in bonus arrangements similar to those established for senior executives.

76 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Performance share plan (PSP)
The Directors have long believed that share plans are an excellent way to provide motivation and align the longer-term interests of senior 
management with those of shareholders. The Committee, recognising the need to assess and evaluate such incentives, adopted a 
performance share plan following shareholder approval at the 2005 Annual General Meeting. This PSP replaced the existing share option 
plans in respect of future share awards. The Committee has responsibility for supervising the PSP and the grants under its terms.
How the PSP works
Performance criteria determine the amount to be granted and, after three years, the amount to vest as illustrated below:
Stages Award criteria Award assessment Vesting criteria Final shares vested
Process Performance criteria determine the 
number of shares to be granted out 
of a Maximum Award level. Primary 
emphasis is placed upon the 
attainment of personal strategic 
objectives coupled with ﬁnancial and 
operational success.
The assessment of the 
individual’s achievement of 
their objectives establishes 
the proportion of the 
Maximum Award that an 
individual is granted (the 
Actual Award in the table 
below).
50% of the amount granted is subject 
to TSR growth relative to the FTSE 250, 
excluding ﬁnancial companies, over the 
three-year vesting period. 
50% of the amount granted is subject 
to ROTIC performance over each of 
the three years.
Awards vest on a sliding 
scale, as set out in the PSP 
vesting table below. 
Timeline Criteria set one year prior to grant. Assessment occurs 
immediately prior to grant.

The Committee believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the interests of the Company’s shareholders. It therefore 
decided that the principal measures of those interests should be Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Return on Total Invested Capital 
(ROTIC).

The Committee recognised that the Group’s improving performance 
in respect of its absolute ROTIC percentage metric merited a 
recalibration of the performance target at which full vesting of the 
ROTIC element is achieved. To that end, the Committee determined 
that full vesting would now occur at a ROTIC performance of 17%
for awards made in 2012 and after.

Vested awards are satisﬁed in shares with sufﬁcient shares being sold to meet tax and social costs owing, at the recipient’s direction, and the 
net balance of shares transferred to the individual.
Awards lapse if they do not vest on the third anniversary of their award.
Current vesting expectations for awards made in 2010, 201 1 and 2012 range from 47% to 99%.

Awards vest after three years on a sliding scale, as set out above, subject to the Company’s relative TSR performance against the FTSE 250, 
excluding ﬁnancial companies, combined with a measure based upon an absolute ROTIC. 
The Plan contains provisions permitting share option grants, restricted share awards and performance share awards. To date, the Committee 
has used the PSP only to award both approved and unapproved performance shares.
Share option plans
The 1999 share option plan provided for the grant of two categories of option both of which are subject to performance criteria. No further 
grants may be made from this plan which has been replaced by the PSP approved by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting. The 
granting of options was spread over the life of the plan.
Dilution
The total dilution effect under these various discretionary share plans is less than 5%.
The Company does not operate any long-term incentive plans other than the share plans described above. No signiﬁcant amendments are 
proposed to be made to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a Director to share options or performance share awards. 
Pension arrangements
Except as noted below, the executive Directors participate in the appropriate section of the Halma Group Pension Plan (the Plan). This section 
is a funded ﬁnal salary occupational pension plan registered with HM Revenue & Customs, which provides a maximum pension of two-thirds 
of ﬁnal pensionable salary after 25 or more years’ service at normal pension age (60). Up to 5 April 2006, ﬁnal pensionable salary was the 
greatest salary of the last three complete tax years immediately before retirement or leaving service. From 6 April 201 1, ﬁnal pensionable salary 
was capped at £139, 185 and is increased annually thereafter by CPI (currently £149,644).
Bonuses and other ﬂuctuating emoluments and beneﬁts-in-kind are not pensionable nor subject to any pension accrued supplement. The 
Plan also provides for life cover of three times salary, pensions in the event of early retirement through ill-health and dependants’ pensions of 
one-half of the member’s prospective pension.
Early retirement pensions, currently possible from age 55 with the consent of the Company and the Trustees of the Plan, are subject to 
actuarial reduction. Pensions in payment increase by 3% per annum for service up to 5 April 1997 , by price inﬂation (subject to a maximum of 
5%) through to 31 March 2007 and 3% thereafter.
The ﬁve-year graph to the left shows the Company’s TSR 
performance over the ﬁve years to 30 March 2013 as compared to 
the FTSE 250 and the FTSE 350 Electronic & Electrical Equipment 
sector indices. Over the period indicated, the Company’s TSR was 
312% compared to 161% for the FTSE 250 and 270% for the FTSE 
350 Electronic & Electrical Equipment sector.
At the commencement of the ﬁve-year period depicted in the graph, 
the Halma plc ordinary share price was 191.5p and the total of 
dividends paid in the year ended 29 March 2008 was 7 .33p per 
share. The Halma plc ordinary share price at 30 March 2013 was 
518.0p and the total of dividends paid in the year then ended was 
10.01p per share.

78 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Whilst pension beneﬁts are accruing, executive Directors receive pension supplements to compensate them for the fact that their pension 
accrual entitlement under the Halma Group Pension Plan deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements is limited by a pensionable salary cap introduced from 
6 April 2006. The Company introduced a pensionable salary cap in order to address changes affecting the Plan made in the Pension Act 
2006. Without the introduction of such a cap, there would, effectively, have been no beneﬁt limits. This could have resulted in beneﬁts in 
excess of prescribed levels with some individuals suffering penal rates of tax and potentially causing a limitation on the tax deductibility of 
employer contributions. The Company obtained external advice regarding the changes to the Plan and executive pension arrangements and 
required each affected executive to obtain independent advice prior to implementing the changes. These changes reduce the Plan’s future 
liabilities and their associated funding risk.
Prior to receiving pension payments, to the extent that an executive’s current salary exceeds the Plan salary cap, the Company compensates 
him at an annual rate of 26% of the excess. In April 2006, Kevin Thompson chose to cease entirely future service accrual in the Halma Group 
Pension Plan in return for the pension supplement on his full salary. 
Beneﬁts-in-kind
The executive Directors receive certain beneﬁts-in-kind, principally use of a car and private medical insurance.
Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indeﬁnite term providing for a maximum of one year’s notice. 
The details of the Directors’ contracts are summarised in the table below:
Date of contract Notice period
Andrew Williams April 2003 one year
Kevin Thompson April 2003 one year
Neil Quinn April 2003 one year
Adam Meyers July 2008 one year
In the event of early termination, no predetermined compensation is provided for in the Directors’ contracts.
Non-executive Directors 
Unless otherwise indicated, all non-executive Directors have a speciﬁc three-year term of engagement which may be renewed for further 
three-year terms if both the Director and the Board agree. Stephen Pettit, who is the Senior Independent Director and is proposed for 
re-election, had his terms of engagement extended for a third three-year term in 2009 and has agreed to remain on the Board for an 
additional period to provide stability and continuity following the appointment of Paul Walker as Chairman Designate. The Board will continue 
to evaluate this mandate annually.
The remuneration of the Chairman and the non-executive Directors is determined by the Committee and the Board based on independent 
surveys of fees paid to the Chairman and the non-executive Directors of similar companies. The Chairman receives a basic fee and the 
non-executive Directors receive a basic fee supplemented by additional fees for membership and/or chairmanship of the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees. 
The contract in respect of Paul Walker’s services provides for termination, by either party, by giving not less than six months’ notice. Stephen 
Pettit, Jane Aikman, Norman Blackwell, Steve Marshall and Daniela Barone Soares have contracts in respect of their non-executive Director 
services which can be terminated, by either party, by giving not less than three months’ notice. Geoff Unwin has tendered his resignation to be 
effective at the close of the Annual General Meeting on 25 July 2013 and the Board has accepted his resignation.
The Chairman’s and the non-executive Directors’ fees, as detailed below, were reviewed by the Board in April 2013 with increases taking 
effect from April 2013.

There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for share options during the ﬁnancial year. 
The closing middle market price of the Company’s ordinary shares on Thursday, 28 March 2013, the last trading day preceding the ﬁnancial 
year end, was 518p per share and the range during the year was 373. 1p to 531.5p.

The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director. Instead they represent a potential liability 
of the pension plan. The transfer values are Gilt related and depend upon the relative standings of the Gilt market at the respective valuation 
dates. The increase in transfer values is predominantly due to the signiﬁcant reduction in the yields available on UK Gilts over the year. The fall 
in yields has been widely attributed to the Bank of England’s continued policy on Quantitative Easing and the Euro crisis. Other factors that 
have increased the transfer values are the impact of any additional service, revaluation in line with inﬂation and any real salary increases as well 
as the anticipated ageing of the members.
These values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN1 1.
Adam Meyers is a member of the US 401k money purchase scheme. Company contributions paid in the year were $12,500 (£7 ,91 1)
(2012: $12,489 (£7 ,806)).

82 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 OTHER STATUTORY
INFORMATION
Activities
Halma plc is a holding company. A list of its principal subsidiary companies and their activities is set out on pages 142 to 145.
Ordinary dividends
The Directors recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 6.37p per share and, if approved, this dividend will be paid on 21 August 2013 to ordinary 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 19 July 2013. Together with the interim dividend of 4.06p per share already paid, this 
will make a total of 10.43p (2012: 9.7 4p) per share for the ﬁnancial year.
Share capital and capital structure
Details of the share capital, together with details of the movements in the share capital during the year, are shown in note 22 to the accounts. 
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to ﬁxed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general 
meetings of the Company.
There are no other classes of share capital. There are no speciﬁc restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, with both 
governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. No person has any special rights of control over the 
Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. 
Rights and obligations of ordinary shares
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and speak at general meetings of the Company and to appoint one or more proxies or, if the 
holder of shares is a corporation, one or more corporate representatives. On a show of hands, each holder of ordinary shares who (being an 
individual) is present in person or (being a corporation) is present by a duly appointed corporate representative, not being himself a member, 
shall have one vote, as shall proxies (unless they are appointed by more than one holder, in which case they may vote both for and against the 
resolution in accordance with the holders’ instructions). On a poll every holder of ordinary shares present in person or by proxy shall have one 
vote for every share of which he is the holder. Electronic and paper proxy appointments and voting instructions must be received not later than 
48 hours before the meeting. A holder of ordinary shares can lose the entitlement to vote at general meetings where that holder has been 
served with a disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company with information concerning interests held in those shares. Except as 
set out above and as permitted under applicable statutes, there are no limitations on voting rights of holders of a given percentage, number of 
votes or deadlines for exercising voting rights.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
The Directors may refuse to register a transfer of a certiﬁcated share that is not fully paid, provided that the refusal does not prevent dealings in 
shares in the Company from taking place on an open and proper basis or where the Company has a lien over that share. The Directors may 
also refuse to register a transfer of a certiﬁcated share unless the instrument of transfer is: (i) lodged, duly stamped (if necessary), at the 
registered ofﬁce of the Company or any other place as the Board may decide accompanied by the certiﬁcate for the share(s) to be transferred 
and/or such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; (ii) in respect of 
only one class of shares; (iii) in favour of a person who is not a minor, infant, bankrupt or a person of unsound mind; or (iv) in favour of not more 
than four persons jointly. 
Transfers of uncertiﬁcated shares must be carried out using CREST and the Directors can refuse to register a transfer of an uncertiﬁcated 
share in accordance with the regulations governing the operation of CREST.
There are no other restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company except certain restrictions which may from time to time be 
imposed by laws and regulations (for example insider trading laws); or where a shareholder with at least a 0.25% interest in the Company’s 
certiﬁcated shares has been served with a disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company with information concerning interests in 
those shares. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Treasury shares
Shares held in treasury do not have voting rights and are not eligible for dividends.
Employee share plans
Details of employee share plans are set out in note 23 to the accounts.
Appointment and replacement of directors
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Companies Act and related legislation. Directors can be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution at a general 
meeting or by the Board. If a Director is appointed by the Board, such Director will hold ofﬁce until the next annual general meeting and shall 
then be eligible for re-election at that meeting. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code all the Directors will retire and, being 
eligible, will offer themselves for re-election at this year’s Annual General Meeting. The Company can remove a Director from ofﬁce, including 
by passing a special resolution or by notice being given by all the other Directors. The Articles themselves may be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders.
Power of Directors
The powers of Directors are described in the Matters Reserved for the Board, copies of which are available on request from the Company 
Secretary, and the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 64 to 69.
Essential contracts and change of control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company, principally bank loan 
agreements and employee share plans.

The only signiﬁcant agreement, in terms of its likely impact on the business of the Group as a whole, containing such provisions is that 
governing the £260m syndicated revolving credit facility which, if within 10 days of a change of control notice to the Loan agent, can result in 
30 days’ notice being given to the Company by any Lender, for all amounts outstanding to that Lender, to be immediately due and payable, at 
which time the commitment of that Lender will be cancelled. If all of the Lenders give this notice the whole facility would be cancelled.
The Group has contractual arrangements with a wide range of suppliers. The Group is not unduly dependent upon contractual arrangements 
with any particular customer. Whilst the loss or disruption to certain of these arrangements could temporarily affect the Group’s business, 
none is considered to be essential. 
The Company’s share plans contain provisions as a result of which options and awards may vest and become exercisable on a change of 
control of the Company in accordance with the rules of the plans.
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and its directors or employees that provide for compensation for loss 
of ofﬁce or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Allotment authority
Under the Companies Act 2006 the Directors may only allot shares if authorised by shareholders to do so. At the Annual General Meeting an 
ordinary resolution will be proposed which, if passed, will authorise the Directors to allot and issue new shares up to an aggregate nominal 
value of £12,500,000 (up to 125,000,000 new ordinary shares of 10p each), being just less than one-third of the issued share capital of the 
Company (excluding treasury shares) as at 12 June 2013 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting).
In accordance with the Directors’ stated intention to seek annual renewal, the authority will expire at the conclusion of the annual general 
meeting of the Company in 2014. Passing this resolution will give the Directors ﬂexibility to act in the best interests of shareholders, when 
opportunities arise, by issuing new shares. 
As at 12 June 2013 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting), the Company had 378,880,622 ordinary 
shares of 10p each in issue of which 1,303,209 were held as treasury shares, which is equal to approximately 0.3% of the issued share capital 
of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at that date.
The Companies Act 2006 also requires that, if the Company issues new shares for cash or sells any treasury shares, it must ﬁrst offer them to 
existing shareholders in proportion to their current holdings. At the Annual General Meeting a special resolution will be proposed which, if 
passed, will authorise the Directors to issue a limited number of shares for cash and/or sell treasury shares without offering them to 
shareholders ﬁrst. The authority is for an aggregate nominal amount of up to 5% of the aggregate nominal value of the issued share capital of 
the Company as at 12 June 2013 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting). The resolution will also modify 
statutory pre-emption rights to deal with legal, regulatory or practical problems that may arise on a rights issue or other pre-emptive offer or 
issue. The authority will expire at the same time as the resolution conferring authority on the Directors to allot shares. The Directors consider 
this authority necessary in order to give them ﬂexibility to deal with opportunities as they arise, subject to the restrictions contained in the 
resolution. There are no present plans to issue shares, except under share plans previously approved in general meeting.
Directors
The names of the Directors of the Company who served throughout the year including brief biographies, are set out on pages 60 and 61.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has entered into deeds of indemnity with each of the current Directors, which remain in force at the date of this report. These 
are qualifying third-party indemnity provisions for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006.
Purchase of the Company’s own shares
The Company was authorised at the 2012 Annual General Meeting to purchase up to 37 ,800,000 of its own 10p ordinary shares in the 
market. This authority expires at the end of the 2013 Annual General Meeting. In accordance with the Directors’ stated intention to seek annual 
renewal, a special resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to renew this authority, until the end of next year’s annual general 
meeting, in respect of up to 37 ,700,000 ordinary shares, which is approximately 10% of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding 
treasury shares) as at 12 June 2013 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting). The Directors consider it 
desirable that the possibility of making such purchases, under appropriate circumstances, is available. Their present intention is that the 
shares purchased under the authority will be held in treasury for future cancellation, sale for cash or transfer for the purposes of, or pursuant 
to, an employee share plan, although in the light of circumstances at the time it may be decided to cancel them immediately on repurchase. 
The effect of any cancellation would be to reduce the number of shares in issue. For most purposes, while held in treasury, shares are treated 
as if they have been cancelled (for example, they carry no voting rights and do not rank for dividends).
Following approval of the Performance Share Plan (PSP) at the 2005 Annual General Meeting, the Directors made, and intend to continue to 
make, routine purchases of Halma shares in the market for holding in treasury until required for vesting under the PSP . In the year to 30 March 
2013, 1,296,006 shares, with a nominal value of £129,600.60, which is 0.3% of the Company’s issued share capital as at 12 June 2013 (the 
latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting), were purchased in the market for treasury. Otherwise, the Directors 
have no present intention of using this authority. In reaching a decision to purchase shares, the Directors will take into account the Company’s 
cash resources, capital requirements and the effect of any purchase on the Company’s earnings per share. It is anticipated that renewal of the 
authority will be requested at subsequent annual general meetings. 
As at 12 June 2013, which is the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Meeting, options were outstanding to subscribe 
for a total number of 1,261,444 ordinary shares, or 0.3% of the Company’s issued share capital. If the proposed authority were to be used in 
full and all of the repurchased shares were cancelled (but the Company’s issued share capital otherwise remained unaltered), the total number 
of options to subscribe for ordinary shares at that date would represent approximately 0.4% of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding 
treasury shares).
84 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Supplier payment policy

• the Director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in ofﬁce as auditor and a resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Governance  60-86 DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the ﬁnancial statements; and
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
In preparing the Group ﬁnancial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs are insufﬁcient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge: 
• the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant ﬁnancial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF HALMA PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of Halma plc for the 52 week period ended 30 March 2013 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure, the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Reconciliation of Net Cash Flow 
to Movement in Net Debt and the related notes 1 to 31. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently  
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 March 2013 and of its profit for the 52 week period  
then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared  
is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ Statement contained within Corporate Governance in relation to going concern; 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and 
• certain elements of the report to the shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Halma plc for the 52 week period ended  
30 March 2013 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF
CHANGES IN EQUITY 
 
Treasury shares are ordinary shares in Halma plc purchased by the Company and held to fulfil the Company’s obligations under the 
performance share plan. At 30 March 2013 the number of treasury shares held was 1,143,209 (2012: 1,404,269) and their market value was 
£5,921,823 (2012: £5,344,648). The net movement of treasury shares of £35,000 (2012: £447,000) comprises the purchase of treasury 
shares of £5,525,000 (2012: £3,985,000) offset by the transfer to Other reserves of £5,560,000 (2012: £4,432,000). 
The Hedging and translation reserve is used to record differences arising from the retranslation of the financial statements of foreign 
operations and the portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments that are deemed to be an 
effective hedge. Other than a net charge of £247,000 (2012: income of £127,000), all amounts at year end relate to translation 
movements. 
The Capital redemption reserve was created on repurchase and cancellation of the Company’s own shares. The Other reserves 
represent the provision for the value of the equity-settled share option plans and performance share plan.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted for use in 
the European Union (EU) and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS legislation and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
that are applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations issued and effective at the time of preparing 
these accounts. 
The principal Group accounting policies are explained below and have been applied consistently throughout the years ended  
30 March 2013 and 31 March 2012 other than those noted below. 
The Group accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as described below under the heading 
‘Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting’. 
New standards and interpretations 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations that are potentially relevant to 
the Group and which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had 
not yet been adopted by the EU): 
• Amendments to IAS 19 “Employee benefits” 
• IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments: Classification and measurement” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2015.  
• IAS 12 “Income Taxes – Limited Scope Amendment”  
• IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial Statements”  
• IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements”  
• IFRS 12 “Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities”  
• IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”  
• IAS 27 (amended) “Separate Financial Statements”  
• IAS 28 (amended) “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”  
• IAS 1 (amended) “Presentation of Items in Other Comprehensive Income”  
• Annual improvements to IFRSs: 2009-2011 Cycle  
• IAS 32 (amended) “Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”  
• IFRS 7 (amended) “Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”  
• IFRS 10 (amended), IFRS 12 (amended) and IAS 27 (amended) – “Investment Entities”  
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact  
on the financial statements of the Group, except for the following: 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which will introduce a number of changes in the presentation of financial instruments;  
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ which will impact the measurement of fair value of certain assets and liabilities;  
IAS 1 ‘Amendments to presentation of Other Comprehensive Income’ which will impact the presentation of financial statements. This 
will impact the presentation of various items within the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income by requiring the separation of items 
that will later be reclassified through the Consolidated Income Statement from those that will never pass through the Consolidated 
Income Statement; and  
IAS 19 (as revised in June 2011) 'Employee Benefits' will be adopted by the Group for the financial year commencing 31 March 2013. 
The interest cost and expected return on defined-benefit pension scheme assets used in the previous version of IAS 19 are replaced 
with a 'net interest' amount, which is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Furthermore, 
IAS 19 (revised) also introduces more extensive disclosures in the presentation of the defined benefit cost, including the separate 
disclosure of the scheme’s administrative expenses. 
If IAS 19 (revised) had been applied to these financial statements, the profit for the year would have been approximately £2 million 
lower. Its adoption for the year to 29 March 2014 is expected to reduce the profit similarly by approximately £2 million. To aid 
comparison, in the 29 March 2014 Financial Statements, the 30 March 2013 comparatives will be restated as if IAS 19 (revised) 
had applied. 
Going concern 
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a high level of confidence that despite the current economic 
uncertainty the company has the necessary liquid resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due and will be able to sustain its 
business model, strategy and operations and remain solvent for the foreseeable future. Thus, the directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing these financial statements. Further detail is contained on page 69. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgments 
The preparation of Group accounts in conformity with IFRS requires the Directors to make judgments, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

  Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 93 
The following four areas of key estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgment have been identified as having significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year: 
Goodwill impairment 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash generating units (CGUs) to which goodwill 
has been allocated. In turn, the value in use calculation involves an estimation of the present value of future cash flows of CGUs. The 
future cash flows are based on annual budgets, as approved by the Board, to which the management’s expectation of market-share 
and long-term growth rates are applied. The present value is then calculated based on management’s judgment of future discount 
rates. The Board reviews these key assumptions (market-share, long-term growth rates, and discount rates) and the sensitivity 
analysis around these assumptions. Further details are provided in note 11.  
Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities 
Determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation requires judgment in respect of the assumptions used to calculate 
present values. These include future mortality, discount rate, inflation and salary increases. Management makes these judgments in 
consultation with an independent actuary. Details of the judgments made in calculating these transactions are disclosed in note 28.  
Intangible assets 
IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’ requires that goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised and included in 
intangible assets. IFRS 3 (revised) also requires the identification of other intangible assets at acquisition. The assumptions involved in 
valuing these intangible assets require the use of estimates and judgements which may differ from the actual outcome. These 
estimates and judgements cover future growth rates, expected inflation rates and the discount rate used. 
Contingent consideration 
Determining the value of contingent consideration recognised as part of the acquisition of subsidiaries requires assumptions to 
determine the expected performance of the acquired business and the amount of contingent consideration that will therefore become 
payable. Initial estimates of expected performance are made by the Directors responsible for completing the acquisition and form a 
key component of the financial due diligence that takes place prior to completion. Subsequent measurement of contingent 
consideration is based on the Directors’ appraisal of the acquired business’s performance in the post-acquisition period with any 
required adjustments to the amount payable recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as required under IFRS 3. Further 
details are provided in note 24.  
Basis of consolidation 
The Group accounts include the accounts of Halma plc and its subsidiary companies made up to 30 March 2013, adjusted to 
eliminate intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses. The results of subsidiary companies acquired or discontinued are 
included from the month of their acquisition or to the month of their discontinuation. 
Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control 
is transferred to the Group. The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: 
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus 
• the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less 
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. Any 
contingent purchase consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent purchase consideration 
is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair 
value of the contingent purchase consideration are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
For acquisitions between 4 April 2004 (the date from which the financial statements were reported under IFRS) and 2 April 2010, 
goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition, including acquisition costs and the fair value of the net 
identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment. 
Goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill therefore includes non-identified intangible 
assets including business processes, buyer-specific synergies, know-how and workforce-related industry-specific knowledge and 
technical skills. Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions would be recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement. On 
closure or disposal of an acquired business, goodwill would be taken into account in determining the profit or loss on closure or 
disposal.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONTINUED 
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ to acquisitions prior to 4 April 2004 in its 
consolidated accounts. As a result, the net book value of goodwill recognised as an intangible asset under UK GAAP at 3 April 2004 
was brought forward unadjusted as the cost of goodwill recognised under IFRS at 4 April 2004 subject to impairment testing on that 
date; and goodwill that was written off to reserves prior to 28 March 1998 under UK GAAP will not be taken into account in 
determining the profit or loss on disposal or closure of previously acquired businesses from 4 April 2004 onwards. 
Investments in associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not in control or joint control over those policies. 
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of 
accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s 
share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of 
the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net 
investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the associate. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date 
of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for 
impairment as part of that investment. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values of the 
identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in profit or loss in the period of 
acquisition.  
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate 
provision is made for impairment.  
Other intangible assets 
(a) Product development costs 
Research expenditure is written off in the financial year in which it is incurred. 
Development expenditure is written off in the financial year in which it is incurred, unless it relates to the development of a new or 
substantially improved product, is incurred after the technical feasibility and economic viability of the product has been proven and the 
decision to complete the development has been taken, and can be measured reliably. Such expenditure is capitalised as an intangible 
asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost and is amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis 
over its estimated economic life of three years. 
(b) Acquired intangible assets 
An intangible resource acquired with a subsidiary undertaking is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired 
business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value  
can be measured reliably. Acquired intangible assets, comprising trademarks and customer relationships, are amortised through  
the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives of between three and 10 years. 
(c) Computer software 
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset, and 
is amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over its estimated economic life of between three 
and five years. 
(d) Other intangibles 
Other intangibles are amortised through the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic 
lives of between three and five years. 
Impairment of non-current assets 
All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. 
Additionally, goodwill and capitalised development expenditure relating to a product that is not yet in full production are subject to an 
annual impairment test. 
An impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement to the extent that an asset’s carrying value exceeds its 
recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the asset’s net realisable value and its value in use. An asset’s value in use 
represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or from the cash generating unit to which 
it relates. The present value is calculated using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset concerned. 
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in the 
estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not 
exceed its carrying amount had no impairment loss been recognised in previous periods. Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are 
not reversed.

Segmental reporting 
An operating segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in business activities from which it may earn 
revenues and incur expenses, and whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Chief 
Executive Officer) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which 
discrete financial information is available. 
Reportable segments are operating segments that either meet the thresholds and conditions set out in IFRS 8 or are considered  
by the Board to be appropriately designated as reportable segments. Segment result represents operating profits and includes  
an allocation of head office expenses. Segment result excludes tax and financing items. Segment assets comprise goodwill, other 
intangible assets, property, plant and equipment (excluding land and buildings), inventories, trade and other receivables. Segment 
liabilities comprise trade and other payables, provisions and other payables. Unallocated items represent land and buildings, corporate 
and deferred taxation balances, defined benefit scheme liabilities, contingent purchase consideration, all components of net 
cash/borrowings and derivative financial instruments. 
Foreign currencies 
The Group presents its accounts in Sterling. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates 
prevailing at that date. Any gain or loss arising from subsequent exchange rate movements is included as an exchange gain or loss in 
the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Net assets of overseas subsidiary companies are expressed in Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year, 
and trading results and cash flows at the average rates of exchange for the financial year. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a 
foreign business is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and is translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the financial 
year. Exchange gains or losses arising on these translations are taken to the Hedging and translation reserve within Shareholders’ 
funds. 
In the event that an overseas subsidiary is disposed of or closed, the profit or loss on disposal or closure will be determined  
after taking into account the cumulative translation difference held within the Hedging and translation reserve attributable to  
that subsidiary. As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected to deem the Hedging and translation to be £nil at 4 April 2004. 
Accordingly, the profit or loss on disposal or closure of foreign subsidiaries will not include any currency translation differences  
which arose before 4 April 2004. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk using forward exchange 
contracts. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 26. 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit and loss (held for trading) unless they are in a designated 
hedge relationship. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to 
their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, unless the 
derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the Consolidated Income 
Statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable 
forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedges), or hedges of net investments in 
foreign operations.  
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a 
financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is 
more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current 
assets or current liabilities. 
Cash flow hedge accounting 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments as cash flow hedges.  
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged 
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the 
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument has been or is expected to be 
highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.  
Note 26 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes and the movements in the hedging 
reserve in equity. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in 
Other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion as a result of being over hedged is recognised 
immediately in Consolidated Income Statement.  
Amounts previously recognised in Other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to the Consolidated 
Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. However, when the 
forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses 
previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial 
asset or non-financial liability.  
    
 
96 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONTINUED 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in Other comprehensive income at 
that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised, when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised, in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.  
Net investment hedge accounting 
The Group uses Swiss Franc denominated borrowings as a hedge against the translation exposure on the Group’s net investment in 
overseas companies. Where the hedge is fully effective at hedging the variability in the net assets of such companies caused by 
changes in exchange rates, the changes in value of the borrowings are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and 
accumulated in the Hedging and translation reserve. The ineffective part of any change in value caused by changes in exchange rates 
is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Revenue 
Revenue represents sales, less returns, by subsidiary companies to external customers excluding value added tax and other sales 
related taxes. Transactions are recorded as revenue when the delivery of products or performance of services takes place in 
accordance with the contracted terms of sale.  
Revenue on long term contracts is recognised while the contracts are in progress. Revenue is recognised proportionally to the stage 
of completion of the contract, based on the fair value of goods and services provided to date, taking into account the sign-off of 
milestone delivery by customers. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is 
recognised as an expense immediately. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less provisions for impairment and depreciation which, with the exception of 
freehold land which is not depreciated, is provided on a straight-line basis over each asset’s estimated economic life. The principal 
annual rates used for this purpose are: 
Leases 
Leases that confer rights and obligations similar to those that attach to owned assets are classified as finance leases, of which the 
Group has none. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease rentals, and any incentives receivable, are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term. 
Pensions 
The Group makes contributions to various pension schemes, covering the majority of its employees. 
For defined benefit schemes, the asset or liability recorded in the balance sheet is the difference between the fair value of the 
scheme’s assets and the present value of the defined obligation at that date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated separately for 
each scheme on an annual basis by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and are taken to Other comprehensive income. 
Current and past service costs, along with the impact of any settlements or curtailments, are charged to the Consolidated Income 
Statement. Interest on pension plans’ liabilities are recognised within finance expense and the expected return on the schemes’ 
assets are recognised within finance income in the Consolidated Income Statement. 
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement when they fall due. 
Employee share schemes 
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s share incentive plan, the share option plans and the 
performance share plan. 
(a) Share incentive plan 
Awards of shares under the share incentive plan are made to qualifying employees depending on salary and service criteria. The 
shares awarded under this plan are purchased in the market by the plan’s trustees at the time of the award, and are then held in trust 
for a minimum of three years. The costs of this plan are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the three-year vesting 
periods of the awards. 
 
Freehold property 2%
Leasehold properties: 
Long leases (more than 50 years unexpired) 2%
Short leases (less than 50 years unexpired) Period of lease

(b) Share option plans 
All grants of options under the 1999 company share option plan are equity settled, and so, as permitted by IFRS 1, the provisions of 
IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payment’ have been applied only to options awarded on or after 7 November 2002 which had not vested at 3 
April 2005. 
The fair value of awards under this plan has been measured at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model and will not  
be subsequently remeasured. The fair value is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the 
expected vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will ultimately vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-
based vesting conditions. The corresponding credit is to Shareholders’ funds. 
No further awards will be made under the share option plan. 
(c) Performance share plan 
On 3 August 2005 the share option plan was replaced by the performance share plan. 
Awards under this plan are partly equity-settled and partly cash-settled, and are subject to both market based and non-market based 
vesting criteria.  
The fair value of the equity-settled portion at the date of grant is established by using an appropriate simulation method to reflect  
the likelihood of market-based performance conditions being met. The fair value is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with appropriate adjustments being made during this period to reflect expected and actual 
forfeitures arising from the non-market based performance conditions only. The corresponding credit is to Shareholders’ funds. 
For the cash-settled portion, a liability equal to the portion of the services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at 
each balance sheet date. 
Inventories 
Inventories and work in progress are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated either on a ‘first in,  
first out’ or an average cost basis and includes direct materials and the appropriate proportion of production and other overheads 
considered by the Directors to be attributable to bringing the inventories to their location and condition at the year end. Net realisable 
value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to complete and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and 
distribution. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of the cash flows.  
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable 
is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable  
can be measured reliably. 
Operating profit 
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs but before the share of results of associates, investment income and 
finance costs. 
Taxation 
Taxation comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in Shareholders’ funds, in which case it too is recognised in Shareholders’ funds. Current tax is the 
expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or subsequently enacted at the balance sheet date, 
along with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method, apart from the 
following differences which are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities 
that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent they will probably 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates and laws, which are expected to apply in the period when 
the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that recovery is probable. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, deposits with an initial maturity of less than three months, and bank overdrafts 
that are repayable on demand.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
1 Segmental analysis 
Sector analysis 
The Group has four main reportable segments (Process Safety, Infrastructure Safety, Medical and Environmental & Analysis), 
which are defined by markets rather than product type. Each segment includes businesses with similar operating and marketing 
characteristics. These segments are consistent with the internal reporting as reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer.  
In the current year the reportable segments have been revised to provide greater understanding of the Group’s activities. 
The main change from the prior year is separating the former Health & Analysis sector into two sectors, namely the Medical 
and Environmental & Analysis sectors. This separation reflects the Group’s growing presence in the medical devices market, 
in particular in ophthalmology and blood pressure monitoring. The Process Safety and Infrastructure Safety sectors, (formerly named 
Industrial Safety and Infrastructure Sensors respectively) are unchanged. Prior year results have been restated to reflect 
the revised reportable segments. 
Segment revenue and results 
Inter-segmental sales are charged at prevailing market prices and have not been disclosed separately by segment as they are  
not considered material. The Group does not analyse revenue by product group and has no material revenue derived from the 
rendering of services. 
* Acquisition costs comprise transactions costs and adjustments to contingent consideration. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies. For acquisitions after  
3 April 2010, acquisition transaction costs and movement on contingent consideration are recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement. Segment profit, before these acquisition costs, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets and the profit on disposal of 
continuing operations is disclosed separately above as this is the measure reported to the Chief Executive Officer for the purpose of 
allocation of resources and assessment of segment performance.

1 Segmental analysis continued 
Segment assets and liabilities, excluding the allocation of goodwill, interests in associates and acquired intangible assets, have been 
disclosed separately above as this is the measure reported to the Chief Executive Officer for the purpose of monitoring segment 
performance and allocating resources between segments. Other unallocated assets include land and buildings and tax assets, and 
unallocated liabilities include contingent purchase consideration, retirement benefit provisions and tax liabilities. 
Other segment information 
Non-current asset additions comprise acquired and purchased goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.  
There were no impairment losses incurred during the year (2012: £nil). 
Geographical information 
The Group’s revenue from external customers (by location of customer) and its non-current assets by geographical location are 
detailed below: 
* Formerly Asia Pacific and Australasia. 
Non-current assets comprise goodwill, other intangible assets, investments in associates and property, plant and equipment.  
Information about major customers 
The Group had no revenue from a single customer, which accounts for more than 2% of the Group’s revenue.  
2 Earnings per ordinary share 
Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 377,597,126 shares in issue during the year (net of 
shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares) (2012: 376,926,013). Diluted earnings per ordinary share are 
calculated using the weighted average of 378,009,506 shares (2012: 377,473,142), which includes dilutive potential ordinary shares 
of 412,380 (2012: 547,129). Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated from those exercisable share options where the exercise 
price is less than the average price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year. 
Adjusted earnings are calculated as earnings from continuing operations excluding the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, 
acquisition transaction costs, movement on contingent consideration and profit on disposal of continuing operations after tax. The 
Directors consider that adjusted earnings represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance. A reconciliation of earnings 
and the effect on basic earnings per share figures is as follows:

3 Non-GAAP measures 
The Board uses certain non-GAAP measures to help it effectively monitor the performance of the Group. These measures include 
Return on Capital Employed, Return on Total Invested Capital, Organic growth, Adjusted operating profit and Adjusted operating 
cashflow. 
Return on Capital Employed 
Return on Total Invested Capital 
* Includes goodwill amortised prior to 3 April 2004 and goodwill taken to reserves. 
Organic growth 
Organic growth measures the change in revenue and profit from continuing Group operations. The effect of acquisitions and disposals 
made during the prior financial year, and acquisitions made in the current financial year has been equalised by adjusting the current 
year results for a pro-rated contributions based on their revenues and profits before taxation at the dates of acquisition and disposal. 
The results of disposals made in the prior financial year have been removed from the prior year reported revenue and profit before 
taxation. Organic growth has been calculated as follows: 
* Before amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition transaction costs, movement on contingent consideration and profit on disposal  
of continuing operations.

The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 25 July 2013 and has not been 
included as a liability in these financial statements. 
11 Goodwill  
The Group identifies cash generating units (CGUs) at the operating company level as this represents the lowest level at which cash 
flows are largely independent of other cash flows. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the 
groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
CONTINUED 
11 Goodwill continued 
Following the revision to the Group’s reportable segments described in note 1, goodwill has been re-allocated to ten CGU groupings 
within the new segments. This is to reflect: 
a) the changing composition of the businesses within the Group;  
b) companies increasingly collaborating and sharing resources;  
c)  the evolving markets in which the businesses operate and the long term growth drivers exhibited in those markets; and 
d)  the way that the Directors make decisions about continuing or disposing of lines of business. 
In the prior year goodwill was allocated to 13 CGU groupings. 
In the current year, the Group disposed of both businesses comprising the Asset Monitoring CGU grouping (see note 29), and 
aggregated the Doors, Security and Elevator CGUs into a single CGU grouping. 
Before recognition of any impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 
Goodwill values have been tested for impairment by comparing them against the value in use in perpetuity of the relevant CGUs. The 
value in use calculations were based on projected cash flows, derived from the latest budget approved by the Board, discounted at 
the Group’s pre-tax estimated short-term discount rate to calculate their net present value.  
The re-allocation of goodwill described above did not have an impact on the outcome of impairment testing, which was carried out 
using a methodology consistent with prior periods. 
Key assumptions used in ‘value in use’ calculations 
The calculation of ‘value in use’ is most sensitive in all cases to the following assumptions: 
• Discount rates; 
• Market share during the budget period for the financial year to March 2014; and  
• Growth rates used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period. 
Discount rates are based on estimations of the assumptions that market participants operating in similar sectors to Halma would 
make, using the Group’s economic profile as a starting point and adjusting appropriately. The Directors do not currently expect any 
significant change in the present base discount rate of 10.51% (2012: 10.23%). The base discount rate, which is pre-tax and is based 
on short-term variables, may differ from the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) used in long-term return measures such as 
ROTIC. Discount rates are calculated for each CGU, reflecting the size of each business and specific geographic and industry factors, 
resulting in the impairment testing using discount rates ranging from 9.36% to 14.59% (2012: 10.75% to 12.98%).  
Market share assumptions are important because, as well as the growth rates (as noted below), management assess how each unit’s 
relative position to its competitors might change over the budget period. Management expects each unit’s position to be stable over 
the projected period. 
Growth rate estimates of respectively 3.25% and 2.50% for the first and second year onwards into perpetuity following the budget 
year are based on management estimates keeping in view past performance growth. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions 
Management believes that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value  
of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

14 Associates 
On 25 April 2012, the Group increased its investment in Optomed Oy from 15% to 40% for a cash consideration of Euro 3,894,000 
(£3,187,000) 
In addition to the 40% holding in Optomed Oy, the Group also holds 50% of the equity of PSRM Immobilien AG (PSRM), which it 
acquired as part of the Medicel AG business acquisition. PSRM is treated as an associate, and not a subsidiary, because the party 
holding the remaining 50% is considered to exert more control.  
Both associates have a 31 December year end, although results coterminous with the Group’s year end have been consolidated 
according to the Group’s share of ownership of each associate. 
Details of the Group’s associates held at 30 March 2013 are as follows:

The above is stated net of provision for slow-moving and obsolete stock, movements of which are shown below:

16 Trade and other receivables 
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 
Impairment charges are recorded against the trade receivables which the Group believes may not be recoverable. In the case of trade 
receivables that are past due, management makes an assessment of the risk of non-collection, taking into account factors such as 
previous default experience, any disputes or other factors delaying payment and the risk of bankruptcy or other failure of the customer 
to meet their obligations. For trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historical collection experience, 
management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection. 
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with these items. 
There is no impairment risk identified with regards to prepayments and accrued income or other receivables where no amounts are 
past due. 
The ageing of trade receivables was as follows: 
17 Trade and other payables: falling due within one year 
The £18,480,000 provision for contingent consideration from 2012 was mainly paid in the current year (Medicel AG: £9,990,000 and 
Avo Photonics, Inc.: £7,059,000). The current year provision mainly comprises a transfer from provisions due after one year (Medicel 
AG: £10,410,000) and amounts payable for Accutome, Inc., a current year acquisition, of £3,290,000.

18 Borrowings 
Information concerning the security, currency, interest rates and maturity of the Group’s borrowings is given in note 26. 
19 Provisions 
Provisions are presented as: 
 
* Comprises £317,000 (current) and £108,000 (non-current) provisions, see note 24. 
Dilapidations and empty property provisions 
Dilapidations and empty property provisions exist where the Group has lease contracts under which the unavoidable costs of meeting 
its obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under them. The provisions comprise the 
Directors’ best estimates of future payments: 
a) to restore the fabric of buildings to their original condition where it is a condition of the leases prior to return of the properties; and 
b) on vacant properties, the rental costs of which are not expected to be recoverable from subleasing the properties.  
These commitments cover the period from 2013 to 2028, though they predominantly fall due within five years. 
Product warranty 
Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and 
included within the Group companies’ standard terms and conditions. Warranty commitments cover a period of between one and five 
years and typically apply for a 12-month period. The provision represents the Directors’ best estimate of the Group’s liability based on 
past experience.  
Legal, contractual and other 
Legal, contractual and other comprise mainly amounts reserved against open legal and contractual disputes. The Company has  
on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties. Provisions are 
made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known  
factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent Directors’ best estimate of the likely outcome. The timing of 
utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings 
and negotiations. Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors’ best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations. 
Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these reserves are shown as current. 
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies 
unless the Directors, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings 
may be successful.

20 Trade and other payables: falling due after one year 
The current year provision for contingent consideration mainly comprises £16,135,000, payable as part of the MicroSurgical 
Technology, Inc. acquisition and £3,500,000 due on the ASL Holdings Limited acquisition. The 2012 non-current provision 
(£10,630,000), which principally comprised an amount of £10,410,000 payable as part of the Medicel AG acquisition, was transferred 
to current provisions (note 17) in the current year.

21 Deferred tax continued 
Movement in deferred tax liability: 
The Finance Act 2013, which provides for a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% effective from 1 April 2013, 
was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012. This rate reduction has been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax at the balance 
sheet date. 
The Government intends to enact future reductions in the main tax rate down to 20% by 1 April 2015. As this tax rate was not 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the rate reduction is not yet reflected in these financial statements in accordance with 
IAS 10, as it is a non-adjusting event occurring after the reporting period. 
However, for indicative purposes only, had the UK main corporate tax rate been reduced to 20% the net impact on recognised 
deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 March 2013 would not have been material. 
It is likely that the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries would qualify for the UK dividend exemption such that no UK tax would 
be due upon remitting those earnings to the UK. However, £22,739,000 (2012: £13,561,000) of those earnings may still result in a tax 
liability, principally as a result of the dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate. 
These tax liabilities are not expected to exceed £3,025,000 (2012: £2,025,000) of which only £315,000 has been provided as the 
Group is able to control the timing of the dividends. It is not expected that further amounts will crystallise in the foreseeable future. 
Temporary timing differences in connection with interests in associates are insignificant. 
At 30 March 2013 the Group had unused capital tax losses of £550,000 (2012: £574,000) for which no deferred tax asset has been 
recognised. 
22 Share capital 
The number of ordinary shares in issue at 30 March 2013 was 378,880,622 (2012: 378,555,028), including treasury shares of 
1,143,209 (2012: 1,404,269). 
Changes during the year in the issued ordinary share capital were as follows: 
The total consideration received in cash in respect of share options exercised amounted to £453,000. 
At 30 March 2013 options in respect of 1,261,444 (2012: 2,160,900) ordinary shares remained outstanding. Further details of these 
are given in note 23 to the accounts. 
At the date of these accounts, the number of ordinary shares in issue was 378,880,622 including treasury shares of 1,303,209.

23 Share-based payments 
The total cost recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of share-based payment schemes (the ‘employee share 
plans’) was as follows: 
The Group has recorded liabilities of £386,000 (2012: £432,000) in respect of the cash settled portion of the awards granted under 
the performance share plan. 
Share incentive plan 
Shares awarded under this Plan are purchased in the market by the Plan’s trustees at the time of the award and are held in trust until 
their transfer to qualifying employees, which is conditional upon completion of three years’ service. The costs of providing this Plan are 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the three-year vesting period. 
Share option plans 
The Group has outstanding issued options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company under a share option plan, approved by 
shareholders in 1999. This share option plan provided for the grant of two categories of option, both of which are subject to 
performance criteria. No further awards have been made under the Company share option plan since 3 August 2005. All options 
lapse if not exercised within 10 years from the date of grant. Options in respect of 1,261,444 ordinary shares remained outstanding at 
30 March 2013. Options over 325,594 ordinary shares were exercised in the year and options over a further 573,862 ordinary shares 
lapsed in the year. 
The weighted average option price of the 332,711 exercisable options at the end of the year was 140.6p; the remaining 928,733 
options, which are not yet exercisable, have a weighted average option price of 138.8p. 
Performance share plan 
The performance share plan was approved by shareholders on 3 August 2005 and replaced the previous share option plans from 
which no further grants can be made. 
Awards made under this Plan vest after three years on a sliding scale subject to the Group’s relative Total Shareholder Return against 
the FTSE250 excluding financial companies, combined with an absolute Return on Total Invested Capital measure. Awards which do 
not vest on the third anniversary of their award will lapse. 
A summary of the movements in share awards granted under the performance share plan is as follows: 
The weighted average share price at the date of awards vesting during the year was 407.1p (2012: 369.4p). 
The performance shares outstanding at 30 March 2013 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.4 years (2012: 1.3 
years). 
The fair value of these awards was calculated using an appropriate simulation method to reflect the likelihood of the market-based 
performance conditions, which attach to half of the award, being met, using the following assumptions: 
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years.

24 Acquisitions  
The Group made six acquisitions during the year. Below are summaries of the assets and liabilities acquired and the purchase 
consideration of: 
a) the total of all acquisitions and adjustments to prior year acquisitions; 
b) the six acquisitions, namely Sensorex Corporation, Accutome, Inc., SunTech Medical Group Limited, MicroSurgical Technology, 
Inc., Thinketron Precision Equipment Company Limited and ASL Holdings Limited. 
c) the one acquisition made since the balance sheet date, namely Talentum Developments Limited. 
(A) Total of all acquisitions and adjustments to prior year acquisitions 
Due to their contractual dates, the fair value of receivables acquired (shown above) approximates to the gross contractual amounts 
receivable. The amount of gross contractual receivables not expected to be recovered is immaterial.  
There are no material contingent liabilities recognised in accordance with paragraph 23 of IFRS 3 (revised). 
£68,613,000 of the goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
Together, the six acquisitions contributed £41,310,000 of revenue and £7,429,000 of profit after tax for the period ended 30 March 
2013. If these acquisitions had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated the Group’s reported revenue and profit 
after tax would have been £24,860,000 and £4,324,000 higher respectively. 
Adjustments were made to the book values of the net assets of the companies acquired to reflect their provisional fair values to the 
Group. Acquired inventories were valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value adopting Group bases and any liabilities for 
warranties relating to past trading were recognised. Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition were included 
and accounting policies were aligned with those of the Group where appropriate. 
There were no adjustments to prior year acquisitions.

Analysis of cash outflow in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement 
* Of the £15,771,000 (2012: £5,411,000) contingent purchase consideration payment £15,771,000 (2012: £5,411,000) had been provided in the prior year’s financial 
statements. 
(Bi) Sensorex Corporation  
On 2 April 2012, the Group acquired the trade and assets of Sensorex Corporation (Sensorex) for US$38,003,000. Sensorex, based 
in California, USA, manufactures electrochemical sensors for water analysis applications.  
Sensorex forms part of the Environmental & Analysis sector and was acquired for its range of sensors and associated accessories, 
which are incorporated by OEMs manufacturing single and multi-parameter probes and instruments for monitoring water quality,  
a market that is forecast to see continued growth. The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the 
assets acquired is represented by customer-related intangibles of £9,998,000 and technological know-how intangibles of £2,691,000 
with residual goodwill arising of £9,739,000. The goodwill represents: 
a) the value of the acquired workforce; 
b) potential synergies with other Halma companies within the Water market, especially the hubs in China and India; and 
c) the ability to exploit the Group’s existing distribution arrangements, particularly outside the USA. 
There are no contingent consideration payment arrangements.  
The Sensorex acquisition contributed £7,781,000 of revenue and £2,466,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 30 March 2013.

(Bii) Accutome, Inc. 
On 2 April 2012, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Accutome, Inc. (Accutome) for US$17,995,000 
(US$20,298,000 including repayment of US$2,303,000 bank loans). Accutome, based in Pennsylvania, USA, with a wholly owned 
subsidiary located in the Netherlands, designs, manufactures and sells surgical and diagnostic instruments and a variety of 
pharmaceuticals for the ophthalmic marketplace.  
Accutome is best known for its leading ultrasound diagnostic equipment (used prior to cataract surgery and to diagnose certain eye 
conditions) and for its surgical instrumentation, featuring its leading diamond bladed surgical knives. Accutome forms part of the 
Medical sector and was acquired to further expand Halma’s footprint in ophthalmic diagnostic and surgical instrumentation. The 
excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is represented by supplier arrangement 
intangibles of £2,102,000, customer-related intangibles of £2,861,000 and brand intangibles of £1,201,000 with residual goodwill 
arising of £8,912,000. The goodwill represents: 
a) the value of the acquired workforce; 
b) the ability to exploit Accutome’s distribution arrangements; 
c) potential synergies with other Halma companies within the ophthalmic market; and 
d) the ability to exploit the Group’s existing distribution arrangements, particularly outside North America. 
Contingent consideration of between US$nil and US$5,000,000 is payable dependent on the profits of the acquired business for the 
period up to September 2013. The Directors’ initial estimate that contingent consideration of US$5,000,000 will be paid, remains 
unchanged as at 30 March 2013. 
The Accutome acquisition contributed £13,420,000 of revenue and £1,444,000 of profit after tax for the year ended  
30 March 2013.

(Biii) SunTech Medical Group Limited 
On 31 May 2012 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of the SunTech Medical Group Limited (SunTech), which is 
primarily based in the USA, UK and China. The initial cash consideration of US$51,000,000 was adjustable based on the final level of 
agreed working capital, which was later determined to be $1,556,000.  
The initial cash consideration to be paid of £1,811,000 in the above table was paid in full on 10 May 2013. This amount was included 
in Group cash and liabilities at the balance sheet date. 
SunTech forms part of the Medical sector and is a pre-eminent supplier of clinical grade non-invasive blood pressure monitoring 
products and technologies. The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is 
represented by customer-related intangibles of £6,103,000, technological know-how intangibles of £3,641,000 and brand intangibles 
of £2,842,000 with residual goodwill arising of £19,270,000. The goodwill represents: 
a) the value of the acquired workforce; and  
b) potential synergies with other Halma companies within the blood pressure monitoring market. 
Contingent consideration of between US$nil and US$6,000,000 was payable dependent on the profits of the acquired business  
for the 12 months to December 2012. On 30 January 2013 the Directors’ estimate of US$6,000,000 (£3,810,000 at the prevailing 
exchange rate) was paid in full.

(Biv) MicroSurgical Technology, Inc. 
On 18 December 2012, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of MicroSurgical Technology, Inc. (MST). MST, based in 
Redmond, USA, designs, manufactures and markets ophthalmic surgical products, focusing on single-use devices used in cataract 
surgery. MST forms part of the Medical sector and was acquired to give Halma’s Medical businesses access to additional 
technologies and manufacturing processes. The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets 
acquired is represented by customer related intangibles of £15,570,000, brand intangibles of £2,090,000 and technological know-
how intangibles of £5,335,000 with residual goodwill arising of £24,341,000. The goodwill represents:  
a) the engineering expertise of the acquired workforce; 
b) the opportunity to leverage this expertise across all Halma’s Medical businesses; and  
c) the ability to exploit the Group’s existing customer base. 
The initial consideration was US$57,430,000 (US$59,000,000 including repayment of US$1,570,000 bank loans), followed by 
contingent consideration payable on or around May 2014 and May 2015 of between US$nil and US$25,000,000 in the first year and 
US$nil and US$30,000,000 in the second year, dependent on the profits of the acquired business for the period up to March 2014 
and March 2015 respectively. The total contingent consideration payable for both years is subject to a cap of US$43,000,000. The 
Directors’ best estimate of the likely overall payment is US$25,000,000 and this amount has been included at fair value in the 
summary above.  
Initial cash consideration to be paid relates to a working capital adjustment of £68,000 (US$110,000) based on the closing net assets 
of the acquired business. 
The MST acquisition contributed £4,167,000 of revenue and £696,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 30 March 2013.

(Bv) Thinketron Precision Equipment Company Limited (and its main trading subsidiary, Baoding Longer Precision Pump 
Co., Ltd) 
On 23 January 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of the holding company, Thinketron Precision Equipment 
Company Limited, and its subsidiaries Baoding Longer Precision Pump Co., Ltd. and Langer Instruments Corporation, (Longer Pump, 
collectively). Longer Pump, based primarily in Baoding, China, manufactures and markets peristaltic, syringe and gear pumps used in 
laboratory, medical and industrial applications. Longer Pump forms part of the Medical sector and was acquired to give Halma’s 
businesses in this sector access to local market knowledge and technical resources. The excess of the fair value of the consideration 
paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is represented by customer related intangibles of £5,554,000, brand intangibles of 
£1,620,000, technological know-how intangibles of £1,258,000 with residual goodwill arising of £13,851,000. The goodwill 
represents:  
a) the engineering expertise of the acquired workforce;  
b) the opportunity to leverage this expertise across all of Halma’s Medical businesses; and  
c) the ability to exploit the Group’s existing customer base through increased access to, and presence in, a dynamic region. 
The initial consideration was RMB 241,954,000 with no further consideration payable. 
The Longer Pump acquisition contributed £915,000 of revenue and £270,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 30 March 2013.

(Bvi) ASL Holdings Limited 
On 14 March 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of ASL Holdings Limited (ASL). ASL, based in Northampton, 
UK, designs and manufactures machine-to-machine (M2M) communication products which are incorporated into SMART meters for 
remote data monitoring and a range of other applications in the utility, transport and retail sectors. ASL forms part of the 
Environmental & Analysis sector and was acquired to compliment and strengthen Halma’s existing Environmental & Analysis 
businesses. The excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the assets acquired is represented by customer 
related intangibles of £6,204,000 with residual goodwill arising of £6,046,000. The goodwill represents:  
a) the technical expertise of the acquired workforce; 
b) the opportunity to leverage this expertise across some of Halma’s businesses; and  
c) the ability to exploit the Group’s existing customer base. 
The initial consideration was £6,365,000, followed by contingent consideration payable in two tranches on or around May 2014 and 
May 2015 of between £nil and £2,000,000, and £nil and £1,500,000 respectively, dependent on the sales growth of the acquired 
business for the years ending March 2014 and March 2015. The fair value of contingent consideration at the balance sheet date is 
based on the assumption that the full value will be payable at the end of each year, which represents the Directors’ best estimate of 
the likely outcome taking into account the proximity of the acquisition to the year end.  
The ASL acquisition contributed £296,000 of revenue and £17,000 of loss after tax for the year ended 30 March 2013.

Since the balance sheet date, the Group has made one further acquisition.  
(C) Talentum 
Due to the proximity of the acquisition dates to the date of approval of the Annual Report, it is only practicable to provide provisional 
summaries of the details of one acquisition made since the balance sheet date.  
On 11 April 2013 the Group acquired Talentum Developments Limited (Talentum). The initial cash consideration of £2,590,000 for the 
share capital is adjustable based on the final level of agreed working capital and cash at closing. Deferred consideration of £250,000 
is payable on or around April 2014 subject to the seller providing certain pre-agreed technical information and know-how to the 
Group. Talentum forms part of the Infrastructure Safety sector and specialises in the design and manufacture of flame detector 
products for a range of industries, which protect property from the risk of fire. Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the date 
of approval of the Annual Report, it is impracticable to provide further information.

26 Financial instruments 
Policy 
The Group’s treasury policies seek to minimise financial risks and to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Group’s operations and strategic 
plans. No complex derivative financial instruments are used, and no trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are 
undertaken. Where the Group does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal 
operations and its financing. Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and, in certain geographical locations, bank 
borrowings. Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments. It is exposed to a 
lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of 
these risks and these policies are summarised below. The Group’s policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the 
financial year. 
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the bases of recognition income and expenses) for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are 
disclosed in the Accounting policies note.  
Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, 
which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity 
holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity. 
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning subsidiaries 
located in foreign countries. 
The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling. This gives rise to translational currency risk, 
where the Sterling value of profits earned by the Group’s foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength of Sterling relative to their 
operating (or ‘functional’) currencies. The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, 
particularly against the US Dollar and Euro. The Group also has transactional currency exposures. These arise on sales or purchases 
by operating companies in currencies other than the companies’ operating (or ‘functional’) currency. Significant sales and purchases 
are matched where possible and a proportion of the net exposure is hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts. 
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations in the USA and EU, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, 
Singapore, Switzerland, China and India. As a result, the Group’s balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries’ 
exchange rates. Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings. These 
currency exposures are reviewed regularly.  
Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits. Where bank borrowings are used to finance 
operations they tend to be short term with floating interest rates. Borrowings used to provide longer term funding are drawn on the 
Group’s loan facilities and have fixed interest rates with maturities of not more than one year. 
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss 
from defaults. Credit ratings are supplied by independent agencies where available, and if not available, the Group uses other publicly 
available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers. The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of 
its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved 
counterparties. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed regularly. 
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. Ongoing credit 
evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is 
purchased.  
The carrying amount of trade, tax and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and cash of £183,653,000 (2012: 
£160,736,000) represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

Liquidity risk 
On 20 October 2011, the Group signed a new unsecured five-year revolving credit facility for £260m. This replaced the previous 
£165m facility which was due to expire in February 2013. This facility is the main source of long-term funding for the Group to October 
2016, and is with a syndicate of five banks. 
The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic 
location.  
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks. For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies 
utilise local bank overdrafts. These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility. 
Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically ‘on demand’ and as such uncommitted. Overdraft facilities are typically 
renewed annually. 
Currency exposures 
Translational exposures 
It is estimated, by reference to the Group’s US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the value of the US 
Dollar relative to Sterling would have had a £464,000 (2012: £353,000) impact on the Group’s reported profit before tax; and a one 
per cent change in the value of the Euro relative to the Sterling would have had a £186,000 (2012: £227,000) impact on the Group’s 
profit before tax for the year ended 30 March 2013. 
Transactional exposures  
The Group has net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional 
currency of the underlying company. These comprise cash and overdrafts as well as certain trade receivable and payable balances. 
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement as a result of movement in exchange rates. The exposures are predominantly Euro and US Dollar. Group policy is 
for a significant portion of foreign currency exposures, including sales and purchases, to be hedged by forward foreign exchange 
contracts in the company in which the transaction is recorded.  
Interest rate risk profile 
The Group’s financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents which totalled 
£1,703,000 at 30 March 2013 (2012: £4,006,000). These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of £2,000 (2012: £4,002,000), 
and Euro, US Dollar and Renminbi deposits of £1,701,000 (2012: £4,000) which are placed on local money markets and earn interest 
at market rates. Cash balances of £48,020,000 (2012: £41,299,000) earn interest at local market rates. 
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts, a loan note and certain 
unsecured loans, which totalled £160,013,000 at 30 March 2013 (2012: £64,014,000). All bank loans and the loan note bear interest 
at floating rates or fixed rates where the fixed period is typically no more than three months. Interest rates are based on the LIBOR of 
the currency in which the liabilities arise plus a small margin. Bank overdrafts bear interest at local base rates. 
At 30 March 2013 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would reduce the Group’s profit 
before tax by £1,281,000 (2012: £892,000).  
Maturity of financial liabilities 
With the exception of the contingent purchase consideration, other payables, provisions and borrowings due after one year, all  
of the Group’s financial liabilities mature in one year or less or on demand. The total of the contractual contingent purchase 
consideration due after one year includes £7,030,000 (2012: £10,452,000) due between one and two years, and the balance of 
£12,626,000 (2012: £178,000) due between two and five years. Other creditors due after more than one year include £1,231,000 
(2012: £1,017,000) due between one and two years, £1,126,000 (2012: £1,088,000) due between two and five years, with the 
balance of £636,000 (2012: £653,000) due after more than five years.

Borrowing facilities 
The Group’s principal source of long-term funding is its unsecured five-year £260m revolving credit facility, which expires in 
October 2016. 
Short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts. These overdraft facilities 
are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year  
or less. 
The Group’s undrawn committed facilities available at 30 March 2013 were £112,371,000 (2012: £205,361,000) of which £7,237,000 
(2012: £9,375,000) mature within one year and £105,134,000 (2012: £195,986,000) between two and five years. 
UK companies have cross-guaranteed £17,025,000 (2012: £17,370,000) of overdraft facilities of which £nil (2012: £nil) was drawn. 
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities 
As at 30 March 2013 and 31 March 2012 there were no significant differences between the book value and fair value (as determined 
by market value) of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. 
The fair value of floating and fixed rate borrowings approximate to the carrying value because interest rates are reset to market rates 
at intervals of less than one year.  
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using readily available 
market data and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.

Hedging
As explained previously, the Group’s policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward 
currency contracts. These instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is typically £nil, and subsequent changes in fair value 
are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement, unless hedge accounted. 
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at the year end, which mostly mature within one year 
and therefore the cash flows and resulting effect on profit and loss are expected to occur within the next 12 months: 
The fair values of the forward contracts are disclosed as a £256,000 (2012: £469,000) asset and £796,000 (2012: £126,000) liability 
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
Any movements in the fair values of the contracts are recognised in equity until the hedge transaction occurs, when gains/losses are 
recycled to finance income or finance expense.  
There was no ineffectiveness arising with regards to forward contracts in a designated cash flow hedge.  
With the exception of currency exposures, the disclosures in this note exclude short-term receivables and payables.

Market risk 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Group enters into 
derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including: 
• forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the export of goods to and from the USA, mainland 
Europe and the UK; and 
• foreign exchange loans to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Group’s investment in foreign operations which 
have the Euro and Swiss Franc as their functional currencies. 
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis as described below.  
There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to market risks or in the manner in which these risks are managed and 
measured.  
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the USA (US Dollar currency) and the currency of Mainland Europe (Euro currency).  
The carrying amount of the Group’s Euro and US Dollar denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date 
are as follows: 
If Sterling increased by 10% against the US Dollar and the Euro, profits before taxation and other equity would decrease as follows: 
The profit sensitivity arises mainly from the translation of overseas profits earned during the year. 10% is the sensitivity rate which 
management assesses to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s profit sensitivity has increased 
against the US Dollar because more of the Group’s profits are earned in this currency.  
27 Commitments 
Capital commitments 
Capital expenditure authorised and contracted at 30 March 2013 but not recognised in these accounts amounts to £1,117,000

Commitments under operating leases 
The Group has entered into commercial leases on properties and other equipment. The former expire between April 2013 and 
November 2028 and the latter between April 2013 and January 2016. Only certain property agreements contain an option for renewal 
at rental prices based on market prices at the time of exercise.

28 Retirement benefits 
Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The Halma Group Pension Plan and the 
Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds. Both of 
these sections were closed to new entrants during 2002/03 and a defined contribution section was established within the Halma 
Group Pension Plan. Defined contribution schemes are mainly adopted in overseas subsidiaries. 
Defined contribution schemes 
The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was £3,658,000 (2012: 
£2,877,000) and represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans. The 
assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees. Where there are employees 
who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the ancillary contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the 
amount of forfeited contributions. 
Defined benefit schemes 
The Group operates defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees of its UK subsidiaries. Under the schemes, the employees are 
entitled to retirement benefits of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement age of 60, for members of 
the Executive Board, and 65, for all other qualifying employees. No other post-retirement benefits are provided. The schemes are 
funded schemes. 
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Halma Group Pension Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
was carried out at 1 December 2011 by Mr Adrian Gibbons, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method. Mr 
Gibbons also carried out the 1 April 2012 actuarial valuation of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan on the same basis. 
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected 
earnings. The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is an actuarial measure of the present value for service already rendered but 
differs from the projected unit credit method in that it includes no assumptions for future salary increases. At the balance sheet date 
the gross accumulated benefit obligation was £223m.  
An alternative method of valuation is a solvency basis, often estimated using the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date 
with a suitable insurance company. This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the scheme liabilities at the 
balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the scheme. The Group estimates that this would 
amount to £370m (2012: £315m). 
Mortality assumptions: 
Investigations have been carried out within the past three years into the mortality experience of the Group’s defined benefit schemes. 
These investigations concluded that the current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for future improvements in mortality 
rates. The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are:

Both the Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan have a baseline mortality assumption for 2013, 
2012 and 2011 derived from the SN03 tables. To reflect population characteristics a one year age deduction has been adopted for 
Halma but no adjustment was made for Apollo. From 2013, a long-term improvement rate of 1.25% per annum 
was incorporated. 
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below: 
Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: 
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure. 
The actual return on scheme assets was £17.4m (2012: £7.7m). 
The cumulative amount of actuarial losses recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure 
since the date of transition to IFRSs is £47m (2012: £25m). 
The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the Group’s obligations in respect of its defined benefit retirement benefit 
schemes is as follows:

Movements in the fair value of scheme assets were as follows: 
The net movement on actuarial gains and losses was as follows: 
The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date were as follows: 
The overall expected rate of return is a weighted average. 
In July 2010, the UK government announced that CPI should be used as the basis for statutory minimum pension increases.  
The impact of the change to CPI (from RPI) for the UK plan, where the pension rules mandate inflation according to the deemed 
statutory index, was a credit to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure of £nil (2012: £1.0m). 
In conjunction with the trustees, the Group conducts asset-liability reviews for its defined benefit pension scheme. The results  
of these reviews are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the 
structure of the liabilities of the scheme. They are also used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment 
performance and risk of a significant increase in the defined benefit deficit by providing information used to determine the scheme’s 
investment strategy.  
As a consequence, the Group is progressively giving more emphasis to a closer return matching of scheme assets and liabilities, both 
to ensure the long-term security of our defined benefit commitment and to reduce earnings and balance sheet volatility.

The five-year history of experience adjustments was as follows. 
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the year ending 29 March 2014 is £9.3m. 
The levels of contributions are based on the current service cost and the expected future cash flows of the defined benefit 
scheme. The Group estimates the scheme liabilities on average to fall due over 20 and 27 years, respectively, for the 
Halma and Apollo plans. 
29 Disposal of business 
On 22 August 2012, the Group disposed of two businesses within its Process Safety sector, Tritech Holdings Limited and its 
subsidiary Tritech International Limited (together known as “Tritech”), for an initial cash consideration of £18,900,000. A further 
£839,000 was received in October 2012 in respect of cash and working capital held in the business at the time of sale. In addition, 
£2,100,000 is retained in escrow and will be released to Halma on the anniversary of the transaction subject to any valid 
warranty/indemnity claims being made by the purchaser. The Directors estimate that the entire £2,100,000 will be received. The profit 
on disposal is estimated to be £8,070,000, being the total £21,839,000 consideration above less £1,435,000 of transaction costs (of 
which £86,000 related to a prior year disposal), £8,009,000 of goodwill and £4,325,000 of net assets.  
The cash inflow in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement of £19,608,000 comprises £19,739,000 initial consideration for Tritech and 
£1,500,000 released from escrow for the prior year disposal of Volumatic Limited less £1,435,000 of transaction costs and £196,000 
cash held by the disposed business. The profit on disposal of £3,543,000 million and cash inflow of £3,554,000 in the  
52 weeks to 31 March 2012 related entirely to the disposal of Volumatic Limited on 30 March 2012.  
Tritech and Volumatic Limited have not been separately disclosed as discontinued operations as defined by IFRS 5 due to their nature 
and size. 
30 Events after the balance sheet date 
On 11 April 2013 the Group acquired Talentum Developments Limited (Talentum). The initial cash consideration of £2,590,000 for the 
share capital is adjustable based on the final level of agreed working capital and cash at closing. Contingent consideration of 
£250,000 is payable on or around April 2014 subject to the seller providing certain pre-agreed technical information and know-how to 
the Group. Talentum forms part of the Infrastructure Safety sector and specialises in the design and manufacture of flame detector 
products for a range of industries, which protect property from the risk of fire. Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the date 
of approval of the Annual Report, it is impracticable to provide further information.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF HALMA PLC
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Halma plc for the 52 week period ended 30 March 2013 which comprise 
the parent company Balance Sheet and the related notes C1 to C12. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the Financial Statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on Financial Statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 March 2013; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the parent company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in  
our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Halma plc for the 52 week period ended 30 March 2013.

ACCOUNTS 
C1 Accounting Policies 
Basis of preparation 
The separate Company financial statements are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 and have been prepared on  
the historical cost basis and comply with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law. The principal Company 
accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding years and are described below. 
Related parties 
The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ from disclosing transactions with other members of the 
Halma Group. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currency are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates prevailing at that date. Any gain or loss arising 
from subsequent exchange rate movements is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account. 
Share-based payments 
The Company has adopted FRS 20 and the accounting policies followed are in all material respects the same as the Group’s policy 
under IFRS 2. This policy is shown on pages 96 and 97. 
Investments 
Investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment. 
Fixed assets and depreciation 
Fixed assets are stated at cost less provisions for impairment and depreciation which, with the exception of freehold land which is not 
depreciated, is provided on all fixed assets on the straight-line method, each item being written off over its estimated life. The principal 
annual rates used for this purpose are: 
Leases 
The costs of operating leases of property and other assets are charged on a straight line basis over the life of the lease. 
Pensions
The Company makes contributions to defined contribution pension plans, which are charged against profits when they become 
payable. The Company also participates in a Group-wide defined benefit pension plan. This plan is operated on a basis that does not 
enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities, and in accordance with FRS 17 the Company 
accounts for its contributions to the plan as if it was a defined contribution plan. 
Taxation
Taxation comprises current and deferred tax. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable, on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
The Company provides for tax deferred because of timing differences between profits as computed for taxation purposes and profits 
as stated in the accounts, on an undiscounted basis. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in 
the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are only recognised if recovery is considered more likely than not 
on the basis of all available evidence. 
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss and are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
  
Freehold property 2%
Plant, equipment and vehicles 8% to 33.3%

NOTES TO THE COMPANY
ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
C5 Debtors 
C6 Borrowings 
On 26 October 2011, the Company signed a new unsecured five-year revolving credit facility for £260 million. This replaced the 
previous £165 million facility which was due to expire in February 2013. Therefore, the facility under which the bank loans are drawn 
expires within two to five years (2012: within two to five years) and at 30 March 2013 £105,134,000 (2012: £195,986,000) remained 
committed and undrawn. 
The bank overdrafts, which are unsecured, at 30 March 2013 and 31 March 2012 were drawn on uncommitted facilities which all 
expire within one year, and were held pursuant to a Group pooling arrangement which offsets them against credit balances in 
subsidiary undertakings. 
The Company is part of an arrangement between UK subsidiaries whereby overdraft facilities of £17,025,000 (2012: £17,370,000) are 
cross-guaranteed. Of these facilities £404,000 (2012: £379,000) was drawn. 
C7 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year 
C8 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year 
The £3,500,000 provision for contingent consideration represents the Directors’ best estimate of amounts payable following the 
Company’s acquisition of ASL Holdings Limited. The £3,500,000 is payable in two tranches on or around May 2014 and May 2015 of 
between £nil and £2,000,000, and £nil and £1,500,000 respectively, dependent on the growth in sales of the acquired business up to 
March 2014 and March 2015.

Investor information 
Visit our website, www.halma.com, for investor information and Company news. In addition to accessing financial data, you can view 
and download Annual and Half Year Reports, analyst presentations, find contact details for Halma senior executives and subsidiary 
companies and access links to Halma subsidiary websites. You can also download our iPad app or subscribe to an 
e-mail news alert service to automatically receive an e-mail when significant announcements are made. 
Shareholding information 
Please contact our registrars, Computershare, directly for all enquiries about your shareholding. Visit their Investor Centre website 
www.investorcentre.co.uk for online information about your shareholding (you will need your shareholder reference number which can 
be found on your share certificate or dividend tax voucher), or telephone the registrars direct using the dedicated telephone number 
for Halma shareholders (+44 (0) 870 707 1046). 
Dividend mandate 
Shareholders can arrange to have their dividends paid directly into their bank or building society account by completing a bank 
mandate form. The advantages to using this service are: the payment is more secure than sending a cheque through the post;  
it avoids the inconvenience of paying in a cheque and there is no risk of lost, stolen or out of date cheques. A mandate form can  
be obtained from Computershare or you will find one on the reverse of the tax voucher of your last dividend payment. 
Dividend reinvestment plan 
The Company operates a dividend reinvestment plan (‘DRIP’) which offers shareholders the option to elect to have their cash 
dividends reinvested in Halma ordinary shares purchased in the market. You can register for the DRIP online by visiting 
Computershare’s Investor Centre website (as above) or by requesting an application form direct from Computershare. Shareholders 
who wish to elect for the DRIP for the forthcoming final dividend, but have not already done so, should return a DRIP application form 
to Computershare no later than 1 August 2013. 
American Depositary Receipts 
The Halma plc American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are traded on the Over The Counter market (OTC) under the symbol HLMLY. 
One ADR represents three Halma plc ordinary shares. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the depositary. If you should have any queries, 
please contact: 
JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., PO Box 64504, St Paul, MN 55164-0854, USA. E-mail: jpmorgan.adr@wellsfargo.com. Telephone 
number for general queries: (800) 990 1135. Telephone number from outside the USA: +1 651 453 2128. 
Electronic communications 
All shareholder communications, including the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts, are made available to shareholders on the 
Halma website and you may opt to receive e-mail notification that documents and information are available to view and download 
rather than to receive paper copies through the post. Using electronic communications helps us to limit the amount of paper we  
use and assists us in reducing our costs. If you would like to sign up for this service, visit Computershare’s Investor Centre website. 
You may change the way you receive communications at any time by contacting Computershare. 
Share dealing facilities 
A low cost telephone dealing service has been arranged with Stocktrade which provides a simple way for buying or selling Halma 
shares. Basic commission is 0.5% up to £10,000, reducing to 0.2% thereafter (subject to a minimum commission of £15). For further 
information please call 0845 601 0995 and quote reference Low Co0198.

01	 	 Ashtead Group plc	 Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 30	 April	 2006 www.ashtead-group.com Chairman’s 
report 
The year saw the Group move  
forward strongly…with underlying  
pre-tax profits of £67.5m just over  
triple last year’s £22.4m
The	 year	 saw	 the	 Group	 move	 forward	 strongly,	 particularly	 in	 the	 United	 States,	 with	 underlying	 pre-tax	 profits	 of	 £67.5m	 just	 over	 triple	 last	 year’s	 £22.4m.	 We	 also	 invested	 heavily	 to	 ensure	 that	 our	 fleet	 age	 remained	 competitive,	 spending	 £220.2m	 in	 the	 year,	 almost	 double	 our	 depreciation	 charge.	 £64.5m	 was	 for	 growth	 with	 the	 balance	 representing	 replacement	 or	 maintenance	 expenditure.	 We	 also	 spent	 $100m	 on	 acquisitions	 in	 the	 US.	 With	 the	 support	 of	 shareholders	 in	 last	 summer’s	 equity	 placing,	 we	 also	 further	 strengthened	 the	 balance	 sheet	 and	 provided	 an	 appropriate	 platform	 from	 which	 to	 execute	 our	 growth	 plans.
Cliff	 Miller	 and	 the	 Sunbelt	 team	 took	 advantage	 of	 the	 strong	 market	 conditions	 in	 the	 US	 to	 deliver	 an	 impressive	 24%	 revenue	 growth	 to	 $818.7m	 (2005:	 $661.1m)	 and	 operating	 profits	 up	 63%	 to	 $175.5m	 (2005:	 $107.9m).	 Whilst	 19%	 of	 the	 revenue	 growth	 was	 same	 store,	 	 we	 also	 welcomed	 to	 the	 Group	 the	 staff	 of	 16	 new	 profit	 centres	 acquired	 during	 the	 year	 in	 the	 Florida,	 Southern	 California,	 Las	 Vegas,	 Indianapolis	 and	 Tennessee	 markets	 as	 well	 as	 Sunbelt’s	 six	 new	 openings.	 The	 acquisitions	 delivered	 an	 excellent	 first	 year	 return.
The	 Board	 was	 also	 pleased	 to	 note	 the	 success	 of	 the	 new	 national	 sales	 force	 structure	 in	 A-Plant	 which	 drove	 a	 rise	 both	 in	 its	 profitability	 and	 rate	 of	 return.	 We	 look	 for	 these	 trends	 to	 continue	 in	 the	 coming	 year.	 Ashtead	 Technology	 also	 delivered	 solid	 growth	 in	 revenues	 and	 profit	 and	 continues	 to	 earn	 the	 highest	 returns	 in	 the	 Group.	 At	 A-Plant	 in	 particular,	 we	 face	 very	 different	 market	 conditions	 to	 those	 which	 prevail	 in	 the	 US	 and	 its	 staff	 and	 management	 are	 to	 be	 congratulated	 on	 the	 progress	 made	 in	 the	 past	 year.
These	 strong	 results	 and	 the	 strengthening	 of	 the	 balance	 sheet	 last	 summer	 enabled	 the	 Board	 to	 announce	 the	 resumption	 of	 dividend	 payments	 last	 December.	 Accordingly	 an	 interim	 dividend	 of	 0.5p	 	 per	 share	 was	 paid	 in	 February	 and	 the	 Board	 is	 recommending	 a	 	 final	 dividend	 of	 1.0p	 per	 share.	 If	 approved	 at	 the	 forthcoming	 Annual	 General	 Meeting,	 this	 will	 be	 paid	 on	 28	 September	 2006	 to	 shareholders	 	 on	 the	 register	 on	 28	 July	 2006.
At	 Board	 level	 we	 saw	 no	 changes	 in	 the	 past	 year.	 However,	 as	 we	 announced	 with	 the	 release	 of	 the	 preliminary	 results	 on	 28	 June	 2006,	 02	 	 Ashtead Group plc	 Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 30	 April	 2006 International	 equipment	 rental George	 Burnett	 will	 be	 retiring	 from	 his	 role	 as	 chief	 executive	 at	 the	 end	 of	 2006.	 George	 co-founded	 Ashtead	 in	 1984	 when	 he	 and	 a	 fellow	 investor	 purchased	 what	 was	 then	 a	 five	 branch	 business	 trading	 in	 	 the	 south-east	 of	 England	 with	 revenues	 of	 £1m.	 George	 has	 been	 instrumental	 in	 all	 the	 key	 steps	 undertaken	 by	 the	 Group	 since	 that	 time.	 Since	 George	 assumed	 the	 role	 of	 Group	 Chief	 Executive	 in	 February	 2000	 he	 has	 successfully	 led	 the	 Group	 through	 the	 US	 economic	 downturn	 of	 2001/2	 and	 the	 turbulent	 times	 which	 followed	 and	 has	 overseen	 the	 recovery	 with	 profits	 now	 at	 record	 levels.	 George	 well	 deserves	 to	 enjoy	 his	 forthcoming	 retirement	 and,	 on	 behalf	 of	 my	 fellow	 directors,	 the	 Company’s	 shareholders	 and	 its	 employees,	 	 I	 would	 like	 to	 thank	 George	 for	 his	 leadership	 in	 developing	 the	 Group	 into	 one	 of	 the	 largest	 equipment	 rental	 businesses	 in	 the	 world	 and	 to	 record	 our	 best	 wishes	 for	 the	 future.
At	 the	 same	 time	 I	 would	 like	 to	 introduce	 our	 new	 Chief	 Executive,	 	 Geoff	 Drabble	 and	 to	 welcome	 him	 to	 his	 new	 role	 in	 the	 Company.	 	 Geoff	 joined	 the	 Board	 in	 2005	 following	 our	 search	 for	 a	 non-executive	 director	 with	 substantial	 experience	 of	 running	 businesses	 in	 the	 US.	 	 He	 is	 currently	 an	 executive	 director	 of	 the	 Laird	 Group	 where	 he	 is	 responsible	 for	 the	 Building	 Products	 division.	 Geoff	 has	 extensive	 experience	 of	 managing	 businesses	 with	 operations	 in	 both	 the	 US	 	 and	 the	 UK	 from	 both	 his	 time	 with	 Laird	 and	 previously	 with	 Black	 &	 Decker.	 We	 are	 certain	 that,	 in	 his	 new	 role,	 Geoff	 will	 bring	 both	 an	 understanding	 and	 continuity	 of	 our	 strategy	 whilst	 also	 providing	 renewed	 focus	 on	 all	 aspects	 of	 the	 Group’s	 operations.	 Geoff	 emerged	 as	 the	 Nomination	 Committee’s	 preferred	 candidate	 after	 an	 extensive	 external	 and	 internal	 search	 and	 we	 are	 delighted	 he	 has	 agreed	 to	 	 join	 Ashtead	 as	 its	 next	 Chief	 Executive.	 Geoff	 will	 be	 available	 to	 start	 	 full	 time	 in	 his	 new	 role	 from	 early	 October	 and	 will	 benefit	 from	 a	 handover	 period	 working	 alongside	 George	 until	 his	 retirement	 at	 the	 	 end	 of	 the	 year.
Amongst	 the	 other	 Board	 members,	 Philip	 Lovegrove	 remained	 on	 the	 Board	 longer	 than	 I	 had	 anticipated	 this	 time	 last	 year.	 Like	 George,	 he	 has	 served	 on	 the	 Company’s	 Board	 since	 1984	 and	 for	 a	 long	 time	 was	 the	 sole	 non-executive.	 As	 a	 member	 of	 the	 FTSE	 250	 the	 Combined	 Code	 requires	 that	 the	 Company	 has	 at	 least	 an	 equal	 number	 of	 independent	 non-executive	 directors	 as	 there	 are	 executive	 directors,	 not	 counting	 myself.	 Your	 Board	 endorses	 these	 principles	 and	 accordingly	 	 is	 initiating	 a	 search	 for	 a	 new	 independent	 non-executive	 to	 replace	 Philip	 (who	 cannot	 be	 classed	 as	 independent	 under	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 Code	 because	 of	 the	 length	 of	 his	 service	 as	 a	 director)	 before	 the	 end	 	 of	 the	 current	 financial	 year.	 I	 therefore	 wish	 to	 record	 the	 Company’s	 thanks	 to	 Philip	 for	 his	 expertise	 and	 advice	 over	 many	 years.
In	 closing,	 I	 should	 like	 to	 thank	 all	 the	 Group’s	 employees	 for	 their	 continuing	 efforts	 on	 behalf	 of	 the	 Company	 in	 the	 past	 demanding	 	 but	 successful	 year.

Measured	 at	 constant	 exchange	 rates,	 to	 eliminate	 currency	 translation	 effects,	 revenue	 grew	 17.8%,	 EBITDA	 before	 04	 	 Ashtead Group plc	 Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 30	 April	 2006 International	 equipment	 rental exceptional	 items	 grew	 28.0%,	 operating	 profit	 before	 exceptional	 items	 grew	 58.6%	 and	 underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 was	 still	 almost	 three	 times	 that	 of	 last	 year.	 These	 improvements	 were	 reflected	 in	 the	 Group’s	 margins.	 EBITDA	 margins	 grew	 from	 32.4%	 to	 35.2%	 and	 operating	 margins	 (before	 exceptional	 items)	 rose	 from	 12.8%	 to	 17.4%.
Sunbelt
In	 the	 year	 to	 30	 April	 2006	 revenue	 grew	 23.8%	 to	 $818.7m.	 This	 was	 achieved	 through	 increased	 investment	 in	 the	 rental	 fleet	 which	 was	 	 on	 average	 11%	 larger	 than	 a	 year	 ago	 and	 by	 significant	 increases	 in	 rental	 rates	 which	 were	 increased	 approximately	 12%	 in	 strong	 market	 conditions.	 Average	 utilisation	 remained	 high	 at	 70%	 (2005:	 69%).	 Revenue	 growth	 was	 broadly	 based	 with	 all	 regions	 and	 all	 major	 product	 areas	 trading	 ahead	 of	 last	 year.	 Last	 summer’s	 hurricanes	 are	 estimated	 to	 have	 added	 around	 2%	 to	 2005/6’s	 revenues.	 In	 a	 strong	 trading	 environment	 where	 US	 non-residential	 construction	 rose	 10.2%	 in	 the	 12	 months	 to	 end	 April,	 according	 to	 figures	 published	 by	 the	 	 US	 Department	 of	 Commerce,	 Sunbelt	 continued	 to	 take	 market	 share.	 Revenues	 from	 house	 builders,	 where	 the	 short	 term	 outlook	 is	 less	 certain,	 accounted	 for	 just	 6%	 of	 Sunbelt’s	 revenues.	 The	 shift	 from	 ownership	 to	 rental	 in	 the	 US	 continued	 with	 the	 rental	 market	 again	 growing	 faster	 than	 its	 key	 customer	 base,	 non-residential	 construction,	 in	 calendar	 2005.
For	 the	 full	 year,	 Sunbelt’s	 operating	 profit	 before	 exceptional	 items	 was	 up	 62.7%	 to	 $175.5m,	 representing	 a	 margin	 of	 21.4%	 (2005:	 16.3%).
Sunbelt	 continued	 to	 invest	 to	 reduce	 the	 age	 of	 its	 rental	 fleet	 and	 	 to	 invest	 for	 growth,	 spending	 $257.9m	 in	 the	 year,	 including	 the	 funding	 of	 six	 new	 greenfield	 stores.	 A	 further	 16	 new	 general	 equipment	 rental	 stores	 were	 acquired	 during	 the	 year	 for	 a	 consideration,	 including	 costs,	 of	 approximately	 $100m.	 The	 acquired	 stores	 were	 all	 immediately	 transferred	 onto	 Sunbelt’s	 point	 of	 sale	 system	 and	 staff	 incentive	 programmes	 and	 began	 trading	 as	 Sunbelt	 stores	 from	 their	 acquisition	 closing	 date.	 The	 financial	 performance	 since	 acquisition	 has	 been	 strongly	 positive.	 In	 August	 Sunbelt	 also	 disposed	 of	 12	 specialist	 scaffold	 stores	 on	 the	 west	 coast	 and	 in	 Texas	 for	 $24.3m	 generating	 	 an	 exceptional	 disposal	 profit	 of	 $5.1m	 (£2.9m).	 The	 new	 stores	 continue	 Sunbelt’s	 strategy	 of	 clustering	 stores	 in	 major	 metropolitan	 markets.	 Sunbelt	 also	 continues	 to	 emphasise	 organic	 growth	 with	 an	 increase	 	 in	 same	 store	 revenues	 for	 the	 year	 of	 19.3%.
In	 the	 fourth	 quarter	 Sunbelt	 delivered	 revenue	 growth	 of	 27.1%	 and	 growth	 in	 operating	 profit	 before	 exceptional	 items	 of	 63.2%.
A-Plant
A-Plant’s	 revenue	 for	 the	 year	 was	 £160.7m	 compared	 to	 £156.3m	 last	 year.	 The	 successful	 restructuring	 of	 A-Plant’s	 sales	 force	 undertaken	 in	 the	 first	 half	 contributed	 to	 a	 significantly	 improved	 performance	 in	 the	 second	 half	 of	 the	 year	 and	 a	 particularly	 strong	 fourth	 quarter	 in	 which	 revenues	 increased	 by	 8%	 to	 £41.8m	 and	 operating	 profit	 by	 47.1%	 to	 £3.9m.	 Rental	 rates,	 average	 fleet	 size	 and	 utilisation	 for	 the	 year	 were	 all	 at	 similar	 levels	 to	 those	 of	 last	 year.	 Revenues	 from	 A-Plant’s	 largest	 150	 customers	 continued	 to	 grow	 and	 represented	 39%	 of	 the	 year’s	 total.
Operating	 expenses	 were	 again	 carefully	 controlled,	 increasing	 by	 just	 3.4%	 before	 depreciation.	 As	 a	 result	 A-Plant’s	 operating	 profit	 for	 the	 year	 grew	 22.0%	 to	 £13.9m	 (2005:	 £11.3m),	 representing	 a	 margin	 of	 8.6%	 (2005:	 7.3%).	 The	 investment	 A-Plant	 makes	 in	 developing	 its	 staff,	 which	 is	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 its	 improving	 performance,	 was	 recognised	 in	 May	 when	 Hire	 Association	 Europe	 (‘HAE’)	 announced	 that	 A-Plant	 had	 won,	 amongst	 competition	 from	 rental	 companies	 across	 Europe,	 HAE’s	 ‘Excellence	 	 in	 Training’	 award.

Over £200m invested in the rental fleet  
with £65m being for growth
Ashtead Technology
Ashtead	 Technology’s	 performance	 continued	 recent	 trends	 with	 revenue	 for	 the	 year	 up	 29.5%	 to	 £16.1m	 (2005:	 £12.4m)	 and	 operating	 profit	 up	 19.9%	 to	 £4.0m	 (2005:	 £3.4m).	 This	 reflects	 increased	 investment	 by	 the	 oil	 majors	 which	 is	 delivering	 higher	 offshore	 exploration	 and	 construction	 activity	 as	 well	 as	 continued	 growth	 in	 Ashtead	 Technology’s	 onshore	 environmental	 business.	 Investment	 	 for	 future	 growth	 included	 a	 significantly	 enlarged	 onshore	 sales	 force	 and	 a	 new	 profit	 centre	 in	 Chicago	 opened	 last	 November.
Exceptional items and fair value remeasurements of  
embedded derivatives
In	 addition	 to	 the	 trading	 results	 discussed	 above,	 operating	 profit	 as	 reported	 in	 the	 consolidated	 income	 statement	 includes	 £13.4m	 of	 	 net	 exceptional	 profits.	 These	 comprise	 the	 £11.3m	 received	 when	 Sunbelt	 settled	 its	 long	 standing	 litigation	 with	 Head	 &	 Engquist	 in	 November	 2005,	 a	 £2.9m	 profit	 on	 disposal	 of	 Sunbelt’s	 12	 scaffold	 stores	 less	 £0.8m	 of	 post	 acquisition	 integration	 costs.	 Included	 	 within	 finance	 costs	 is	 the	 £4.8m	 net	 cost	 of	 last	 summer’s	 capital	 reorganisation,	 mainly	 relating	 to	 the	 12%	 premium	 payable	 on	 the	 £42m	 of	 sterling	 senior	 secured	 notes	 redeemed	 early	 out	 of	 the	 proceeds	 of	 the	 equity	 placing,	 and	 the	 £5.6m	 (2005:	 £9.8m)	 non-cash	 fair	 value	 remeasurements	 of	 embedded	 derivatives	 in	 long	 term	 debt.
Taxation
Overall	 for	 the	 year	 the	 effective	 accounting	 tax	 rate	 on	 the	 underlying	 profit	 was	 31%	 whilst	 the	 cash	 tax	 rate	 on	 the	 same	 basis	 remained	 minimal.	 The	 recent	 increases	 in	 Sunbelt’s	 profitability	 together	 with	 the	 Head	 &	 Engquist	 litigation	 receipt	 means,	 however,	 that	 Sunbelt’s	 US	 federal	 tax	 losses	 have	 now	 been	 fully	 utilised	 and	 that	 consequently	 	 the	 Group’s	 cash	 tax	 rate	 will	 rise	 into	 double	 digits	 next	 year.
Pensions
Funding	 of	 the	 UK	 pension	 plan	 deficit	 as	 announced	 with	 the	 third	 quarter	 results	 was	 completed	 at	 the	 end	 of	 March	 with	 the	 payment	 of	 £17.1m,	 the	 amount	 recommended	 by	 the	 actuary,	 into	 the	 fund.	 As	 a	 result	 the	 Group’s	 pension	 obligations	 are	 now	 fully	 funded.	 Funding	 of	 the	 deficit	 had	 no	 significant	 effect	 on	 the	 Group’s	 income	 statement.
Capital expenditure and net debt
Capital	 expenditure	 in	 the	 year	 was	 £220.2m	 (2005:	 £138.4m)	 of	 which	 £201.8m	 was	 invested	 in	 the	 rental	 fleet.	 £64.5m	 of	 the	 fleet	 expenditure	 was	 for	 growth,	 principally	 in	 Sunbelt,	 with	 the	 remainder	 spent	 to	 replace	 existing	 equipment.	 Disposal	 proceeds	 were	 £50.8m	 (2005:	 £37.6m)	 generating	 a	 profit	 on	 disposal	 of	 £9.1m	 (2005:	 £7.1m).	 As	 indicated	 in	 March,	 capital	 expenditure	 for	 the	 year	 to	 30	 April	 2007	 is	 currently	 expected	 to	 total	 approximately	 £250m.
Net	 debt	 at	 30	 April	 2006	 was	 £493.6m,	 an	 increase	 of	 £11.3m	 since	 	 30	 April	 2005.	 At	 constant	 exchange	 rates	 the	 increase	 over	 the	 year	 was	 £2.5m.

Dividends

All	 three	 of	 our	 businesses	 performed	 well	 in	 the	 past	 year.	 Each	 continues	 to	 benefit	 from	 good	 market	 conditions	 and	 has	 made	 an	 excellent	 start	 to	 the	 new	 financial	 year.
In	 the	 US,	 where	 the	 shift	 from	 ownership	 to	 rental	 continues,	 we	 are	 encouraged	 by	 the	 strength	 of	 the	 non-residential	 construction	 market	 which	 rose	 10%	 in	 the	 12	 months	 to	 April	 2006	 and	 is	 forecast	 to	 grow	 strongly	 for	 at	 least	 the	 next	 two	 years	 and	 by	 Sunbelt’s	 continuing	 gains	 in	 market	 share.	 Revenues	 from	 house	 builders,	 where	 the	 short	 term	 outlook	 is	 less	 certain,	 accounted	 for	 just	 6%	 of	 Sunbelt’s	 revenues	 last	 year.	 The	 restructuring	 of	 A-Plant’s	 sales	 force	 at	 the	 start	 of	 last	 year	 delivered	 benefits	 on	 a	 rising	 scale	 as	 the	 year	 progressed,	 a	 trend	 which	 has	 continued	 into	 our	 new	 financial	 year.
With	 this	 strong,	 broadly-based	 momentum,	 the	 Board	 looks	 forward	 	 to	 reporting	 further	 significant	 progress	 in	 the	 coming	 year.
In	 closing,	 I	 should	 like	 to	 express	 my	 thanks	 to	 everyone	 who	 has	 contributed	 to	 the	 growth	 of	 Ashtead	 Group	 over	 the	 last	 22	 years:	 shareholders,	 suppliers,	 customers	 (without	 whom	 we	 would	 not	 be	 here)	 but	 most	 of	 all	 to	 our	 staff,	 past	 and	 present.	 We	 are	 a	 service	 business	 in	 a	 ‘hard-work’	 industry	 and	 it	 is	 the	 enthusiasm,	 drive	 and	 commitment	 of	 the	 A-Plant,	 Sunbelt	 and	 Ashtead	 Technology	 teams,	 backed	 up	 by	 the	 equally	 capable	 and	 committed	 Ashtead	 Group	 support	 staff,	 that	 makes	 the	 difference.	 My	 appreciation	 and	 best	 wishes	 go	 to	 all	 of	 them.
I	 am	 delighted	 that	 Geoff	 Drabble	 will	 be	 joining	 the	 Group	 in	 an	 executive	 capacity	 in	 October	 and	 very	 much	 look	 forward	 to	 working	 with	 him	 in	 effecting	 a	 seamless	 transition.	 He	 will	 take	 over	 the	 best	 management	 team	 in	 the	 industry	 and	 will	 bring	 both	 a	 sense	 of	 continuity	 and	 fresh	 new	 ideas	 to	 the	 next	 phase	 of	 Ashtead’s	 development.	 I	 wish	 him	 and	 the	 entire	 Board	 every	 success	 in	 taking	 the	 Group	 forward	 to	 what	 I	 am	 sure	 will	 be	 a	 prosperous	 and	 exciting	 future.

for growth
Regular	 re-investment	 in	 our	 rental	 fleet	 sits	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 Ashtead’s	 business	 philosophy	 as	 does	 investing	 for	 growth	 when	 market	 conditions	 allow.
In	 the	 US,	 Sunbelt	 is	 growing	 as	 new	 sites	 are	 established	 	 and	 smaller	 businesses	 are	 acquired.	 2005/6	 has	 seen	 $257.9m	 invested	 in	 Sunbelt’s	 fleet	 and	 six	 new	 greenfield	 stores	 opened.	 The	 year	 also	 saw	 the	 acquisition	 of	 a	 further	 16	 new	 general	 equipment	 rental	 stores	 representing	 an	 investment	 of	 $100m.
A-Plant	 is	 targeting	 a	 more	 mature	 market	 in	 the	 UK	 and	 the	 challenge	 here	 is	 to	 strengthen	 and	 consolidate	 the	 brand.	 	 A-Plant	 is	 well	 established	 in	 the	 market	 and	 within	 the	 industry	 its	 reputation	 continues	 to	 improve.	 Internal	 re-structuring	 has	 helped	 drive	 22%	 profit	 growth	 in	 2005/6	 and	 positioned	 it	 for	 ongoing	 growth.
Ashtead	 Technology	 maintains	 a	 substantial	 position	 within	 its	 specialist	 market.	 The	 significant	 rise	 in	 its	 2005/6	 operating	 profit	 reflects	 both	 the	 increase	 in	 offshore	 activity	 around	 the	 world	 and	 growth	 in	 its	 environmental	 business,	 demonstrating	 its	 ability	 to	 take	 advantage	 of	 market	 strengths.
A-Plant’s	 accommodation	 business	 offers	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 accommodation	 units.

our rental fleet 
The	 quality	 of	 the	 operational	 fleet	 is	 the	 key	 to	 successful	 rental	 operations.	 In	 all	 three	 divisions	 and	 in	 all	 markets	 Ashtead	 is	 committed	 to	 offering	 the	 customer	 high	 	 standards	 of	 equipment.	 Ashtead’s	 strong	 growth	 over	 the	 last	 two	 years,	 taken	 in	 tandem	 with	 the	 Company’s	 financial	 re-structuring,	 allows	 	 for	 a	 significant	 level	 of	 discretion	 in	 fleet	 investment	 decisions.
The	 volume	 and	 pattern	 of	 replacement	 within	 the	 fleet	 can	 be	 used,	 at	 the	 directors’	 discretion,	 to	 manage	 the	 Group’s	 free	 cash	 flow.	 With	 record	 results	 this	 year	 the	 level	 of	 replacement	 investment	 has	 been	 high,	 ensuring	 we	 are	 able	 to	 offer	 our	 customers	 a	 highly	 competitive	 standard	 and	 age	 of	 equipment.	 Also,	 by	 reducing	 fleet	 age	 significantly	 this	 year,	 the	 Company	 has	 the	 option	 to	 be	 flexible	 in	 the	 future.	 Fleet	 age	 at	 30	 April	 2006	 was	 37	 months	 for	 the	 Group,	 38	 months	 for	 Sunbelt	 and	 36	 months	 for	 A-Plant.	 These	 figures	 compare	 to	 the	 average	 depreciable	 life	 of	 the	 equipment	 in	 our	 fleet	 of	 96	 months	 indicating	 the	 flexibility	 available	 to	 us.

opportunities
Sunbelt	 continues	 to	 open	 greenfield	 stores	 but	 during	 the	 	 year	 returned	 to	 acquisitions	 to	 consolidate	 and	 expand	 its	 clusters	 in	 key	 metropolitan	 areas.	 Stores	 acquired	 from	 HSS	 RentX	 consolidated	 the	 Miami	 cluster	 and	 the	 Northridge	 	 and	 Brookstone	 acquisitions	 increased	 Sunbelt’s	 presence	 	 in	 the	 attractive	 Southern	 California	 market.	 They	 have	 	 been	 integrated	 within	 Sunbelt’s	 operations,	 exceeding	 our	 expectations	 post	 acquisition.	 Sunbelt	 intends	 to	 continue	 	 to	 develop	 further	 clusters	 in	 key	 markets.
In	 the	 UK	 an	 estimated	 70%–80%	 of	 equipment	 is	 rented	 rather	 than	 owned.	 Early	 in	 2005/6	 A-Plant	 re-structured	 its	 sales	 operation	 to	 streamline	 and	 increase	 its	 penetration	 of	 the	 market.	 The	 enhanced	 sales	 operation	 which	 secures	 	 and	 services	 our	 larger	 customers	 was	 strengthened	 and	 consolidated	 into	 a	 single	 national	 structure.	 This	 has	 been	 instrumental	 in	 driving	 our	 national	 accounts	 business	 with	 	 the	 top	 150	 customers	 accounting	 for	 39%	 of	 A-Plant’s	 revenue	 in	 the	 year.
Over	 the	 past	 year	 the	 market	 profile	 of	 Ashtead	 Technology	 was	 raised	 further	 as	 it	 successfully	 pursued	 growth	 in	 its	 offshore	 and	 onshore	 markets.	 Ashtead	 Technology	 now	 has	 	 a	 strong	 position	 within	 this	 exciting	 and	 dynamic	 sector	 and	 intends	 to	 use	 that	 advantage	 to	 grow	 as	 its	 markets	 expand.
Ashtead	 Technology	 Rentals	 offers	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 remote	 visual	 inspection	 equipment	 to	 meet	 many	 inspection	 requirements.
10	 	 Ashtead Group plc	 Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 30	 April	 2006 International	 equipment	 rental The trend
to rent
Sunbelt	 is	 riding	 the	 national	 trend	 in	 the	 US	 away	 from	 ownership	 and	 towards	 rental.	 Ashtead	 originally	 identified	 this	 shift	 within	 the	 marketplace	 ten	 years	 or	 more	 ago,	 and	 Sunbelt	 is	 perfectly	 placed	 to	 take	 advantage	 of	 the	 changing	 patterns	 of	 utilisation.
At	 the	 moment,	 an	 estimated	 38%	 of	 construction	 equipment	 is	 rented	 by	 contractors	 but	 this	 is	 expected	 by	 Dan	 Kaplan	 Associates	 to	 grow	 to	 50%	 by	 2010.	 This	 gives	 Sunbelt	 enormous	 scope	 for	 growth	 as	 the	 company’s	 customers	 make	 the	 strategic	 decision	 to	 move	 away	 from	 outright	 ownership	 and	 towards	 rental.	 Sunbelt’s	 objective	 is	 to	 continue	 its	 expansion	 in	 this	 vigorous	 and	 buoyant	 marketplace	 in	 the	 coming	 year.
Sunbelt	 also	 plays	 a	 crucial	 part	 in	 clearing	 and	 reconstruction	 operations	 following	 meteorological	 occurrences	 such	 as	 tornadoes,	 hurricanes	 and	 flooding.	 These	 naturally	 occurring	 events	 are	 a	 weighty	 challenge	 for	 the	 regional	 authorities	 and	 contractors	 charged	 with	 implementing	 both	 emergency	 and	 long-term	 repair	 and	 restoration.	 It	 makes	 no	 sense	 for	 these	 bodies	 to	 own	 the	 essential	 equipment	 outright,	 so	 they	 turn	 to	 rental	 companies	 for	 a	 fast,	 efficient	 and	 professional	 service.	 Sunbelt	 is	 proud	 of	 its	 record	 in	 providing	 its	 equipment	 as	 rapidly	 as	 possible	 to	 help	 assist	 the	 recovery	 from	 such	 natural	 disasters.
Sunbelt	 Rentals	 crews	 respond	 day	 or	 night	 for	 emergency	 equipment	 needs.

Health and Safety
In	 all	 markets	 there	 is	 an	 ever	 greater	 awareness	 of	 health	 	 and	 safety,	 with	 our	 customers	 demanding	 increasing	 levels	 	 of	 support.
In	 the	 US,	 Sunbelt	 offers	 an	 extensive	 online	 library	 of	 safety	 advice,	 and	 has	 also	 initiated	 a	 monthly	 safety	 message	 quiz,	 with	 prizes	 for	 both	 customers	 and	 members	 of	 the	 Sunbelt	 team.	 The	 company	 also	 offers	 training	 to	 customers’	 employees	 with	 qualified	 trainers	 available.	 There	 is	 also	 an	 	 in-house	 national	 training	 centre	 in	 Charlotte,	 North	 Carolina	 which	 provides	 Sunbelt’s	 employees	 with	 training	 of	 the	 highest	 standard.
With	 its	 national	 presence	 and	 established	 IT	 systems,	 A-Plant	 is	 one	 of	 only	 a	 few	 national	 providers	 able	 to	 consistently	 meet	 its	 customers’	 health	 and	 safety	 requirements	 and	 to	 report	 on		 its	 success	 in	 doing	 so.	 A-Plant	 launched	 a	 health	 and	 safety	 awareness	 programme	 amongst	 its	 customers	 during	 the	 	 year	 entitled	 ‘Making	 your	 Safety	 our	 Priority’	 and	 distributed	 over	 100,000	 copies	 throughout	 the	 UK.

employees
The	 strength	 of	 our	 business	 and	 its	 culture	 is	 the	 level	 of	 responsibility	 delegated	 to	 the	 rental	 store	 level.	 The	 rental	 store	 manager	 has	 a	 high	 degree	 of	 autonomy	 to	 manage	 his	 business	 in	 the	 light	 of	 local	 market	 conditions.	 This	 is	 reflected	 in	 the	 monthly	 profit	 share	 programme	 in	 which	 every	 member	 of	 the	 store	 staff	 is	 entitled	 to	 participate	 and	 is	 based	 on	 	 the	 store’s	 month	 to	 month	 performance.	 The	 profit	 share	 programme	 motivates	 employees	 to	 maximise	 returns	 on	 investment	 and	 encourages	 them	 to	 build	 and	 reinforce	 relationships	 with	 our	 customers.	 It	 contributes	 to	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 business	 through	 acting	 as	 an	 incentive	 	 to	 control	 costs,	 optimise	 pricing	 and	 promote	 efficient	 fleet	 management,	 while	 building	 motivated	 cohesive	 teams	 focused	 on	 profitability	 at	 a	 local	 level.	 Profit	 share	 payments	 totalled	 £16.2m	 in	 2005/6,	 representing	 7 .7%	 of	 employee	 remuneration.
In	 addition	 to	 rewarding	 our	 employees	 financially,	 the	 development	 of	 their	 careers	 is	 a	 priority	 and,	 we	 believe,	 an	 important	 way	 of	 maintaining	 employee	 morale	 and	 loyalty.	 Sunbelt	 and	 A-Plant	 maintain	 in-house	 training	 teams	 which,	 during	 2005/6,	 organised	 over	 2,200	 courses	 for	 a	 significant	 number	 of	 employees.
Sunbelt’s	 diesel-driven	 generators	 provide	 emergency	 power	 for	 diverse	 needs.

operations
Ashtead	 is	 committed	 to	 continuing	 Sunbelt’s	 strategy	 of	 clustering	 its	 stores	 in	 key	 markets	 across	 the	 country.	 Sunbelt’s	 209	 outlets	 are	 concentrated	 in	 major	 metropolitan	 areas	 ranging	 from	 Washington,	 DC	 and	 Baltimore	 on	 the	 Atlantic	 Coast	 through	 Miami,	 Tampa	 and	 Orlando	 in	 Florida	 	 to	 Seattle	 on	 the	 west	 coast.
Sunbelt	 concentrates	 on	 expanding	 and	 improving	 both	 its	 profile	 and	 the	 service	 it	 offers	 to	 its	 customers	 within	 these	 large	 metropolitan	 markets.	 In	 so	 doing,	 Sunbelt	 aims	 to	 	 offer	 its	 customers	 a	 complete,	 one-stop	 service	 for	 all	 their	 	 rental	 requirements.
Sunbelt	 also	 actively	 looks	 for	 acquisitions	 in	 pursuit	 of	 this	 strategy.	 For	 the	 most	 part	 these	 will	 be	 smaller,	 traditionally	 family-run	 operations	 in	 key	 locations	 although,	 as	 and	 when	 the	 opportunities	 arise,	 the	 company	 may	 pursue	 larger	 acquisitions	 of	 operators	 who	 fit	 Sunbelt’s	 profile.
The	 US	 economy	 performed	 well	 in	 the	 past	 year	 and	 Sunbelt	 is	 servicing	 one	 of	 the	 most	 solid	 sectors	 of	 that	 economy,	 non-residential	 construction.	 This	 market	 is	 in	 excellent	 shape	 with	 its	 growth	 rate	 forecast	 by	 McGraw-Hill	 Construction	 to	 significantly	 outstrip	 the	 growth	 rate	 of	 the	 national	 economy	 	 in	 2006	 and	 2007.

utilisation
The	 Company’s	 distinctive	 and	 attractive	 green	 livery	 means	 that	 its	 equipment	 is	 easily	 identified,	 and	 its	 quality	 is	 appreciated	 wherever	 it	 is	 found.
However,	 equipment	 which	 is	 sitting	 in	 a	 yard	 or	 a	 showroom	 unused	 is	 not	 earning	 its	 keep.	 A	 key	 objective	 is	 to	 maximise	 the	 use	 of	 all	 items	 of	 equipment.	 This	 objective	 is	 supported	 by	 both	 our	 strategic	 national	 purchasing	 policy	 in	 each	 of	 the	 US	 and	 UK	 and	 by	 the	 local	 knowledge	 of	 customer	 requirements	 	 and	 preferences	 amongst	 our	 regional,	 district	 and	 profit	 	 centre	 managers.
Time	 utilisation	 of	 our	 fleet	 has	 improved	 significantly	 in	 the	 past	 two	 years	 at	 both	 Sunbelt	 and	 A-Plant	 and	 now	 approaches	 peak	 efficiency.
Both	 A-Plant	 and	 Sunbelt	 work	 hard	 to	 assist	 and	 inform	 their	 customers,	 and	 thereby	 ensure	 that	 they	 hire	 the	 most	 appropriate	 equipment	 for	 the	 job	 in	 hand.	 To	 this	 end	 both	 	 have	 public	 internet	 websites,	 which	 are	 easily	 navigated	 	 and	 provide	 technical	 information	 on	 the	 equipment	 in	 the	 	 field.

to health and safety at work and to compliance with the law and the 
requirements of the regulatory bodies in both the UK and the US. A 
copy of the relevant formal statement of the Group’s policy on health 
and safety is on display at profit centres in the UK and the US.
The Group encourages UK employees to become shareholders through 
the SAYE share option scheme. 
Directors and directors’ insurance
Details of the directors of the Company are given on pages 16 and 17. 
Each of the directors as at the date of approval of this report confirms, 
as required by Section 234 of the Companies Act 1985, that to the best 
of their knowledge and belief:
(1) there is no significant information known to the director relevant to 
the audit of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
(2) each director has taken reasonable steps to make himself aware of 
such information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of it.
The Company has maintained insurance throughout the year to cover all 
directors against liabilities in relation to the Company and its subsidiary 
undertakings. 
Policy on payment of suppliers 
Suppliers are paid in accordance with the individual payment terms 
agreed with each of them. The number of Group creditor days at  
30 April 2006 was 57 days (30 April 2005: 74 days) which reflects  
the terms agreed with individual suppliers. There were no trade  
creditors in the Company’s balance sheet at any time during the  
past two years. 19  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.ashtead-group.com
Political and charitable donations 
Charitable donations in the year amounted to £29,914 in total (2005: 
£22,650). No political donations were made in either year. 
Environmental report
The Group, through its equipment purchasing policies, maintenance 
programmes and environmental monitoring practices, endeavours to 
ensure that its trading activities have as little adverse impact on the 
environment as it is possible to achieve. Accordingly, the Group has 
developed environmental management processes which are designed 
to ensure:
compliance with relevant legislation;
removal of potential causes of environmental damage where 
practicable; and
continuous reduction in environmental impact through monitoring 
and corrective action.
The Group’s continued investment in its rental fleet, along with its 
maintenance programmes, minimises both pollution to the atmosphere 
and accidental contamination. The facilities the Group maintains 
throughout its profit centre network are designed to enable waste to be 
disposed of correctly, bulk fuels to be stored safely and fleet cleaning 
and maintenance to be carried out efficiently. 
Group companies have documented procedures at profit centre level  
for fleet maintenance, removal of waste from customers’ sites back to 
company premises for safe disposal as well as contractual arrangements 
for the disposal of all major waste products. 
The Group’s internal operational audit teams measure and monitor 
environmental performance and control measures at profit centres as 
part of their rolling audit programme and report their findings to senior 
operational management. 
Auditors
Deloitte & Touche LLP has indicated its willingness to continue in office 
and in accordance with section 385 of the Companies Act 1985, a 
resolution concerning its re-appointment and authorising the directors 
to fix its remuneration will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Corporate governance report
The revised Combined Code on corporate governance was published  
in July 2003 by the Financial Reporting Council (‘the 2003 FRC Code’) 
following a review of the role and effectiveness of non-executive 
directors by Sir Derek Higgs and a review of audit committees by  
a group led by Sir Robert Smith.
The Company is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate 
governance. The Board recognises that it is accountable to the 
Company’s shareholders for corporate governance and this statement 
describes how the Company has applied the relevant principles of  
the 2003 FRC Code. The Company complied throughout the year  
with the provisions of the 2003 FRC Code on corporate governance.
The Board 
The Company’s Board comprises the non-executive chairman, the  
chief executive, the finance director, the executive heads of Sunbelt  
and A-Plant, the senior independent non-executive director and  
four other non-executive directors. Short biographies of the directors 
are given on pages 16 and 17.
The chairman undertakes leadership of the Board by agreeing Board 
agendas and encourages its effectiveness by the provision of timely, 
accurate and clear information on all aspects of the Group’s business  
to enable the Board to take sound decisions and promote the success 
of the business. The chairman, assisted by other directors, reviews the 
effectiveness of each member of the Board no less than annually and 
he facilitates constructive relationships between the executive and non-
executive directors through both formal and informal meetings.
The chairman ensures that all directors are properly briefed to enable 
them to discharge their duties effectively. All newly appointed directors 
undertake an induction to all parts of the Group’s business. Additionally, 
detailed management accounts are sent monthly to all Board members 
and, in advance of all Board meetings, an agenda and appropriate 
documentation in respect of each item to be discussed is circulated.
The chairman facilitates effective communication with shareholders 
through both the Annual General Meeting and by individual meetings 
with major shareholders to develop an understanding of the views of  
the investors in the business. He also ensures that shareholders have 
access to other directors, including non-executive directors, as 
appropriate.
The chief executive’s role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership of  
the Group within a framework of prudent and effective controls, which 
enables risk to be assessed and managed. The chief executive 
undertakes the leadership and responsibility for the direction and 
management of the day-to-day business and conduct of the Group.  
In doing so, the chief executive’s role includes, but is not restricted to, 
implementing Board decisions, delegating responsibility, and reporting 
to the Board regarding the conduct, activities and performance of the 
Group. The chief executive chairs the formal management meetings 
with the operating divisions of the Group’s business and sets policies 
and direction to maximise returns to shareholders.
All directors are responsible under the law for the proper conduct of  
the Company’s affairs. The directors are also responsible for ensuring 
that the strategies proposed by the executive directors are discussed  
in detail and assessed critically to ensure they conform with the long-
term interests of shareholders and are compatible with the interests  
of employees, customers and suppliers. The Board has reserved  
to itself those matters, which reinforce its control of the Company.  
These include treasury policy, acquisitions and disposals, appointment 
and removal of directors or the company secretary, appointment and 
removal of the auditors and approval of the annual accounts.
Regular reports and briefings are provided to the Board, by the 
executive directors and the company secretary, to ensure the directors 
are suitably briefed to fulfil their roles. The Board normally meets at least 
six times a year and there is contact between meetings to advance the 
Company’s activities. It is the Board’s usual practice to meet at least 
annually at the offices of Sunbelt and A-Plant. The directors also have 
access to the company secretary and are able to seek independent 
advice at the Company’s expense.
The Board’s terms of reference are available for inspection at the Annual 
General Meeting.
All directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first Annual 
General Meeting after their appointment and to re-election thereafter  
at intervals of no more than three years. Non-executive directors are 
appointed for specified terms not exceeding three years and are subject 
to re-election and the provision of the Companies Act relating to the 
removal of a director.
In accordance with the Company’s articles of association, Mr Stenham, 
Mr Robson and Mr Miller will offer themselves for retirement and  
re-election to the Board at the next Annual General Meeting. 
Non-executive directors 
The Board considers that the Company is in compliance with the 
independence provisions of the 2003 FRC Code.
In the recruitment of non-executive directors, it is the Group’s practice  
to utilise the services of an external search consultancy. Before 
appointment, non-executive directors are required to assure the Board  21  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.ashtead-group.com
that they can give the time commitment necessary to fulfil properly  
their duties, both in terms of availability to attend meetings and discuss 
matters on the telephone and meeting preparation time. The non-
executives’ letters of appointment are available for inspection at the 
Annual General Meeting.
The non-executive directors (including the chairman) meet as and  
when required in the absence of the executive directors to discuss and 
appraise the performance of the Board as a whole and the performance 
of the executive directors. In accordance with the FRC Code, the  
non-executive directors, led by the senior independent non-executive 
director, also meet annually in the absence of the chairman to discuss 
and appraise his performance.
Performance evaluation
The performance of the chairman, the chief executive, the Board and its 
committees is evaluated, amongst other things, against their respective 
role profiles and terms of reference. This evaluation was conducted by 
the Board as a whole in the context of a paper submitted by the company 
secretary summarising the key highlights of the year. The executive 
directors are additionally evaluated against the agreed budget for the 
generation of revenue, profit and value to shareholders. 
Board committees
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprised throughout the year Mr Etheridge 
(chairman), Mr Cole and Mr Iceton. In accordance with the 
recommendation of the Smith Committee, the Company’s non-executive 
chairman, Mr Stenham, is not a member of the Audit Committee.  
By invitation, our finance director, Mr Robson, our director of financial 
reporting, Mr Pratt and other directors (including the chairman) normally 
attend the committee’s meetings, as do representatives of our internal 
and external auditors. 
As is required by its terms of reference, the Audit Committee meets  
on at least four occasions each year to review the draft quarterly and 
annual financial statements prior to their publication, to consider the  
key accounting estimates and judgements contained therein and to 
consider reports from both the internal and external auditors which 
includes audit plans and the key findings of their work. The Audit 
Committee also keeps the Group’s accounting policies under review, 
evaluates the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and financial 
reporting policies and is responsible for dealing with any matter brought 
to its attention by the auditors. The Audit Committee also keeps under 
review the effectiveness of both internal and external audit as well as  
the independence of the external auditors including the type of, and 
associated fees for, non-audit services. 
The Audit Committee reviews the nature of any non-audit work to be 
undertaken by Deloitte & Touche LLP and the level of proposed fees to 
ensure their independence is not impaired. The principal non-audit fees for 
the year relate to their work in connection with last year’s share placing and 
open offer, to their reviews of the Group’s quarterly results announcements 
and to their work on the Group’s IFRS implementation project. The Audit 
Committee is satisfied that the nature of work undertaken and the level of 
non-audit fees did not impair their independence.
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference are available for inspection  
at the Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprised throughout the year Mr Cole 
(chairman), Mr Etheridge and Mr Drabble. 
The Remuneration Committee meets as and when required but in any 
event holds a series of meetings during the year to set the compensation 
packages for the executive directors, to establish the terms and conditions 
of the executive directors’ employment and to set remuneration policy 
generally. Mr Stenham and Mr Burnett normally attend the meetings of 
the Committee. The Committee also engages remuneration consultants 
to advise it in its work as and when required.
None of the members of the Remuneration Committee is currently  
or has been at any time one of the Company’s executive directors or  
an employee. None of the executive directors currently serves, or has 
served, as a member of the Board of Directors of any other company, 
which has one or more of its executive directors serving on the 
Company’s Board or Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference are available for 
inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
 
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprised throughout the year Mr Stenham 
(chairman), Mr Burnett, Mr Cole, Mr Etheridge, Mr Lovegrove, Mr Iceton 
and Mr Drabble. The Nomination Committee meets as and when required 
to recommend proposed changes to the structure and composition of 
the Board of Directors. The Nomination Committee met informally on a 
number of occasions throughout the year, usually at the end of Board 
meetings. As there were no proposed changes to the composition of the 
Board of Directors, the Committee did not meet formally during the year. 
The Nomination Committee’s terms of reference are available for 
inspection at the Annual General Meeting. 22  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 International equipment rental

Corporate governance report continued
Finance and Administration Committee
The Finance and Administration Committee comprised Mr Stenham,  
Mr Burnett and Mr Robson throughout the year and is chaired by  
Mr Burnett. The Board of Directors has delegated authority to this 
committee to deal with routine financial and administrative matters 
between Board meetings. The committee meets as necessary to 
perform its role and has a quorum requirement of two members  
with certain matters requiring the presence of Mr Stenham, our  
non-executive chairman, including, for example, the approval of  
material announcements to the London Stock Exchange. 
Internal control 
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s system  
of internal control and confirm they have reviewed its effectiveness.  
In doing so, the Group has taken note of the guidance for directors  
on internal control, Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the 
Combined Code (the Turnbull Guidance).
The Board confirms that there is a process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing significant risks faced by the Group. This process has 
been in place for the full financial year and is ongoing. It is kept under 
regular review by the executive directors and is considered periodically 
by the Board and accords with the Turnbull Guidance.
 
The Board considers that the Group’s internal control system is 
appropriately designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk  
of failure to achieve business objectives. Any such control system, 
however, can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The Group reviews the risks it faces in its business and how these  
risks are managed. These reviews are conducted in conjunction with 
the management teams of each of the Group’s businesses and are 
documented in an annual report. The reviews consider whether any 
matters have arisen since the last report was prepared which might 
indicate omissions or inadequacies in that assessment. They also 
consider whether, as a result of changes in either the internal or external 
environment, any new significant risks have arisen. The executive 
directors reviewed the draft report for 2006, which was then presented 
to, discussed and approved by the Group Board on 21 June 2006.
Before producing the statement on internal control for the annual report 
and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006, the Board reconsidered 
the operational effectiveness of the Group’s internal control systems.  
In particular, through the Audit Committee, it received reports from the 
operational audit teams and considered the status of implementation  
of internal control improvement recommendations made by the  
Group’s internal auditors and our external auditors. The control system 
includes written policies and control procedures, clearly drawn lines  
of accountability and delegation of authority and comprehensive 
reporting and analysis against budgets and latest forecasts. 
In a group of the size, complexity and geographical diversity of Ashtead, 
minor breakdowns in established control procedures can occur. There 
are supporting policies and procedures for investigation and management 
of control breakdowns at any of the Group’s profit centres or elsewhere. 
The Audit Committee also meets with the external auditors at least four 
times a year to discuss the results of their work. 
In relation to internal financial control, the Group’s control and 
monitoring procedures include:
the maintenance and production of accurate and timely financial 
management information, including a monthly profit and loss account 
and selected balance sheet data for each profit centre;
the control of key financial risks through clearly laid down authority 
levels and proper segregation of accounting duties at the Group’s 
accounting support centres;
•
• 23  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.ashtead-group.com
the preparation of a monthly financial report to the Board including 
income statements for the Group and each subsidiary, balance sheet 
and cash flow statement;
the preparation of an annual budget and periodic update forecasts 
which are reviewed by the executive directors and then by the Board;
a programme of rental equipment inventories and full inventory 
counts conducted at each profit centre by equipment type 
independently checked on a sample basis by our operational 
auditors and external auditors;
detailed internal audits at the Group’s major accounting centres 
undertaken by internal audit specialists from a major international 
accounting firm; 
comprehensive audits of all profit centres generally carried out on 
average at least once per year by internal operational audit. A summary 
of this work is provided annually to the Audit Committee; and
a review of arrangements by which staff may, in confidence, raise 
concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial 
reporting or other matters.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and  
the financial statements. The directors are required to prepare financial 
statements for the Group in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and have also elected to prepare financial 
statements for the Company in accordance with IFRS. Company  
law requires the directors to prepare such financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS, the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulations.
IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, requires that financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s  
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires 
the representation of the effects of transactions, other events and 
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria  
for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International 
Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and 
Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances,  
a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable 
International Financial Reporting Standards. Directors are also  
required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies;
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner  
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; and
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand  
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions  
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities and for the preparation of a directors’ report and directors’ 
remuneration report which comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 1985.
The maintenance and integrity of the Ashtead Group plc website is the 
responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does 
not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors 
accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the 
financial statements since they were first published.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that  
it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements. In forming this view the directors have reviewed 
the Group’s budgets and cash flow forecasts for a period of more than 
12 months from the date of the approval of these financial statements 
and considered the sufficiency of the Group’s banking facilities 
described on pages 42 to 43 of the Business and Financial Review.

Directors’ remuneration report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002. The report also meets the 
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of 
Good Governance relating to directors’ remuneration. As required by 
the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed  
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company’s 
members on the ‘auditable part’ of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as 
amended by the Regulations). The report has therefore been divided 
into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee (‘the 
Committee’) in accordance with the recommendations of the  
Combined Code. The members of the Committee throughout the  
year were Mr Cole (chairman), Mr Etheridge and Mr Drabble. None  
of the Committee members has any personal financial interests,  
other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
The Group’s chief executive, Mr Burnett, normally attends the meetings  
of the Committee to advise on operational aspects of the implementation 
of existing policies and policy proposals, except where his own 
remuneration is concerned, as does the non-executive chairman,  
Mr Stenham. The company secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. 
Under Mr Cole’s direction, the company secretary and Mr Burnett have 
responsibility for ensuring the Committee has the information relevant to 
its deliberations. In formulating its policies, the Committee has access to 
professional advice from outside the Company, if required, and to publicly 
available reports and statistics. External professional advice was obtained 
in the year from The Zygos Partnership.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate  
and retain directors of the high calibre needed to achieve the Group’s 
objectives and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The 
main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and 
senior management are: 
basic annual salary and benefits in kind; 
annual performance related bonus plan;
share related incentives; and
pension arrangements.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Company compares 
packages offered by similar companies, which are chosen having  
regard to:
•
•
•
•
the size of the company (revenues, profits and number of people 
employed); 
the diversity and complexity of its businesses; 
the geographical spread of its businesses; and 
their growth, expansion and change profile.
 
In making the comparisons, the Company takes into consideration the 
international scope, complexity and speed of change of the Group’s 
business and, particularly, its significant operations in the US where the 
Company has a number of larger, successful competitors who compete 
with it for top management talent. 
The Committee implements its remuneration policies by the design of 
reward packages for executive directors comprising the appropriate mix 
of salary, performance related annual cash incentive bonuses and share 
related incentives. Mr Burnett, with the approval of the Board, holds  
two non-executive appointments outside the Group: he is chairman of 
Henderson Strata Investments plc and is also chair of the Governors of 
University College for the Creative Arts. The latter position is unpaid and 
Mr Burnett is allowed to retain the fees arising from Henderson Strata 
Investments plc amounting to £12,500 in the past year. None of the other 
executive directors holds any outside appointments.
Basic salary
An executive director’s basic salary is normally determined by the 
Committee before the start of the year and when an individual changes 
position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee 
considers the Group as a whole and seeks to be competitive, but fair, 
using information drawn from both internal and external sources. 
In recognition of the substantial growth in the Company’s market 
capitalisation achieved in the year ended 30 April 2005, the 
Remuneration Committee concluded that a significant upwards revision 
to the salaries of the executive directors was appropriate for the year  
to 30 April 2006 just as the salaries of Mr Burnett and Mr Robson had 
been adjusted downwards in 2003 in the light of the reduction in the 
Company’s market capitalisation at that time. Accordingly, effective 
1 May 2005 the following salary increases were implemented: 
 
 Percentage  Revised 
 increase salary
George Burnett 25.6% £428,000
Ian Robson 25.6% £260,000
Sat Dhaiwal 20.0% £180,000
Cliff Miller 20.0% $420,000
Annual performance related bonus plan
Under the annual performance related bonus plan for executive directors, 
except for the additional payment to Mr Robson discussed below, 
payments for the year to 30 April 2006 were related directly to financial 
performance targets and were subject to a cap of 100% of salary. The 
•
•
•
• 25  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.ashtead-group.com
Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial 
year if a cash incentive bonus for that year is to be paid. In determining 
bonus parameters the Committee’s objective is to set targets that reflect 
appropriately challenging financial performance measures.
For the year ended 30 April 2006, the Group and Sunbelt fully attained 
their respective financial targets and accordingly Mr Burnett, Mr Robson 
and Mr Miller will be paid their 2005/6 performance related bonus in  
full in July 2006. In addition, Mr Robson was paid a discretionary 
performance bonus during the year of £40,000 in recognition of  
his performance in delivering the complete restructuring of the  
Group’s debt finances over the 18 months culminating in last August’s 
successful capital reorganisation. A-Plant partially attained its 2005/6 
targets and accordingly Mr Dhaiwal will be paid a proportionate bonus 
in July 2006.
 
Share related incentives
Details of the Company’s existing arrangements are set out below. 
Previous plans
Executive share option schemes
Until 2002, it was the Committee’s policy to make regular awards under 
the Company’s executive share plans to senior staff. The value of the 
shares underlying the options awarded was assessed by reference  
to a number of factors including the employee’s salary, seniority and 
length of service as well as both the Company’s and the individual’s 
performance in the year prior to the award. No further executive share 
option awards are planned.
Investment Incentive Plan
The Investment Incentive Plan is a long-term incentive plan which 
provided for senior management, who so elected, to invest all or a 
portion of their annual cash bonuses in shares of the Company and, 
thus, become eligible for matching awards in the form of shares which 
only vest subject to demanding performance conditions. The Company 
does not intend currently to make any further awards under this plan.
Matching awards were made in respect of investment shares acquired by 
participants with all or part of their bonus for the previous financial year. 
The matching awards only vest, in whole or part, based on annual growth 
in the Company’s earnings per share (‘EPS’) in the three year period 
following the award over that of the year ended 30 April immediately prior 
to the date of the award and on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) performance relative to a comparator group. In respect of the 
remaining available matching awards, the relevant performance period  
is the three years from 19 August 2004 (when the share price was 48.5p) 
to 18 August 2007. The comparator group comprises all of the FTSE 250 
mid-cap stocks other than investment trusts.
The above performance conditions were chosen because they were  
felt to align most closely the interests of senior management with the 
interests of shareholders, by rewarding management for achieving 
superior relative total shareholder return performance compared with 
the FTSE 250 as a whole, excluding investment trusts. At the time the 
awards were made, the FTSE 250 was considered to be the Stock 
Exchange index most appropriate to the size and scale of the 
Company’s operations.
 
Vesting of the matching awards is based on the following required 
performance grid:
Real EPS 
growth 
performance
TSR performance against peer group
Below median TSR Median

75th

Vesting operates on a scaled basis for performance between the target 
levels shown in the grid above. Performance is measured at the end of 
the three year performance period when the awards either vest in full  
or part or lapse completely. For performance measurement purposes 
earnings per share is based on the profit before exceptional items 
measured under consistently applied accounting policies and using  
a 30% standardised tax rate.
Current plan
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan is a long-term incentive plan under which 
executive directors and other members of the senior management team 
may annually receive a conditional right to acquire shares (‘performance 
shares’), the vesting of which depends on the satisfaction of demanding 
performance conditions. 
The maximum award of performance shares that may be made in any 
financial year of the Company is limited under the rules of the Plan, to 
shares with a market value equal to 100% of the participant’s base 
salary at the time the award is made. To date no award has exceeded 
70% of salary. 26  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 International equipment rental

The extent to which the awards vest depends as to 50% of the award 
on growth in EPS over the three year vesting period which runs for the 
awards granted in 2004 for the three years ending 30 April 2007 and for 
the awards granted in 2005 for the three years ending 30 April 2008.
The vesting of the other 50% of the awards is dependent upon the 
Company’s TSR performance over the three years commencing on 
award date (5 October 2004 for the 2004 awards and 16 August 2005 
for the 2005 awards) against the relevant index. For the 2004 awards 
this was the FTSE SmallCap index (excluding investment trusts) whilst, 
for the 2005 awards, it was the constituents of the FTSE 250 index 
(excluding investment trusts). 
 
The part of each award relating to EPS growth depends on the level of 
EPS for the year ending 30 April 2007 for the 2004 award and for the 
year ending 30 April 2008 for the 2005 award. For the 2004 award, the 
award vests in full if EPS for 2006/7 is 8p or greater and lapses if EPS is 
5p or lower. The equivalent thresholds for the 2005 award in the 2007/8 
year are 9.1p and 7.7p. Awards are scaled for performance between 
these points. EPS for this purpose is calculated on the Group’s profit 
before exceptional items less a standardised 30% tax charge. The EPS 
targets noted above have not yet been adjusted by the Committee to 
reflect the impact of the Group’s subsequent application of International 
Financial Reporting Standards but this will be considered by the 
Committee at the time the awards mature.
Directors’ remuneration report continued
The part of each award linked to TSR vests in full if the Company’s TSR 
growth over the three year vesting period ranks it in the top 25% of 
participants in the relevant index and will lapse if the Company’s relative 
TSR growth is ranked at or below 50% of participants in the relevant 
index over the three year vesting period. If relative TSR performance is 
between these points, the TSR linked part of the award is scaled on a 
pro rata basis.
Employee Share Ownership Trust
The Group has established an Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) 
to hold shares in the Company to satisfy potential awards under the 
Investment Incentive Plan and the Performance Share Plan. At 30 April 
2006, the ESOT held a beneficial interest in 4,721,490 shares. The ESOT 
owned directly 2,286,959 of these shares and a further 2,434,531 shares 
were registered in the name of Investment Incentive Plan or Performance 
Share Plan participants on terms which require that the award shares are 
transferred back to the ESOT to the extent that the performance targets 
are not met.
 
Relative performance
The following graph compares the Company’s TSR performance with 
the FTSE 250 index (excluding investment trusts) over the five years 
ended 30 April 2006, the Stock Exchange index the Committee 
considers to be the most appropriate to the size and scale of the 
Company’s operations.  27  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.ashtead-group.com
Directors’ pension arrangements
During the year the Company agreed with Mr Burnett that his 
remuneration from 6 April 2006 would be non-pensionable and also that 
the Company’s pension obligation to Mr Burnett at 6 April 2006 under 
the terms of his employment contract would be satisfied in full by the 
transfer to a private personal pension scheme established by Mr Burnett 
of all the assets then held by the Ashtead Group plc Pension Scheme of 
which Mr Burnett was the sole remaining member. The value of these 
assets at 6 April 2006 was £10.3m and the transfer to Mr Burnett’s new 
personal pension plan was concluded on 29 April 2006.
Under the terms of his contract, Mr Robson is entitled to retire at age  
60 on a pension equal to one-thirtieth of his final salary for each year  
of pensionable service. He is a member of the Company’s Retirement 
Benefits Plan, which is a defined benefits scheme. Following the change 
in pension plan and Inland Revenue regulations effective 6 April 2006, 
the Company has agreed with the trustees of the Retirement Benefits 
Plan that the Retirement Benefits Plan will now be responsible for  
Mr Robson’s entire pension, part of which was previously provided  
by the Company. Mr Robson’s contract also contains early retirement 
provisions allowing him to retire and draw a pension based on actual 
years of service, but without deduction for early payment which take 
effect once he has completed 10 years’ service with the Company (or  
at any time after age 50 if there is a change of control). Mr Robson pays 
contributions equal to 7.5% of his salary to the Retirement Benefits Plan.
Mr Dhaiwal’s pension benefits are also now provided entirely through 
the Ashtead Group plc Retirement Benefits Plan. His pension rights 
accrue at the rate of one-sixtieth of salary (as defined) for each year  
of pensionable service and his normal retirement date is at age 65.  
Mr Dhaiwal also pays contributions equal to 7.5% of his salary to the 
Retirement Benefits Plan.
Except where otherwise stated above, the Retirement Benefits Plan 
provides:
in the event of death in service or death between leaving service and 
retirement while retaining membership of the plan, a spouse’s 
pension equal to 50% of the member’s deferred pension calculated 
at the date of death plus a return of his contributions;
in the event of death in retirement, a spouse’s pension equal to 50% 
of the member’s pension at the date of death;
•
•
an option to retire at any time after age 50 with the Company’s 
consent. Early retirement benefits are reduced by an amount agreed 
between the Actuary and the Trustees as reflecting the cost to the 
plan of the early retirement. After 2010, Government regulations raise 
the minimum early retirement age to 55;
pension increases in line with the increase in retail price inflation up  
to a limit of currently 5% a year; and
transfer values do not include discretionary benefits.
In February 2006, Mr Miller ceased contributing to Sunbelt’s 401K defined 
contribution pension plan and joined Sunbelt’s deferred compensation 
plan. Under the deferred compensation plan Mr Miller has elected to  
defer 6% of his annual salary and a proportion of his annual performance 
bonus, which is retained by Sunbelt in an account designated for his 
benefit to be paid to him on retirement. Sunbelt provides a co-match  
at the rate of $1 for every $1 deferred up to $7 ,500 per annum.
Executive directors’ service agreements
Mr Burnett’s service agreement dated 18 September 2003 provides  
for termination by either party by the giving of 12 months’ notice. The 
contract further provides that Mr Burnett need give the Company only 
six months’ notice if he wishes to retire on or after attaining the age of 
60 in September 2006. The service agreements between the Company 
and Mr Robson (dated 4 August 2000), Mr Dhaiwal (dated 8 July 2002) 
and Mr Miller (dated 5 July 2004) are also terminable by either party 
giving the other 12 months’ notice. The service agreements for each of 
the executive directors all contain non-compete provisions appropriate 
to their roles in the Group.
Remuneration policy for non-executive directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the 
chairman and chief executive within limits set out in the Articles of 
Association. The chairman has a service contract (dated 22 October 
2003) with the Company terminable on three months’ notice by the 
Company or immediately by the members in general meeting. The 
contract also provides for compensation following termination by reason 
of any change of control equal to 12 months’ fees. None of the other 
non-executive directors has a service contract with the Company and 
their appointment is therefore terminable by the Board at any time.
An ordinary resolution concerning the Group’s remuneration policies will 
be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Key management 
As noted above, all the assets then held by the Ashtead Group plc 
Pension Scheme of which Mr Burnett was the sole remaining member 
were vested in him on 6 April 2006 in full settlement of the Company’s 
pension obligation to him under his employment contract and his 
employment subsequent to that date is non-pensionable. The value  
of the assets so vested at 6 April 2006 was £10.3m. 
Mr Miller contributed to the US defined contribution plan until February 
2006, to which his employer, Sunbelt, contributed £5,087 in the year.  
In February 2006, Mr Miller joined the Sunbelt deferred compensation 
plan to which Sunbelt had allocated £2,730 by 30 April 2006 and the 
amount due to Mr Miller at 30 April 2006 was £5,445.

Note
On 23 September 2005, Mr Burnett exercised an option originally granted to him in September 1995 under the Company’s executive share option plan to acquire 487,494 shares at a price of 
72.535p per share and sold all of the acquired shares on the same day at the then market price of 140p per share. On 14 July 2005, Mr Dhaiwal exercised an option originally granted to him in 
February 2002 under the Company’s executive share option plan to acquire 72,000 shares at a price of 41.5p per share and sold all of the acquired shares on the same day at the then market 
price of 110p per share. On 8 August 2005 following achievement of the relevant performance conditions, the matching award granted to Mr Robson on 8 August 2002 under the Investment 
Incentive Plan vested in full and accordingly 176,469 shares were transferred to Mr Robson at a time when the market price was 114.25p per share. Mr Robson sold 50,579 shares to partially 
fund the tax liability resulting from vesting of the matching award and retained 125,890 shares. 
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Exercise of certain of the above listed discretionary option awards were 
subject to performance conditions when originally granted, all of which 
have been met subsequently. The market price of the Company’s 
shares at the end of the financial year was 235p and the highest and 
lowest prices during the financial year were 238p and 85.5p respectively.
Mr Dhaiwal also holds 50,000 units in the Company’s Cash Incentive 
Scheme which were granted to him on 22 February 2000 when he was 
not a director. The performance criteria related to this award have been 
satisfied and accordingly Mr Dhaiwal may exercise the award in whole 
or in part at any time prior to 22 February 2010. When the award is 
exercised Mr Dhaiwal will be paid in cash an amount equal to the 
difference between the mid market price of Ashtead Group plc shares 
on the day of exercise and 102p multiplied by the number of units 
exercised. The resultant sum will be paid to Mr Dhaiwal in cash less 
applicable taxes.

Business and financial review
Introduction
This Business and Financial Review discusses our financial results, cash 
flows and balance sheet fluctuations as well as certain factors affecting 
our financial performance, our critical accounting policies and certain 
market risks to which our operations subject us.
Business overview
The Group is one of the largest equipment rental groups in the world with 
a network of 413 profit centres in the US, the UK, Singapore and Canada 
at 30 April 2006. Equipment rental companies provide customers with a 
comprehensive line of equipment, including larger equipment such as 
aerial work platforms, backhoes, excavators and forklifts, as well as 
smaller equipment such as power tools and small pumps.
Operations
The Group conducts its equipment rental operations in the US under the 
brand name ‘Sunbelt’ and in the UK principally under the brand name  
‘A-Plant’. Sunbelt is the fourth largest equipment rental company in the 
US and A-Plant is the third largest equipment rental company in the UK, 
in each case, measured by rental revenue. The Group offers for rent a 
wide range of equipment and during 2006 had total revenue of £638m.
In the year ended 30 April 2006, approximately 72% of the Group’s 
revenue was generated in the US by Sunbelt, which operates 209 profit 
centres in 27 states and the District of Columbia, and approximately 
25% of our revenue was generated by A-Plant, which operates 193 
profit centres throughout the UK. The Group also has a specialised 
business that rents mainly electronic survey and testing equipment in 
the UK, the US, Singapore and Canada under the brand name ‘Ashtead 
Technology Rentals’ which accounted for approximately 3% of our 
revenue in 2006 and operates 11 profit centres.
Sunbelt builds on the advantages of its geographical scale through a 
‘clustered market’ approach of grouping its rental locations into clusters 
of three to 15 locations in each of its developed markets throughout the 
US. Sunbelt has developed such ‘clustered markets’ in 22 major cities 
including Washington DC, Baltimore, Charlotte, Atlanta, Jacksonville, 
Orlando and Seattle. This approach allows us to provide a comprehensive 
product offering and convenient service to our customers wherever their 
job sites may be within these markets. 
In the UK, A-Plant services its customers with a full range of equipment 
on a nationwide basis. We believe A-Plant is one of only two companies 
able to provide such a comprehensive range of equipment and 
dedicated customer service throughout the UK, which allows it to 
service fully the needs of its national customers.
Markets and competition
The US equipment rental market continues to expand as rental 
penetration increases. Historically, the majority of construction 
equipment was owned by the contractors. In the mid-1990s it is 
estimated that only 5% of construction equipment was rented. The 
amount of equipment rented has increased steadily since then with 
industry commentators indicating it is now around 38%. The trend 
towards increased rental is expected to continue in the foreseeable 
future. In contrast, the UK is a mature market with rental penetration 
rates estimated in the 70-80% range.
Reflecting the development of the market, the US equipment rental 
industry is highly fragmented and Sunbelt’s competitors include large 
companies operating nationally, regional competitors that operate on  
a multi-state basis, small independent businesses with fewer than 10 
rental locations, and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and 
rent equipment directly to customers. The more mature UK equipment 
rental market is highly competitive. In the UK we face competition  
from large national operations, as well as smaller local and regional 
operations. In both markets, we believe that the top 10 equipment rental 
companies accounted for approximately 30% of the total market in the 
year ended 31 December 2005.
Customers
The Group’s diversified customer base includes construction, industrial 
and homeowner customers, as well as government entities and specialist 
contractors. The rental equipment fleet comprises an extensive range of 
general construction equipment, supplemented by more specialised 
product groups such as pumps, welding equipment, power generation 
equipment, aerial work platforms, scaffolding, shoring equipment and 
temporary accommodation units. 
As a large portion of our customer base comes from the commercial 
construction and industrial sectors, the Group is dependent on the  
level of commercial construction or industrial activity. The factors  
which influence this activity include: 
the strength of the US and UK economies over the long term, 
including the level of government spending;
the level of interest rates; and
demand within the businesses that drive the need for commercial 
construction or industrial equipment. 
However, the Group’s geographical scale and diversified customer base 
assist in mitigating the adverse impact of these factors on the Group’s 
performance through:
reducing the impact of localised economic fluctuations on our overall 
financial performance;
reducing our dependence on any particular customer or group of 
customers; and
enabling us to meet the needs of larger customers who have a wide 
range of equipment needs.

Suppliers
Like other large participants in the industry, the Group purchases large 
amounts of equipment, parts and other items from its suppliers. The 
Group’s capital expenditure on rental equipment for 2005/6 was £202m. 
The Group believes that this level of capital expenditure enables it to 
negotiate favourable pricing, warranty and other terms with its suppliers 
which provide it with a competitive advantage over smaller competitors.
Across our rental fleet, we seek to carry equipment from one or two 
manufacturers in each product range and to limit the number of model 
types of each product. We believe that having such a standardised  
fleet results in lower costs because we obtain greater discounts by 
purchasing spare parts in bulk and reduce maintenance costs through 
more focused, and therefore reduced, training requirements for our 
workshop staff. We are also able to share spare parts between profit 
centres which helps to minimise the risk of overstocking. We purchase 
equipment from vendors with strong reputations for product quality and 
reliability and maintain close relationships with these vendors to ensure 
good after-purchase service and support. However, management 
believes the Group has sufficient alternative sources of supply for  
the equipment it purchases in each of its product categories.
 
Sales and marketing
Each of Sunbelt, A-Plant and Ashtead Technology Rentals has their  
own sales force focusing on establishing and expanding our national, 
regional and specialised-equipment customers in various sectors.  
In both the US and the UK, we also have dedicated large account sales 
teams who are focused on building and reinforcing relationships with 
our larger customers, particularly those with a national or multi-regional 
presence. In May 2005, the A-Plant sales force was restructured as a 
single national function to ensure the differing requirements of national, 
regional and local customers were served in a more focused way.  
The benefits of this restructuring have started to be realised with  
A-Plant returning to year on year sales growth in the third quarter of  
this financial year, which continued in the fourth quarter.
In addition to the efforts of our sales forces, we market our business 
through direct mail campaigns, print advertising, telemarketing and 
industry trade publications. All three of our businesses also maintain  
up to date website presences.
Employees
The Group’s worldwide workforce consisted of 6,465 employees (full- and 
part-time) at 30 April 2006, of which 4,323 were located in the US, 2,128 
were located in the UK, and the remainder in Canada and Singapore.
Environmental and safety matters
Our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental 
protection and occupational health and safety matters. These laws 
regulate such issues as wastewater, stormwater, solid and hazardous 
wastes and materials, and air quality. Under these laws, we may be 
liable for, among other things, the cost of investigating and remediating 
contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous 
wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault, and also fines and 
penalties for non-compliance. Our operations generally do not raise 
significant environmental risks, but we use hazardous materials to  
clean and maintain equipment, dispose of solid and hazardous waste 
and wastewater from equipment washing, and store and dispense 
petroleum products from under-ground and above-ground storage 
tanks located at some of our locations.
Based on the conditions currently known to us, we do not believe that 
any pending or likely remediation and compliance costs will have a 
material adverse effect on our business. 
Legal proceedings
The Group is party to certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary 
course of business. The results of such proceedings cannot be 
predicted with certainty, but we do not believe any of these matters  
are material to our financial condition or results of operations.
Business strategy
The Group’s goal is to establish a premium equipment rental business  
in all of the markets in which it operates. In order to accomplish this, its 
business strategy is to continue to provide top-quality customer service 
and maintain a clear focus on the equipment rental business coupled 
with controlled growth. In addition, the Group believes it has built a 
strong platform and achieved critical mass in its core markets, enabling 
it to maximise returns on investment, generate free cash flow and to 
maintain leverage at an average 2 to 3 times net debt to EBITDA over 
the economic cycle.
Top-quality customer service is the cornerstone of the Group’s business 
strategy. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 
through efforts to provide the highest level of customer service, which 
includes employing specialist personnel, motivating and empowering 
profit centre managers to forge strong relationships with customers  
in their service area, ensuring that the Group has an extensive,  
high-quality rental fleet and providing dependable customer support. 
Customer service initiatives include, in particular, focusing on reliable, 
on-time delivery of equipment directly to customers’ job sites.
Business and financial review continued 35  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.ashtead-group.com
The Group focuses almost entirely on the equipment rental business. 
During 2006 approximately 96% of revenue was derived from equipment 
rentals and rental-related services with the balance coming from sales of 
parts and associated goods, such as equipment accessories. We believe 
that equipment rental offers the opportunity to earn substantially higher 
returns than those which are earned by equipment dealers whose 
margins are effectively capped by the equipment manufacturer. The 
Group believes that this focused and dedicated approach improves  
the effectiveness of its rental sales force by encouraging them to build 
and reinforce relationships with customers and to concentrate on 
strong, whole-life returns from our rental fleet rather than on short-term 
returns from sales of equipment. In contrast, many of our competitors  
in the equipment rental industry, especially in the US, follow a mixed 
business approach, providing rentals, selling new equipment and 
trading used equipment.
The Group strives to maximise its return on investment through a 
combination of measures. In addition to our monthly ‘profit-share’ 
programme, we also encourage effective management of invested 
capital by:
maintaining a concentration of higher-return (often specialised) 
equipment within the overall rental equipment fleet;
promoting the transfer of equipment to locations where maximum 
utilisation rates and returns can be obtained;
monitoring the amount of invested capital at each of our profit 
centres; and
empowering regional and local managers to adapt pricing policies  
in response to local demand in order to maximise the overall return 
achieved from our investment in our rental fleet.
We also actively manage the composition and size of our rental fleet  
by continuing to assess and dispose of older or underperforming 
equipment and other assets and adapt the level of our capital 
expenditure to economic activity levels.
The Group’s flexible business model allows it to focus on generating  
free cash flow. When the economy is expanding, we utilise this free  
cash flow to increase investment in our rental fleet to support revenue, 
EBITDA and earnings growth and reduce the age of our rental fleet. 
During a recessionary environment, we reduce the rate at which we 
invest in new equipment and increase the age of our rental fleet, which 
consequently increases free cash flow.
Factors affecting our financial performance and results
Seasonality and cyclicality
Our revenue and operating results are significantly dependent on  
activity in the commercial construction industry in the US and the UK. 
Commercial construction activity tends to decrease in the winter and 
•
•
•
•
during extended periods of inclement weather and increase in the 
summer and during extended periods of mild weather. Furthermore, 
due to the incidence of public holidays in the US and the UK, there are 
more billing days in the first half of our financial year than the second 
half. This results in changes in demand for our rental equipment. In 
addition, the commercial construction industries in the US and the UK 
are cyclical industries with activity levels that tend to increase in line with 
GDP growth and decline during an economic downturn. The seasonality 
and cyclicality of the equipment rental industry results in variable 
demand and therefore, our revenue and operating results will fluctuate 
from period to period.
Currency translation
Our reporting currency is the pound sterling. However, a majority of our 
assets, liabilities, revenue and costs are denominated in US dollars. We 
have arranged our financing such that approximately 80% of our debt  
is also denominated in US dollars so that we have a natural partial  
offset between our dollar-denominated net assets and earnings and  
our dollar-denominated debt and interest expense. Fluctuations in the 
value of the US dollar with respect to the pound therefore have had,  
and may continue to have, a significant impact on our financial condition 
and results of operations as reported in pounds. This impact is greatest 
on our revenue and operating profits but less significant on our profits 
before and after tax which are stated after deduction of our dollar-
denominated interest expense.
In the year ended 30 April 2006, the appreciation of the US dollar 
against the pound increased our total revenue by approximately 3.6% 
and our pre-tax profits by approximately 4.5%, in each case compared 
to the year ended 30 April 2005.
Accordingly, throughout this Business and Financial Review, we  
also present the changes in our reported results in one period as 
compared to the equivalent prior period at constant exchange rates, 
which assumes that the US dollar amounts for both periods were 
consolidated and translated at the average exchange rate applied  
in the financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2006. 
Presentation of financial information
Revenue
Our revenue is a function of our prices and utilisation of, and the size 
and mix of, our equipment rental fleet. In turn, the prices we charge are 
affected in large measure by utilisation and the relative attractiveness of 
our rental equipment, while utilisation is determined by market size and 
our market share, as well as general economic conditions. Utilisation is 
time based utilisation calculated as the original cost of equipment on 
rent as a percentage of the total value of equipment in the fleet at the 
measurement date. In the US we measure time utilisation on those items  36  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 International equipment rental
in our fleet with an original cost of $7 ,500 or more which constituted 90% 
of our US serialised rental equipment at 30 April 2006. In the UK time 
utilisation is measured for all our serialised rental equipment. The size,  
mix and relative attractiveness of our rental equipment fleet is significantly 
affected by the level of our capital expenditure. The main components of 
our revenue are:
revenue from equipment rentals, including related revenues such as 
the fees we charge for equipment delivery, erection and dismantling 
services for our scaffolding rentals, fuel provided with the equipment 
we rent to customers, and loss damage waiver fees; and
revenue from sales of new merchandise, including sales of parts and 
revenues from a limited number of sales of new equipment. 
Costs
The main components of our total costs are:
Staff costs – staff costs at our profit centres as well as at our central 
support offices represent the largest single component of our total 
costs. Staff costs consist of salaries, profit share and bonuses, social 
security costs, and other pension costs and comprised 37.4% of our 
total operating costs in the year ended 30 April 2006. Profit share 
and bonuses earned in the year rose 42% to £16.2m (2005: £11.4m).
Other operating costs – comprised 41.5% of total costs in the year 
ended 30 April 2006. These costs include:
− spare parts, consumables and outside repairs costs – costs 
incurred for the purchase of spare parts used by our workshop 
staff to maintain and repair our rental equipment, and outside 
repair costs. 
− facilities costs – rental payments on leased facilities as well as 
utility costs and local property taxes relating to these facilities.
− vehicle costs – costs incurred for the purchase, maintenance and 
operation of our vehicle fleet, which consist of our delivery trucks, 
the light commercial vehicles used by our mobile workshop staff 
and cars used by our sales force, profit centre managers and 
other management staff. 
− other costs – all other costs incurred in operating our business, 
including the costs of new equipment and merchandise sold, 
advertising costs and bad debt expense.
Other income – profit on disposal of fixed assets which totalled 
£9.1m in the year ended 30 April 2006 (2005: £7.1m).
Depreciation – the depreciation of our tangible fixed assets, including 
rental equipment, comprised 21.1% of total costs in the year ended 
30 April 2006. 
Our costs are significantly fixed in the short to medium term, and 
material adjustments in the size of our cost base typically result  
only from openings or closures of one or more of our profit centres. 
Accordingly, our business model is such that small increases or 
reductions in our revenue can result in little or no change in our  
costs and often therefore have a disproportionate impact on our  
profits. We refer to this feature of our business as ‘operational leverage’.

Critical accounting policies
We prepare and present our financial statements in accordance  
with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In 
applying many accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, 
estimates and judgements. These assumptions, estimates and 
judgements are often subjective and may be affected by changing 
circumstances or changes in our analysis. Changes in these 
assumptions, estimates and judgements have the potential to alter 
materially our results of operations. We have identified below those  
of our accounting policies that we believe would most likely produce 
materially different results were we to change underlying assumptions, 
estimates and judgements. These policies have been applied consistently. 
For a summary of these and our other significant accounting policies, see 
note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements.
Useful lives of property, plant and equipment
We record expenditures for property, plant and equipment at cost. We 
depreciate equipment using the straight line method over its estimated 
useful economic life (which ranges from 3 to 20 years with a weighted 
average life of 8 years). We give effect to an estimated salvage value of 
10% of cost in respect of most types of our rental equipment, zero for 
scaffolding and similar equipment, 15% for aerial work platforms and 
20% for steel site accommodation units. We establish our estimates  
of useful life and salvage value with the objective of allocating most 
appropriately the cost of each fixed asset to our profit and loss account 
over the period we anticipate it will be used in our business. 
We may be required to change these estimates if experience shows that 
the current estimates are not achieving this objective. If these estimates 
change in the future, we may then be required to recognise increased or 
decreased depreciation expense. Our total depreciation expense in the 
year ended 30 April 2006 was £113.6m.
Impairment of assets
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment  
as at 30 April each year. Assets that are subject to amortisation or 
depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement 
for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. For the purposes of assessing impairment,  
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable and independent cash flows for the asset being tested  
for impairment. In the case of goodwill, impairment is assessed at  
the level of the Group’s three reporting units. The recoverable amount  
is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Management necessarily applies to its judgement in estimating  
the timing and value of underlying cash flows within the value in  
use calculation as well as determining the appropriate discount  
rate. Subsequent changes to the magnitude and timing of cash  
flows could impact the carrying value of the respective assets.
Business and financial review continued 37  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.ashtead-group.com
Self-insurance
We establish provisions at the end of each financial year to cover our 
estimate of the discounted liability for uninsured retained risks on unpaid 
claims arising out of events occurring up to the end of such financial 
year. The estimate includes events incurred but not reported at the 
balance sheet date. The provision is established using advice received 
from external actuaries who help us extrapolate historical trends and 
estimate the most likely level of future expense which we will incur on 
outstanding claims. These estimates may, however, change based on 
varying circumstances, including changes in our experience of the costs 
we incur in settling claims over time. Accordingly, we may be required  
to increase or decrease the provision held for self-insured retained risk. 
At 30 April 2006, the total provision for self-insurance recorded in our 
consolidated balance sheet was £15.8m (2005: £12.5m).
Pensions
We account for the cost of pension plans for employees by charging  
the expected cost of providing pensions over the period during which 
we benefit from the employees’ services. In respect of defined benefit 
plans, actuarial valuations are made regularly and the contributions 
payable are adjusted in light of these valuations. However, these 
adjustments may be significant and may result in an increase or 
decrease in the cost of providing the defined benefit pensions. In the 
year ended 30 April 2006 the total pension cost was £2.8m of which 
£1.8m was in respect of defined contribution plans.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the total amount receivable for the provision of 
goods and services to customers net of returns and value added tax. 
Rental revenue, including loss damage waiver fees, is recognised on  
a straight line basis over the period of the rental contract. Because the 
terms and conditions of a rental contract can extend across financial 
reporting period ends, the Group records unbilled rental revenue and 
deferred revenue at the end of the reporting periods so rental revenue  
is appropriately stated in the financial statements.
Revenue from rental equipment delivery and collection is recognised 
when delivery or collection has occurred.
Revenue from the sale of new equipment, parts and supplies, retail 
merchandise and fuel is recognised at the time of delivery to, or 
collection by, the customer and when all obligations under the sales 
contract have been fulfilled.

Sunbelt
Revenue increased 23.8% in the year to $818.7m. This was achieved 
through increased investment in the rental fleet which was on average 
11% larger than a year ago and by significant increases in rental rates 
which were increased approximately 12% in strong market conditions. 
Average utilisation remained high at 70% compared to 69% in the prior 
year. Revenue growth was broadly based with all regions and all major 
product areas trading ahead of last year. Last summer’s hurricanes are 
estimated to have added around 2% to revenues. In a strong trading 
environment where US non-residential construction rose 10.2% in  
the year to 30 April 2006, according to figures published by the US 
Department of Commerce, Sunbelt continued to take market share. 
Revenues from house builders, where the short term outlook is less 
certain, accounted for just 6% of Sunbelt’s revenues. The shift from 
ownership to rental continued with the US rental sector again growing 
faster than its key customer base, non-residential construction, in 
calendar 2005.
Sunbelt continued to invest to reduce the age of its rental fleet and  
for growth, spending $257.9m in the year, including the funding of  
six new greenfield stores. A further 16 new general equipment rental 
stores were acquired during the year for a consideration, including 
costs, of approximately $100m. The acquired stores were all 
immediately transferred onto Sunbelt’s point of sale system and staff 
incentive programmes and began trading as Sunbelt stores from their 
acquisition closing date. Their financial performance since acquisition 
has been strongly positive. In August Sunbelt also disposed of 12 
specialist scaffold stores on the west coast and in Texas for $24.3m 
generating an exceptional disposal profit of $5.1m (£2.9m). The new 
stores continue Sunbelt’s strategy of clustering stores in major 
metropolitan markets. Sunbelt also continues to emphasise organic 
growth with an increase in same store revenues for the year of 19.3%.
 
Operating costs (excluding depreciation) rose 16.7% in the period  
to $509.8m. This reflected increased personnel costs and higher 
maintenance costs to service current activity levels as well as growth  
in fuel and insurance costs.
Reflecting these developments, Sunbelt’s EBITDA for the year grew 
37.4% to $307.9m and its EBITDA margin improved to 37.6% from 
33.9% in 2005. Divisional operating profit grew 62.7% to $175.5m 
representing a margin of 21.4% (2005: 16.3%). Return on investment 
including capitalised goodwill increased to 17.6% from 12.4% in 2005. 
Excluding capitalised goodwill, return on investment increased to 23.1% 
from 16.3% in 2005.
Sunbelt’s results in sterling reflected the factors discussed above and 
the stronger US dollar.  39  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.ashtead-group.com
A-Plant
A-Plant’s revenue for the year was £160.7m compared to £156.3m last 
year. The successful restructuring of A-Plant’s sales force undertaken  
in the first half of the year contributed to a significantly improved 
performance in the second half of the year and a particularly strong 
fourth quarter with revenues increasing by 8%. Rental rates, average 
fleet size and utilisation for the year were all at similar levels to those  
of last year with average utilisation of 65% for the year (2005: 65%).
A-Plant’s sales operations are now structured in a single national 
organisation to serve the differing requirements of national, regional  
and local customers in a more focused way. Senior sales management 
resources have been increased as has the size of the sales force  
to ensure that A-Plant can address the needs of a UK construction 
market which continues to show solid growth. The emphasis placed  
by customers on Health & Safety continues to increase and is driving 
increased outsourcing activity coupled with a need for the rental 
equipment provider to be able to monitor and measure its performance 
across a range of key performance indicators. These trends are 
benefiting A-Plant which, with its national presence and established  
IT systems, is one of only a few national providers able to meet 
customers’ needs. Revenues from its largest 150 customers continued 
to grow and represented 39% of the year’s total.
Careful management of operating expenses continued. These increased 
by just 3.4% reflecting principally the full year impact of cost reduction 
measures taken last year. Consequently, EBITDA for the year increased 
1.5% to £48.9m representing an EBITDA margin of 30.4% compared to 
30.8% in 2005. Divisional operating profit increased 22.0% to £13.9m 
representing a margin of 8.6% (2005: 7.3%). Return on investment 
increased to 7.0% from 5.6% in 2005. Excluding goodwill, return on 
investment increased to 7.1% from 5.7% in 2005.
Ashtead Technology
Revenue for the year grew 26.0% at constant exchange rates to £16.1m 
and by 29.5% at actual exchange rates. Divisional operating profit 
increased by 17.5% at constant exchange rates to £4.0m and by 19.9% 
at actual exchange rates. This reflects increased investment by the oil 
majors which is delivering higher offshore exploration and construction 
activity as well as continued growth in Ashtead Technology’s onshore 
environmental business. Investment for future growth included a 
significantly enlarged onshore sales force and a new profit centre 
opened in Chicago last November.
Exceptional items and fair value  
remeasurements of embedded derivatives
In addition to the trading results discussed above, operating profit as 
reported in the consolidated income statement includes £13.4m of net 
exceptional profits. These comprise the £11.3m received when Sunbelt 
settled its litigation with Head & Engquist last November, a £2.9m  
profit on disposal of Sunbelt’s 12 scaffold stores less £0.8m of post 
acquisition integration costs. Included within finance costs is the £4.8m 
net cost of last summer’s capital reorganisation, mainly relating to the 
12% premium payable on the £42m of sterling senior secured notes 
redeemed early out of the proceeds of the equity placing and the  
£5.6m (2005: £9.8m) non-cash fair value remeasurement of embedded 
derivatives in long term debt. 
Net financing costs 
Net financing costs for the year increased to £42.8m from £34.9m in 
2005, due primarily to the effects of exceptional costs of £4.8m related 
to the capital re-organisation and fair market remeasurements of 
embedded derivatives of £5.6m (2005: £9.8m) in long-term debt. Before 
exceptional costs and fair value remeasurements, net financing costs 
decreased by 2.5% reflecting slightly lower average debt levels but 
similar average interest rates. Compared to the previous year, the 
average interest rate benefited from the repayment of £42.0m of our 
12% notes and from a lower margin under our first priority asset based 
senior secured loan facility, but these benefits have been offset by 
increases in US dollar interest rates payable under our floating rate 
senior facility. 
Profit before taxation
The profit on ordinary activities before taxation was £81.7m compared 
with £32.2m in 2005. Underlying profit before tax was £67.5m, more 
than triple last year’s £22.4m (£24.2m at constant exchange rates). After 
taxation, the profit for the year was £55.6m compared to £18.2m in 2005.
Taxation
Overall for the year the effective accounting tax rate on the underlying 
profit was 31% whilst the cash tax rate on the same basis remained 
minimal. The tax charge for the year of £26.1m (2005: £14.0m) comprises 
£21.1m relating to the profit before tax, exceptional items and fair value 
remeasurements and £5.0m relating to the exceptional income and fair 
value remeasurements. The charge for current tax was £5.5m (of which 
£5.4m related to exceptional items) and the charge for deferred tax was 
£20.6m. Except in relation to the exceptional gains, substantially no cash 
tax was again paid reflecting the capital intensive nature of the Group’s 
operations and the level of available prior year tax losses. 
The recent increases in Sunbelt’s profitability together with the Head & 
Engquist litigation receipt mean, however, that Sunbelt’s US federal tax 
losses have now been fully utilised and that consequently the Group’s 
cash tax rate will rise into double digits next year. 40  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 International equipment rental
Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share were 12.2p and basic earnings per 
share were 14.7p compared to 2.6p and 5.6p respectively a year ago. 
On a cash tax basis, earnings per share before exceptional items were 
17.8p (2005: 6.7p). Cash tax earnings per share comprises earnings 
before exceptional items, fair value remeasurements and deferred tax, 
divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue. Cash tax 
earnings per share is considered to be a relevant measure of earnings 
per share as the deferred tax liability is not expected to crystallise in the 
foreseeable future.
Business and financial review continued
Dividends
The directors are proposing to shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting that a final dividend of 1.0p per share be paid making a total  
for the year of 1.5p per share (2005: nil). Under IFRS the financial 
statements now reflect only dividends paid in the year and therefore 
show only the £2.0m cost of the interim dividend paid in February.  
The final dividend, if approved by shareholders, will be paid on 28 
September 2006 to shareholders on the register on 28 July 2006.

Capital expenditure was increased significantly in the year, mainly to 
enable Sunbelt to take advantage of the improving economic conditions 
in the US. £64.5m of the fleet expenditure was for growth with the 
remainder being spent to replace existing equipment. This proportion  
is estimated on the basis of the assumption that maintenance capital 
expenditure in any period is equal to the original cost of equipment sold 
in that period. Expenditure on A-Plant’s rental fleet was also increased 
from £35.4m to £52.1m as its performance improved. Disposals 
amounted to £50.8m (2005: £37.6m) in the year, generating a profit  
on disposal of £9.1m (2005: £7.1m) at a margin of 22% (2005: 23%) 
above book value. The markets we use for disposing of used rental 
equipment continue to be healthy. 
The average age of the Group’s serialised rental equipment, which 
constitutes the substantial majority of our fleet, at 30 April 2006 was 37 
months on a net book value basis (2005: 45 months). At the same date, 
Sunbelt’s fleet had an average age of 38 months (2005: 46 months) 
comprising 49 months for aerial work platforms which have a longer life 
and 28 months for the rest of its fleet whilst A-Plant’s fleet had an average 
age of 36 months (2005: 43 months). 
In the year ending 30 April 2007 gross capital expenditure is expected 
to increase to approximately £250m. 41  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 www.ashtead-group.com
Trade and other receivables
Receivable days improved to 49 days (2005: 53 days). The bad debt 
charge as a percentage of total revenue was 0.7% in 2006 compared 
with 1.1% in 2005. 
Trade and other payables
Group payable days decreased to 57 days at 30 April 2006 from 74 
days at 30 April 2005. Capital expenditure related payables at 30 April 
2006 totalled £30.0m (2005: £35.9m). Payment periods for purchases 
other than rental equipment vary between 7 and 60 days and for rental 
equipment between 30 and 90 days. 
Other provisions
Other provisions of £18.3m (2005: £15.0m) relate principally to provision  
for self insured retained risk under the Group’s self insurance policies.  
The Group’s business exposes it to claims for personal injury, death or 
property damage resulting from the use of the equipment it rents and from 
injuries caused in motor vehicle accidents in which its vehicles are involved. 
The Group carries insurance covering a wide range of potential claims  
at levels it believes are sufficient to cover existing and future claims. Our 
liability insurance programmes provide that we can only recover the liability 
related to any particular claim in excess of an agreed excess amount of 
typically between $500,000 and $2m depending on the particular liability 
programme. In certain, but not all, cases this liability excess amount is 
subject to an annual cap, which limits the Group’s maximum liability in 
respect of these excess amounts to such annual cap. Our insured liability 
coverage is limited to a maximum of £100m per occurrence.
Pensions
The Group operates a number of pension plans for the benefit of  
its employees, for which the overall charge included in the financial 
statements was £2.8m (2005: £3.8m). Amongst these, the Group now 
has just one defined benefit pension plan which covers approximately 
350 employees in the UK and which was closed to new members in 
2001. All our other pension plans are defined contribution plans.
In March 2006, the Group contributed £17.1m to fully fund the UK 
defined benefit pension plan on an ongoing actuarial basis. This has  
no significant impact on the Group’s income statement but will reduce 
future payments to the plan.
Principally as a result of the foregoing, the Group’s defined benefit 
pension plan deficit which, measured in accordance with IAS 19, 
Employee Benefits, was £16.2m at the beginning of the year has 
become a surplus of £1.7m at the end of the year. Excluding the 
additional £17.1m contribution, asset values increased by £5.3m over 
and above the expected return on plan assets of £2.2m included in  
the income statement. However, offsetting this benefit was the impact  
of changes in the required market linked discount rate which reduced 
from 5.25% in 2005 to 5.0% in 2006, adding £5.1m to the value of 
liabilities. Accordingly there was a net gain of £0.2m in the year which 
was credited direct to the statement of recognised income and expense.
Cash flow and net debt
Free cash flow in the year ended 30 April 2006 (which is defined to 
exclude exceptional costs and which comprises our net cash inflow from 
operations excluding exceptional items, less net maintenance capital 
expenditure, interest and tax) is summarised below:
 Year to 30 April
 2006 2005 
 £m £m
EBITDA before exceptional items 224.7 169.5
Cash inflow from operations  
 before exceptional items 215.2 164.8

(Increase)/reduction in total debt (2.6) 53.6
Cash inflow from operations reflected principally the growth in reported 
EBITDA. Consequently, cash inflow from operations increased 30.6% to 
£215.2m and the cash efficiency ratio was 95.8% (2005: 97.2%) as we 
continued to convert almost all our EBITDA into cash.
Net maintenance rental capital expenditure increased to £99.5m (2005: 
£59.7m) as we spent ahead of depreciation to reduce the age of the 
rental fleet. Proceeds from the sale of fixed assets, principally used 
equipment, rose 40.4% to £50.4m (2005: £35.9m) and represented  
34% (2005: 38%) of maintenance capital expenditure. Expenditure on 
non-rental capital expenditure (principally leasehold improvements, 
vehicles and computer equipment) was £16.8m with the increase over 
last year’s £5.4m reflecting principally high vehicle replacements. Cash 
tax payments in the year were just £2.8m but are set to increase next 
year as the US tax group has now utilised all its federal tax losses due to 
improved operating performance, the Head & Engquist settlement and 
the scaffold disposal. Financing costs (excluding exceptional financing 
costs) paid this year were more in line with the accounting charge. Last 
year, financing costs were unusually low compared to last year’s £44.7m 
accounting charge and reflected the timing of interest payments.  42  Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2006 International equipment rental
Reflecting this and the high fleet maintenance capital expenditure, after 
interest, free cash flow fell 16.7% to £57.4m (2005: £68.9m). This free 
cash flow, net proceeds of £70.9m from the issue of ordinary shares and 
a £2.6m draw under our bank facilities were applied:
(i) to pay £62.6m in respect of growth capital expenditure;
(ii) to fund acquisitions net of disposal proceeds of £44.2m;
(iii) to fund the purchase of £2.8m of shares by the ESOT in connection 
with employee share plans; 
(iv) to pay the interim dividend of £2.0m;
(v) to make the one-time contribution of £17.1m to the defined benefit 
pension plan; and
(vi) to pay net exceptional costs of £2.2m. 
On 3 August 2005, the Group completed a capital reorganisation which 
raised approximately £70m from an equity placing and open offer as well 
as $250m of new second lien 8.625% senior secured notes due 2015. 
The proceeds of the placing and the debt issue were applied to redeem 
early, at an approximate 11% discount, the £134m convertible loan note 
and to redeem £42m of the 12% second priority senior secured loan 
notes due 2014. After payment of transaction costs, the remaining 
£26.5m of funds raised were applied to reduce outstandings under  
our asset based debt facility.
Based on current projections, the Group expects to be able to fund  
its cash requirements relating to its operations from existing sources  
of cash including its committed borrowing facilities for at least the next  
12 months. It expects that the principal needs for cash relating to existing 
operations over the next 12 months will be to:
fund operating expenses and working capital;
fund the purchase of rental equipment and other capital expenditures; 
and
service outstanding debt.
While emphasising primarily internal growth, the Group also expects to 
continue to expand through making small acquisitions that it would expect  
to fund by using cash, share capital, and/or the assumption of debt.

Net debt at 30 April 2006 was £493.6m (2005: £482.3m). Measured at 
constant (30 April 2006) exchange rates, the increase in net debt from 
30 April 2005 was £2.5m. Although net debt has increased slightly,  
the significant growth in EBITDA has resulted in the ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA before exceptional items reducing from 2.85 times a year ago  
to 2.2 times at 30 April 2006.
 
Bank loan facility
On 14 November 2005, the Group agreed amended terms with the 
syndicate of lenders who make available its first priority asset based 
senior secured loan facility (‘the ABL facility’) to increase the amount, 
extend the maturity, reduce the number of covenants and lower the cost 
of the facility. Following this amendment, the ABL facility consists of a 
$525m revolving credit facility and a $272m term loan and is secured by 
a first priority interest in substantially all of the Group’s assets. Pricing is 
based on the ratio of funded debt to EBITDA according to a grid which 
varies, depending on leverage, from LIBOR plus 250bp to LIBOR plus 
175bp for term borrowings and from LIBOR plus 250bp to LIBOR plus 
150bp for revolver borrowings. At 30 April 2006 the Group’s borrowing 
rate was LIBOR plus 175bp on the term loan and LIBOR plus 150bp on 
the revolver loan. 
The ABL facility carries minimal amortisation of 1% per annum ($2.75m) 
on the term loan and is committed until November 2010. 
The ABL facility includes a springing covenant package under which 
quarterly financial performance covenants are only tested if available 
liquidity is less than $50 million. These covenants comprise a maximum 
ratio of total debt to EBITDA and a minimum fixed charge ratio (the ratio 
of EBITDA less capital expenditure, net of disposal proceeds to the sum 
of cash interest, taxes, distributions to equity holders and scheduled 
principal debt repayments). Available liquidity under the ABL facility at 
30 April 2006 was £156m ($283m), compared with £82m ($157m) at  
30 April 2005. As the ABL facility is asset based, the maximum amount 
available to be borrowed (which includes drawings in the form of standby 
letters of credit) depends on asset values (receivables, inventory, rental 
equipment and real estate) which are subject to periodic independent 
appraisal. At 30 April 2006 the maximum amount available to be borrowed 
based on asset values exceeded the facility size by £25m ($46m).
Because liquidity at 30 April 2006 much exceeded the $50m springing 
level, together with the fact that neither of the Group’s other debt 
facilities (the senior secured notes due 2014 and 2015) contain regularly 
measured financial covenants, the Group does not currently have any 
quarterly monitored financial performance covenants to adhere to.

12% second priority senior secured notes due 2014 having  
a nominal value of £120m
On 16 April 2004 the Group, through its wholly owned subsidiary 
Ashtead Holdings plc, issued £120m of 12% second priority senior 
secured notes due 1 May 2014. The notes are secured by second 
priority security interests over substantially the same assets as the 
senior secured credit facility and are also guaranteed by Ashtead  
Group plc. On 5 September 2005, £42m of the principal was repaid 
utilising some of the proceeds of last summer’s equity issue.
8.625% second priority senior secured notes due 2015 having a 
nominal value of $250m
On 3 August 2005 the Group, through its wholly owned subsidiary Ashtead 
Holdings plc, issued $250m of 8.625% second priority senior secured notes 
due 1 August 2015. The notes are secured by second priority security 
interests over substantially the same assets as the first priority senior 
secured credit facility and are also guaranteed by Ashtead Group plc.
Under the terms of the 12% and 8.625% notes, the Group is, subject to 
important exceptions, restricted in its ability to incur additional debt, pay 
dividends, make investments, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback 
transactions and merge or consolidate with another company. Interest is 
payable on the 12% notes on 1 May and 1 November of each year and on 
the 8.625% notes on 1 February and 1 August of each year. Both senior 
secured notes are listed on the Official List of the UK Listing Authority.

Treasury policies
The Group reports in sterling and pays dividends in sterling. It is the  
role of the Group treasury function to manage and monitor the Group’s 
internal and external funding requirements and financial risks in support 
of the Group’s corporate objectives. Treasury activities are governed by 
policies and procedures approved by the Board and monitored by the 
Finance and Administration Committee. In particular, the Board of 
Directors or, through delegated authority, the Finance and Administration 
Committee, approves any derivative transactions. Derivative transactions 
are only undertaken for the purposes of managing interest rate risk and 
currency risk. The Group does not trade in financial instruments. The 
Group maintains treasury control systems and procedures to monitor 
liquidity, currency, credit and financial risks. 
Liquidity
The Group generates significant free cash flow (defined as cash flow 
from operations less replacement capital expenditure net of proceeds  
of asset disposal, interest paid and tax paid). This free cash flow is 
available to the Group to invest in growth capital expenditure, acquisitions 
and dividend payments or to reduce debt.
 
In addition to the strong free cash flow from normal trading activities, 
additional liquidity is available through the Group’s ABL facility. At  
30 April 2006, availability under this facility was $283m (£156m) and  
the Group’s objective is to maintain availability in excess of $100m 
throughout the economic cycle. Furthermore, the Group seeks to 
maintain leverage at an average of 2 to 3 times net debt to EBITDA  
over the economic cycle.
Interest rate risk management
The Group periodically utilises interest rate swap agreements to manage 
and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates. At 30 April 2006, 
the Group had one swap agreement with an aggregate notional amount 
of $100m whose effect had been to fix the interest rate exposure at 
2.5% on $100m of US dollar borrowings. This contract expired on 3 May 
2006. The Group’s debt that bears interest at a variable rate comprises 
all outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit facility. The 
interest rates currently applicable to this variable rate debt are LIBOR as 
applicable to the currency borrowed (US dollars or pounds) plus 175bp 
for term borrowings and 150bp for revolver borrowings.
At 30 April 2006, based upon the amount of variable rate debt 
outstanding, the Group’s pre-tax profits would change by approximately 
£2m for each one percentage point change in interest rates applicable 
to the variable rate debt. The amount of the Group’s variable rate debt 
may fluctuate as a result of changes in the amount of debt outstanding 
under the revolving tranches of the senior secured credit facility. 
Currency exchange risk management
The Group’s reporting currency is the pound sterling. However, a majority 
of our assets, liabilities, revenue and costs are denominated in US dollars. 
The Group has arranged its financing such that approximately 80% of its 
debt is also denominated in US dollars so that there is a natural partial 
offset between its dollar-denominated net assets and earnings and its 
dollar-denominated debt and interest expense. 
Based upon the level of US operations and of the US dollar-denominated 
debt balance and US interest rates at 30 April 2006, a 1% change in  
the US dollar-pound exchange rate would impact our pre-tax profits  
by 1%. At 30 April 2006, the Group had no outstanding foreign 
exchange contracts.
The Group’s exposure to exchange rate movements on trading 
transactions is relatively limited. All Group companies invoice revenues 
in their respective local currency and generally incur expense and 
purchase assets in their local currency. Consequently, the Group does 
not routinely hedge either forecast foreign exchange exposures or the 
impact of exchange rate movements on the translation of overseas 
profits into sterling. Foreign exchange risk on significant non-trading 
transactions (e.g. acquisitions) is considered on an individual basis.
Credit risk management
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and bank balances  
and trade and other receivables. The Group’s credit risk is primarily 
attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the 
balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. The  
credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited 
because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned 
by international credit rating agencies. The Group has no significant 
concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number 
of customers.

and Article 4 of the IAS Regulations. We report to you if, in our opinion, 
the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. We also 
report to you if the Company has not kept proper accounting records,  
if we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
 
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not complied 
with any of the four directors’ remuneration disclosure requirements 
specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority. These comprise the amount of each element in the 
remuneration package and information on share options, details of  
long-term incentive schemes, and money purchase and defined  
benefit schemes. We give a statement, to the extent possible, of  
details of any non-compliance.
 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects  
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of  
the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We  
are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on  
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on  
the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures  
or its risk and control procedures.
 
We read the Directors’ Report and the other information contained  
in the Annual Report for the above year as described in the contents 
section including the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and we consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the financial statements. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report described as having been audited. It also includes 
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the 
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information 
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us 
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report described 
as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we 
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in 
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report described as having been audited.

Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union,  
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 April 2006 and of its  
profit for the year then ended;
the individual Company financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union 
as applied in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 1985, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 30 April 2006; 
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report described as having been audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulations; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the 
financial statements. 
Separate opinion in relation to IFRS 
As explained in note 1 to the financial statements, the Group, in addition 
to complying with its legal obligation to comply with IFRS as adopted for 
use in the European Union, has also complied with the IFRS as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board. Accordingly, in our 
opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance 
with IFRS, of the state of the Group’s and Company’s affairs as at  
30 April 2006 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended.

Notes:  An audit does not provide assurance on the maintenance and 
integrity of the website, including controls used to achieve this, and in 
particular on whether any changes may have occurred to the financial 
statements since first published. These matters are the responsibility of 
the directors but no control procedures can provide absolute assurance 
in this area.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements differs from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

1 Accounting policies
The	 principal	 accounting	 policies	 adopted	 in	 the	 preparation	 of	 these	 financial	 statements	 are	 set	 out	 below.	 These	 policies	 have	 been	 consistently	 applied	 to	 all	 the	 years	 presented,	 unless	 otherwise	 stated.
Basis of preparation
These	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards	 (IFRS)	 and	 IFRIC	 interpretations	 	 and	 with	 those	 parts	 of	 the	 Companies	 Act,	 1985	 applicable	 to	 companies	 reporting	 under	 IFRS.	 The	 disclosures	 required	 by	 IFRS	 1,	 First	 Time	 Adoption	 of	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards,	 for	 the	 transition	 from	 UK	 GAAP	 to	 IFRS	 are	 provided	 in	 note	 28.	 Accordingly,	 the	 Group	 complies	 with	 all	 IFRS,	 including	 those	 adopted	 for	 use	 in	 the	 European	 Union.	 The	 financial	 statements	 have	 been	 prepared	 under	 the	 historical	 	 cost	 convention,	 modified	 for	 certain	 items	 carried	 at	 fair	 value,	 as	 stated	 in	 the	 accounting	 policies.	 A	 summary	 of	 the	 more	 important	 accounting	 policies	 is	 set	 out	 below.
The	 Group,	 as	 a	 first-time	 IFRS	 reporter,	 has	 adopted	 early	 with	 effect	 from	 1	 May	 2004	 the	 following	 standards	 and	 interpretations	 as	 at	 30	 April	 2006,	 the	 reporting	 date	 for	 the	 Group’s	 first	 IFRS	 financial	 statements:
IAS	 19	 Employee	 benefits	 amended.
IFRIC	 4	 Determining	 whether	 an	 arrangement	 contains	 a	 lease.
At	 the	 date	 of	 authorisation	 of	 these	 financial	 statements,	 IFRS	 7,	 Financial	 Instruments:	 Disclosures	 and	 the	 related	 amendment	 to	 IAS	 1,	 Presentation	 of	 Financial	 Statements,	 on	 capital	 disclosures,	 were	 in	 issue	 but	 not	 yet	 effective	 and	 have	 not	 been	 applied.	 Adoption	 will	 have	 no	 material	 impact	 on	 the	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Group	 except	 for	 additional	 disclosures	 on	 capital	 and	 financial	 instruments	 when	 the	 standards	 come	 into	 effect	 for	 periods	 commencing	 on	 or	 after	 1	 January	 2007.
The	 preparation	 of	 financial	 statements	 in	 conformity	 with	 generally	 accepted	 accounting	 principles	 requires	 management	 to	 use	 estimates	 and	 assumptions	 that	 affect	 the	 reported	 amounts	 of	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 at	 the	 date	 of	 the	 financial	 statements	 and	 the	 reported	 amount	 of	 revenue	 	 and	 expenses	 during	 the	 reporting	 period.	 Actual	 results	 could	 differ	 from	 these	 estimates.	 Basis of consolidation
The	 Group	 financial	 statements	 incorporate	 the	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Company	 and	 all	 its	 subsidiaries	 for	 the	 year	 to	 30	 April	 each	 year.	 The	 results	 of	 businesses	 acquired	 or	 sold	 during	 the	 year	 are	 incorporated	 for	 the	 periods	 from	 or	 to	 the	 date	 on	 which	 control	 passed	 and	 acquisitions	 are	 accounted	 for	 under	 the	 acquisition	 method.	 Control	 is	 achieved	 when	 the	 Group	 has	 the	 power	 to	 govern	 the	 financial	 and	 operating	 policies	 of	 an	 entity	 so	 as	 to	 obtain	 the	 benefits	 from	 its	 activities.
Foreign currency translation 
Assets	 and	 liabilities	 in	 foreign	 currencies	 are	 translated	 into	 sterling	 at	 rates	 of	 exchange	 ruling	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 Profit	 and	 loss	 accounts	 and	 cash	 flows	 of	 overseas	 subsidiary	 undertakings	 are	 translated	 into	 sterling	 at	 average	 rates	 of	 exchange	 for	 the	 year.	 The	 exchange	 rates	 used	 	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 US	 dollar	 are:
	 	 	 	 	 	 	 2006	 2005
Average	 for	 year	 	 	 	 	 	 1.7751	 1.8624
Year	 end	 	 	 	 	 	 	 1.8176	 1.9099
Exchange	 differences	 arising	 from	 the	 retranslation	 of	 the	 opening	 net	 investment	 of	 overseas	 subsidiaries	 and	 the	 difference	 between	 the	 inclusion	 of	 their	 profits	 at	 average	 rates	 of	 exchange	 in	 the	 Group	 income	 statement	 and	 the	 closing	 rate	 are	 recognised	 directly	 in	 a	 separate	 component	 of	 equity.	 Other	 exchange	 differences	 are	 dealt	 with	 in	 the	 income	 statement.

Revenue
Revenue	 represents	 the	 total	 amount	 receivable	 for	 the	 provision	 of	 goods	 and	 services	 to	 customers	 net	 of	 returns	 and	 value	 added	 tax.	 Rental	 revenue,	 including	 loss	 damage	 waiver	 fees,	 is	 recognised	 on	 a	 straight	 line	 basis	 over	 the	 period	 of	 the	 rental	 contract.	 Because	 the	 terms	 and	 conditions	 of	 a	 rental	 contract	 can	 extend	 across	 financial	 reporting	 period	 ends,	 the	 Group	 records	 unbilled	 rental	 revenue	 and	 deferred	 revenue	 	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 reporting	 periods	 so	 rental	 revenue	 is	 appropriately	 stated	 in	 the	 financial	 statements.
Revenue	 from	 rental	 equipment	 delivery	 and	 collection	 is	 recognised	 when	 delivery	 or	 collection	 has	 occurred.
Revenue	 from	 the	 sale	 of	 new	 equipment,	 parts	 and	 supplies,	 retail	 merchandise	 and	 fuel	 is	 recognised	 at	 the	 time	 of	 delivery	 to,	 or	 collection	 by,	 	 the	 customer	 and	 when	 all	 obligations	 under	 the	 sales	 contract	 have	 been	 fulfilled.
Current/non-current distinction 
Current	 assets	 include	 assets	 held	 primarily	 for	 trading	 purposes,	 cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 and	 assets	 expected	 to	 be	 realised	 in,	 or	 intended	 for	 sale	 or	 consumption	 in,	 the	 course	 of	 the	 Group’s	 operating	 cycle	 and	 those	 assets	 receivable	 within	 one	 year	 from	 the	 reporting	 date.	 All	 other	 assets	 are	 classified	 as	 non-current	 assets.	 Current	 liabilities	 include	 liabilities	 held	 primarily	 for	 trading	 purposes,	 liabilities	 expected	 to	 be	 settled	 in	 the	 course	 of	 the	 Group’s	 operating	 cycle	 	 and	 those	 liabilities	 due	 within	 one	 year	 from	 the	 reporting	 date.	 All	 other	 liabilities	 are	 classified	 as	 non-current	 liabilities.	 Property, plant and equipment
Owned assets
Property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 are	 stated	 at	 cost	 (including	 transportation	 costs	 from	 the	 manufacturer	 to	 the	 initial	 rental	 location)	 less	 accumulated	 depreciation	 and	 any	 provisions	 for	 impairment.	 In	 respect	 of	 aerial	 work	 platforms,	 cost	 includes	 rebuild	 costs	 when	 the	 rebuild	 extends	 the	 asset’s	 useful	 economic	 life	 and	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 incremental	 economic	 benefits	 will	 accrue	 to	 the	 Group.	 Rebuild	 costs	 include	 the	 cost	 of	 transporting	 	 the	 equipment	 to	 and	 from	 the	 rebuild	 facility.	 Additionally,	 depreciation	 is	 not	 charged	 while	 the	 asset	 is	 not	 in	 use	 during	 the	 rebuild	 period.
Leased assets
Finance	 leases	 are	 those	 leases	 which	 transfer	 substantially	 all	 the	 risks	 and	 rewards	 of	 ownership	 to	 the	 lessee.	 Assets	 held	 under	 finance	 leases	 are	 capitalised	 within	 property,	 plant	 and	 equipment	 at	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 leased	 assets	 at	 inception	 of	 the	 lease	 and	 depreciated	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 Group’s	 depreciation	 policy.	 Outstanding	 finance	 lease	 obligations	 are	 included	 within	 debt.	 The	 finance	 element	 of	 the	 agreements	 is	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 on	 a	 systematic	 basis	 over	 the	 term	 of	 the	 lease.	 All	 other	 leases	 are	 operating	 leases,	 the	 rentals	 on	 which	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 on	 a	 straight	 line	 basis	 over	 the	 lease	 term.	 Depreciation
Leasehold	 properties	 are	 depreciated	 on	 a	 straight	 line	 basis	 over	 the	 life	 of	 each	 lease.	 Other	 fixed	 assets,	 including	 those	 held	 under	 finance	 	 leases,	 are	 depreciated	 on	 a	 straight	 line	 basis	 applied	 to	 the	 opening	 cost	 to	 write	 down	 each	 asset	 to	 its	 residual	 value	 over	 its	 useful	 economic	 	 life.	 The	 rates	 in	 use	 are	 as	 follows:	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 Per 	 annum
Freehold	 property	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 2%
Rental	 equipment	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 5% 	 to	 33%	 Motor	 vehicles	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 16% 	 to	 25%
Office	 and	 workshop	 equipment	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 20%
Residual	 values	 are	 estimated	 at	 10%	 of	 cost	 in	 respect	 of	 most	 types	 of	 rental	 equipment,	 zero	 for	 scaffolding	 and	 similar	 equipment,	 15%	 for	 aerial	 work	 platforms	 and	 high	 reach	 forklifts	 and	 20%	 for	 steel	 site	 accommodation	 units.

Gains	 and	 losses	 from	 the	 sale	 of	 used	 equipment	 are	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 as	 other	 income	 on	 transfer	 of	 title	 in	 the	 equipment	 to	 the	 purchaser	 provided	 delivery	 has	 also	 taken	 place	 except	 in	 the	 case	 of	 sales	 of	 rental	 equipment	 lost	 when	 in	 the	 possession	 of	 the	 rental	 customer	 which	 are	 recognised	 when	 the	 loss	 is	 notified	 by	 the	 customer.	 Gains	 or	 losses	 in	 connection	 with	 trade-in	 arrangements	 with	 certain	 manufacturers	 from	 whom	 the	 Group	 purchases	 new	 equipment	 are	 accounted	 for	 at	 the	 lower	 of	 transaction	 value	 or	 fair	 value	 based	 on	 independent	 appraisals.	 If	 the	 trade-in	 price	 of	 a	 unit	 of	 equipment	 exceeds	 the	 fair	 market	 value	 of	 that	 unit,	 the	 excess	 is	 accounted	 for	 as	 a	 reduction	 of	 the	 cost	 of	 the	 related	 purchase	 of	 new	 rental	 equipment.
Repairs and maintenance 
Costs	 incurred	 in	 the	 repair	 and	 maintenance	 of	 rental	 and	 other	 equipment	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 as	 incurred.
Intangible assets
Business combinations and goodwill
Acquisitions	 are	 accounted	 for	 using	 the	 purchase	 method.	 Goodwill	 represents	 the	 difference	 between	 the	 cost	 of	 the	 acquisition	 and	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 net	 identifiable	 assets	 acquired,	 including	 any	 intangible	 assets	 other	 than	 goodwill.	 Adjustments	 to	 the	 fair	 values	 of	 assets	 acquired	 made	 within	 12	 months	 of	 acquisition	 date	 are	 accounted	 for	 from	 the	 date	 of	 acquisition.	 For	 business	 combinations	 prior	 to	 1	 May	 2004,	 but	 after	 30	 April	 1999,	 goodwill	 is	 included	 at	 its	 deemed	 cost,	 which	 represents	 the	 amount	 recorded	 under	 UK	 GAAP	 at	 the	 time	 as	 subsequently	 amortised	 up	 to	 30	 April	 2004.	 Under	 UK	 GAAP	 goodwill	 arising	 on	 acquisitions	 prior	 to	 	 30	 April	 1999	 was	 eliminated	 against	 reserves.	 The	 accounting	 treatment	 of	 business	 combinations	 occurring	 up	 to	 30	 April	 2004,	 the	 date	 of	 transition	 to	 IFRS,	 has	 not	 been	 reconsidered	 as	 permitted	 under	 IFRS	 1,	 First	 Time	 Adoption	 of	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards.	 Goodwill	 is	 stated	 at	 cost	 less	 any	 accumulated	 impairment	 losses	 and	 is	 allocated	 to	 the	 Group’s	 three	 reporting	 units:	 Sunbelt	 Rentals;	 A-Plant;	 	 and	 Ashtead	 Technology.	 The	 profit	 or	 loss	 on	 the	 disposal	 of	 a	 previously	 acquired	 business	 includes	 the	 attributable	 amount	 of	 any	 purchased	 goodwill	 relating	 to	 	 that	 business.	 Impairment of assets
Goodwill	 is	 not	 amortised	 but	 is	 tested	 annually	 for	 impairment	 as	 at	 30	 April	 each	 year.	 Assets	 that	 are	 subject	 to	 amortisation	 or	 depreciation	 are	 reviewed	 for	 impairment	 whenever	 events	 or	 changes	 in	 circumstances	 indicate	 that	 the	 carrying	 amount	 may	 not	 be	 recoverable.	 An	 impairment	 loss	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 for	 the	 amount	 by	 which	 the	 asset’s	 carrying	 amount	 exceeds	 its	 recoverable	 amount.	 For	 the	 purposes	 of	 assessing	 impairment,	 assets	 are	 grouped	 at	 the	 lowest	 levels	 for	 which	 there	 are	 separately	 identifiable	 and	 independent	 cash	 flows	 for	 the	 asset	 being	 tested	 for	 impairment.	 In	 the	 case	 of	 goodwill,	 impairment	 is	 assessed	 at	 the	 level	 of	 the	 Group’s	 three	 reporting	 units.
The	 recoverable	 amount	 is	 the	 higher	 of	 an	 asset’s	 fair	 value	 less	 costs	 to	 sell	 and	 value	 in	 use.	 In	 assessing	 value	 in	 use,	 estimated	 future	 cash	 flows	 are	 discounted	 to	 their	 present	 value	 using	 a	 pre-tax	 discount	 rate	 that	 reflects	 current	 market	 assessments	 of	 the	 time	 value	 of	 money	 and	 the	 risks	 specific	 to	 the	 asset.	 In	 respect	 of	 assets	 other	 than	 goodwill,	 an	 impairment	 loss	 is	 reversed	 if	 there	 has	 been	 a	 change	 in	 the	 estimates	 used	 to	 determine	 the	 recoverable	 amount.	 An	 impairment	 loss	 is	 reversed	 only	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 the	 asset’s	 carrying	 amount	 does	 not	 exceed	 the	 carrying	 amount	 	 that	 would	 have	 been	 determined,	 net	 of	 depreciation	 or	 amortisation,	 if	 no	 impairment	 loss	 had	 been	 recognised.	 Impairment	 losses	 in	 respect	 	 of	 goodwill	 are	 not	 reversed.	 54	 Ashtead Group plc	Annual	report	and	accounts	for	the	year	ended	30	April	2006 International	equipment	rental

Taxation 
The	 tax	 charge	 for	 the	 period	 comprises	 both	 current	 and	 deferred	 tax.	 Taxation	 is	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 except	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 	 it	 relates	 to	 items	 recognised	 directly	 in	 equity,	 in	 which	 case	 it	 is	 recognised	 in	 equity.	 Current	 tax	 is	 the	 expected	 tax	 payable	 on	 the	 taxable	 income	 for	 the	 year	 and	 any	 adjustment	 to	 tax	 payable	 in	 respect	 of	 previous	 years.	 Deferred	 tax	 is	 provided	 using	 the	 balance	 sheet	 liability	 method	 on	 any	 temporary	 differences	 between	 the	 carrying	 amounts	 for	 financial	 reporting	 purposes	 and	 those	 for	 taxation	 purposes.	 Deferred	 tax	 liabilities	 are	 generally	 recognised	 for	 all	 taxable	 temporary	 differences	 and	 deferred	 tax	 assets	 are	 recognised	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 taxable	 profits	 will	 be	 available	 against	 which	 deductible	 temporary	 differences	 can	 be	 utilised.	 Such	 assets	 and	 liabilities	 are	 not	 recognised	 if	 the	 temporary	 differences	 arise	 from	 the	 initial	 recognition	 of	 goodwill.
Deferred	 tax	 liabilities	 are	 not	 recognised	 for	 temporary	 differences	 arising	 on	 investment	 in	 subsidiaries	 where	 the	 Group	 is	 able	 to	 control	 the	 reversal	 of	 the	 temporary	 difference	 and	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 the	 temporary	 difference	 will	 not	 reverse	 in	 the	 foreseeable	 future.	 Deferred	 tax	 is	 calculated	 at	 the	 tax	 rates	 that	 are	 expected	 to	 apply	 in	 the	 period	 when	 the	 liability	 is	 settled	 or	 the	 asset	 is	 realised.	 Deferred	 tax	 assets	 and	 	 liabilities	 are	 offset	 when	 they	 relate	 to	 income	 taxes	 levied	 by	 the	 same	 taxation	 authority	 and	 the	 Group	 intends	 to	 settle	 its	 current	 tax	 assets	 	 and	 liabilities	 on	 a	 net	 basis.
Inventories
Inventories,	 which	 comprise	 fuel,	 merchandise	 and	 spare	 parts,	 are	 valued	 at	 the	 lower	 of	 cost	 and	 net	 realisable	 value.
Trade receivables
Trade	 receivables	 do	 not	 carry	 interest	 and	 are	 stated	 at	 nominal	 value	 as	 reduced	 by	 appropriate	 allowances	 for	 estimated	 irrecoverable	 amounts.
Trade payables
Trade	 payables	 are	 not	 interest	 bearing	 and	 are	 stated	 at	 nominal	 value.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash	 and	 cash	 equivalents	 comprise	 cash	 balances	 and	 call	 deposits	 with	 maturity	 of	 less	 than,	 or	 equal	 to,	 three	 months.
Employee benefits 
Defined contribution pension plans
Obligations	 under	 the	 Group’s	 defined	 contribution	 plans	 are	 recognised	 as	 an	 expense	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 as	 incurred.	 Defined benefit pension plans
The	 Group’s	 obligation	 in	 respect	 of	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 plans	 is	 calculated	 by	 estimating	 the	 amount	 of	 future	 benefit	 that	 employees	 have	 earned	 in	 return	 for	 their	 service	 in	 the	 current	 and	 prior	 periods;	 that	 benefit	 is	 discounted	 to	 determine	 its	 present	 value	 and	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 plan	 assets	 is	 deducted.	 The	 discount	 rate	 is	 the	 yield	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 on	 AA	 rated	 corporate	 bonds.	 The	 calculation	 is	 performed	 by	 a	 qualified	 actuary	 using	 the	 projected	 unit	 credit	 method.	 In	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 1	 the	 Group	 chose	 to	 recognise	 the	 full	 pension	 deficit	 on	 the	 balance	 sheet	 at	 30	 April	 2004.	 The	 Group	 also	 took	 the	 option	 of	 adopting	 early	 the	 amendment	 to	 IAS	 19	 (Employee	 Benefits)	 issued	 on	 16	 December	 2004.	 As	 a	 result,	 actuarial	 gains	 and	 losses	 are	 recognised	 in	 full	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 they	 arise	 through	 the	 statement	 of	 recognised	 income	 and	 expense.	 The	 increase	 in	 the	 present	 value	 of	 	 plan	 liabilities	 arising	 from	 employee	 service	 during	 the	 period	 is	 charged	 to	 operating	 profit.	 The	 expected	 return	 on	 plan	 assets	 and	 the	 expected	 increase	 during	 the	 period	 in	 the	 present	 value	 of	 plan	 liabilities	 due	 to	 unwind	 of	 the	 discount	 are	 included	 in	 investment	 income	 and	 interest	 expense,	 respectively.
Share based compensation 
The	 fair	 value	 of	 awards	 made	 under	 share	 based	 compensation	 plans	 is	 measured	 at	 grant	 date	 and	 spread	 over	 the	 vesting	 period	 through	 the	 income	 statement	 with	 a	 corresponding	 increase	 in	 equity.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 share	 options	 and	 awards	 is	 measured	 using	 an	 appropriate	 valuation	 model	 taking	 into	 account	 the	 terms	 and	 conditions	 of	 the	 individual	 scheme.	 The	 amount	 recognised	 as	 an	 expense	 is	 adjusted	 to	 reflect	 the	 	 actual	 awards	 vesting	 except	 where	 any	 change	 in	 the	 awards	 vesting	 relates	 only	 to	 market	 based	 criteria	 not	 being	 achieved.

Insurance
Insurance	 costs	 include	 insurance	 premiums	 which	 are	 written	 off	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 over	 the	 period	 to	 which	 they	 relate	 and	 an	 estimate	 of	 	 the	 discounted	 liability	 for	 uninsured	 retained	 risks	 on	 unpaid	 claims	 incurred	 up	 to	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 The	 estimate	 includes	 events	 incurred	 	 but	 not	 reported	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 This	 estimate	 is	 discounted	 and	 included	 in	 provisions	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet.
Investment income and interest expense
Investment	 income	 comprises	 interest	 receivable	 on	 funds	 invested,	 fair	 value	 gains	 on	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 and	 the	 expected	 return	 	 on	 plan	 assets	 in	 respect	 of	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 plans.
Interest	 expense	 comprises	 interest	 payable	 on	 borrowings,	 amortisation	 of	 deferred	 finance	 costs,	 fair	 value	 losses	 on	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 and	 the	 expected	 increase	 in	 plan	 liabilities	 in	 respect	 of	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 schemes.
Financial instruments
Details	 of	 the	 Group’s	 treasury	 policies	 are	 set	 out	 in	 the	 Business	 and	 Financial	 Review	 on	 pages	 33	 to	 44.
Derivatives 
The	 Group	 uses	 a	 limited	 number	 of	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 to	 hedge	 its	 exposure	 to	 fluctuations	 in	 interest	 and	 foreign	 exchange	 rates.	 These	 are	 principally	 swap	 agreements	 used	 to	 manage	 the	 balance	 between	 fixed	 and	 floating	 rate	 finance	 on	 long	 term	 debt	 and	 forward	 	 contracts	 for	 known	 future	 foreign	 currency	 cash	 flows.	 The	 Group	 does	 not	 hold	 or	 issue	 derivative	 instruments	 for	 speculative	 purposes.
All	 derivatives	 are	 held	 at	 fair	 value	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 within	 trade	 and	 other	 receivables	 or	 trade	 and	 other	 payables.	 Changes	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 derivative	 financial	 instruments	 that	 are	 designated	 and	 effective	 as	 hedges	 of	 future	 cash	 flows	 are	 recognised	 directly	 in	 equity.	 The	 gain	 or	 loss	 relating	 to	 the	 ineffective	 portion	 is	 recognised	 immediately	 in	 the	 income	 statement.	 Amounts	 deferred	 in	 equity	 are	 recognised	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 in	 the	 same	 period	 in	 which	 the	 hedged	 item	 affects	 profit	 or	 loss.	 Changes	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 any	 derivative	 instruments	 that	 are	 not	 	 hedge	 accounted	 are	 recognised	 immediately	 in	 the	 income	 statement.
Secured notes
The	 Group’s	 secured	 notes	 contain	 early	 prepayment	 options,	 which	 constitute	 embedded	 derivatives	 in	 accordance	 with	 IAS	 39,	 Financial	 Instruments:	 Recognition	 and	 Measurement.	 At	 the	 date	 of	 issue	 the	 liability	 component	 of	 the	 notes	 is	 estimated	 using	 prevailing	 market	 interest	 rates	 for	 similar	 debt	 with	 no	 prepayment	 option	 and	 is	 recorded	 within	 borrowings.	 The	 difference	 between	 the	 proceeds	 of	 the	 note	 issue	 and	 	 the	 fair	 value	 assigned	 to	 the	 liability	 component,	 representing	 the	 embedded	 option	 to	 prepay	 the	 notes	 is	 included	 within	 ‘Other	 financial	 assets	 –	 derivatives’.	 The	 interest	 expense	 on	 the	 liability	 component	 is	 calculated	 by	 applying	 the	 effective	 interest	 rate	 method.	 The	 embedded	 option	 to	 prepay	 is	 fair	 valued	 using	 an	 appropriate	 valuation	 model	 with	 fair	 value	 remeasurement	 gains	 and	 losses	 being	 included	 in	 ‘Investment	 income’	 	 or	 ‘Interest	 expense’.
Convertible debt
Convertible	 debt	 is	 regarded	 as	 a	 compound	 instrument,	 consisting	 of	 a	 liability	 and	 an	 equity	 component.	 At	 the	 date	 of	 issue,	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 liability	 component	 is	 estimated	 using	 the	 prevailing	 market	 interest	 rate	 for	 similar	 non-convertible	 debt	 and	 is	 recorded	 within	 borrowings.	 The	 difference	 between	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 convertible	 debt	 at	 issue	 and	 the	 fair	 value	 assigned	 to	 the	 liability	 component,	 representing	 the	 embedded	 option	 to	 convert	 the	 liability	 into	 equity	 of	 the	 Group	 is	 included	 in	 equity.
The	 interest	 expense	 on	 the	 liability	 component	 is	 calculated	 by	 applying	 the	 effective	 interest	 rate	 for	 similar	 non-convertible	 debt	 to	 the	 liability	 component	 of	 the	 instrument.	 The	 difference	 between	 this	 amount	 and	 the	 interest	 paid	 is	 added	 to	 the	 carrying	 amount	 of	 the	 convertible	 debt.
Exceptional items
Exceptional	 items	 are	 those	 items	 that	 are	 material	 and	 non-recurring	 in	 nature	 that	 the	 Group	 believes	 should	 be	 disclosed	 separately	 to	 assist	 	 in	 the	 understanding	 of	 the	 financial	 performance	 of	 the	 Group. 56	 Ashtead Group plc	Annual	report	and	accounts	for	the	year	ended	30	April	2006 International	equipment	rental

Earnings per share
Earnings	 per	 share	 is	 calculated	 based	 on	 the	 profit	 for	 the	 financial	 year	 and	 the	 weighted	 average	 number	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 issue	 during	 the	 year.	 For	 this	 purpose	 the	 number	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 in	 issue	 excludes	 shares	 held	 by	 the	 ESOT	 and	 shares	 registered	 in	 the	 name	 of	 employees	 but,	 subject	 to	 forfeiture	 if	 performance	 targets	 are	 not	 achieved,	 in	 respect	 of	 which	 dividends	 have	 been	 waived.	 Diluted	 earnings	 per	 share	 is	 calculated	 using	 the	 profit	 for	 the	 financial	 year	 and	 the	 weighted	 average	 diluted	 number	 of	 shares	 (ignoring	 any	 potential	 issue	 of	 ordinary	 shares	 which	 would	 be	 anti-dilutive)	 during	 the	 year.
Underlying	 earnings	 per	 share	 comprises	 basic	 earnings	 per	 share	 adjusted	 to	 exclude	 earnings	 relating	 to	 exceptional	 items	 and	 fair	 value	 remeasurements	 of	 embedded	 derivatives	 in	 long-term	 debt.	 Cash	 tax	 earnings	 per	 share	 comprises	 underlying	 earnings	 per	 share	 adjusted	 to	 exclude	 deferred	 taxation.	 Provisions
Provisions	 are	 recognised	 when	 the	 Group	 has	 a	 present	 obligation	 as	 a	 result	 of	 a	 past	 event,	 and	 it	 is	 probable	 that	 the	 Group	 will	 be	 required	 to	 settle	 that	 obligation.	 Provisions	 are	 measured	 at	 the	 directors’	 best	 estimate	 of	 the	 expenditure	 required	 to	 settle	 the	 obligation	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 and	 are	 discounted	 to	 present	 value	 where	 the	 effect	 is	 material.
Employee Share Ownership Trust
Shares	 in	 the	 Company	 acquired	 by	 the	 Employee	 Share	 Ownership	 Trust	 in	 the	 open	 market	 for	 use	 in	 connection	 with	 employee	 share	 plans	 are	 presented	 as	 a	 deduction	 from	 shareholders’	 funds	 together	 with	 shares	 transferred	 by	 the	 ESOT	 to	 employees	 and	 registered	 in	 the	 employees’	 name	 but	 subject	 to	 mandatory	 return	 to	 the	 ESOT	 if	 performance	 targets	 are	 not	 achieved.	 Where	 these	 shares	 are	 subject	 to	 commitments	 to	 release	 them	 to	 employees	 (subject	 to	 the	 attainment	 of	 performance	 targets)	 in	 connection	 with	 the	 Group’s	 long	 term	 incentive	 plans,	 then	 provision	 is	 made	 by	 way	 of	 a	 charge	 against	 profits	 to	 write	 off	 the	 estimated	 cost	 of	 the	 shares	 over	 the	 performance	 period	 which	 is	 normally	 three	 years.	 When	 the	 shares	 vest	 to	 satisfy	 share	 based	 payments,	 a	 transfer	 is	 made	 from	 shares	 held	 in	 treasury	 to	 retained	 earnings.	 Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current	 assets	 held	 for	 sale	 are	 measured	 at	 the	 lower	 of	 carrying	 amount	 and	 fair	 value	 less	 costs	 to	 sell.	 Such	 assets	 are	 classified	 as	 held	 for	 sale	 if	 their	 carrying	 amount	 will	 be	 recovered	 through	 a	 sale	 transaction	 rather	 than	 through	 continuing	 use.	 Such	 assets	 are	 not	 depreciated.	 Assets	 are	 regarded	 as	 held	 for	 sale	 only	 when	 the	 sale	 is	 highly	 probable	 and	 the	 asset	 is	 available	 for	 sale	 in	 its	 present	 condition.	 Management	 must	 be	 committed	 to	 the	 sale	 which	 must	 be	 expected	 to	 qualify	 for	 recognition	 as	 a	 completed	 sale	 within	 one	 year	 from	 the	 date	 of	 classification.
Borrowings
Interest	 bearing	 bank	 loans	 and	 overdrafts	 are	 recorded	 at	 the	 proceeds	 received,	 net	 of	 direct	 transaction	 costs.	 Finance	 charges,	 including	 direct	 transaction	 costs,	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 using	 the	 effective	 interest	 rate	 method.	 Revolving	 tranches	 of	 borrowings	 and	 overdrafts	 which	 mature	 on	 a	 regular	 basis	 are	 classified	 as	 current	 or	 non-current	 liabilities	 based	 on	 the	 maturity	 of	 the	 relevant	 facility.

On	 14	 November	 2005,	 the	 Group	 agreed	 amended	 terms	 with	 the	 syndicate	 of	 lenders	 who	 make	 available	 its	 first	 priority	 asset	 based	 senior	 secured	 loan	 facility	 (the	 “ABL	 facility”)	 to	 increase	 the	 amount,	 extend	 the	 maturity,	 reduce	 the	 number	 of	 covenants	 and	 lower	 the	 cost	 of	 the	 	 facility.	 Following	 this	 amendment,	 the	 ABL	 facility	 consists	 of	 a	 $525m	 revolving	 credit	 facility	 and	 a	 $272m	 term	 loan	 and	 is	 secured	 by	 a	 first	 	 priority	 interest	 in	 substantially	 all	 of	 the	 Group’s	 assets.	 Pricing	 is	 based	 on	 the	 ratio	 of	 funded	 debt	 to	 EBITDA	 according	 to	 a	 grid	 which	 varies,	 depending	 on	 leverage	 from	 LIBOR	 plus	 250bp	 to	 LIBOR	 plus	 175bp	 for	 term	 borrowings	 and	 LIBOR	 plus	 150bp	 for	 revolver	 borrowings.	 	 At	 30	 April	 2006	 the	 Group’s	 borrowing	 rate	 was	 LIBOR	 plus	 150bp	 on	 revolver	 borrowings	 and	 LIBOR	 plus	 175bp	 on	 term	 borrowings.	 The	 ABL	 facility	 carries	 minimal	 amortisation	 of	 1%	 per	 annum	 ($2.75m)	 on	 the	 term	 loan	 and	 is	 committed	 until	 November	 2010.	 The	 ABL	 facility	 includes	 a	 springing	 covenant	 package	 under	 which	 quarterly	 financial	 performance	 covenants	 are	 only	 tested	 if	 available	 liquidity	 is	 less	 than	 	 $50	 million.	 Available	 liquidity	 at	 30	 April	 2006	 was	 £155.9m	 ($283.4m)	 reflecting	 drawings	 under	 the	 facility	 at	 that	 date	 together	 with	 outstanding	 letters	 of	 credit	 of	 £15.4m	 ($27.9m).	 As	 the	 ABL	 facility	 is	 asset-based,	 the	 maximum	 amount	 available	 to	 be	 borrowed	 (which	 includes	 drawings	 in	 the	 form	 of	 standby	 letters	 of	 credit)	 depends	 on	 asset	 values	 (receivables,	 inventory,	 rental	 equipment	 and	 real	 estate)	 which	 are	 subject	 to	 periodic	 independent	 appraisal.	 The	 maximum	 amount	 which	 could	 be	 drawn	 at	 30	 April	 2006	 was	 limited	 to	 the	 facility	 size	 of	 $797.3m	 (£438.7m)	 because	 the	 relevant	 asset	 values	 exceeded	 the	 facility	 size	 by	 $46.0m	 (£25.3m).	 66	 Ashtead Group plc	 Annual	report	and	accounts	for	the	year	ended	30	April	2006 International	equipment	rental

Cash Incentive Plan
The	 Cash	 Incentive	 Plan	 (‘CIP’)	 is	 an	 award	 of	 units	 which	 are	 subject	 to	 the	 same	 performance	 conditions	 as	 apply	 to	 the	 Company’s	 unapproved	 share	 option	 scheme.	 Awards	 were	 granted	 under	 this	 plan	 in	 2000	 and	 2001	 and	 are	 exercisable	 up	 to	 February	 2010	 and	 2011,	 respectively,	 as	 all	 performance	 conditions	 have	 been	 satisfied.	 On	 exercise	 by	 the	 option	 holder,	 the	 difference	 between	 the	 mid-market	 price	 of	 Ashtead	 Group	 plc	 shares	 on	 that	 day	 and	 the	 grant	 price	 of	 102p	 and	 125p,	 for	 the	 2000	 and	 2001	 awards	 respectively,	 multiplied	 by	 the	 number	 of	 units	 held	 will	 be	 paid	 by	 way	 of	 a	 cash	 award	 to	 the	 holder,	 net	 of	 applicable	 taxes.
In	 2006	 the	 charge	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 CIP	 was	 £558,000	 (2005:	 £140,000).	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 awards	 at	 30	 April	 2006	 was	 based	 on	 the	 share	 price	 on	 that	 date.
	 Investment Incentive Plan
Details	 of	 the	 Investment	 Incentive	 Plan	 (‘IIP’)	 are	 given	 on	 page	 25.	 The	 costs	 of	 this	 scheme	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 over	 the	 vesting	 period,	 based	 upon	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 award	 at	 the	 grant	 date	 and	 the	 likelihood	 of	 allocations	 vesting	 under	 the	 scheme.	 In	 2006	 the	 charge	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 IIP	 was	 £160,000	 (2005:	 £106,000).	 No	 awards	 were	 granted	 under	 the	 IIP	 in	 2006.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 awards	 granted	 during	 2005	 	 was	 estimated	 using	 a	 Black-Scholes	 option	 pricing	 model	 with	 the	 following	 assumptions:	 share	 price	 at	 grant	 date	 of	 48.50p,	 nil	 exercise	 price,	 	 no	 dividend	 yield,	 volatility	 of	 125.41%,	 a	 risk	 free	 rate	 of	 4.878%	 and	 an	 expected	 life	 of	 three	 years.	 Expected	 volatility	 was	 determined	 by	 calculating	 the	 historical	 volatility	 over	 the	 previous	 three	 years.	 The	 expected	 life	 used	 in	 the	 model	 is	 based	 on	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 plan.

The	 costs	 of	 this	 scheme	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 over	 	 the	 vesting	 period,	 based	 on	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 award	 at	 the	 grant	 date	 and	 the	 likelihood	 of	 allocations	 vesting	 under	 the	 scheme.	 In	 2006,	 the	 charge	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 PSP	 was	 £828,000	 (2005:	 £200,000).
The	 fair	 value	 of	 awards	 granted	 during	 the	 year	 is	 estimated	 using	 a	 Black-Scholes	 option	 pricing	 model	 with	 the	 following	 assumptions:	 share	 price	 at	 grant	 date	 of	 113.5p,	 nil	 exercise	 price,	 no	 dividend	 yield,	 volatility	 of	 97.90%,	 a	 risk	 free	 rate	 of	 4.219%	 and	 an	 expected	 life	 of	 three	 years.	 Expected	 volatility	 was	 determined	 by	 calculating	 the	 historical	 volatility	 over	 the	 previous	 three	 years.	 The	 expected	 life	 used	 in	 the	 model	 is	 based	 on	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 plan.
Discretionary share option schemes
Details	 of	 the	 discretionary	 share	 option	 schemes	 are	 given	 on	 page	 25.	 In	 accordance	 with	 the	 transitional	 provisions	 of	 IFRS	 2:	 ‘Share-based	 payments’,	 the	 Group	 has	 not	 recognised	 any	 expense	 for	 these	 schemes	 as	 they	 were	 all	 granted	 prior	 to	 7	 November	 2002.	 72	 Ashtead Group plc	Annual	report	and	accounts	for	the	year	ended	30	April	2006 International	equipment	rental

Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE) schemes
The	 costs	 of	 SAYE	 schemes	 are	 charged	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 over	 the	 vesting	 period	 based	 upon	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 award	 at	 the	 grant	 date.	 In	 2006	 the	 charge	 in	 respect	 of	 SAYE	 schemes	 was	 £400,000	 (2005:	 £290,000).
The	 fair	 value	 of	 awards	 granted	 during	 the	 year	 is	 estimated	 using	 a	 Black-Scholes	 option	 pricing	 model	 with	 the	 following	 assumptions:	 share	 price	 at	 grant	 date	 of	 136.75p,	 exercise	 price	 of	 115.43p,	 no	 dividend	 yield,	 volatility	 of	 110.00%,	 a	 risk	 free	 rate	 of	 4.182%	 and	 an	 expected	 life	 of	 three	 years.

The	 Group	 operates	 pension	 plans	 for	 the	 benefit	 of	 qualifying	 employees.	 The	 major	 plans	 for	 new	 employees	 throughout	 the	 Group	 are	 all	 defined	 contribution	 plans	 following	 the	 introduction	 of	 the	 new	 stakeholder	 pension	 plan	 for	 UK	 employees	 in	 May	 2002.	 Pension	 costs	 for	 defined	 contribution	 plans	 were	 £1.8m	 (2005:	 £1.5m).
The	 Group	 also	 has	 a	 defined	 benefit	 plan	 for	 UK	 employees	 which	 was	 closed	 to	 new	 members	 in	 2001.	 This	 plan	 is	 a	 funded	 defined	 benefit	 	 plan	 with	 trustee	 administered	 assets	 held	 separately	 from	 those	 of	 the	 Group.	 It	 was	 valued	 by	 the	 actuaries	 under	 IAS	 19,	 Employee	 Benefits,	 	 at	 30	 April	 2006.	 The	 principal	 assumptions	 made	 by	 the	 actuary	 were	 as	 follows:
	 	 	 	 	 	 	 2006	 2005
Rate	 of	 increase	 in	 salaries	 	 	 	 	 	 	 4.00%	 3.75%

	 The 	 acquired	 businesses	 have	 been	 integrated	 into	 Sunbelt	 and	 A-Plant	 and	 the	 acquired	 rental	 fleets	 reorganised	 through	 additions,	 disposals	 and	 transfers	 of	 equipment.	 Accordingly,	 it	 is	 not	 practicable	 to	 disclose	 separately	 the	 revenue	 and	 profit	 of	 the	 acquired	 assets.

25 Contingent liabilities
The	 Group	 is	 subject	 to	 periodic	 legal	 claims	 in	 the	 ordinary	 course	 of	 its	 business.	 However,	 the	 claims	 outstanding	 at	 30	 April	 2006,	 net	 of	 provisions	 held,	 are	 not	 expected	 to	 have	 a	 significant	 impact	 on	 the	 Group’s	 financial	 position.	 The	 Company	 has	 guaranteed	 the	 borrowings	 of	 its	 subsidiary	 undertakings	 under	 the	 Group’s	 senior	 secured	 credit	 and	 overdraft	 facilities.	 	 At	 30	 April	 2006	 the	 amount	 borrowed	 under	 these	 facilities	 was	 £272.0m	 (30	 April	 2005:	 £225.4m).	 Additionally,	 subsidiary	 undertakings	 are	 	 able	 to	 obtain	 letters	 of	 credit	 under	 these	 facilities	 which	 are	 also	 guaranteed	 by	 the	 Company	 and,	 at	 30	 April	 2006,	 letters	 of	 credit	 issued	 	 under	 these	 arrangements	 totalled	 £15.4m	 (US$27.9m).	 Additionally,	 the	 Company	 has	 guaranteed	 the	 remaining	 outstanding	 12%	 second	 	 priority	 senior	 secured	 notes	 with	 a	 par	 value	 of	 £78m	 and	 8.625%	 second	 priority	 senior	 secured	 notes	 with	 a	 par	 value	 of	 $250m	 (£137.5m),	 	 both	 issued	 by	 Ashtead	 Holdings	 plc.
The	 Company	 has	 guaranteed	 operating	 and	 finance	 lease	 commitments	 of	 subsidiary	 undertakings	 where	 the	 minimum	 lease	 commitment	 	 at	 30	 April	 2006	 totalled	 £77.1m	 (2005	 –	 £63.1m)	 in	 respect	 of	 land	 and	 buildings	 and	 £19.0m	 (2005:	 £21.4m)	 in	 respect	 of	 other	 lease	 rentals	 	 of	 which	 £5.6m	 and	 £6.1m	 respectively	 is	 payable	 by	 subsidiary	 undertakings	 in	 the	 year	 ending	 30	 April	 2007.
The	 Company	 has	 guaranteed	 the	 performance	 by	 subsidiaries	 of	 certain	 other	 obligations	 up	 to	 £1.1m	 (2005:	 £1.6m).	 26 Capital commitments
At	 30	 April	 2006	 capital	 commitments	 in	 respect	 of	 purchases	 of	 rental	 and	 other	 equipment	 totalled	 £119.0m	 (2005:	 £39.8m),	 all	 of	 which	 had	 been	 ordered.	 There	 were	 no	 other	 material	 capital	 commitments	 at	 the	 year-end.

28 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued
Explanation of reconciling items from UK GAAP to IFRS
(a)	The 	 Group’s	 revolving	 accounts	 receivable	 securitisation	 programme	 was	 disclosed	 under	 a	 linked	 presentation	 under	 UK	 GAAP.	 The	 application	 of	 IAS	 39	 has	 removed	 the	 linked	 presentation	 and	 the	 funding	 received	 has	 been	 reclassified	 as	 debt.	 This	 affects	 the	 opening	 balance	 sheet	 at	 30	 April	 2004	 by	 increasing	 trade	 receivables	 and	 debt	 by	 £52.2m.	 The	 accounts	 receivable	 securitisation	 was	 refinanced	 through	 the	 Group’s	 new	 first	 priority	 senior	 secured	 credit	 facility	 in	 November	 2004.
(b)	 The	 Group	 reclassified	 certain	 leases	 (mainly	 related	 to	 our	 delivery	 fleet)	 previously	 accounted	 for	 as	 operating	 leases	 as	 capital	 leases	 under	 UK	 GAAP	 in	 the	 second	 half	 of	 2004/5.	 Under	 IAS	 8	 (Accounting	 Policies,	 Changes	 in	 Accounting	 Estimates	 and	 Errors)	 the	 prior	 period	 element	 of	 this	 adjustment	 has	 been	 recorded	 at	 the	 date	 of	 transition.
(c)	 The	 Group	 has	 taken	 the	 exemption	 from	 applying	 IFRS	 3	 (Business	 Combinations)	 to	 acquisitions	 occurring	 before	 1	 May	 2004.	 The	 goodwill	 arising	 from	 acquisitions	 occurring	 before	 that	 date	 remains	 at	 the	 amount	 shown	 under	 UK	 GAAP	 at	 1	 May	 2004	 except	 that	 the	 Group	 has	 elected	 to	 translate	 foreign	 currency	 denominated	 goodwill	 at	 exchange	 rates	 ruling	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date	 rather	 than	 the	 historical	 rate	 ruling	 at	 the	 time	 of	 the	 acquisition.	 This	 reduces	 the	 amount	 of	 goodwill	 by	 £16.7m	 in	 the	 opening	 IFRS	 balance	 sheet	 and	 £24.7m	 at	 30	 April	 2005	 	 from	 that	 reported	 previously	 under	 UK	 GAAP.	 The	 goodwill	 amortisation	 under	 UK	 GAAP	 of	 £8.9m	 was	 reversed	 at	 30	 April	 2005	 resulting	 in	 	 an	 overall	 reduction	 in	 goodwill	 at	 30	 April	 2005	 of	 £15.8m.
(d)	 The	 Group	 has	 elected	 to	 adopt	 IAS	 32	 (Financial	 Instruments:	 Disclosure	 and	 Presentation)	 and	 IAS	 39	 (Financial	 Instruments:	 Recognition	 and	 Measurement)	 from	 1	 May	 2004.	 	 IAS 	 32	 requires	 the	 debt	 and	 equity	 components	 of	 a	 compound	 financial	 instrument	 to	 be	 recognised	 separately	 in	 the	 financial	 statements.	 	 The	 5.25%	 unsecured	 convertible	 loan	 note	 is	 a	 compound	 financial	 instrument.	 Under	 UK	 GAAP	 the	 loan	 note	 was	 recorded	 as	 debt	 at	 a	 fair	 value	 of	 £121.3m	 when	 issued	 in	 June	 2000	 and	 was	 being	 accreted	 to	 the	 face	 value	 of	 the	 loan	 note	 (£134.0m)	 over	 the	 life	 of	 the	 instrument.	 	 IFRS 	 requires	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 debt	 component	 of	 the	 instrument	 alone	 (£97.0m)	 to	 be	 recognised	 as	 debt	 when	 issued	 and	 accreted	 	 to	 the	 face	 value	 of	 the	 loan	 (£134.0m)	 over	 the	 life	 of	 the	 instrument	 and	 the	 balance	 (£24.3m)	 to	 be	 recognised	 as	 equity	 at	 the	 date	 the	 	 loan	 note	 was	 issued.	 Consequently,	 the	 interest	 charge	 is	 increased	 under	 IFRS	 to	 make	 the	 interest	 expense	 (the	 5.25%	 coupon	 plus	 debt	 amortisation)	 equivalent	 to	 that	 for	 a	 similar	 instrument,	 issued	 at	 the	 same	 time	 and	 with	 the	 same	 maturity,	 but	 without	 equity	 conversion	 rights.	 	 Accordingly, 	 the	 opening	 IFRS	 balance	 sheet	 at	 30	 April	 2004	 includes:
the	 equity	 component	 of	 the	 instrument,	 £24.3m;	 and	 debt	 at	 amortised	 cost	 of	 £116.8m	 (being	 the	 £97.0m	 recognised	 on	 issue	 plus	 the	 accumulated	 discount	 amortisation	 to	 30	 April	 2004).
	 As 	 a	 result,	 debt	 at	 30	 April	 2005	 is	 £10.9m	 lower	 than	 reported	 previously	 under	 UK	 GAAP.	 In	 addition,	 due	 to	 the	 amortisation	 of	 the	 discount,	 interest	 expense	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 30	 April	 2005	 is	 £3.0m	 higher	 than	 reported	 previously	 under	 UK	 GAAP.
(e)	 The	 Group	 has	 a	 $100m	 fixed/floating	 interest	 rate	 swap	 to	 mitigate	 its	 exposure	 to	 increasing	 interest	 rates.	 Under	 UK	 GAAP	 the	 swap	 was	 accounted	 for	 using	 hedge	 accounting	 principles.	 Under	 IFRS,	 the	 Group	 is	 required	 to	 fair	 value	 such	 instruments	 and	 reflect	 their	 fair	 value	 in	 its	 financial	 records.	 The	 fair	 value	 gain	 or	 loss	 is	 taken	 through	 the	 income	 statement	 unless	 the	 instruments	 are	 designated	 as	 hedges	 at	 inception	 and	 satisfy	 the	 hedge	 effectiveness	 criteria,	 when	 it	 is	 taken	 directly	 to	 equity.	 The	 Group	 has	 complied	 with	 the	 necessary	 documentation	 requirements	 set	 out	 in	 the	 standard	 with	 effect	 from	 29	 April	 2005	 and,	 accordingly,	 the	 effective	 portion	 of	 any	 unrealised	 gains	 or	 losses	 on	 	 the	 swap	 is	 taken	 directly	 to	 equity.	 Prior	 to	 29	 April	 2005	 the	 necessary	 documentation	 was	 not	 in	 place	 and,	 for	 this	 period,	 hedge	 accounting	 was	 not	 therefore	 available	 under	 IFRS.	 Consequently,	 the	 change	 in	 fair	 value	 has	 been	 reflected	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 in	 the	 year	 ending	 	 30	 April	 2005.

28 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued
(f)	 The 	 Group	 has	 secured	 notes	 due	 in	 2014	 and	 2015	 which	 contain	 early	 prepayment	 options.	 Under	 UK	 GAAP,	 the	 prepayment	 option	 was	 	 not	 separately	 identified	 and	 the	 notes	 were	 included	 within	 borrowings	 at	 amortised	 cost.	 Under	 IFRS,	 the	 early	 prepayment	 options	 constitute	 embedded	 derivatives	 which	 must	 be	 accounted	 for	 separately.	 At	 the	 date	 of	 issue	 the	 liability	 component	 of	 the		 notes	 is	 estimated	 using	 prevailing	 market	 interest	 rates	 for	 similar	 debt	 with	 no	 prepayment	 option	 and	 is	 recorded	 within	 borrowings.	 The	 difference	 between	 the	 proceeds	 of	 the	 note	 issue	 and	 the	 fair	 value	 assigned	 to	 the	 liability	 component,	 representing	 the	 embedded	 option	 to	 prepay	 the	 notes,	 is	 included	 within	 ‘Other	 financial	 assets	 –	 derivatives’.	 The	 interest	 expense	 on	 the	 liability	 component	 is	 calculated	 by	 applying	 the	 effective	 	 interest	 rate	 method.	 The	 embedded	 option	 to	 prepay	 is	 fair	 valued	 using	 an	 appropriate	 valuation	 model	 with	 fair	 value	 remeasurement	 	 gains	 and	 losses	 being	 included	 in	 ‘Investment	 income’	 or	 ‘Interest	 expense’.
	 As 	 a	 result,	 ‘Other	 financial	 assets	 –	 derivatives’	 of	 £9.8m	 increase	 total	 assets	 at	 30	 April	 2005	 and	 investment	 income	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 	 30	 April	 2005	 is	 £9.8m	 higher	 than	 under	 UK	 GAAP.
(g)	 IAS	 12	 (Income	 Taxes)	 requires	 deferred	 tax	 to	 be	 provided	 on	 all	 temporary	 differences	 rather	 than	 timing	 differences	 under	 UK	 GAAP.	 Deferred	 tax	 also	 needs	 to	 be	 provided,	 where	 relevant,	 on	 the	 other	 IFRS	 differences.
	 The 	 total	 impact	 on	 the	 balance	 sheet	 is	 the	 net	 deferred	 tax	 liability	 reduces	 by	 £3.9m	 at	 30	 April	 2005	 compared	 with	 that	 reported	 previously	 under	 UK	 GAAP	 due	 to	 the	 recognition	 of	 a	 deferred	 tax	 asset	 for	 tax	 deductible	 goodwill	 arising	 in	 the	 US.	 There	 is	 no	 impact	 on	 the	 income	 statement.	 (h)	 IAS	 19	 (Employee	 Benefits)	 requires	 defined	 benefit	 pension	 schemes	 accounting	 to	 be	 based	 on	 fair	 values	 at	 the	 balance	 sheet	 date.	 Separate	 charges	 for	 operating	 and	 net	 financing	 costs	 based	 on	 actuarial	 assumptions	 in	 place	 at	 the	 start	 of	 the	 year	 are	 required	 through	 the	 income	 statement	 while	 recognition	 through	 the	 balance	 sheet	 is	 dependent	 upon	 the	 policy	 adopted	 for	 the	 recognition	 of	 actuarial	 gains	 and	 losses.	 	 The	 Group	 has	 elected	 to	 recognise	 all	 cumulative	 actuarial	 gains	 and	 losses	 in	 respect	 of	 employee	 benefit	 schemes	 at	 the	 date	 of	 transition	 	 to	 IFRS.	 Additionally	 the	 Group	 has	 chosen	 to	 adopt	 early	 the	 amendment	 to	 IAS	 19	 (issued	 on	 16	 December	 2004)	 and	 recognise	 actuarial	 	 gains	 and	 losses	 arising	 from	 the	 full	 year	 actuarial	 valuation	 in	 full	 through	 the	 statement	 of	 recognised	 income	 and	 expense	 in	 the	 period	 in	 which	 they	 arise.	 	 The 	 balance	 sheet	 shows	 a	 total	 IAS	 19	 pensions	 deficit	 of	 £16.2m	 at	 30	 April	 2005	 which	 compares	 with	 a	 prepayment	 of	 £0.5m	 and	 accrual	 	 of	 £0.2m	 reported	 previously	 under	 UK	 GAAP.	 In	 addition,	 the	 operating	 charge	 through	 the	 income	 statement	 reduces	 by	 £0.2m	 while	 the	 net	 financing	 cost,	 for	 which	 there	 was	 no	 equivalent	 under	 UK	 GAAP	 (SSAP	 24),	 is	 £0.4m.
	 (i)	 IAS	 21	 (The	 Effects	 of	 Changes	 in	 Foreign	 Exchange	 Rates)	 requires	 cumulative	 translation	 differences	 to	 be	 reported	 as	 a	 separate	 component	 	 of	 equity	 and,	 on	 disposal	 of	 a	 foreign	 operation,	 the	 cumulative	 translation	 difference	 related	 to	 that	 operation	 forms	 part	 of	 the	 gain	 or	 loss	 on	 disposal.	 The	 Group	 has	 not	 used	 the	 exemption	 in	 IFRS	 1	 to	 set	 cumulative	 translation	 differences	 to	 zero	 at	 30	 April	 2004	 and	 will	 report	 cumulative	 translation	 differences	 from	 the	 date	 of	 acquisition	 of	 a	 foreign	 operation	 as	 a	 separate	 component	 of	 equity.	 The	 aggregate	 amount	 	 at	 30	 April	 2005	 was	 £32.6m.
(j)	 Under 	 IFRS	 2	 (Share-based	 Payments),	 where	 an	 entity	 receives	 goods	 or	 services	 in	 exchange	 for	 equity	 instruments	 (such	 as	 shares,	 share	 options	 and	 cash-settled	 share	 transactions),	 the	 charge	 through	 the	 income	 statement	 is	 based	 on	 a	 fair	 value	 of	 share	 options	 and	 awards	 granted.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 equity	 instrument	 is	 measured	 at	 grant	 date	 and	 spread	 over	 the	 vesting	 period	 through	 the	 income	 statement	 	 with	 a	 corresponding	 increase	 in	 equity.	 The	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 share	 options	 and	 awards	 is	 measured	 using	 the	 Black-Scholes	 model	 taking	 into	 account	 the	 terms	 and	 conditions	 of	 the	 scheme.	 The	 amount	 recognised	 as	 an	 expense	 is	 adjusted	 to	 reflect	 changes	 to	 the	 expected	 level	 	 of	 awards	 vesting,	 except	 where	 the	 changes	 relate	 to	 the	 expected	 achievement	 of	 market	 based	 criteria.	 	 IFRS 	 2	 requires	 a	 charge	 for	 all	 such	 grants	 including	 awards,	 options	 and	 SAYE	 schemes	 unlike	 UK	 GAAP	 which	 based	 the	 charge	 on	 the	 intrinsic	 market	 value	 of	 the	 underlying	 shares	 at	 the	 date	 of	 grant	 and	 so,	 for	 the	 Group,	 the	 charge	 arose	 on	 awards	 under	 the	 SAYE	 schemes,	 Investment	 Incentive	 Plan	 and	 Performance	 Share	 Plan.

	 The 	 transitional	 provisions	 of	 IFRS	 2	 permit	 a	 company	 to	 apply	 IFRS	 2	 just	 to	 share	 based	 awards	 after	 7	 November	 2002	 which	 had	 not	 vested	 at	 1	 January	 2005.	 The	 Group	 has	 followed	 this	 option	 and	 accordingly	 earlier	 awards	 continue	 to	 be	 accounted	 for	 on	 the	 basis	 adopted	 under	 UK	 GAAP.	 The	 transitional	 arrangements	 of	 IFRS	 2	 do	 not,	 however,	 apply	 to	 cash-settled	 transactions	 and	 accordingly	 cash-settled	 phantom	 option	 awards	 (granted	 in	 2000	 and	 2001)	 have	 been	 accounted	 for	 in	 accordance	 with	 IFRS	 2.
	 The 	 charge	 under	 IFRS	 is	 £0.4m	 higher	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 30	 April	 2005	 than	 under	 UK	 GAAP.	 There	 is	 no	 impact	 on	 the	 assets	 of	 the	 Group	 	 as	 the	 charge	 to	 the	 income	 statement	 is	 matched	 by	 an	 equal	 credit	 through	 equity.

Explanation of reconciling items from UK GAAP to IFRS
(i)	 In 	 2003	 the	 Company	 executed	 a	 $100m	 fixed/floating	 interest	 rate	 swap	 to	 mitigate	 the	 Group’s	 exposure	 to	 increasing	 interest	 rates.	 Under	 	 UK	 GAAP	 the	 swap	 was	 accounted	 for	 using	 hedge	 accounting	 principles.	 Under	 IFRS,	 the	 Company	 is	 required	 to	 fair	 value	 such	 instruments	 and	 reflect	 their	 fair	 value	 in	 its	 financial	 records.	 The	 fair	 value	 gain	 or	 loss	 is	 taken	 through	 the	 income	 statement	 unless	 the	 instruments	 are	 designated	 as	 hedges	 at	 inception	 and	 satisfy	 the	 hedge	 effectiveness	 criteria,	 when	 it	 is	 taken	 directly	 to	 equity.	 The	 change	 in	 fair	 value	 has	 been	 reflected	 in	 the	 income	 statement	 in	 the	 year	 ending	 30	 April	 2005.
(ii)	 The 	 Group	 has	 elected	 to	 adopt	 IAS	 32	 (Financial	 Instruments:	 Disclosure	 and	 Presentation)	 and	 IAS	 39	 (Financial	 Instruments:	 Recognition	 and	 Measurement)	 from	 1	 May	 2004.	 	 IAS 	 32	 requires	 the	 debt	 and	 equity	 components	 of	 a	 compound	 financial	 instrument	 to	 be	 recognised	 separately	 in	 the	 financial	 statements.	 	 The	 5.25%	 unsecured	 convertible	 loan	 note	 is	 a	 compound	 financial	 instrument.	 Under	 UK	 GAAP	 the	 loan	 note	 was	 recorded	 as	 debt	 at	 a	 fair	 value	 of	 £121.3m	 when	 issued	 in	 June	 2000	 and	 was	 being	 accreted	 to	 the	 face	 value	 of	 the	 loan	 note	 (£134m)	 over	 the	 life	 of	 the	 instrument.	 	 IFRS 	 requires	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 debt	 component	 of	 the	 instrument	 alone	 (£97m)	 to	 be	 recognised	 as	 debt	 when	 issued	 and	 accreted	 to	 the	 face	 value	 of	 the	 loan	 (£134m)	 over	 the	 life	 of	 the	 instrument	 and	 the	 balance	 (£24.3m)	 to	 be	 recognised	 as	 equity	 at	 the	 date	 the	 loan	 note	 was	 issued.	 Consequently,	 the	 interest	 charge	 is	 increased	 under	 IFRS	 to	 make	 the	 interest	 expense	 (the	 5.25%	 coupon	 plus	 debt	 amortisation)	 equivalent	 to	 that	 for	 a	 similar	 instrument,	 issued	 at	 the	 same	 time	 and	 with	 the	 same	 maturity,	 but	 without	 equity	 conversion	 rights.	 	 Accordingly, 	 the	 opening	 IFRS	 balance	 sheet	 at	 30	 April	 2004	 includes:
the	 equity	 component	 of	 the	 instrument,	 £24.3m;	 and	 debt	 at	 amortised	 cost	 of	 £116.7m	 (being	 the	 £97m	 recognised	 on	 issue	 plus	 the	 accumulated	 discount	 amortisation	 to	 30	 April	 2004).
	 As 	 a	 result,	 debt	 at	 30	 April	 2005	 is	 £10.9m	 lower	 than	 reported	 previously	 under	 UK	 GAAP.	 In	 addition,	 due	 to	 the	 amortisation	 of	 the	 discount,	 interest	 expense	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 30	 April	 2005	 is	 £3.0m	 higher	 than	 reported	 previously	 under	 UK	 GAAP.
(iii)	The 	 Company’s	 cash	 flows	 under	 IFRS	 are	 unchanged	 from	 those	 under	 UK	 GAAP.	 The	 IFRS	 cash	 flow	 format	 is	 similar	 to	 UK	 GAAP	 but	 presents	 various	 cash	 flows	 in	 different	 categories	 and	 in	 a	 different	 order	 from	 the	 UK	 GAAP	 cash	 flow	 statement.	 All	 of	 the	 IFRS	 accounting	 adjustment	 net	 out	 within	 cash	 generated	 from	 operations.

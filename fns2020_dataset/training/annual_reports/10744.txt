Many African cultures revere ndlovu (elephant in Ndebele) as a 
symbol of strength and power. Ndlovu is also praised for its size, 
longevity, stamina, mental faculties, cooperative spirit and loyalty. 
Mwana Africa PLC, in adopting the image of the African elephant in its 
Company branding, recognises the powerful and positive attributes 
of this majestic creature and strives to imbue the Company with at 
least some of these same characteristics.
In 2005, Mwana Africa became the ﬁrst African-owned, African-
managed resource company to be listed on the London Stock 
Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market (AIM), through a reverse 
takeover of African Gold PLC by a privately-held mining company, 
Mwana Africa Holdings (Proprietary) Limited.

Mwana Africa PLC is a pan-African, multi-commodity 
mining and development company. Mwana’s principal 
operations and exploration activities involve gold, 
nickel, copper and diamonds in Zimbabwe, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), South Africa, 
Angola and Botswana. 
In Zimbabwe, Mwana Africa’s interests are the Trojan and Shangani nickel mines, 
and the Freda Rebecca gold mine. Mwana’s nickel and gold projects include Hunter’s 
Road and Maligreen, with the Makaha deposit being a gold exploration prospect.
•  Th e Freda Rebecca gold mine in Zimbabwe restarted operations in  
2009 and in the 12 months ending March 2014, produced 58,704oz of gold.
•  Th e Trojan nickel mine is owned by Mwana’s Zimbabwe subsidiary, 
Bindura Nickel Corporation (BNC). After a four year period of being under  
care and maintenance, in 2012 BNC carried out a US$23m restructuring  
and recapitalisation programme which allowed it to restart the Trojan mine.  
The ﬁrst sale of concentrate to Glencore took place in April 2013.
In the DRC, Mwana Africa has exploration programmes in Katanga (copper),  
Zani-Kodo (gold) and a 20% stake in Société Minière de Bakwanga (MIBA)
(diamonds).  
•  Copper licence areas in the Katanga Province. Mwana has a Joint Venture 
Agreement with Zhejiang Hailiang Company Limited to jointly explore some of 
these areas. The Katanga concessions are otherwise known as SEMHKAT (Société 
d’Exploration Minière du Haut Katanga).
•  The joint venture Zani-Kodo project has a gold mineral resource of 2.97Moz.
Klipspringer diamond mine is Mwana’s South African interest. 
•  Mwana holds a 69.77% interest in Klipspringer, which is currently on care  
and maintenance, but involved in a tailings retreatment project and investigating 
the viability of underground mining. STRATEGIC REPORT

STRATEGIC REPORT • MANAGING OUR RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
MANAGING OUR RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
The principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is 
exposed relate to changes in the market prices of gold, nickel 
and diamonds, resource and reserves risk, processing risk, 
environmental risk, mining and operating risk, ﬁnancing risk and 
political risk.
METAL PRICE RISK
Fluctuations in metal prices can clearly affect the proﬁtability 
of mining operations. The Group seeks to protect itself from 
adverse ﬂuctuations by investing in projects which can operate 
economically in lower metal price environments and by controlling 
operating costs. The Group uses no ﬁnancial instruments or 
hedging products to ﬁx metal prices.
The impact of the metal prices on the performance of the period is 
assessed in note 34.
RESOURCE AND RESERVE RISK
There is a risk that estimates of Mineral Resources and Reserves 
overstate their economic potential. This uncertainty could give rise 
to a situation where a mine is, or becomes, commercially unviable.
The Group manages risk by ensuring that all Mineral Resource and 
Reserve estimates are calculated by reference to internationally 
accepted standards (in this case The Australian Code for Reporting 
of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves; ‘JORC’).
In addition, all Mineral Resource estimates published by the Group 
are signed off by an independent qualiﬁed person.
Information about the Resources and Reserves is included in the 
Review of operations and exploration. 
PROCESSING RISK
There is a risk that the processing of ore to recover metal fails 
to deliver recoveries expected and this may have the effect of 
reducing projected proﬁtability. All of the Group’s existing mining 
operations have a long history of economic production and the 
processing techniques used are well understood. When the Group 
invests in new projects the metallurgical processes are thoroughly 
tested and reviewed by independent consultants before any 
investment is made.
ENVIRONMENTAL RISK
Exploration and development of a project can be adversely 
affected by environmental legislation and the unforeseen results 
of environmental studies carried out during evaluation of a 
project. Once a project is in production, unforeseen events can 
give rise to environmental liabilities and/or temporary closure of 
mining operations.
The Group takes every care to comply with environmental 
legislation in the countries in which it operates and designs its 
training and procedures to minimise the environmental impact 
of operations.
The impact of the existing environmental obligations on the 
ﬁnancial statements is disclosed in note 29. The details of the 
mitigating actions undertaken by the Group during the period 
are disclosed in Environmental impacts and mitigation in the 
Overview of social and environmental responsibility on page 25 
of this report.
MINING AND OPERATING RISK
Mining is an inherently risky activity and can involve ground 
instability, failure of machinery and human error. The Group makes 
every effort to ensure that these risks are minimised by ensuring 
that mining operations are professional, that a high level of 
workforce training and education is maintained and by prompt 
reporting of incidents to management.
Information about the health and safety framework at Freda 
Rebecca and BNC is included in the Overview of social and 
environmental responsibility on page 22 of this report.
FINANCING RISK
Mining is a capital intensive business and there is a risk that if 
ﬁnance is not available for the development or further exploration 
of a project then the value of the project may not be realised. 
Mwana’s ﬁnancing risk is linked to the availability of funding in the 
capital and debt market which are impacted by their perception of 
commodity and country risk. Mwana seeks to mitigate its ﬁnancing 
risk by diversifying its sources of ﬁnance for the development of 
its projects.
POLITICAL RISK
There are political risks impacting the Group’s operations in Africa, 
including indigenisation regulations in Zimbabwe. Details of this 
risk and the actions undertaken to mitigate it are detailed on page 
29  of the Directors’ report regarding Zimbabwean indigenisation. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
The past year has probably been one of the most signiﬁcant in our 
Company’s history, both strategically and operationally. 
Strategically, we afﬁrmed our position and goal to be a multi- 
commodity, multi-country Pan-African mining group. After several 
years of building our asset portfolio with shareholder funding to 
achieve a position where we are capable of achieving income 
self-sufﬁciency, our business model has moved into its next logical 
phase of generating future growth organically, seeking funding 
and, if appropriate, partners, on a speciﬁc project by project basis 
rather than by general capital raising. Our focus is ﬁrmly set on 
rewarding shareholders through growth in asset value.
Operationally, we undertook a fundamental restructuring, founded 
on the premise that, in mining, the lowest-cost producer wins the 
day. This was motivated by falling prices for the commodities we 
produce (gold, nickel and diamonds); by the understanding that 
raising further development capital could be difﬁcult without 
offering increased foreseeable value and by the imperative of 
matching our projects to our capacity. In laying the groundwork for 
this, during the 12 months under review, we:
• Trimmed our head count from Board level down;
• Reduced the scale of our London ofﬁce;
• Reduced salaries voluntarily;
• Reduced our reliance on professional services;
• Cut operating costs; and
• Improved operating efﬁciencies.
Our activities are being directed towards the consolidation of our 
diversiﬁcation strategy, reducing overheads, derisking technical 
mining and exploration issues, increasing our operational cash 
generation capabilities such that, of our ﬁve major projects, two 
– Bindura Nickel and Freda Rebecca Gold Mine – are income 
generating; two – copper and diamonds – have reduced their burn 
rates; and one, the Zani-Kodo gold project in the eastern DRC, is 
advancing at limited cost to Mwana. As regards corporate costs, 
we are on track to achieve our target in annual savings, after 
allowing for once-off retrenchment and other costs of reduction 
or closure.
We have the assets in our portfolio capable of delivering on our 
evolving strategic objectives. At BNC, the operational plan allows 
earlier mining access and the blending of higher grade massives 
with disseminated ore to ensure a sustainable improved feed 
grade through the Trojan life of mine plan. We have restarted the 
deepening project and organic growth will centre on reopening 
the smelter, subject to funding, to add value through beneﬁciation. 
Most of the legacy labour liabilities at BNC should be discharged 
by December 2014 and the other liabilities by December 2015, 
freeing cash ﬂows to be applied to investment and operational 
purposes. At Freda Rebecca, we will complement our underground 
production, by concentrating on improving the performance of 
our plant and complete our testing programme of the recently 
commissioned tailings retreatment plant. At SEMHKAT, the labour 
force has been substantially cut and our Chinese partner, Hailiang, 
has assumed responsibility for exploration expenditure. At 
Klipspringer Diamonds, the joint venture to treat residue material is 
generating income while the restart of the mine is being evaluated. 
At Zani Kodo, we are assessing the prospects of feasibility studies 
and a small pilot plant for gold production.
Our emphasis upon becoming a multi-commodity company is 
bearing fruit through the reduction of risks associated with being 
dependant on a single metal. We have already enjoyed some 
beneﬁts from this commodity diversiﬁcation, with BNC production 
having supported the Group and Freda Rebecca pre-2009, while 
Freda Rebecca production supported the Group and BNC post-2009. 
I am conﬁdent of the sound long-term prospects of our two 
principal metals, though the immediate future is likely to exhibit 
price volatility. The nickel price has been bolstered by Indonesia’s

STRATEGIC REPORT • CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
ban on exports of nickel ore, whilst the gold price has been lower 
as investors anticipate interest rate increases that raise the cost of 
holding bullion as an investment.
As the past year’s results have shown, we have demonstrated 
an ability to contain costs to acceptable levels. We are fortunate 
that the majority of both our revenues and costs are denominated 
in US dollars as this relieves us of some of the distraction of 
managing exchange rate ﬂuctuations. Our strategy is to mine 
proﬁtably. We will not pursue new ventures unless they display 
clear prospects of sound returns on investment.
Careful cash-ﬂow management is central to our business plan and 
we will direct investment to those projects and operations that 
offer the best prospects of returns. This applies as much to our 
exploration initiatives in the DRC as to our developed mines in 
Zimbabwe, and this is dealt with more fully by my colleague and 
CEO, Kalaa Mpinga, in his CEO’s report.
In Zimbabwe – the central point of our mining and processing 
operations – the outcome of the general election in July 2013 
lifted much of the political uncertainty that preceded it. Like the 
governments of many other countries dependent on primary 
products, Zimbabwe’s is aware of the need to foster mining and 
investment, at the same time being mindful of its responsibility to 
ensure that the local populace should share fairly in the fruits of 
their country’s own resources. It is pleasing that we are in a position 
to resume smelting at BNC as it represents cooperation with the 
Zimbabwean government and its beneﬁciation objectives. We 
believe that this, too, can contribute to the indigenisation policy by 
creating more jobs for local people, by increasing purchases from 
local suppliers and through generating higher taxable revenues.
I have been Interim Chairman since only February 2014, but 
have always appreciated the skills and expertise that my Board 
colleagues and executives bring to the management of our 
Company. During the year, my long-serving predecessor Oliver 
Baring retired, along with John Anderson and Etienne Denis and 
I thank them for the direction they gave during their tenure on 
the Board. Oliver was succeeded, albeit brieﬂy, by Mark Wellesley-
Wood who we would also like to thank for his contribution. 
I would also like to thank Donald McAlister, who left in September, 
for his contribution during his time on the Board and to welcome 
our new Finance Director Yim Kwan to the Board. These departures 
mean that we are seeking to appoint a permanent Chairman, as 
well as improving the balance of our Board, and that search will 
be completed as expeditiously as possible. I would like to express 
my sincere thanks to my colleagues on the Board, our senior 
executives and all of our staff in many countries for their support 
during the past challenging year. I also express my gratitude to our 
shareholders and stakeholders for their continued support, which 
has contributed to the successes already mentioned above.
Safety is our priority, and it is with deep regret that I record the 
unfortunate deaths of two of our colleagues, Lovemore Nyanusanu 
and Shepherd Muradzi, in accidents at Freda Rebecca and Trojan. 
My condolences go to the families, friends and colleagues of both 
men. I assure all of our employees that our efforts to ensure safety 
are a priority and remain unremitting.
I make no forecast of our Group’s near-term performance, particularly 
given the current uncertainties over commodity prices. There remains 
some distance to travel before we are generating positive cash 
ﬂows at all of our projects. But while we will be patient in achieving 
this, we remain mindful of our commitment to deliver wealth to 
our shareholders. We shall build on our assets that are generating 
positive cash ﬂows and carefully develop those that are still in 
their infancy or are being maintained in anticipation of proﬁtable 
development. Stakeholders may rest assured that we will work hard 
to implement our strategy and focus on the sound development of 
our assets.

The performance of Mwana’s people during the past ﬁnancial year 
underscores our capacity to position our Company as a leading 
emerging miner on the African continent. It was a performance 
that overcame difﬁculties and set-backs while taking new projects 
forward. This demonstrated our ability to contain costs and to 
optimise our return on assets.
But the past year was also one which delivered personal tragedies. 
At the Freda Rebecca gold mine, excavator operator Lovemore 
Nyanusanu (32) died on 13 October 2013 in a mud rush. At the 
Trojan nickel mine, Shepherd Muradzi (35), a support rig assistant, 
lost his life in an underground tramming accident on 16 March 
2014. I join with all of my colleagues in sending my most profound 
condolences to the families of Lovemore and Shepherd and to their 
friends and colleagues. 
Apart from these two unfortunate losses, our overall safety record 
measured in the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rates (LTIFRs) improved 
at the two producing mines. Safety comes second to nothing at 
our operations. We ensure that our employees and contractors are 
equipped and trained to work safely and to ensure the safety of 
their colleagues.
As the past year started, members of the technical staff at Freda 
Rebecca were engaged on replacing a leach tank that had failed 
in the previous year. The replacement was ﬁnished in the year’s 
second quarter and complemented by a second leach tank. 
Simultaneously the team completed the pilot treatment plant 
for retreating tailings. Despite some difﬁculties with the tailings 
pilot plant’s capital equipment, commissioning was nearing 
completion as the ﬁnancial year ended. At the time of writing, 
commissioning had been completed which will allow thorough 
testing of the project.
An important part of our emphasis at Freda Rebecca has been and 
continues to be on containing costs. While cash costs per ounce of 
gold remained comfortably below gold prices for the entire year, 
by the fourth quarter all-in sustaining costs (C3) were close to the 
gold price, due to the operation not achieving its volume targets. 
I am, however, conﬁdent that by maximising gold production 
and with careful cost controls the mine will continue to operate 
proﬁtably. Our policy is to mine proﬁtable ore – we are not in the 
business of producing at any cost.
While Freda Rebecca was being brought up to steady-state, 
proﬁtable operations, production at BNC’s newly re-opened Trojan 
mine was being ramped up to full capacity. The year under review 
was the ﬁrst operating period since operations were placed on a 
care-and-maintenance basis in 2008. As the ﬁnancial year began, 
we were faced with having to re-evaluate our operating strategy in 
the light of sharply-declining nickel prices. 
We had hoped to raise additional capital to build operations, but 
this proved to be impractical as investors shied away from nickel 
as the metal’s price fell sharply. Our response was to introduce 
a modiﬁed mining sequence, based on the results from drilling 
carried out during care and maintenance. This mining method 
was evaluated thoroughly by our consultants, SRK, who conﬁrmed 
it as safe, feasible and not impacting on the life of mine (LoM). 
This strategy has proved its worth as nickel prices rose towards 
the year’s end in response to Indonesia’s restrictions on exports 
of nickel ore. Our conﬁdence in the sustainability of nickel’s price 
advance and the successful restart of Trojan has allowed us to 
reverse a substantial part of the previous year’s impairment of 
BNC’s assets.
While this reversal has a signiﬁcant positive effect on the year’s 
reported headline earning, it is, perhaps, best to remember that this 
has no effect on the Group’s cash ﬂow. For the foreseeable future, 
BNC will be conserving cash to fund the Trojan mine’s deepening 
and capacity development from internal resources. Cash ﬂow will 
continue to be directed at clearing BNC’s legacy liabilities or debt, 
strengthening the balance sheet and laying the foundation for the 
ﬁrst proﬁts to be reported since 2008.
Once that is completed, and adding to the beneﬁts of the mining 
developments, we are embarking on the current project to restart 
the BNC smelter, to move our nickel operations up the value chain. 
Preliminary planning started in the year under review and, 
based on the restart plan reviewed by consultant Hatch Goba, 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
Kalaa Mpinga – Chief Executive Ofﬁcer STRATEGIC REPORT
MWANA AFRICA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

GOVERNANCE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
STRATEGIC REPORT • CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
we estimate that the project can come on stream in the ﬁrst 
half of 2015 with a capacity to process an annual 160,000t of 
concentrate, of which approximately one-third will be drawn 
from other local nickel miners. The capital cost is estimated at 
$26.5m of which half will be debt and the remainder will come 
from BNC’s improved cash resources and cash ﬂow. The project is 
expected to generate ﬁnancial beneﬁts on two important fronts 
– an increase in proﬁt from selling nickel leach alloy rather than 
concentrate and a reduction in transport costs as we ship leach 
alloy rather than concentrate.
In South Africa, the management of our diamond interests reﬂects 
our careful approach to operations. Following extensive damage 
caused by the ﬂooding of underground workings in 2010 and 
2011, the Klipspringer mine was placed on care and maintenance, 
where it remains pending our securing funding to re-establish 
underground mining. 
We remain, however, conﬁdent of the longer-term potential of 
Klipspringer’s diamondiferous kimberlite ﬁssure deposits and will 
retain the asset. In October 2013 we entered into an agreement 
with Greenhurst Mining & Exploration to recover diamonds from 
the old Marsfontein slimes dumps. Greenhurst brought in a new 
process for recovering micro-diamonds, a process that has proved 
its worth at the slimes recovery operation. During the second half 
of the year under review 28,600 carats of small diamonds were 
recovered and sold at an average price of $21 per carat. Revenue 
from this recovery operation is directed at covering the property’s 
care-and-maintenance costs.
Continuing care and maintenance has ensured that underground 
workings could be restored to initial production within four months 
followed, three months later, by the preliminary sales of diamonds. 
In round ﬁgures, we estimate that the capital investment required 
will be approximately $4m and the pay-back on the project will 
be 28 months. Discussions are taking place with a number of off-
takers to source funding.
Full details are contained elsewhere in this report, but at our 
Zani-Kodo gold prospect in the Ituri district of the north-eastern 
DRC where we are partnered by the state-owned mining 
company Société Minière de Kilo-Moto (SOKIMO), drilling allowed 
us to increase the size of our gold resource to 2.97m ounces. 
Metallurgical testing was largely completed in the year under 
review and we have entered the current year examining various 
plant-design options to be built into a project feasibility study 
based, initially, on the Kodo Main property. The area is a highly-
prospective zone of gold-bearing greenstone deposits with other 
major gold companies actively drilling and exploring near our 
permit areas.
Our other interests in diamonds are limited to minority stakes 
in prospects in the DRC, Angola and Botswana. Though they 
are comparatively small interests at present, they do not involve 
Mwana investing in exploration and development and we look 
upon them as long-term projects to be undertaken with our 
partners at some point in the future.
While our understanding of our Zimbabwean and South 
African resources is well developed, we also see opportunities 
in prospective ventures under exploration in the Katanga and 
Orientale provinces of the DRC. Again, we are adopting a cautious 
approach, steadily adding to the value of our properties’ resources 
while not wanting to over-extend our ﬁnances on exploration.
I believe it bears repeating that our strategy is to contain costs and, 
when appropriate, to partner with others with whom we can share 
them. This is particularly the case with our copper/cobalt prospect 
in the DRC’s Katanga province where we are partnered in a joint 
venture between SEMHKAT and Zhejiang Hailiang Company 
Limited, the Shanghai listed copper tubes fabricator. In terms of the 
agreement, Hailiang will ﬁnance the costs of exploring and drilling 
28 of our 34 copper permit areas at a total cost of $25m over four 
years, thereby buying into an interest in the venture. In the year 
under review, Hailiang spent $7m on exploration, which amount is 
subject to audit and veriﬁcation. Targets have been selected based 
on data collected from the year’s ﬁeld prospecting season. Drilling 
and further regional prospecting has just begun.
From a personal standpoint, I have again found working with 
my colleagues to be stimulating and I thank them sincerely for 
their contributions to the development of Mwana Africa in a 
year which has seen the Company and our future potential and 
prospects change dramatically. Their contributions have been 
made at a sometimes substantial individual personal cost. The 
Board and staff members have voluntarily made salary sacriﬁces 
which have helped mitigate falling commodity prices. I express 
my sincere thanks to each of the individuals who have made 
these sacriﬁces and contributed to the Company’s continued 
progress during the year.
There have been difﬁculties, but they have been overcome with 
conﬁdence and dedication and the Company is now on a sound 
footing from which to develop further.

Freda Rebecca gold mine – Zimbabwe
The Freda Rebecca gold mine (Freda Rebecca) is situated near the 
town of Bindura, some 90km north-east of Harare. 
Total gold production for the year ending 31 March 2014 
was 58,704oz, 7.3% down on the previous year’s production 
of 63,350oz. A signiﬁcant contributor to the variance was a 
leach tank failure in the last quarter of FY2013, which affected 
recovery during the ﬁrst quarter of FY2014. The failed leach tank 
was replaced during the past year and a new, additional leach 
tank has also been commissioned. Recoveries have now been 
restored. Closure for the environmental clean-up was successful, 
with additional lined spill containment ponds being completed 
in the year.
Average quarterly production for the ﬁnancial period was 14,676oz 
of gold, and the highest level of quarterly gold production was 
17,536oz, achieved in the second quarter. 
Tailings retreatment project
The mine, which has been in production since 1988, has 
accumulated some 13Mt of gold-bearing tailings in three main 
storage facilities within the mine lease area. During FY2013, the 
economic potential of recovering gold from Freda Rebecca’s tailings 
dumps was evaluated and the construction of a pilot recovery plant 
initiated. The plant was completed and commissioning began in 
the year ended 31 March 2014. 
The objective of the pilot scale test plant is to prove that gold can 
be recovered economically from the tailings with little reprocessing 
and low mining and handling costs. An augering programme over 
the dumps is expected to result in a JORC-compliant mineral 
resource that has the potential to add signiﬁcantly to Freda 
Rebecca’s gold production.
Freda Rebecca continues to focus on mining and processing 
efﬁciencies, particularly on increasing plant throughput and 
recovery improvement.

Zani-Kodo project – Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
The Zani-Kodo gold exploration project in the Ituri district of the DRC 
covers gold mining rights over 1,605 square kilometres in the Orientale 
Province. Mwana is in a joint venture with the state-owned SOKIMO 
which holds a 20% free-carry interest. The licence areas contain a 
series of greenstone belts of Kibalian age which have the potential 
to host world-class gold deposits. Zani-Kodo is situated between the 
Kibali (formerly Moto Mines) Project (Randgold Resources/AngloGold 
Ashanti joint venture) and the Mongbwalu Project (AngloGold 
Ashanti).
The Zani-Kodo project total combined JORC-compliant gold 
resource now stands at 2.97Moz at 2.43g/t (based on a cut-off  
grade of 0.5g/t). This is an increase of 13% on the February 2013 
resource statement, which was itself a 30% increase on the 
February 2012 resource statement.

In response to lower commodity prices and in line with the Company’s strategy of cutting costs, Mwana suspended exploration drilling 
at Zani-Kodo during Q2 of FY2014. Prior to the cessation of drilling, 42 diamond core drill holes for a total of 11,268m were completed. 
Results include 9m @ 6.46g/t Au and 4m @ 8.33g/t.
Test work carried out on samples taken from the Kodo Main orebody found the ore to be non-refractory and showed higher than 90% gold 
extraction across all the recovery methods tested.
As part of feasibility work underway at Kodo Main, a resource-conversion drilling programme was completed in 2014. This will be followed 
by a geotechnical drilling programme and regional ﬁeld investigations will continue during FY2015. STRATEGIC REPORT

GOVERNANCE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NICKEL
Bindura Nickel Corporation (BNC) - Zimbabwe
BNC has been listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange since 1971. 
Located near the Freda Rebecca gold mine close to the town of 
Bindura, north-east of Harare, BNC is Africa’s only integrated nickel 
mining, smelting and reﬁning operation. Historically, ore from the 
Company’s Shangani and Trojan mines, with a combined hoisting 
capacity in excess of 2Mt of ore per year, was concentrated and 
fed, along with concentrate from third parties, to BNC’s smelter 
and reﬁnery. 
BNC’s mines, smelter and reﬁnery were placed on care and 
maintenance in 2008 and remained so until the conclusion of 
BNC’s rights issue and restructuring in September 2012 when 
mining restarted at the Trojan nickel mine. 
The restart involved the refurbishment of the handling facilities for 
the surface milling ﬂotation, tailings and concentrate. The cold 
commissioning of the electrical and mechanical circuits of the feed 
conveyors, mills, ﬂotation circuits, concentrate handling and tailings 
handling was completed in January 2013 by passing water through the 
processing plant circuits. The hot commissioning, with the introduction 
of ore into the milling circuit, commenced shortly afterwards.
Progress on surface was matched by a successful ramp up 
of underground operations. In April 2013, BNC sold its ﬁrst 
shipment of nickel concentrate since the restart to Glencore, 
BNC’s offtake partner.
As a result of depressed nickel prices, additional ﬁnancing to fund 
full ramp up was not secured. BNC began reviewing options to 
resolve this cash shortfall including considering alternative mine 
plans at Trojan and seeking bridging ﬁnance. 
During Q1 of FY2014, the Trojan mine plan was revised to target 
the higher-grade zones of the orebody, known as ‘massives’, with 
the aim of reducing the cost per tonne of nickel produced. The 
impact of this was already being seen in the ﬁrst six months, with 
a drop in cash costs from $19,251/t in Q1 to $9,689/t in Q2. In 
October 2013, a competent person’s review of BNC’s business plan 
for Trojan’s operations concluded that the plan was realistic and 
achievable. This enabled BNC to update its ore reserves statement 
to total proven and probable reserves of 3.168Mt at an average 
grade of 1.04% for 32,975t of contained nickel. This denotes 
a 28% increase on the previously reported Trojan reserves of 
25,810t of contained nickel.
Work has commenced on the Trojan shaft re-deepening project 
which had been suspended while the mine was on care and 
maintenance. The re-deepening will extend the operating horizon 
of Trojan from 35 level to 45 level and secure the life of mine of 
the Trojan asset.
Trojan mine is making continued progress towards steady-
state processing of 195,000t per quarter and the increase in 
tonnes milled indicates more consistent, efficient operation of 
the mills.

SEMHKAT – Katanga, DRC
The Mwana Group holds a 100% interest in 33 exploration 
concessions covering 4,845 square kilometres in the south-east 
of the DRC. The Katanga concessions are otherwise known as 
SEMHKAT (Société d’Exploration Minière du Haut Katanga). 
Exploration is focusing on sediment-hosted stratiform copper-
cobalt, iron-oxide-copper-gold (IOCG) occurrences as well as on 
showings of lead and zinc.
The Hailiang Joint Venture, signed in February 2013, covers  
27 licence areas, with a commitment by Hailiang to spend 
$25m over a four-year period. In terms of the JV agreement, the 
licences will be transferred into a development company in which 
Mwana will hold a 38% non-dilutable stake. Also under the joint 
venture agreement, Hailiang had a six-month option over the 
Kibolwe licence, which has expired.
Kibolwe is the most advanced of the SEMHKAT concessions and is 
located approximately 150 kilometres north-west of Lubumbashi 
and 86 kilometres south-west of the town of Likasi. Kibolwe is 
a near surface secondary enriched sediment-hosted stratiform 
copper deposit. The dominant oxide mineral is malachite 
with minor amounts of cuprite and tenorite, occurring within 
weathered argillaceous limestones. The drilling programmes 
have outlined near-surface, ﬂat-lying mineralised units up to 40m 
thick, extending over a strike of 1,500m.
The exploration programme to date includes:
•  a high-resolution aeromagnetic and radiometric survey ﬂown 
over the bulk of the area (54,000 line km)
• 12,000m of drilling at the advanced Kibolwe surface deposit
• 5,700m drilling on extensions of Kibolwe
• 7,000m drilling at satellite targets within 10km of Kibolwe
•  soil geochemical sampling of an area of approximately 1,500km
2
• geophysical and geological mapping surveys
Following completion of the Phase 1 programme, which resulted 
in the statutory shedding of 50% of ground holdings, the Phase 2 
work programme commenced in July 2013. The programme has 
been executed by three Hailiang sub-contractors (Huakuan, Inner 
Mongolian and SinoMine) and the SEMHKAT technical team. 
A target generation exercise was conducted and deﬁned high-
priority targets for follow-up exploration during 2014. Eight 
targets were delineated at Lunsano and reverse circulation drilling 
started. Other important targets were delineated at Kitemena East, 
Kawesitu North, Lutobwe, Kiﬁta and Lukosombi. 
SEMHKAT commenced an exploration programme on Lutobwe, 
Lombe, Kapande and Mifumbi.
Our joint venture partner will mobilise for the second year’s 
exploration programme. This includes six targets, with geochemistry 
and geophysics, followed by drilling.

DIAMONDS
Klipspringer – South Africa
The Project consists of several en echelon (staggered or 
overlapping) kimberlite ﬁssures and blows trending in a northeast 
orientation, and includes the Leopard Fissure, the Sugarbird 
Fissure, the Sugarbird Blow, the Kudu Fissure, and the Kudu Blow, 
amongst others.
As a result of severe weather incidents in December 2010 and 
January 2011, which ﬂooded the shaft bottom and lower (7) 
level of the Leopard ﬁssure, the mine was placed on care and 
maintenance. Ultimate funding from Mwana, has continued to 
maintain the asset in a ready state and at the same time the 
interest in the joint venture has increased to almost 70% due 
to non-investment by the BEE partner in the working capital 
requirements of Klipspringer. 
Care and maintenance will continue until a source of ﬁnance is 
secured to restart the mine and has ensured that the mine will be 
in a position to take advantage of favourable market conditions. 
The evaluation of options to re-open the underground operation 
along the Leopard ﬁssure will continue.

Slimes retreatment project
In October 2012, an agreement was signed with Greenhurst Mining 
and Exploration to re-treat ﬁne-residue tailings at Klipspringer on 
a proﬁt-sharing basis. Construction and commissioning of the 
processing plant with a capacity of 50t per hour was completed by 
the end of September 2013. At steady state, the plant is projected 
to produce from 15,000 to 20,000 carats per month from the old 
Marsfontein ﬁne residue tailings deposit. 
In November 2013, Klipspringer sold its ﬁrst parcel of diamonds 
(1,512cts) under the Greenhurst agreement. During FY2014, 
production of diamonds more than doubled, quarter on quarter, as 
a result of the treatment of 16,000t of ﬁne-residue tailings, at an 
average grade of 88.5cts/100t. An average selling price of $21/ct 
was achieved. Following process changes in the plant, including 
screening improvements and a DMS surge bin, a substantial 
increase in throughput is expected and thus a signiﬁcant 
contribution to Klipspringer’s monthly care-and-maintenance costs 
should follow in FY2015.

Five kimberlitic pipes intrude a valley and outcrop in the Chicapa 
River bed and both sides of the river. Contained diamond content 
for the ﬁve pipes, a total surface area of 167ha, quoted down to a 
depth of 145 metres, is 23million carats.
In 2005, the government approved the formation of the operating 
company, Sociedade Mineira do Camafuca Lda, which was issued 
the mining licence for the Camafuca project. In terms of the 
shareholders agreement, Mwana will provide the technical skills 
and manage the project implementation.
Mwana Africa has no further ﬁnancial commitments to the 
development of Camafuca and retains a free carried interest of 
18% in the Camafuca project through SouthernEra Diamonds. 
DRC – Mbuyi Maya (MIBA)
The Mbuji Maya cluster in Kasai-Oriental Province of the DRC was 
recognised in 1946, 28 years after diamonds were recovered in the 
surrounding rivers. The cluster consists of 11 elliptical kimberlites 
totalling in excess of 39 ha, with associated elluvial and alluvial 
deposits.
Mwana holds a minority interest of 20% in this project through 
the Société Minière de Bakwanga (MIBA). The Company is in 
discussions with the DRC government about the recapitalisation 
and restructuring of MIBA.
Botswana – BK16
In June 2008, Firestone Diamonds entered into an agreement 
with Mwana under which it can acquire an 87.5% interest in the 
BK16 kimberlite in return for carrying all costs to completion of 
bankable feasibility.
At present Mwana holds 55% of the shares in this project through 
a Botswana registered company, Kenrod Engineering.

(2013: $17.8m). The net proﬁt for the year is $50.6m (2013: loss of $43.5m).
FREDA REBECCA
During the year, Freda Rebecca sold 58,704 ounces of gold (2013: 65,350 ounces) at an average price of $1,319 per ounce  
(2013: $1,654 per ounce) as well as by-products, generating revenue of $77.5m (2013: $108.1m). Operating costs during the period 
totalled $61.3m (2013: $65.3m) for the year. Proﬁt before tax for the year was $8.6m (2013: $36.4m).
BINDURA NICKEL CORPORATION
Revenue of $65.0m (2013: $1.0m) was generated through the sale of nickel in concentrate (2013: sale of in-process inventories). Operating 
costs were $45.7m (2013: $15.9m) increased from the previous year due to the restart of the Trojan mine. BNC reported EBITDA (before 
impairments) of $19.4m (2013: loss of $14.1m).
In the prior year, 100% of BNC’s non-current assets have been impaired in the Group Financial Statements which resulted in an impairment 
loss of $43.7m. During the current ﬁnancial year, $28.0m of the impairment relating to the Trojan mine was reversed. During the current 
year, it became probable that BNC would make taxable proﬁts in the future and that deferred tax should be recognised in their accounts. 
A net deferred taxation credit of $3.6m was included in proﬁt during the ﬁnancial year in respect of impairments. See note 35 which 
provides background and ﬁnancial impact of this impairment and reversal.

GOVERNANCE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
STRATEGIC REPORT • FINANCIAL REVIEW
At 31 March 2014, the Group had cash balances of $9.1m  
(2013: $15.2m), comprising $4.2m (2013: $5.5m) held by BNC 
and $4.9m (2013: $9.7m) held by Freda Rebecca and other Mwana 
Africa Group entities. The book value of shareholders’ equity for 
the Group at the year-end was $125.6m (2013: $82.8m), whereas 
for the Company it was $175.5m (2013: $139.1m). The reason for 
the Company equity being more than Group equity is because of 
equity deﬁcits included in the consolidated ﬁgure.
FREDA REBECCA
Non-current assets of $49.4m were in line with the prior year 
(2013: increase of $3.7m to $49.3m). Current assets increased 
by $3.6m (2013: $1.7m decrease) to $17.3m (2013: $13.7m). 
This amount includes an increase in trade debtors of $3.7m 
(2013: $3.3m decrease), a decrease in spares and inventory of 
$0.1m (2013: $1.9m increase) and no change in other debtors 
(2013: $0.3m decrease). 
The movement in non-current liabilities to $18.8m (2013: $19.4m) 
is contributed to the interest on the IDC loan, the continued 
repayment of the IDC loan facility as well as the increase in the 
environmental provision.
BINDURA NICKEL CORPORATION
The value of current assets increased by $4.1m (2013: $1.7m 
increase) to $13.1m (2013: $9.0m) still being the result of the 
restart programme which necessitates increased inventory. In the 
prior year, non-current assets (excluding investments of $0.5m) of 
BNC was impaired and the non-current assets of Trojan impaired 
in 2013 was reversed in the current ﬁnancial year, as described 
in note 35. 
OTHER MWANA AFRICA GROUP
The value of non-current assets increased to $64.8m (2013: $61.5m). 
Additional exploration expenditure was capitalised during the year 
in accordance with the Group’s policy.
GROUP LIQUIDITY
At 31 March 2014 the Group held cash of $9.1m (2013: $15.2m). 
Included in the Group cash balance is $1.8m (2013: $1.7m) 
reserved for loan repayments in relation to the IDC loan facility 
in Freda Rebecca. At 30 June 2014 the Group held cash of $7.3m  
(30 June 2013: $5.2m).

GOING CONCERN
The directors, after making enquiries and considering the 
uncertainties described further in note 3: Basis of preparation to the 
ﬁnancial statements ‘going concern’, believe that the Company and 
the Group will be able to access the ﬁnancial resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual 
Report and ﬁnancial statements and these ﬁnancial statements 
do not include any adjustments that would result from the going 
concern basis of preparation being inappropriate.  MWANA AFRICA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

STRATEGIC REPORT • OVERVIEW OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
OVERVIEW OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
Mwana Africa’s social and environmental responsibility is driven by 
its passion for creating a synergy between sustainable investments, 
sustainable mining and sustainable communities. Mwana has 
consistently encouraged this synergy by creating safe working 
environments for staff, by positively affecting the communities in 
which it operates, and by minimising the environmental impact 
of its activities. The Company’s major contribution to surrounding 
communities and social partners is through a multi-faceted approach 
of driving job creation, technical support of local businesses, the 
empowerment of local contractors, and the purchase of goods and 
services from local suppliers. 
The Katanga concessions or SEMHKAT, which has 27 of its 33 
exploration licences in a joint venture with the Hailiang Group, is 
actively involved with the daily management of the joint venture 
to ensure that standard operating procedures are implemented.
The three main pillars of Mwana Africa’s corporate social 
responsibility (CSR) continue to be education, health, and support 
of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to help empower local 
business enterprises. This resonates with government policies 
of requiring every investor to play a role in the development of 
disadvantaged communities.
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Stakeholder engagement with investors, employees, customers, 
community partners and regulators and others is actively pursued. 
This is done through a variety of formal and informal engagements, 
brieﬁngs, surveys, and feedback sessions on issues raised. 
WORKPLACE SAFETY
Mwana Africa recognises that exploration and mining have 
inherent levels of risk. We regret deeply the loss of two workers 
this year - excavator operator Lovemore Nyanusanu (32) at Freda 
Rebecca mine and support rig assistant Shepherd Muradzi (35) at 
the Trojan nickel mine. We extend our sincere condolences to their 
families, colleagues and friends.
At Freda Rebecca gold mine the implementation of proactive safety 
management programmes resulted in a lost-time injury frequency 
rate (LTIFR) of 0.53 in FY2014, compared with 0.91 in 2013. 
BNC achieved an LTIFR of 2.52. The Company had progressed well 
until March 2014 when the fatality took place which resulted in 
6,000 lost shifts as we moved to assess safety issues. The lost-
time injury severity rate (LTISR) increased from 26 to 455.53. Some 
600 managerial and non-managerial employees were trained 
on Behaviour Based Safety and the system is currently in the 
implementation phase.
All our mines and exploration operations achieved extended periods 
in which no lost-time injuries were reported. No exploration related 
incidents or accidents were reported during FY2014.
Freda Rebecca mine maintained OHSAS 18001 health and safety 
certiﬁcation. The Trojan mine is in the process of achieving similar 
accreditation in the very near future.
Operations at Klipspringer remained on care and maintenance. 
At the mine’s slimes retreatment project, no safety, health or 
environment issues were recorded during FY2014. The mine 
recorded zero lost time injuries during the same period.
EMPLOYEE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
The principal health issues faced in the regions where Mwana 
Africa operates are malaria, HIV/AIDS and waterborne diseases 
such as typhoid and cholera. The Company provides medicines, 
education and training for the prevention and treatment of these 
diseases, as well as associated infections such as tuberculosis. 
Mwana Africa’s social 
and environmental 
responsibility is driven  
by its passion for creating 
a synergy between 
sustainable investments, 
sustainable mining and 
sustainable communities. STRATEGIC REPORT
MWANA AFRICA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

GOVERNANCE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
STRATEGIC REPORT • OVERVIEW OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
During FY2014 there were two reports of malaria in SEMHKAT’s 
Lunsano camp. The contractors concerned were treated timeously 
and returned to work within a week.
Freda Rebecca gold mine acts in partnership with the local Bindura 
municipality to provide technical support for water reticulation. The 
mine also complements municipal efforts in the provision of clean 
water programmes for outlying communities to ensure access to safe 
water supplies. To date, 10 boreholes with manual pumps have been 
donated to local communities. BNC runs its own water treatment 
plant and has oxidation ponds for handling sewage.
Mwana’s mine operations have all implemented community-wide 
HIV/AIDS management strategies linked to the concept of overall 
wellness. They include awareness and education campaigns, 
voluntary counselling and testing (VCT), and health-care training. 
At BNC and at Freda Rebecca, Mwana Africa staffs and funds the 
running of clinics for employees and their families. Freda Rebecca 
and Trojan mine clinics are certiﬁed Opportunistic Infections 
Clinics. Shangani mine has also applied for this status and is 
being monitored. Trojan and Freda Rebecca are also certiﬁed as 
anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics and dispense anti-retroviral 
(ARVs) medication supplied by the government to affected 
employees and their dependents, as well as to members of the 
local community. Both Freda Rebecca and BNC receive assistance 
from the Zimbabwean Business Council on AIDS (ZBCA). BNC also 
runs an HIV/AIDS assistance project coordinated by the Swedish 
Workplace HIV and AIDS Programme (SWHAP). The ﬁrst phase of 
cooperation involves the review and implementation of HIV/AIDS 
and wellness policies and practices. 
At BNC, a wellness programme is scheduled to be launched in 
the second quarter of the new ﬁnancial year. This intervention is 
expected to result in a signiﬁcant reduction in AIDS-related psycho-
social problems faced by employees and their families, and also in 
problems ensuing from the period of care and maintenance. Safety, 
health, environment and quality (SHEQ) management systems 
certiﬁcation is planned for December 2015.
UNICEF donates primary health-care drugs to Freda Rebecca gold 
mine, which passes on the unused portions to the local provincial 
hospital. Mine teams assist where required with ambulance 
services for critical health emergencies. 
All SEMHKAT personnel have access to one of two hospitals – the 
Panda Hospital in Likasi and CMC in Lubumbashi.
Klipspringer does not have any employee and community health 
programmes running at present, due to the underground mining 
operation not being in production.
At the Zani-Kodo gold project, a fresh-water borehole source has 
resulted in a dramatic decrease in water-borne disease in Zani 
village. Mosquito nets have been distributed to all employees 
and their families. We give monthly ﬁnancial support to the two 
local clinics and give Mwana staff free access to medication from 
the hospital.
EMPLOYMENT AND LABOUR RELATIONS
At the year’s end, Mwana Africa employed 1,605 people  
(2013: 1,560).
Diversity
Preference during recruitment is given to members of the local 
community, especially for unskilled and semi-skilled positions. At 
the Freda Rebecca mine in Zimbabwe, 60% of the workforce is from 
the local town of Bindura. One third of all staff members at BNC 
are drawn from the surrounding communities. With the exception 
of some of the senior expatriate management, all employees in our 
exploration operations come from the surrounding communities. 
All casual employees at SEMHKAT are recruited locally. At the 
end of FY2014, Klipspringer mine employed 70 people, both 
employees and contractors, more than 80% of whom are from 
local communities. A formal relationship with local leaders helps 
ensure that local community members beneﬁt from preferential 
recruitment opportunities.
Mwana employee diversity
Male % Female %
Directors 6 100.0 – 0.0
Senior managers 165 88.2 22 11.8
Employees 1,368 96.9 44 3.1
Labour relations
In all operations, joint consultative forums with employee leaders 
and unions are conducted regularly and this has the effect of 
creating healthy labour relations. The areas of mutual interest are 
generally wages, conditions of employment, occupational health and 
safety and serious diseases such as HIV/AIDS. No work stoppages 
were reported due to industrial action across the Group.
The Hailiang joint venture is actively assisted and encouraged to 
respect relevant DRC law in connection with employees, contractors 
and local casual workers. Regular meetings and inspections take 
place to monitor employment processes. MWANA AFRICA ANNUAL REPORT 2014
24
OVERVIEW OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
BNC has an active workers’ committee at the Trojan nickel mine and 
the workers are free to join the trade union. 
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
Education
Freda Rebecca mine has continued to enhance its corporate 
social responsibility (CSR) footprint in the area of education. This 
is being done in partnership with other stakeholders such as the 
NGO Terre des Hommes (TdH). TdH provides school fees for some 
100 children at the Batanai Early Childhood Development Centre. 
Freda Rebecca mine is also sponsoring ﬁve students working 
towards their degrees at the Zimbabwe School of Mines, and 
offers scholarships on a case-by-case basis to academically-gifted 
students from the local community. 
BNC provides on-site primary school education, funds secondary 
schooling and grants a number of scholarships to higher education 
institutions for employees’ children. The Company also provides 
training opportunities for undergraduates from different learning 
institutions, with Bindura University being given the ﬁrst priority.
The exploration project at Zani-Kodo in the DRC has constructed 
several classrooms for schools in the vicinity and has refurbished the 
dormitory at the adjacent secondary school. In addition, the project 
has also commissioned a local carpenter to construct desks for local 
primary and secondary schools. The project has also been involved in 
donating stationery to local schools and has refurbished numerous 
community ofﬁces. Staff training in computer literacy takes place on 
a continual basis.
Klipspringer does not provide any assistance in this regard due to 
its being under care and maintenance. Detailed programmes are 
included in our social and labour plan and will be implemented once 
the mine returns to steady state production.
In Katanga, two local workers were provided with opportunities 
for part-time study in English and management during 2013. 
This programme will continue and be extended to benefit more 
local workers.
Enterprise development
The exploration projects continue to reach out to surrounding 
communities in the areas of routine road upgrades and the 
construction of access bridges. BNC donates material such as 
waste rock to the local authority and other institutions for road 
construction and building.
Freda Rebecca mine has consistently maintained the proportion 
of its local procurement, with about 60% of total procurement 
sourced from local suppliers. A considerable number of small 
business enterprises continue to be assisted by Freda Rebecca mine 
in providing services to the mine and mine villages. The mine also 
encourages and supports local entrepreneurial ventures. 
BNC similarly sourced 76% of its total procurement locally. The 
remoteness of Mwana’s operations in Zani-Kodo necessitates that 
many supplies have to be imported from Uganda, though fuel and 
some foodstuffs are sourced locally when they are available. 
The operations in Katanga source 15% of goods and services from 
local villages, with the remaining 85% split between the towns 
of Likasi and Lubumbashi. Villagers provide guard services for the 
camps, house and ofﬁce.
Despite the limited nature of operations at Klipspringer, the 
mine strives to ensure that goods and services are sourced from 
local suppliers. We estimate that between 65% and 75% of 
procurement spend was sourced from local suppliers.
In 2012, Bindura Estates (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Freda 
Rebecca mine) began establishing a commercial farm on 
the arable portions of the mine’s lease areas. Bindura Estates 
successfully completed its ﬁrst farming season in FY2014 and 
the results are encouraging in the areas of potato, soya bean 
and maize farming, enhancing the local economy of Bindura 
and improving food security. So far this venture has provided 
employment for more than 300 women who have been engaged 
on a seasonal labour basis. 
The limited income derived from diamond sales at Klipspringer 
does not allow the mine to invest in infrastructure support or small 
business enterprises at present. Klipspringer mine personnel and 
equipment are on stand-by during the dry winter months to assist 
neighbouring land owners in combating the threat of runaway veld 
ﬁres that may damage property or lives, including wildlife.
Since the year-end, Mwana’s Freda Rebecca gold mine and BNC 
have embarked on further empowerment plans in the areas of 
education and mining, in collaboration with Zimbabwe’s Ministry 
of Youth, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment. The two 
companies have offered to adopt and partner with Bindura 
Vocational College, providing $200,000 sponsorship for the 
college’s refurbishment over a period of ﬁve years. In the area of 
mining, Freda Rebecca will be assisting young people by making 
available on a tribute basis its special grant claim on areas adjacent 
to the mining lease. The mine will also consider purchasing a stamp 
mill for the site for use by the beneﬁciaries and offering initial set-
up technical training.
ARTISANAL AND SMALL-SCALE MINING
Where operations interact with artisanal gold miners, the 
Company has undertaken studies to better understand the issues 
of and challenges faced by these populations. This is a prelude to 
formulating a strategy aimed at improving these miners’ working 
conditions. At Zani-Kodo in the DRC, PACT, an American NGO, is 
assisting Mwana with this process.

GOVERNANCE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Mwana Africa recognises its obligation to rehabilitate the sites 
where it has operated. The Company has put ﬁnancial provisions 
in place for costs associated with the closure of the Company’s 
operations in Zimbabwe and South Africa, as prescribed by local 
laws. These provisions are audited and reviewed annually by 
independent consultants as prescribed by regulations.
ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES
The UK Bribery Act of 2010 updated and enhanced existing UK 
law on bribery and ensured conformity with the requirements of 
the 1997 OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.  It is now among the 
strictest laws governing international bribery, prohibiting actively 
bribing entities or persons in the context of international business 
transactions and imposing heightened liability for companies, 
directors and individuals.  Mwana Africa PLC, as a company 
incorporated/doing business in the UK, supports the law and has 
implemented procedures to ensure compliance with the Act’s 
requirements for strong, effective anti-bribery policies and systems.  
Mwana Africa’s proactive measures protect it from strict liability 
that the Act would otherwise impute to a company in the event of 
an unacceptable bribery attempt by any of its individual ofﬁcials.  
All of Mwana’s executives have signed personal commitments to 
respect the provisions and the intent of the UK Bribery Act of 2010 
and best practices.
SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
Mwana Africa has also been an active participant in and 
contributor to the ICGLR-OECD UN GoE Joint Forum on 
Responsible Mineral Supply Chains from Conﬂicted-Affected and 
High-Risk Areas process which started with the ﬁrst consultation 
meeting with the mining sector on December 8, 2009 in Paris.  
The Forum’s Gold Supplement provides speciﬁc recommendations 
for gold producers, reﬁners and exporters to establish controls 
and transparency in their supply systems to ensure identiﬁable 
chain of custody.  The recommendations vary depending on the 
Company’s activity within the chain (reﬁning mined gold, original 
recycled/scrap gold, consolidated recycled/scrap gold, melted 
recycled/scrap gold and/or mixed gold) because the risks of 
leakage are related to the speciﬁc activities involved.  Mwana 
Africa has regularly reviewed its procedures to ensure its ongoing 
compliance with these recommendations and best practices.
THIS STRATEGIC REPORT
was approved by the Board on 8 July 2014 and is signed on 
their behalf by:
Kalaa Mpinga Yim Kwan
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer                                                  Finance Director
Mwana Africa has also made progress with granting claims on a 
tributary basis to more than 200 applicants on its ground holdings 
near Kwe Kwe, Zimbabwe. This exercise is being conducted in 
conjunction with traditional leaders and the relevant regulatory 
authorities. The potential exists to assist small-scale miners with 
the viable exploitation of mineral resources and, in turn, provide 
employment and improve the local economy.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION
Mwana Africa limits the impact of its operations on the environment 
through responsible waste disposal and prevention of pollution, and 
by optimising the use of resources such as water, fuel and electricity. 
Proactive measures are taken to conserve local biodiversity, and to 
re-establish habitats disrupted by vehicle movement, waste-rock 
dumps and tailings dams. 
In all but one of our operations, internal and external environmental 
audits were completed. No signiﬁcant non-compliances were 
found by Zimbabwe’s Environmental Management Authority. 
Freda Rebecca Mine has maintained its ISO14001 certiﬁcation for 
environmental practices. Continued air-quality monitoring shows 
that the dust generated by mining activities is not at a level that 
impacts negatively on employees’ or community health.
BNC and the Zimbabwean Environmental Management Authority 
continue to monitor discharges from the permitted sources of 
efﬂuent. The restart at BNC operations involved the re-establishment 
of sound environmental practices, including programmes to reduce 
impacts, and the Trojan mine aims to obtain ISO and OHSAS 
certiﬁcation by December 2015.
Klipspringer continued during the year with external audits 
being conducted on our environmental impacts, including water 
abstraction and water disposal. No signiﬁcant areas of non-
compliance were recorded.
Regular inspections by SEMHKAT have been set up to monitor 
the environmental impact of the joint venture’s operations, 
followed by minuted meetings.

GOVERNANCE • DIRECTORS’ REPORT
DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
The directors present their report and ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2014. 
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES 
The Group’s main activities are exploration, development and production of gold, nickel, copper and diamonds. Further information concerning the activities 
of the Group and its future prospects are contained in the Chairman’s letter on page 6 and the Review of operations and exploration on pages 10 to 17. 
BUSINESS REVIEW
The Group proﬁt before tax was $43.9m (2013: $32.1m loss). The proﬁt for the year attributable to shareholders of the parent Company was $36.6m  
(2013: $28.6m loss). The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend on ordinary shares. As required by the Companies Act 2006, the Company 
must provide a fair review of the development and performance of the Group during the year ended 31 March 2014, its ﬁnancial position at the end of the year 
and likely future developments in the Group’s business. The information which satisﬁes these requirements is to be found in the Chairman’s letter on page 6, 
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s review on pages 8 to 9, the Review of operations and exploration on pages 10 to 17, and the Financial review on pages 19 to 21. 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
The principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed relate to changes in the market prices of gold, nickel and diamonds, resource and reserves 
risk, processing risk, environmental risk, mining and operating risk, ﬁnancing risk and political risk.
Metal price risk
Fluctuations in metal prices can clearly affect the proﬁtability of mining operations. The Group seeks to protect itself from adverse ﬂuctuations by investing 
in projects which can operate economically in lower metal price environments and by controlling operating costs. The Group uses no ﬁnancial instruments or 
hedging products to ﬁx metal prices.
The impact of the metal prices on the performance of the period is assessed in note 34.
Resource and Reserve risk
There is a risk that estimates of Mineral Resources and Reserves overstate their economic potential. This uncertainty could give rise to a situation where a 
mine is, or becomes, commercially unviable.
The Group manages risk by ensuring that all Mineral Resource and Reserve estimates are calculated by reference to internationally-accepted standards (in this 
case The Australian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves; ‘JORC’).
In addition all Mineral Resource estimates published by the Group are signed off by an independent qualiﬁed person. 
Information about the Resources and Reserves is included in the Review of operations and exploration.
Processing risk
There is a risk that the processing of ore to recover metal fails to deliver recoveries expected and this may have the effect of reducing projected proﬁtability. 
All of the Group’s existing mining operations have a long history of economic production and the processing techniques used are well understood. When the 
Group invests in new projects the metallurgical processes are thoroughly tested and reviewed by independent consultants before any investment is made.
Environmental risk
Exploration and development of a project can be adversely affected by environmental legislation and the unforeseen results of environmental studies carried 
out during evaluation of a project. Once a project is in production unforeseen events can give rise to environmental liabilities and/or temporary closure of 
mining operations.
The Group takes every care to comply with environmental legislation in the countries in which it operates and designs its training and procedures to minimise 
the environmental impact of operations.
The impact of the existing environmental obligations on the ﬁnancial statements is disclosed in note 29. The details of the mitigating actions undertaken by 
the Group during the period are disclosed in the section Environmental impacts and mitigation of the Overview of social and environmental responsibility.
Mining and operating risk
Mining is an inherently risky activity and can involve ground instability, failure of machinery and human error. The Group makes every effort to ensure that these 
risks are minimised by ensuring that mining operations are professional, that a high level of workforce training and education is maintained and by prompt 
reporting of incidents to management.
Information about the health and safety framework at Freda Rebecca and BNC is included in the Overview of social and environmental responsibility on 
page 22 of this report.
Financing risk
Mining is a capital intensive business and there is a risk that if ﬁnance is not available for the development or further exploration of a project then the value 
of the project may not be realised. Mwana’s ﬁnancing risk is linked to the availability of funding in the capital and debt market which are impacted by their 
perception of commodity and country risk. Mwana seeks to mitigate its ﬁnancing risk by diversifying its sources of ﬁnance for the development of its projects. FINANCIALS • CONTENTS

Political risk
There are political risks impacting the Group’s operations in Africa, including indigenisation regulations in Zimbabwe. Details of this risk and the actions 
undertaken to mitigate it are detailed below.
ZIMBABWEAN INDIGENISATION
In 2007, the Zimbabwean Government published the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act which made provision for the indigenisation of up to 
51% of all foreign owned businesses operating in Zimbabwe. Regulations in support of the Indigenisation Act were published in February 2010 in preparation 
for the implementation of the Act.
On 25 March 2011 the Minister of Youth Development, Indigenisation and Empowerment published a notice in the government gazette promulgating the 
Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment (General) Regulations in statutory instrument 21 of 2010. The document sets out the requirements for the 
implementation of the Indigenisation Act and its supporting regulations as they pertain to the mining sector. These regulations include the requirement to sell a 
sufﬁcient shareholding so that 51% or a controlling interest is owned by indigenous Zimbabweans, and/or provides for foreign investors to earn indigenisation 
credits to meet the ownership requirements.
During the year ended 31 March 2013, Mwana had disposed of 15% of Freda Rebecca to an indigenous Zimbabwean. 
A community trust has been established in the year ended 31 March 2013 and discussions are underway with this trust about a disposal of some shareholding 
in Freda Rebecca to this trust. Furthermore, discussions remain on-going with the Zimbabwean Government to determine any further impact on Mwana’s 
shareholding in its Zimbabwean assets. 
The Board has considered the impact of the uncertainties stemming from indigenisation risk on the ﬁnancial statements as disclosed in note 3 regarding the 
basis of preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and in the note 22 regarding investments. 
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Management monitors the Group’s liquidity requirement on a weekly basis. Financial and operational performance is measured regularly and operational 
updates are published quarterly.
Key performance indicators are speciﬁc to each area of the business:
Freda Rebecca
Key performance indicators include tonnes mined and processed, grade of material delivered to plant, gold recovery, operating costs per ounce produced, ounces

costs per lb, tonnes of nickel in concentrate within speciﬁcations, both in %MgO and moisture content. Other measures considered are ﬁnancial performance 
and management of assets, health, safety and environmental incidents including lost time events due to injury. The remainder of the BNC operations remain on 
care and maintenance, and the key performance areas include maintenance and the operating integrity of all the assets and the ﬁnancial performance against 
the care and maintenance budget. Refer to pages 13 to 14 in the Review of operations and exploration.
Exploration projects
Key performance indicators include the addition of resource ounces in the case of Zani and the identiﬁcation of drill targets at SEMHKAT. Refer to pages 12

CREDITOR PAYMENT POLICY
Each operating company in the Group is responsible for agreeing the terms of transactions, including payment terms, with suppliers and, provided 
that suppliers perform in accordance with the agreed terms, it is the Group’s policy that payment is made accordingly. Trade creditors of the Group at  
31 March 2014 represented 76 days (2013: 65 days) of annual purchases, including capital expenditure.

GOVERNANCE • DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
The Remuneration Committee comprising non-executive directors JL Botha (Chairman) and SG Morris, reviews the performance of the executive directors 
and sets and reviews the scale, structure and basis of their remuneration and the terms of their service agreements, paying due regard to the interests of 
shareholders as a whole and the performance of the Company. 
In determining the remuneration of executive directors, the Remuneration Committee seeks to enable the Company to attract and retain executives of the 
highest calibre. The Remuneration Committee also makes recommendations to the Board concerning the allocation of share options to employees. No director 
is permitted to participate in discussions or decisions concerning his own remuneration. 
REMUNERATION POLICY 
The policy on directors’ remuneration is that the overall remuneration package should be sufﬁciently competitive to attract and retain individuals of a quality 
capable of achieving the Group’s objectives. 
The remuneration policy is designed such that individuals are remunerated on a basis that is appropriate to their position, experience and value to the Company.
The Remuneration Committee determines the contract terms, basic salary and other remuneration for each of the executive directors, including performance 
related share options, bonuses, pension rights and any compensation payments. 
EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION PACKAGE 
The details of individual components of the remuneration package and service and employment contracts are discussed below. 
Basic salary and beneﬁts 
The policy is to review salary and beneﬁts annually against competitive market data and analysis, and adjust accordingly. 
Bonus scheme 
There is no formal bonus scheme in place. Bonus awards in respect of the year ended 31 March 2014 are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
SHARE OPTIONS 
The Company has outstanding options under an unapproved Share Option Scheme adopted in 1997 (1997 Scheme) and a new scheme which was approved 
by shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting on 31 July 2007 (2007 Scheme). Details of option awards made under these schemes are detailed 
in note 33.
1997 Scheme 
Under the 1997 Scheme unapproved share options were granted to directors and employees by the Board. The Company’s policy on the granting of share 
options is to make such awards that are necessary to recruit and retain executives. 
The Company has operated this scheme since 1997 where options were granted to any employee, ofﬁcer or director of the Company or any subsidiary of the 
Company. The limit for options granted under this scheme was not to exceed 15% of the number of issued ordinary shares from time to time. 
The Board granted options at its discretion. The subscription price was fixed by the Board at the price per share on the dealing day preceding the date 
of grant. 
These options vest immediately and may be exercised at any time within a seven-year period from the date of the grant, unless the Board determines 
otherwise. The options lapse if not exercised by the seventh anniversary of the grant. It was the Board’s policy to spread the vesting period for options granted 
to employees over two to three years. 
Unless the Board agrees otherwise, the right to exercise an option terminates on the holder ceasing to be a participant, subject to certain exceptions, which 
broadly apply in the event of death of the option holder or where the option holder ceases to be a participant due to retirement, ill health, accident or 
redundancy. In such a case, the option may be exercised within six months of such event provided such exercise will take place within seven years of the 
original date of grant. 
2007 Scheme 
The 2007 Scheme allows for awards of both tax approved options (approved options) to be made to employees resident in the United Kingdom and 
unapproved options (unapproved options), to be made to both resident and non-resident employees. The Company’s policy on the granting of share options is 
to make such awards that are necessary to recruit and retain executives. Details of option awards made under this scheme are detailed in note 33. 
The Company has operated this scheme since December 2007 where options may be granted to full-time employees and directors of the Company or any 
subsidiary of the Company. The overall limit for options granted under this scheme and any other employees’ share scheme adopted by the Company is, in any 
rolling 10-year period, 10% of the issued ordinary share capital (including treasury shares) of the Company for the time being plus 8,100,000 ordinary shares. 
There is an individual limit of a maximum of ordinary shares to the value of £30,000 in respect of approved options.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
GOVERNANCE • DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Options may be granted when the Remuneration Committee determines, within 42 days of the announcement by the Company of its full or interim results. 
Options may be granted outside the 42-day period if the Remuneration Committee considers there to be exceptional circumstances. Options must be granted 
subject to performance conditions being satisﬁed. The performance conditions must be objective and, save where the Remuneration Committee determines 
there to be exceptional circumstances, the performance conditions must relate to the overall ﬁnancial performance of the Company or the market value of 
ordinary shares over a period of at least three years. The performance conditions can be waived or amended by the Remuneration Committee if it determines 
that a change of circumstances means that the performance conditions cannot reasonably be met. No consideration is payable on the grant of an option and 
no option may be granted after 31 July 2017. 
The Remuneration Committee determines the exercise price before the options are granted which cannot be less than the market value of the shares on the 
date of grant. 
The options can be exercised only on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant provided the performance conditions have been satisﬁed or waived by 
the Remuneration Committee. The options lapse if not exercised by the 10th anniversary of the grant. 
These options lapse when the option holder ceases to be an eligible employee. In the case of death, a participant’s personal representatives may exercise 
his/her options within 12 months after the date of death. Where an option holder ceases to be an employee by reason of injury, disability, redundancy, the 
Company that employs the option holder ceasing to be a subsidiary of the Company, retirement, pregnancy or in any other circumstances determined by the 
Remuneration Committee, the options may be exercised within six months of the termination of employment or such longer period as may be determined by 
the Remuneration Committee.
Share incentives 
The Share Incentive Scheme was approved by shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting on 31 July 2007. The Share Incentive Scheme is designed 
to complement the Share Option Scheme to facilitate awards to selected executives and managers. The Share Incentive Scheme permits the award of any one 
or a combination of the following incentives:
• the sale of ordinary shares on deferred payment terms;
• share awards as part of a bonus scheme by way of nil cost options in consideration of cash bonuses forgone on terms that would be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee of the Company; and
• the issue of share appreciation rights either by the Company or EBT (as deﬁned below).
The Company has also adopted an Employees’ Beneﬁt Trust (EBT) which will operate in conjunction with the Share Option Scheme and Share Incentive Scheme. 
The EBT has not yet been utilised for this purpose and there have been no awards under the Share Incentive Scheme since it was approved by shareholders.
Pensions 
The Company does not operate a pension scheme for executive directors but does, according to the director’s preference, contribute to the personal pension 
plan of each executive director, or pays cash in lieu of such contributions up to a speciﬁed maximum of 12.5% of salary. No pension contributions are made 
in respect of non-executive directors.
Fees 
The fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board, having taken independent expert advice on appropriate levels, and are reviewed on an 
annual basis. 
Service contracts 
The service and employment contracts of the executive directors are not of a ﬁxed duration and therefore have no unexpired terms, but continuation in ofﬁce 
as a director is subject to re-election by shareholders as required under the Company’s Articles of Association. The Company’s policy is for executive directors 
to have service and employment contracts with provision for termination of no longer than 12 months’ notice.  
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts. Letters of appointment provide for termination of the appointment with up to three months’ notice 
by either party. 
Details of the current directors’ contracts or appointment dates are as follows:

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF MWANA AFRICA PLC 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent Company ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. As required by the AIM Rules of the 
London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRSs as endorsed by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent Company ﬁnancial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and parent Company and of their proﬁt or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent Company ﬁnancial statements, the 
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as endorsed by the EU; and
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent Company will continue  
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the parent Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the parent Company and enable them to ensure that its ﬁnancial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

GOVERNANCE • STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The directors support the principles of good corporate governance. While not mandatory for an AIM company, the directors have implemented, where 
practical for a company of this size and nature, certain provisions of the principles of good governance and code of best practices set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The disclosures presented herein are limited and are not intended to constitute a corporate governance statement as prescribed by the 
Disclosures and Transparency Rules or the Companies Act.
The Board has also considered the guidance published by the Financial Reporting Council concerning the internal control requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, in line with the Turnbull Report. The Board regularly reviews key business risks, via a number of properly constituted committees, in addition 
to the ﬁnancial risks facing the Group in the operations of the business.
THE BOARD
The Board meets at least quarterly throughout the year. The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s strategy, planning, 
budgets, acquisitions, risk, and environmental management.
The non-executive directors Mr SG Morris and Mr JL Botha are considered by the Board to be independent of management and free from any business or other 
relationship which could materially affect the exercise of their independent judgement. Messrs YH Ning and YC Hu have an interest in the Group’s largest 
shareholder China International Mining Group Corporation.
Directors have the facility to take external independent advice in furtherance of their duties at the Group’s expense and have access to the services of the 
Company secretary.
The Board delegates certain of its responsibilities to the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees under clearly deﬁned terms of reference.
AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee meets at least twice during the year and is responsible for ensuring that the ﬁnancial performance of the Company is properly reported 
on and monitored, and for meeting the auditors and reviewing the auditors’ reports relating to the accounts. The committee also recommends the appointment 
of, and reviews the fees of, the external auditors. It meets once a year with the auditors without executive Board members present. The Audit Committee 
comprises at least three members, two of whom shall be non-executive. The current membership of the committee is Mr SG Morris (Chairman) and Mr JL Botha, 
both of whom are non-executive, and Mr YC Kwan.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee meets at least twice per year. It reviews the performance of the executive directors and sets and reviews the scale, structure and 
basis of their remuneration and the terms of their service agreements paying due regard to the interest of shareholders as a whole and the performance of 
the Company. The Remuneration Committee comprises two non-executive directors, Mr JL Botha (Chairman) and Mr SG Morris. The Directors’ remuneration 
report appears on pages 32 to 36.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The role of the Nomination Committee is to recommend any new appointment of directors to the Board, based on the merits of the candidates and the 
relevance of their background and experience. It periodically reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board.
The committee comprises at least three members, two of whom shall be non-executive directors. The committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Board, 
Mr SG Morris. Mr JL Botha is the other non-executive member and Mr KK Mpinga is also a member of the committee.
The nomination committee met twice during the year. The appointments of Mr YC Kwan as Finance Director and Mr M Wellesley-Wood as Non-Executive 
Chairman were considered and approved by the full Board. FINANCIALS • CONTENTS

INTERNAL CONTROLS
The directors have overall responsibility for the Group’s internal control effectiveness in safeguarding the assets of the Group. Internal control systems are 
designed to identify and mitigate the particular type of business, operational and safety risks to which the Group is exposed. Internal controls can only provide 
a reasonable, but not absolute assurance against material misstatements or loss.
The Board reviews the effectiveness of the internal controls through the Audit Committee and through executive management reporting to the Board. Business 
plans, budgets and authorisation limits for the approval of signiﬁcant expenditure, including investments are appraised and approved by the Board. The Board 
also seeks to ensure that there is a proper organisational and management structure with clear responsibilities and accountability.
It is the Board’s policy to ensure that the management structure and the quality and integrity of the personnel are compatible with the requirements of 
the Group.
The Company complies with rule 21 of the AIM Rules for Companies regarding dealings in the Company’s shares and has adopted a share dealing code to 
ensure compliance by the directors and applicable employees.
SHAREHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS
During the year the executive directors met frequently with shareholders and the investment community. This included formal road shows and presentations, 
one-to-one meetings, analysts meetings and press interviews. The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Finance Director regularly brief the Board on these contacts and 
relay the views expressed. 
ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION
Following introduction of the UK Anti-Bribery & Corruption Act, the Board introduced a Group policy in relation thereto. The Board takes a zero tolerance 
approach to bribery and corruption and will uphold all laws relevant to countering bribery and corruption in all jurisdictions in which the Group operates. 
The Board expect the highest standard of personal and professional behaviour from all employees within the Group and from external contractors and third 
parties working or performing services on behalf of the Group. The Board will not tolerate any incidence of bribery and will take action against anyone 
employed within the Group, or associated with the Group, who commits bribery.
The Group’s policy on bribery and corruption has been communicated to all employees and contractors.
The Board has delegated oversight of the policy to the Audit Committee and has appointed the ﬁnance director to act as the Group’s anti-bribery 
compliance ofﬁcer. 
The Group regularly monitors and investigates all allegations of fraud and bribery and corruption and reports on all issues arising to the Board. MWANA AFRICA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

GOVERNANCE • INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF MWANA AFRICA PLC
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF MWANA AFRICA PLC
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Mwana Africa PLC for the year ended 31 March 2014 set out on pages 42 to 80. The ﬁnancial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and, as 
regards the parent company ﬁnancial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR  
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 37, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial 
statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, and express an opinion on, the ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
A description of the scope of an audit of ﬁnancial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate.
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
In our opinion: 
• the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2014 and of the Group’s 
proﬁt for the year then ended; 
• the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
• the parent Company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
EMPHASIS OF MATTER – CARRYING VALUE OF COMPANY INVESTMENTS 
In forming our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements, which is not modiﬁed, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in note 22 to the ﬁnancial 
statements concerning the carrying value of investments held by the Company in the Zimbabwean operation of $96.5m (2013: $74.6m). As disclosed in 
note 22, there are uncertainties linked to the implementation of the Indigenisation Law in Zimbabwe. The possible impact of this law is uncertain and causes 
doubt over the carrying value of the investments held by the Company. The ﬁnancial statements do not include the adjustments that would result from the 
impact of the Zimbabwe indigenisation legislation on the carrying value of the investment held by the Company. 
OPINION ON OTHER MATTER PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the ﬁnancial statements.
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or 
• the parent Company ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2014
1.  REPORTING ENTITY
Mwana Africa PLC (‘the Company’) is a company domiciled in the UK. The address of the Company’s registered ofﬁce is Premier House, 10 Greycoat Place, 
London, SW1P 1SB. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 March 2014 comprise the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as ‘the Group’ and individually as ‘Group entities’) and the Group’s interest in jointly controlled entities. The Group primarily 
is involved in the mining of gold and nickel.
2.  ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS AS ENDORSED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION 
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the parent company (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together, the Group) and the ﬁnancial statements of the 
Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU). 
3.  BASIS OF PREPARATION
Basis of preparation 
With the exception of certain items noted below, which are carried at fair value, the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost 
convention.
The Company and consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU (‘IFRSs’) and, as regards the Company ﬁnancial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own income statement. 
Going Concern 
The directors, having considered the Group’s and the Company’s current trading activities, funding position and the Zimbabwean environment for the period 
of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these Financial Statements consider it appropriate to adopt the Going Concern basis in preparing the 
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2014.
The Group’s activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business review on page 28.  
The ﬁnancial position of the Group, its cash ﬂows and liquidity position are as set out in the Financial review on pages 19 to 21.
During the year to 31 March 2014 operations at BNC have re-started successfully and the operating cash inﬂows from BNC together with signiﬁcant cost 
cutting measures achieved during the year have signiﬁcantly improved the Group’s cash position and outlook.
The directors’ cash ﬂow forecasts assume:
• an average nickel price of $18,500 per tonne and average gold price of $1,250 per ounce;
• settlement in full of the legacy creditors at BNC in line with agreements concluded last ﬁnancial year. Staff creditors will be settled by December 2014 and 
trade creditors in December 2015;
• all planned capital expenditure to maintain existing operations, with any additional capital expenditure to be funded from external sources. The directors 
also plan to restart the smelter at BNC and expand the milling capacity at Freda Rebecca if debt funding is obtained from external sources. These projects 
would impact positively the cash ﬂow forecast if achieved during the period considered for the going concern analysis;
• the Group’s other activities are assumed to be funded from internally generated cash resources, however, in line with other mining companies the Group 
retains a high degree of ﬂexibility over its expenditure and will continue to pursue alternative funding options for its main exploration projects from time to 
time including potential farm-out or joint venture arrangements where appropriate.  
These forecasts indicate that the Group will have sufﬁcient cash available to continue in operation for at least a year from the date of approval of these 
ﬁnancial statements.
The Directors are aware that various uncertainties outside the Group’s control might impact the validity of their forecasts. These uncertainties include future 
gold and nickel prices, mining and processing risks, resource and reserve risks and customer risks in addition to the political and indigenisation risks in 
Zimbabwe which may constrain the ability of the Company to control the movement of cash between entities or receive dividends. Nickel prices in particular 
have been historically volatile, however, absent a structural change in the market (such as a decision by Indonesia to reverse the export ban), forecasts are 
considered to be achievable. Reasonably expected variations in nickel price would not cause the going concern assumption to be inappropriate.
The Directors consider that they have a number of actions available to them in the event of any of these uncertainties eventuating including constraining cash 
expenditure at operations, curtailing exploration expenditure and arranging additional debt ﬁnancing.
The directors, after making enquiries and considering the uncertainties described above, believe that the Company and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.  Accordingly they continue to adopt the Going Concern basis in preparing the Annual Report 
and ﬁnancial statements and these ﬁnancial statements do not include any adjustments that would result from the Going Concern basis of preparation  
being inappropriate. MWANA AFRICA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3.  BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities over whose ﬁnancial and operating policies the Group has the ability to exercise control. The Group ﬁnancial statements 
incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted. Under 
this method, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition 
or up to the date of disposal. 
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests exist in less than wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company and represent the outside interest’s share of the carrying values of the 
subsidiaries. Non-controlling interests are recorded at their proportionate share of the identiﬁable net assets acquired as at the date of acquisition and are 
presented immediately after the shareholder’s equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. When the subsidiary company issues its own shares to outside 
interests, a dilution gain or loss arises as a result of the difference between the Company’s share of the proceeds and the carrying value of the underlying 
equity. If the change in ownership does not result in loss of control, it is accounted for as an equity transaction.
Jointly controlled entities
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long term interest and in which the Group has the ability to exercise joint control in terms of a 
contractual arrangement. The Group’s interest in a jointly controlled entity is accounted for by proportionate consolidation. In terms of this method, the Group 
includes its share of the income and expenses, assets and liabilities, and cash ﬂows on a line by line basis with similar items in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Inter-group balances and transactions and any unrealised income and expenses arising from inter-group transactions are eliminated in the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements.
Companies with different year-ends than the parent Company
The following DRC subsidiaries of Mwana Africa PLC have 31 December year ends as required by DRC legislation:
• Mwana Africa Congo Gold SPRL (Zani Kodo)
• SEMHKAT SPRL
4.  SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the 
estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Derivation of assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable values of assets requires a signiﬁcant amount of judgement. The assumptions underlying 
the estimated recoverable values include, amongst others, the technical performance, revenue, operating costs and discount rate (for discounted cash ﬂow 
based valuations), and are based on management’s best judgements at the date of signing the accounts. 
The life of mine periods used for the purpose of calculating estimated recoverable values are based on Resources and Reserves. These judgements used by 
management correspond to realistic scenarios taking into account the information available. The impairment note discloses a sensitivity analysis with regard 
to the assumptions which the Board deems most susceptible to variances against forecast.
In particular, information about signiﬁcant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most signiﬁcant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements is included in the following notes:
Property, Plant and Equipment (note 20); including:
Assets’ useful lives and depreciation rates for property, plant and equipment and mineral interests
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation rates are calculated on a straight-line basis based on the estimated assets’ useful lives.
Should the assets’ useful lives differ from the initial estimate, an adjustment would be made. The assets’ useful lives are estimated based on the shorter of the 
life of the mine and the useful life of the speciﬁc component of the asset.
Commencement of commercial/operating level production
As a mine is developed and until it reaches an operating level that is consistent with the use intended by management, costs incurred are capitalised as 
property, plant and equipment. The Company exercises judgement to determine the commencement of commercial production that is deﬁned as the date 
when a mine achieves a sustainable level of production that provides a basis for a reasonable expectation of proﬁtability along with various qualitative 
factors including but not limited to the achievement of mechanical completion, whether production levels are sufﬁcient to be at least capable of generating 
sustainable positive cash ﬂow, and whether the product is of sufﬁcient quantity to be sold.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Deferred tax (note 17)
In assessing the probability of realising deferred income tax assets management makes estimates related to expectations of future taxable income, expected 
timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the likelihood that tax positions taken will be sustained upon examination by applicable tax 
authorities. Where applicable tax laws and regulations are either unclear or subject to ongoing varying interpretations, it is reasonably possible that changes in 
these estimates can occur that materially affect the amounts of income tax assets recognised. Also, future changes in tax laws could limit the Company from 
realising the tax beneﬁts from the deferred tax assets. The Company reassesses unrecognised deferred income tax assets at each reporting period.
Inventories (note 24)
The assumptions used in the valuation of work-in-progress and ﬁnished goods inventories include estimates of gold contained in the leach tanks, the amount 
of gold in the mill circuits, recovery percentage and the estimation of the gold price expected to be realised when the gold is recovered. 
Rehabilitation provisions (note 29)
The cost estimates are updated annually during the life of a mine to reﬂect known developments, (e.g. revisions to cost estimates and to the estimated lives of 
operations), and are subject to review at regular intervals. Rehabilitation liabilities are estimated based on the Company’s interpretation of current regulatory 
requirements, constructive obligations and are measured at fair value. Fair value is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash 
expenditures for the settlement of decommissioning, restoration or similar liabilities that may occur upon rehabilitation of the mine site. Such estimates are 
subject to change based on changes in laws and regulations, technology and negotiations with regulatory authorities.
Provisions (note 31)
The use of estimates regarding the probability of the outﬂow of economic beneﬁts as well as whether the Company has an obligation which needs to  
be settled. 
Share-based payments (note 33)
The use of valuation models to fair value share-based payments require assumptions regarding the estimated term of the option, share price volatility and 
expected dividend yield.
5.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Foreign currencies
(a) Functional and presentation currency 
The individual ﬁnancial statements of each Group entity are prepared in its functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which that entity operates. For the purpose of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the results and ﬁnancial position of each entity are translated into  
US dollars, which is the presentational currency of the Group. 
(b) Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency 
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates 
of the transactions. At each subsequent balance sheet date: 
• foreign currency monetary items are re-translated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the settlement or  
re-translation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement;
• non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not re-translated; and 
• exchange differences arising on the re-translation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement except for differences 
arising on the re-translation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised in the other comprehensive income, in which case 
any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity. 
The directors have prepared the ﬁnancial statements on the basis of their judgement that the functional currency under IAS 21 of the Group’s Zimbabwean 
subsidiaries is the US dollar. The directors judge that the functional currency of these subsidiaries is the US dollar, based on revenue, capital expenditure and 
the majority of costs being denominated in US dollars. 
(c) Translation from functional currency to presentational currency 
When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Group’s presentational currency (US dollars), its results, ﬁnancial position and cash ﬂows 
are translated into the presentational currency as follows: 
• assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date;
• income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such an average rate does not approximate the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used;  
• all resulting exchange differences are recognised in translation reserves as a separate component of equity and are recognised in the income statement in 
the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of; and 
• cash ﬂows are translated using average exchange rates during the period and the effect of exchange rate changes on the balances of cash and cash 
equivalents is presented as part of the reconciliation of movements therein. MWANA AFRICA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
5.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Intangible assets – exploration and evaluation expenditure 
All expenditure directly related to mineral exploration is capitalised on a project-by-project basis, pending the determination of the feasibility of the project. 
Exploration costs include certain administration and salary costs. If a project is ultimately deemed commercially and technically viable, the related exploration 
costs remain capitalised and are reclassiﬁed to tangible assets whilst the asset is developed, and are then written off over the life of the estimated ore reserve 
on a unit-of-production basis. If it is determined that a project is not expected to be successful, whether relinquished, abandoned or uncommercial, the related 
exploration costs are written off. 
Once a decision is made to develop then the related exploration and evaluation costs are transferred from intangible to tangible assets.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in exploration activities is capitalised to intangible exploration and evaluation assets. 
For the purpose of impairment assessment, capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditures are allocated to the cash generating units on the basis of the 
exploration ﬁeld in which the costs have been incurred.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or development of the asset.
Capitalised mine development costs include expenditure incurred to develop new ore bodies, to deﬁne further mineralisation in existing ore bodies and, to 
build or expand the capacity of a mine or to enhance its future economic beneﬁts. 
Development projects are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. The costs capitalised under development projects will include 
an allocation of salary costs, materials and any other costs directly attributable to the project. This does not include administration and general expenses which 
would have been incurred irrespective of whether the project was taking place. 
Any sales taking place within the development project period would be shown as revenue with corresponding costs allocated to cost of sales.
When signiﬁcant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) 
of property, plant and equipment.
Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated from the date they are available for use or, in respect of capitalised cost, from the date that commercial 
production is reached.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line basis over 
their estimated useful lives, as set out below: 
• Mining assets: mining assets consists of plant and equipment used in mining operations and is depreciated at varying rates on a straight-line basis over 
the expected useful lives (deﬁned by reference to the life of mine), which range from three to 17 years. It also includes capitalised mine development costs 
and development projects: 
  The Group’s policy is to depreciate the cost in equal instalments over the estimated economic life of the project. These costs are depreciated from the date 
on which commercial production begins. 
• Smelter and refinery assets: smelter and reﬁnery assets are depreciated at varying rates on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives, which 
range from 5 to 40 years.
• Plant and equipment and motor vehicles: plant and equipment and motor vehicles are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful 
lives at the annual rate of 10% and 20% respectively.
• Buildings: buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives, currently 40 years.
• Depreciation is generally recognised in proﬁt and loss, unless the amount is included in the carrying amount of another asset.
• Land is not depreciated.
  Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated with the expenditure will ﬂow to the Group. Ongoing 
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Impairment 
(i) Non-ﬁnancial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.  
Exploration and evaluation assets are also assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset may exceed 
its recoverable amount. 
NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2014 MWANA AFRICA ANNUAL REPORT 2014
55
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (“CGU”) exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of i) its fair value less costs to sell and ii) its value in use, which is the present value of the future 
cash ﬂows expected to be derived from the asset or CGU, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks associated with the asset or CGU. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating 
units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit. A cash generating unit is the smallest identiﬁable group of assets that generates 
cash inﬂows that are largely independent of the cash inﬂows from other assets or groups of assets. It usually corresponds to the exploration ﬁeld or the 
production unit. 
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a 
change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.  Reversals 
of impairment relating to other assets are recognised in the income statement.
(ii) Non-derivative ﬁnancial assets
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale ﬁnancial asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective evidence that the asset 
is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is recognised in proﬁt or loss even though the ﬁnancial asset has not been  
de-recognised. The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in the income statement is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair 
value, less any impairment loss on that ﬁnancial asset previously recognised in the income statement.
The Company assesses for impairment the value of its investments in and loans to its subsidiaries when there are indicators of impairment.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classiﬁed as available-for-sale is not reversed through the income statement. If the 
fair value of a debt instrument classiﬁed as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment 
loss was recognised in the income statement, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.  An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is 
not reversed. 
Financial instruments
(a) Non-derivative financial assets
The Group initially recognises loans and receivables on the date that they are originated. All other ﬁnancial assets (including assets designated at fair value 
through proﬁt and loss) are recognised initially on trade date, which is the date that the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group de-recognises a ﬁnancial asset when the contractual rights to the cash ﬂows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual 
cash ﬂows in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the ﬁnancial asset are transferred.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of ﬁnancial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right 
to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
The Group classiﬁes non-derivative ﬁnancial assets into the following categories: ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt and loss, held-to-maturity ﬁnancial 
assets, loans and receivables and available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets.
(i) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are recognised initially 
at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method, less any impairment losses.
Loans and receivables comprise cash and cash equivalents, and trade and other receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities of three months or less from acquisition date that are subject to an 
insigniﬁcant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments.
(b) Non-derivative financial liabilities
The Group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they are originated. All other ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised 
initially on the trade date that the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group de-recognises a ﬁnancial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
The Group classiﬁes non-derivative ﬁnancial liabilities into the other ﬁnancial liabilities category. Such ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value 
less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these ﬁnancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method. MWANA AFRICA ANNUAL REPORT 2014
56
ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
5.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Other ﬁnancial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts, and trade and other payables.
Investments 
Joint ventures
The Group holds a 69.77% interest in the Klipspringer Diamond Mine joint venture, the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of which are consolidated on 
a proportional basis.
Investments in subsidiaries 
The Company has investments in its various subsidiaries. These are accounted for at cost less impairment. All inter-group loans are repayable on demand or 
at arm’s length basis. 
Inventories 
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods purchased for resale, the weighted average purchase price is used.
For ﬁnished goods and work in progress which includes quantities of gold in process, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on 
normal capacity.
Net realisable value is calculated based on market prices prevailing as at the year-end less costs to sell. 
Rehabilitation provision 
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and when it is probable that an outﬂow 
of resources embodying economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. 
Estimated long-term environmental obligations, comprising pollution control, rehabilitation and mine closure, are based on the Group’s environmental 
management plans in compliance with current technology, environmental and regulatory requirements. 
On initial recognition, the net present value of estimated future decommissioning costs are capitalised to property, plant and equipment and the concomitant 
provisions are raised. These estimates are reviewed annually and discounted using a pre-tax rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks speciﬁc to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as ﬁnance cost. Any increases in such revised estimates are capitalised 
to property, plant and equipment while decreases in estimates are recognised as an impairment of the asset in the period in which they are incurred.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, 
trade discounts and volume rebates. 
Revenue represents the sale of gold, nickel and diamonds net of discounts and taxes. Revenue also includes toll reﬁning and processing of material on behalf 
of, or purchased from, non-group companies.
Revenue is recognised when signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the 
associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of 
revenue can be measured reliably. If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as 
a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.
The timing of the transfer of risks and rewards and measurement varies depending on the item sold, which occurs as follows:
• Revenue from the sale of gold is based on the spot price on the date of delivery, which is also the point at which the Company recognises the revenue for 
gold sales.
• Revenue from the sale of nickel is recognised on delivery and the measurement based on the international market price of nickel.
• Diamond revenue is based on negotiated prices and recognised on delivery.
Leases 
Leases where the lessor retains the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset are classiﬁed as operating leases. Operating lease rentals are 
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. 
The Group has not entered into any ﬁnance lease arrangements. 
Employee beneﬁts
(a) Defined contribution pension scheme 
Certain companies in the Group operate deﬁned contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in 
independently administered funds. 
Obligations for contributions to deﬁned contribution plans are expensed as the related service is provided. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to 
the extent that a cash refund is available or a reduction in future payments is available.

(b) Share-based payments 
The share option programmes allow employees to acquire shares of the Company. The grant-date fair value of the share-based payment award is recognised 
as employee expenses, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair 
value of the options granted is measured using an option- pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reﬂect the actual number of share options that vest except where variations are due only to share prices 
not achieving the threshold for vesting. 
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax (including withholding tax) and deferred tax.  
(a) Current tax 
Current tax payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁt differs from proﬁt before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date. Current tax also includes 
any tax liability arising from withholding tax on dividends.
(b) Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is measured on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding 
tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill 
or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable proﬁt nor 
the accounting proﬁt.  
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except 
where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable 
proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when 
it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the associated deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when 
they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
6.  REVISED AND AMENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS
The following revised and amended standards, which have been endorsed by the EU, have been adopted by the Group in these consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements; the adoption has had no material impact on the Group’s net cash ﬂows, ﬁnancial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.
• Amendments to IFRS 7 – ‘Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’, issued December 2011 and endorsed by the EU December 2012. 
Additional disclosures for ﬁnancial assets and liabilities within the scope of the common disclosures.
• Amendments to IAS 1 – ‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income’, issued May 2012 and endorsed by the EU in June 2012. 
The amendment deals with the clariﬁcation of the requirements for comparative information.
• Amendments to IAS 19 – ‘Employee Benefits’, issued in June 2011, endorsed by the EU in June 2012. The amendments include clariﬁcation of 
miscellaneous issues and enhanced disclosure.
• IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’, issued in May 2011 and endorsed by the EU in December 2012, is a new standard that aims to improve consistency 
and reduce complexity of fair value measurement techniques adopted in ﬁnancial statements.
• IFRIC 20 ‘Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine’, issued in October 2011 and endorsed by the EU in December 2012, is 
effective for the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2013. This interpretation applies to the treatment of waste removal (stripping) costs incurred in 
surface mining activity during the production phase of a mine.
Standards, amendments and interpretations that are not yet effective
The following new, revised and amended standards and interpretations have been issued and endorsed by the EU unless otherwise stipulated, but are not yet 
effective and have not been adopted by the Group in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments (Hedge accounting and Amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7 and IAS 39)’ issued in November 2013, but not yet 
endorsed by the EU, the standard is IASB effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard introduces a new hedge accounting 
chapter and makes improvements to the reporting of changes in the fair value of an entity’s own debt. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact on its 
ﬁnancial position or performance; MWANA AFRICA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
6.  REVISED AND AMENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS CONTINUED
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, issued in May 2011, replaces the consolidation requirements in SIC-12 ‘Consolidation – Special Purpose 
Entities’ and IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’. This standard builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as 
the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the parent Company. The standard provides 
additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difﬁcult to assess. The standard has been endorsed by the EU and is effective for 
the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2014. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 10’s full impact on its ﬁnancial position or performance;
• IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’, issued in May 2011, replaces IAS 31 ‘Interests in joint ventures’. The standard establishes accounting principles based on 
the rights and obligations of the joint arrangement rather than its legal form. The standard introduces two types of joint arrangement – joint operations and 
joint ventures – and eliminates proportionate consolidation for any form of joint arrangement. The standard has been endorsed by the EU and is effective 
for the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2014. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 11’s full impact on its ﬁnancial position or performance;
• IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’, issued in May 2011, is a new standard that establishes the disclosure requirements for all entities 
that a Group has an interest in, including subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off-balance sheet vehicles. The 
standard has been endorsed by the EU and is effective for the accounting period beginning on 1 January 2014. The Group is yet to assess IFRS 12’s full 
impact on its ﬁnancial position or performance;
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ issued in May 2014, IASB effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 but not yet 
endorsed by the EU. The standard introduces a new revenue recognition model that recognises revenue either at a point in time or over time. The Group is 
yet to assess IFRS 15’s full impact on its ﬁnancial position or performance;
• IAS 27 (2011) ‘Separate Financial Statements’, issued in May 2011 and endorsed by the EU in December 2012. Consolidation requirements 
previously forming part of IAS 27 (2008) have been revised and are now contained in IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’; and
• Improvements to IFRSs. There are a number of amendments to certain standards following the 2011 annual improvements project of which some have 
been endorsed by the EU and others not. The impact of any consequential changes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements is not likely to be signiﬁcant. 
The following amendments have been endorsed by the EU:
• Amendments to IAS 28 (2008) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures;
• Amendments to IAS 32 – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities;
• Amendments to IAS 36 – Recoverable disclosures for non-ﬁnancial assets;
• Investment Entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27); and
• Transition Guidance (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12).
7.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Overview
The Group has exposure to the following risks in relation to its operating and ﬁnancial activities: 
• credit risk,
• liquidity risk, 
• market risk, and
• currency risk.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and 
managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included within note 34. 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The subsidiaries report 
regularly to the Board of Directors on their activities and their risk management procedures. 
The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the 
adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a ﬁnancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises 
principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. 
The Company’s cash balances are held in investments and with institutions considered by the directors to have a low risk of default. The Group’s policy on 
credit risk is to seek, to the extent possible, to deal with customers with a strong ﬁnancial position, and to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to 
reduce the level of counterparty credit risk. Such measures may include limiting shipments of material while balances are outstanding, requesting the use of 
bank and/or corporate guarantees, and, where appropriate, retention of amounts owed by the Group to its counterparties by way of offset against amounts 
owed to the Group. At year-end, the Group’s principal customers are Fidelity Printers and Reﬁneries who purchases gold production from Freda Rebecca, as 
well as Glencore who purchases nickel production from BNC.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due and is measured by reference to cash levels and 
forecasted cash ﬂows. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to seek to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufﬁcient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group 
monitors its current and forecasted cash and cash equivalents positions to ensure that it will be able to meet its ﬁnancial commitments.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • NOTES TO THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and commodity prices will affect the Group’s income. The Group’s earnings 
are exposed to movements in the prices of gold, nickel, and diamonds that it produces. The Group is also exposed to movements in interest rates on cash 
and cash equivalents as well as the risk related to market price of the investments held. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control 
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. The Group’s policy is not to hedge commodity price risk.  Consequently, as at 
31 March 2014 and during the year, the Group did not have any long term commodity price hedges in place.
Currency risk 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from transactions and investments that are denominated in currencies 
other than the US dollar, including pound sterling and the South African rand. Such risks include the effect of movements in exchange rates on the Group’s 
forecasts of capital and operating expenditure, and on the Group’s forecasts of revenue. The Group’s policy is not to hedge currency risk. Consequently, as at  
31 March 2014 and during the year, the Group did not have any currency hedges in place.
Capital management
The Group considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity. The Board is committed to maintaining a capital base that maintains creditors’ 
conﬁdence in Mwana’s ability to meet its commitments.
The Company’s primary objectives when managing its capital are: 
• to ensure that the Company is able to operate as a going concern;
• to have available both the necessary ﬁnancial resources and the appropriate equity to allow the Company to make investments including, where necessary, 
further investment in existing subsidiaries, that will deliver acceptable future returns to the Company’s shareholders; and 
• to maintain sufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
There were no changes in the Company’s approach to capital management in the year.  Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally 
imposed capital requirements.
8.  SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
The Group has four reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic business units.
The strategic business units offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different technology and marketing 
strategies. The CEO reviews internal management reports for each of the strategic business units. The following summary describes the operations in each of 
the Group’s reportable segments:
• Gold: Gold mining and prospecting activities
• Nickel: Nickel mining, smelting and reﬁning activities partially on care and maintenance
• Diamonds: Diamond mining activities currently on care and maintenance
• Exploration: Gold and base metal exploration activities

The Group holds a 69.77% interest (2013: 68.93%) in the Klipspringer diamond mine joint venture. The Group does not have control over the joint venture 
as the decision making is still shared between the joint venture partners. The mine, which is situated in South Africa’s Limpopo Province, was placed on care 
and maintenance in February 2011 following a number of severe weather incidents which occurred in December 2010 and January 2011, ﬂooding the shaft 
bottom lower (7) level. Mwana Africa is currently the sole funder of the operation and the joint venture partners’ interest is being diluted in accordance with 
the contractual agreement.

16.  INCOME TAX (CREDIT)/EXPENSE CONTINUED
Deferred taxation impacts are described more fully in note 17. 
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 26% to 24% (effective from 1 April 2012) and to 23% (effective 1 April 2013) were substantively enacted on 
26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively. Further reductions to 21% (effective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (effective from 1 April 2015) were substantively 
enacted on 2 July 2013. Changes to the Company’s domestic tax rate are unlikely to have a signiﬁcant impact on the Group’s current tax charge as the majority 
of taxable income is incurred in foreign jurisdictions.
Signiﬁcant factors affecting the tax charge relate to the taxation regimes for the mining sector in the UK, Zimbabwe, South Africa and the DRC. Changes in 
any of these areas could, adversely or positively impact the Group’s tax charge in the future.

Net deferred tax (asset)/liability at end of the year (528) 9,320
Deferred tax assets (19,406) (1,186)
Deferred tax liabilities 18,878 10,506
The elements of deferred taxation are as follows:
Difference between accumulated depreciation and amortisation and capital allowances 18,734 10,496
Unutilised losses (19,213) –
Other timing differences (49) (1,176)
(528) 9,320
The deferred tax liability represents the difference between the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and the corresponding tax bases on those 
assets. The deferred tax asset principally relates to unutilised tax losses at Bindura Nickel Corporation. The full taxation loss has been fully recognised in the 
current year since the restart of the Trojan mine, as management is now of the opinion that the full tax loss will be utilised against future taxable generated 
by the operation.

Deferred taxes have not been recognised in respect of the following items:
Difference between accumulated depreciation and amortisation and capital allowances 981 1,105

Tax losses 11,722 39,514
Other timing differences 1,174 4,063
20,620 51,259
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the 
Group can utilise the beneﬁts.

18.  DIVIDENDS 
No dividends were declared during the 2014 ﬁnancial year (2013: Nil). 
19.  EARNINGS PER SHARE 
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing the proﬁt or loss after taxation for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the sum of the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue ranking for dividend during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing the proﬁt or loss after taxation for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the sum of the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue, adjusted for the effect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares that were outstanding during the year.

Basic earnings/(loss) per share 2.89c (2.62c)
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share 2.89c (2.62c)
The effect of shares issued reﬂects the number of shares in issue during the year, weighted for the number of days that the shares were in issue for the 
ﬁnancial year. Share placements were made on 12 September 2013 (130,254,717 shares), 17 September 2013 (109,913,459 shares) and on 23 October 
2013 (37,885,448 shares).
No dilutive effect was recognised for the 2014 ﬁnancial year as the exercise price of all potentially dilutive instruments at year-end were higher than the 
average share price for the portion of the year that these instruments were in issue.
No dilutive effect was recognised for the 2013 ﬁnancial year as the dilutive potential ordinary shares would have reduced the loss per share. MWANA AFRICA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

 interest in the BK16 project in Botswana. These investments are carried at nil value (2013: Nil).

of these entities. 
The Group’s exposure to credit, currency and interest rate risks related to other investments is disclosed in note 34.

 The disposal of share investment related to all the shares held in Mantle Diamonds Ltd on 24 February 2014.
The recoverable value of the investments in the Zimbabwean operation exceeds its carrying value but developments in the Zimbabwe indigenisation legislation, 
which are explained in more detail in the Directors’ report on page 29, may have an impact on the recoverable value of the investments.
The impact cannot be reliably measured as there are uncertainties regarding the implementation of this legislation which the directors consider may 
impact the carrying value, amounting to $96.5m (2013: $74.6m), of the investments relating to Zimbabwean subsidiaries consolidated in the Group 
financial statements.
These ﬁnancial statements do not include any adjustments that would result from the impact of the Zimbabwe indigenisation legislation on the carrying value 
of the investment held by the Company and on the entities that are included by consolidation in the Group ﬁnancial statements.

The Group holds a 69.77% interest (2013: 68.93%) in the Klipspringer diamond mine joint venture situated in South Africa’s Limpopo Province. Information 
regarding the Group loss from the joint venture has been disclosed in accordance with IAS31 Interests in Joint Ventures and can be found in note 9. The Group

33.  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
Share options – employees
The Company has outstanding options under an unapproved share option scheme adopted in 1997 which expired in September 2007 (the 1997 Scheme) and 
a new scheme which was approved by shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting on 31 July 2007 (the 2007 Scheme). 
1997 Scheme
The Company has operated this scheme since 1997 where options were granted to any employee, ofﬁcer or director of the Company or any subsidiary of the 
Company. The limit for options granted under this scheme was not to exceed 15% of the number of issued ordinary shares from time to time. 
The Board granted options at its discretion. The subscription price was ﬁxed by the Board at the price per share on the dealing day preceding the date of grant.  
For the directors, these options vest immediately and may be exercised at any time within a seven-year period from the date of the grant, unless the Board 
determines otherwise. The options lapse if not exercised by the seventh anniversary of the grant. 
For the employees, there is a vesting period of one to three years from the date of grant. Once vested, the options may be exercised at any time within a seven-
year period from date of grant, unless the Board determines otherwise. The options lapse if not exercised by the seventh anniversary of the grant. 
The right to exercise an option terminates on the holder ceasing to be a participant, subject to certain exceptions, which broadly apply in the event of death 
of the option holder or where the option holder ceases to be a participant due to retirement, ill health, accident or redundancy. In such a case, the option may 
be exercised within six months of such event provided such exercise will take place within seven years of the original date of grant. 
2007 Scheme 
The 2007 Scheme allows for both tax approved options (approved options) to be made to employees resident in the United Kingdom and unapproved options 
(unapproved options), which can be made to both resident and non-resident employees. 
The Company has operated this scheme since December 2007 where options may be granted to full-time employees and directors of the Company or any 
subsidiary of the Company. The overall limit for options granted under this scheme and any other employees’ share scheme adopted by the Company is, in any 
rolling ten-year period, 10% of the issued ordinary share capital (including treasury shares) of the Company for the time being plus 8,100,000 ordinary shares. 
There is an individual limit of ordinary shares to a maximum of £30,000 in value in respect of approved options. 
Options may be granted when the Remuneration Committee determines, within 42 days of the announcement by the Company of its full or interim results. 
Options may be granted outside the 42-day period if the Remuneration Committee considers there to be exceptional circumstances. Options must be granted 
subject to performance conditions being satisﬁed. The performance conditions must be objective and, save where the Remuneration Committee determines 
there to be exceptional circumstances, the performance conditions must relate to the overall ﬁnancial performance of the Company or the market value of 
ordinary shares over a period of at least three years. The performance conditions can be waived or amended by the Remuneration Committee if it determines 
that a change of circumstances means that the performance conditions cannot reasonably be met. The current performance condition in relation to these 
options is that the market value of the Company’s shares must increase above the exercise price by not less than 10% per annum on a compound basis. 
No consideration is payable on the grant of an option and no option may be granted after 31 July 2017. 
The Remuneration Committee determines the exercise price before the options are granted and cannot be less than the market value of the shares on the 
date of grant. 
The options can only be exercised on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant provided the performance conditions have been satisﬁed or waived by 
the Remuneration Committee. The options lapse if not exercised by the tenth anniversary of the grant. 
These options lapse when the option holder ceases to be an eligible employee. In the case of death, a participant’s personal representatives may exercise 
his/her options within 12 months after the date of death. Where an option holder ceases to be an employee by reason of injury, disability, redundancy, the 
Company that employs the option holder ceasing to be a subsidiary of the Company, retirement, pregnancy or in any other circumstances determined by the 
Remuneration Committee, the options may be exercised within six months of the termination of employment or such longer period as may be determined by 
the Remuneration Committee. 
Share incentives 
The share incentive scheme was approved by shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting on 31 July 2007 (the Share Incentive Scheme). The Share 
Incentive Scheme is designed to complement the Share Option Scheme to facilitate awards to selected executives and managers. The Share Incentive Scheme 
permits the award of any one or a combination of the following incentives: 
• the sale of ordinary shares on deferred payment terms; 
• share awards as part of a bonus scheme by way of nil cost options in consideration of cash bonuses forgone on terms that would be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee of the Company; and 
• the issue of share appreciation rights either by the Company or EBT (as deﬁned below).
The Company has also adopted an Employees’ Beneﬁt Trust (EBT) which will operate in conjunction with the Share Option Scheme and Share Incentive Scheme. 
The EBT has not yet been utilised for this purpose and there have been no awards under the Share Incentive Scheme since it was approved by shareholders.

34.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The directors determine, as required, the degree to which it is appropriate to use ﬁnancial instruments, commodity contracts, other ﬁnancial instruments or 
techniques to mitigate risks. The principal risks for which such instruments may be appropriate are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and 
commodity price risk. The most signiﬁcant of these is foreign currency risk which comprises transactional exposure on operating activities. Some translation 
exposure also exists in respect of the investments in overseas operations, since these have functional currencies other than the Group’s reporting currency.  
The Group is also exposed to commodity price risk since its sales are dependent on the price of gold, nickel and diamonds. 
The Group has not currently engaged in any instruments to mitigate or hedge any such risks, although the directors keep this regularly under review. 
Exposure to currency risk
The Group’s exposure to currency risk was as follows based on notional amounts:

Sensitivity analysis 
A 10% weakening of the US dollar against the following currencies at 31 March and the average rate for the year ended 31 March would have increased/
(decreased) equity and results before non-controlling interest by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest 
rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2013.

ZAR (495) (744) 207 74
A 10% strengthening of the US dollar against the above currencies would have had a similar but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis 
that all other variables remain constant. 
Credit risk 
The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the value of its trade receivables, and loans and other receivables which are reﬂected in note 25.
In Freda Rebecca, trade receivables of $4,513,938 (2013: $2,927,307) were due by Fidelity Printers and Reﬁneries (2013: Zimbabwe Chamber of Mines), none 
of which was outstanding past its due date.
In BNC, trade receivables of $6,024,342 (2013: Nil) were due by Glencore, which were due within normal terms of agreement.
There is a concentration of risk in respect of trade receivables from Fidelity Printers and Reﬁneries as well as Glencore, being the two major customers of the 
respective subsidiaries.
Based on historical default rates, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables as explained in note 7.

Commodity price risk 
For the 2014 ﬁnancial year, the Group’s earnings were mainly exposed to changes in the prices of gold and nickel. A 10% increase and decrease in these prices 
would have increased/(decreased) equity and results by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, 
remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2013.

uncertainties included within the forecasts.
Financial risk management
Fair values
Fair value is deﬁned as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date. Wherever possible, fair value is calculated by reference to quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. Where no such 
quoted prices are available, other observable inputs are used and if there are no observable inputs then fair values are calculated by discounting projected 
future cash ﬂows at prevailing rates translated at year-end exchange rates.

Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses ﬁnancial instruments measured at fair value, into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine fair value. 
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly 
(i.e. derived from prices).
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). MWANA AFRICA ANNUAL REPORT 2014

During the ﬁnancial year there were no transfers between Levels. In order to determine the fair value of investments, management used a valuation technique 
in which all signiﬁcant inputs were based on observable market data for Level 1 including quoted share prices. 
The Group’s only ﬁnancial asset held at fair value through proﬁt or loss is its investment in Kimberley Diamonds Ltd which is categorised as Level 1.

35. IMPAIRMENT
Group
An impairment indicator was identiﬁed for Freda Rebecca, being the low gold price. Management calculated the value-in-use for the cash-generating unit 
of Freda Rebecca gold mine by applying a discounted cash ﬂow model to the future expected cash ﬂows expected to arise from the operation. The key 
assumptions of the discounted cash ﬂow model were a gold price of $1,250/oz at an average yearly production of around 62,000oz p.a. for another seven 
years of the mine still being in production. A pre-tax discount rate ranging between 20% and 25% was used and was calculated as a discounting rate for 
similar mining operations in developing countries, adjusted for the speciﬁc risks of the Freda Rebecca gold mine. Management was satisﬁed that the value-
in-use exceeded the carrying amount of the assets despite the lower current gold price and no impairment of Freda Rebecca’s assets was deemed necessary.
In the prior year, all of BNC’s non-current assets were impaired after the falling nickel price was deemed a trigger event for impairment testing and a discounted 
cash ﬂow model was applied to the Trojan life of mine model. In the current year, nickel prices have steadily been increasing and with the Trojan mine becoming 
fully operational, another discounted cash-ﬂow model was applied to the updated Trojan life of mine plan. The key assumptions for the model was a long-term 
nickel price of $18,500 for the remaining life of mine of an estimated eight years, a pre-tax discount rate ranging between 20% and 25% which was calculated 
as a discounting rate for similar mining operations in developing countries, adjusted for the speciﬁc risks of BNC. The Trojan mine operates independently and 
is regarded as a separate Cash Generating Unit (CGU) from other BNC assets. This resulted in a reversal of the impairment of the non-current assets of Trojan 
mine recorded in the prior year to the amount of $28.0m (before tax). This value represents the fair value less costs of disposal for the CGU. The BSR smelter 
and Shangani mine are still under care and maintenance and no impairment reversal was deemed appropriate.
During the year, SEMHKAT exploration licences for ASMA, PACHALU and Kinkombe sites expired, were not renewed and no future plans to explore these 
areas are expected. This was a trigger event for impairment testing. These licences were for speciﬁc geographical areas and are regarded as separate CGUs. 
Management is of the opinion that no future beneﬁts or cash ﬂows will come from the past costs capitalised to these projects, and the full value of these 
intangible assets were fully impaired to the amount of $553,824.
The Klipspringer Diamond Mine is currently on care and maintenance and this, in conjunction with current issues regarding the renewal of the diamond 
licence, was deemed a trigger event for impairment testing. A decision was made to impair the full value of the non-current assets to the value of $117,514.
Company
During the year, the Company reversed impairments relating to loans and investments of BNC (directly and indirectly) after management was satisﬁed that 
BNC will be able to repay these loans and the full value of the investment is expected to be recovered from future cash ﬂows.

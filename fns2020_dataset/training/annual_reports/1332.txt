Results
I am delighted to have joined Ashley House 
in March 2007 and to be able to announce 
an excellent set of results for the year ended 
30 April 2007. Turnover has grown by 11% to
£25.7m (2006: £23.1m), whilst operating profit
(pre-tax and excluding exceptional items) was 
up 84% to £4.1m (2006: £2.2m). Net profit 
(post tax excluding exceptional items) was £2.8m
up 56% from £1.8m in 2006. Earnings per share
(excluding exceptional items) reached 11.4p up
from 8p in 2006. Net profit (post tax and
exceptional items) was down 26% to £1.3m
(2006: £1.8m) with earnings per share at 5.5p. 
The exceptional items amounted to 
£1.4m and were the expensed element of the
costs of joining AIM of £0.4m and a one-off 
non-cash notional charge of £1.1m relating to
the issue of the warrant which was part of the
strategic alliance with Babcock & Brown offset 
by a gain of £0.1m on disposal of the head office
building. The tax charge this year was higher as
there are no longer any tax losses available and
the exceptional items have been treated as
disallowable for prudence.
As a result the board recommends a final
dividend of 3p per share which brings the total
dividend for the year to 5p per share, a 25%
increase on the 4p paid for 2006. The dividend
will be paid on 24 August 2007 to those on 
the share register as at 3 August 2007.
The balance sheet now shows net assets 
of £11.0m (2006: £4.5m) with cash of £6.1m 
and no debt.
Chairman’ s statement
“With a sound core business 
and new related business
activities coming on stream,
Ashley House is well positioned
to continue to deliver sustained
growth in earnings and
dividends.”  Chairman’ s statement continued
06 Ashley House plc Report and accounts 2007
A year of substantial progress
T ogether with producing an excellent set 
of financial results, this year ended 30 April 2007
has seen Ashley House progress materially. The
strategic alliance with Babcock & Brown provides
the business another substantial pipeline of work
in the NHS LIFT market as well as a potential
partner in our larger schemes incorporating
Health Parks and community hospitals.
The admission to AIM and the
oversubscribed £5m fundraising in January 2007
was another landmark for the company and
marked the beginning of a new chapter. The
platform of a sound financial base now allows
the business to look forward to the many
opportunities emerging as the NHS seeks greater
private sector involvement both in the provision
of primary care infrastructure and importantly
through our growing Clinical Services division.
Looking forward
With a sound core business and new 
related business activities coming on stream,
Ashley House is well positioned to continue 
to deliver sustained growth in earnings and
dividends. This is an exciting time to become
involved with Ashley House as the business 
grows further income streams around the 
core of primary care infrastructure. 
I would like to welcome new shareholders
who joined the share register at the AIM
Admission and subsequently to Ashley House.
The CEO’ s report pays appropriate tribute to my
predecessor, David Burton, but it is a great credit
to him that I am following him into a business 
in such good health and with strong potential 
to continue its impressive growth.

New surgery premises at Carden Hill,
Carden Avenue, Brighton, East Sussex 
Brighton:Delivering solutions 
in environmental design
The brief
Relocation of two local surgeries 
within one building while maintaining 
their own identity as separate practices. 
T o provide additional space for the 
provision of extended PCT services, 
such as podiatry, health education 
and community pharmacy.
The solution
Working with the local school, community,
GP practices and the PCT Ashley House
carried out an extensive site search and
came up with an innovative design on
unused land within the grounds of Carden
Primary School. This will result in a modern
facility, built in a residential area, that will
serve the community for many years to
come. It will be built to allow changes in
configuration, as service solutions to
patient needs change.
Points of interest
Energy efficient design
passive ventilation 
light tubes 
renewable energy sources
air source heat pumps
helped to meet new targets for carbon
footprints of new buildings. 
Due to the topography of the site, 
the building comprises upper ground

Business review
T ogether with taking major corporate and
financial steps forward as described in the
Chairman’ s statement, Ashley House has made
strong operating progress during the past year. 
I shall set out below the achievements and
outlook for the company’ s five activities.
Traditional primary care infrastructure
The design and project management of 
primary care infrastructure construction remains
our core business and has contributed the lion’ s
share of the turnover and profits for the year. 
We have had a very positive year as 10 projects
were completed in Birmingham, Bolsover , Brighton,
Colchester , Danby , Lowestoft, Newcastle-upon-T yne,
Scarborough, Shipton-under-Wychwood 
and Wokingham.
The scheme at Byker in Newcastle 
(see facing page) is important to highlight as it
delivered the vision of an integrated multi-use
primary care centre likely to be at the forefront 
of the Government’ s efforts to change and
improve healthcare delivery. At 4,600m
2
it
incorporates two GP practices, a dentist and
dental training unit, an urgent care centre that
could provide 24 hour walk-in care, a resource
centre, physiotherapy, pain management, 
mental health services, and a privately operated
pharmacy and optician. Part owned by our
associated property investment company, 
AH Medical Properties plc (AHMP), and part 
PCT owned, Newcastle has throughout been a
successful collaboration working with the PCT
focusing on local health needs and the provision
of a long-term sustainable solution.
The current pipeline for the year to 
30 April 2008 remains strong and we have
numerous new schemes on site and due 
on site in the coming months.

“The current pipeline for the 
year to 30 April 2008 remains

Centre provides a real boost to
patient care in the area. Ashley
House and the project team have
worked tremendously hard to
deliver this innovative building
and we are delighted with the
results that this partnership has
brought to date.”

Newcastle: Innovative solution 
delivers inner-city ‘one-stop-shop’
The brief
Ashley House was asked to rehouse 
two forward-thinking local GP practices 
who wanted to be at the heart of the 
regeneration of the Shields Road area 
in Byker, Newcastle-upon-T yne. 
The PCT was also keen to co-locate 
a number of services in this city centre site 
to create a significant primary care facility.
The solution
Ashley House worked with the local
council to identify a suitable site. The PCT
responded very positively to the opportunity
and brought in the concept of including an
urgent care centre to allow patients to be
treated locally without attending A&E for
all but the most serious of problems. 
A project team was then formed with all the
occupants to develop the design for an
integrated facility . The premises have been
built to allow for flexibility in the building as
healthcare delivery for patient needs change.
The result is a hugely innovative facility , built
in a regeneration area, that will serve the
community for many years to come. 
Points of interest
The building is part owned by the PCT 
and part owned by AHMP and throughout
has been a highly successful collaboration
between Ashley House and the PCT .

NHS LIFT
In December 2006 Ashley House was
delighted to announce the signing of a
strategic alliance with Babcock & Brown.
As part of this agreement Ashley House
entered into agreements to design and
build a number of LIFT schemes arising
from Babcock & Brown’ s involvement as
private sector partner in 7 of the 42 LIFT
Co’ s in England. This gives Ashley House a
significant involvement in the LIFT market,
fulfilling a long-term aim. Kenmore Road,
pictured above, is an example of one 
of the LIFT projects being delivered by 
this relationship.
The project
In partnership with Brent, Harrow 
and Hillingdon LIFT Co, Ashley House 
are designing and building three
Neighbourhood Resource Centres for
Harrow Council on sites at Christchurch
Avenue, Kenmore Road (shown) and
Vaughan Road. Though all three buildings
have the same brief each centre will have
an individual design to reflect the different
character of the areas.
The proposed Neighbourhood 
Resource Centres will provide high 
quality accommodation from which
support and services are delivered to
people with learning disabilities. They 
are intended to act as a focal point for
broader community involvement and
participation in the neighbourhood,
offering valuable day support allowing
people to participate in the community.
The developments will be undertaken 
by Ashley House plc in its role as design
and build supply chain partner to the 
Brent, Harrow and Hillingdon LIFT Co.

10 Ashley House plc Report and accounts 2007
“NHS LIFT is a vehicle for
improving and developing
frontline primary and
community care facilities. 
It is allowing PCTs to invest 
in new premises in new
locations, not merely reproduce
existing types of service. It is
providing patients with modern
integrated health services in
high quality , fit for purpose
primary care premises.”
Department of Health website NHS LIFT
In December 2006, we announced a 
strategic alliance with Babcock & Brown 
which represented an important step in 
Ashley House participating in the NHS LIFT
programme. According to the terms of the
alliance, Ashley House’ s in-house design and
construction project management skills can be
provided to the LIFT companies where Babcock 
& Brown are the private sector partners. Working
together we can deliver more schemes with
greater efficiency thereby achieving best value 
for the NHS and its partners (see facing page). 
We have already achieved stage one
approval on four schemes, with progress being
made towards approval for a further eight
schemes whilst we are also in the early stages 
of working on an additional nine schemes. 
The relationship with Babcock & Brown is
working well and there is clearly scope for 
NHS LIFT work to become a major part 
of Ashley House’ s business.
Asset management
Ashley House has a long-term contract as asset
manager for the portfolio of properties owned by
AH Medical Properties plc (AHMP). The portfolio
has grown substantially to be approximately
£80m of completed income producing assets,
doubling in size from £41m as at 30 April 2006.
This growth has come from schemes completed
in the year by Ashley House along with the
acquisition of a portfolio of schemes previously
completed by us. 
Including those properties now under
construction, the portfolio will soon have a gross
value of approximately £100m – and not only 
has the portfolio grown but importantly, the net
asset value per share has also grown by some
50%. With its recent successful equity capital
raising of £17m, AHMP is well placed to continue
its growth, with the support of new blue-chip
institutional shareholders such as Schroders
Exempt Property Unit Trust who have taken 
a 29.6% stake. Ashley House also invested
£1.85m in AHMP shares giving us a 6.8% 
stake following the capital raising.
The exclusive arrangement between 
Ashley House and AHMP means that the
portfolio should grow as AHMP is the purchaser
of choice for Ashley House’ s future primary care
project pipeline, which should produce some
£25-30m of new assets annually. The asset
management fee earned by Ashley House is
linked to the gross value of the assets with an
out-performance fee linked to the return for 
the AHMP shareholders. We can thus expect
substantial and growing asset management
revenues in the years ahead.

Health Parks
Our first Health Park in Scarborough is on track 
to achieve planning permission soon. The vendors,
Scarborough Rugby Club, have gained planning
consent for their new ground, which satisfies 
a key condition of our contract to acquire the
site. Our scheme will incorporate a primary care
centre, a private hospital, a nursing and care
home, and some retirement housing. Whilst
smaller than some sites being considered, this
Health Park does encapsulate the concept 
of co-locating a number of health-related
activities on one site (see facing page).
We are reviewing a number of other
opportunities and are in advanced negotiations
on a second, larger site in the South East. We
shall make the appropriate announcements as
soon as we have secured a new site and gained
planning consent for the Scarborough site. It is
our intention to bring in partners to co-own these
sites which will be capital intensive and are long
term in nature. Ashley House will provide the
design and construction project management
services to these projects as well as taking an
equity interest.
Clinical Services
Ashley House has a hard won reputation 
for working with GPs and PCT s to provide
infrastructure solutions. Accordingly, as the remit
for GPs to provide an increasingly wider range 
of devolved services gathers pace, Ashley House
Clinical Services is positioning itself as the natural
commercial partner for groups of GPs wishing 
to participate in the new opportunities.
On this basis the GPs provide the clinical
knowhow and credibility whilst Ashley House
provides the management systems, finance,
administration and infrastructure services. 
We have numerous initiatives under way 
and we have recruited an excellent team with
considerable experience of running healthcare
services in both the public and private sectors.

Case study
The brief
With a detailed knowledge of the local
health economy, gleaned from a number 
of schemes already undertaken in the area,
Ashley House was keen to address wider
health needs in Scarborough.
Ashley House had a site requirement for 
two GP practices and was aware of the
need for hospital space to augment the 
local NHS hospital. Demand for residential
care accommodation for the elderly is also 
strong in the area.
The Health Park scheme will integrate 
and support various types of health-related
services on a campus styled development
bringing in an investment of £25m to the
region, creating employment and providing
a flagship development including a much
needed local private hospital.
The solution
Ashley House has recently gained 
planning committee approval for 
general medical space to accommodate:
GP practices, a hospital, a care home and
sheltered housing. This is the site of the
current Scarborough Rugby Football Club, 
which is moving to an edge of town 
new stadium.
Points of interest
Ashley House worked closely with the 
local council and rugby club to realise this
important new facility for the community 
of Scarborough.

The brief 
T o provide modern accommodation 
for a growing four partner training
practice. The new premises needed to
provide ‘fit for purpose’ accommodation
for both GPs and other clinical staff. As
well as a dispensary, the new building has
enlarged administration and patient waiting
areas, which will allow for the patient list
from a retiring GP’ s local practice to be
accommodated. Central to the successful
completion of the project were the close
working relationships established with 
NE Derbyshire PCT (as was) and 
Derbyshire County Council.
The solution
This new surgery offers patients a large
spacious facility within a comfortable 
and relaxed environment. In addition to
consulting rooms and a treatment room 
for minor surgery, the premises also include
a large health education room for classes
and meetings, plus ample parking for 
both staff and patients.
The building also brings together the
community clinical team and practice 
staff under one roof. With the addition 
of ‘state of the art’ equipment, staff can 
now offer patients a truly modern and 
all encompassing service, close to home.

Key performance
Unsurprisingly after such a strong year, the
financial key performance targets have been 
met with growth in normalised earnings per
share (after excluding the one-off transaction
costs) and the strengthened balance sheet. The
key corporate targets have also been exceeded 
as a significant position in the NHS LIFT market
has been secured whilst the de-stapled Ashley
House shares were admitted to AIM and the
accompanying fundraising was oversubscribed.
The staff resource has been expanded to match
the increased workload and retention of key 
staff has been good. We are very pleased 
that Investors In People accreditation has been
recommended for approval. (Approval received 
28 June 2007).
Current trading
The new financial year has begun well with 
a number of schemes moving on site, most
notably in Brighton where having worked closely
with the planners and the PCT , our latest scheme
incorporates many carbon footprint reducing
features, without making the costs of delivering
the scheme uneconomic.
The strategic alliance with Babcock &
Brown is working well as described above and 
we have achieved stage one approval on four
schemes with many others now being worked 
on by our design team. These schemes will start
to make a financial impact in the second half 
of the new financial year and we look forward 
to expanding our work with Babcock & Brown
and their partners.
Board and future
We would like to thank all our people for their
hard work and efforts in the success we have
achieved, particularly over the past 12 months.
We would also like to pay tribute to David Burton
who, as outgoing Chairman, leaves us in a far
stronger position than when he stepped in some
years ago and we thank him for his contribution.
We are delighted that we have been able to
attract such a high calibre new Chairman in 
Sir William Wells whose combination of property
and NHS experience are ideally suited for the 
next phase of Ashley House’ s growth.

Financial risk management objectives and policies
The group is exposed to a variety of financial risks which result
from both its operating and investing activities. The board is
responsible for co-ordinating the group’ s risk management and
focuses on actively securing the group’ s short- to medium-term
cash flows. Long-term financial investments are managed to
generate lasting returns.
The group does not actively engage in the trading of financial
assets and has no financial derivatives. The most significant
financial risks to which the group is exposed are described below:
Credit risk
The group’ s principal financial assets are cash and trade debtors.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of any
allowance for doubtful debtors, estimated by the directors. 
The group’ s largest customers are AH Medical Properties plc 
and its subsidiary, Medical Properties Limited.
The group has adopted a strict credit vetting policy based on
track record payment history and externally available credit data.
Interest rate risk
The group finances its operations through retained profits and
has no borrowings. The group operates a policy of seeking to
optimise deposit interest earned, paying due regard to credit 
risk and ensuring the business has sufficient available cash 
to operate effectively.
16 Ashley House plc Report and accounts 2007 Ashley House plc Report and accounts 2007 17
Liquidity risk
The group seeks to manage risks to ensure sufficient liquidity 
is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets
safely and profitably.
Corporate governance
The board supports the principles of good governance. 
The group is committed to high standards of corporate
governance and has adopted procedures to institute good
governance insofar as they are practical and appropriate for a
business of this size at this stage in its development. The board
has a remuneration committee and an appointments committee
in each case comprising a majority of non-executive directors
and an audit committee chaired by the Non-executive Chairman.
Going concern
After making enquiries and reviewing forecasts, the directors
have, at the time of approving the financial statements,
concluded that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.
Application of principles of good governance
Directors
The group supports the concept of an effective board, 
leading and controlling the group. The board is responsible 
for approving group policy and strategy. It meets regularly and
has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision.
Management supplies the board with appropriate and timely
information and the directors are free to seek any further
information that they consider necessary. All directors have
access to advice from the Company Secretary and independent
professionals at the group’ s expense. 
Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year, which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the company and the group and
of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing
those financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the entity 
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the corporate and financial information included on the
company’ s website.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the company and group and enable
them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies
Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding assets 
of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are also responsible for the preparation of the
directors’ report and other information in the annual report.
Insofar as the directors are aware:
there is no relevant audit information of which the company’ s
auditor is unaware; and
the directors have taken all steps that they ought to have
taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the auditor is aware 
of that information.
The board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the 
group maintains systems of internal control to provide it 
with reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
information used within the business and for publication 
and that assets are safeguarded. 
Remuneration policy
The group’ s policy on executive directors’ remuneration is to:
attract and retain high quality executives by paying competitive
remuneration packages relevant to each director’ s role,
experience and the external market. The packages include
contributions to private medical insurance; and
give incentive to directors to maximise shareholder value
through annual bonus schemes.
Service agreements
No director has a service agreement with a notice period that
exceeds six months. Report of the directors continued

20 Ashley House plc Report and accounts 2007 Report of the independent auditor 
to the members of Ashley House plc
Ashley House plc Report and accounts 2007 21
We have audited the group and parent company financial
statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Ashley House plc 
for the year ended 30 April 2007 which comprise the principal
accounting policies, the consolidated profit and loss account,
the balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement, 
the statement of total recognised gains and losses the note 
of historical cost profits and losses and notes 1 to 26. These
financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the company’ s members, as a body,
in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the company’ s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. 
T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and
the company’ s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report
and the financial statements in accordance with United
Kingdom law and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the
statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view, whether they are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
whether the information given in the report of the directors 
is consistent with the financial statements. The information
given in the directors’ report includes that specific information
presented in the Chairman’ s statement and Chief Executive
Officer’ s statement that is cross-referred from the business
review section of the directors’ report. We also report to 
you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report, 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. This other information comprises only the Chairman’ s
statement, Chief Executive Officer’ s statement and the report 
of the directors. We consider the implications for our report if
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the directors 
in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’ s 
and company’ s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity 
or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial
statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the group’ s and the
parent company’ s affairs as at 30 April 2007 and of the
group’ s profit for the year then ended;
the financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
the information given in the report of the directors 
is consistent with the financial statements for the year 
ended 30 April 2007.
Grant Thornton UK LLP
Registered Auditors
Chartered Accountants
Oxford
22 June 2007 Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
applicable UK accounting standards (UK GAAP) and under the
historical cost convention, with the exception of the revaluation
of land and buildings. 
The principal accounting policies of the group are set out below.
The policies have remained unchanged from the previous year
apart from the adoption of FRS 20 ‘Share-based Payment’. 
This change is described in more detail below.
Changes in accounting policies
In preparing the financial statements for the current year, the
group has adopted FRS 20 ‘Share-based Payment’ (IFRS 2).
In accordance with FRS 20, the fair value of equity-settled 
share-based payments to employees is determined at the date
of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period of the share options or warrants based upon the group’ s
estimate of share options and warrants that will eventually vest.
The fair value has been measured by the use of a binomial
lattice pricing model.
Following the adoption of FRS 20, a prior year adjustment 
has been made to decrease the profit and loss reserve brought
forward at 1 May 2006, and create a share option reserve, of
£165,000 to reflect the option charge which would have been
incurred in the previous years and the year ended 30 April 2006
had FRS 20 been adopted earlier. The profit and loss account for
the year ended 30 April 2006 has been restated to reflect the
share-based payment charge of £40,000 for that year.
The group recognised total expenses of £1,256,000 relating 
to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the year
ended 30 April 2007. £1,085,000 of this related to the grant 
to Babcock & Brown of warrants over 7,880,000 shares at
£1.20 per share as part of the strategic alliance entered into
with them.
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate those of the company
and of its subsidiary undertakings. Profits or losses on intra-group
transactions are eliminated in full. All of the subsidiary’ s assets
and liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition were recorded
at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Turnover
Turnover is the total of amounts for goods supplied and 
services provided during the year, excluding value-added tax.
In the case of long-term contracts, turnover reflects the 
contract activity during the year and represents the proportion
of total contract value which costs incurred to date bear to 
total expected contract costs.
Turnover on long-term contracts is only recognised where 
there is reasonable certainty that the contract will proceed 
and planning permission has been obtained.
T angible fixed assets and depreciation
T angible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation 
is calculated to write down the cost or valuation less estimated
residual value of all tangible fixed assets, other than freehold
land, on the reducing balance basis over their expected useful
economic lives. The periods generally applicable are:
Office equipment, furniture and fixtures 4 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Mobile surgeries 4 years
Investments
Investments are included at cost less provision for amounts
written off.
Work in progress and long-term contracts
Work in progress is valued on the basis of direct costs plus
attributable overheads based on normal levels of activity. Costs
associated with long-term contracts are included in stock to the
extent that they cannot be matched with contract work accounted
for as turnover. Long-term contract balances included in stocks
are stated at cost, after provision has been made for any
foreseeable losses and the deduction of applicable payments 
on account. No element of profit is included in the carrying
value of work in progress. Full provision is made for losses 
on all contracts in the year in which the loss is first foreseen.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that
have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result
in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax, with the
exception that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the
extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not
that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future
reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax
rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Leased assets
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
Financial instruments
Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments is
recognised on the accruals basis, and is credited or charged to the
profit and loss account in the financial period to which it relates.
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill, representing the excess of the fair value of
consideration given over the fair values of the identifiable net
assets acquired, is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line
basis over its estimated useful economic life.

average number of shares in issue during the year.

The average share price during the year was 158.9p, which meant that the dilutive securities shown in the table above were those
which have exercise prices of 30p, 40p, 85p, 98p 108p and 150p per share.
The calculation of normalised earnings per share of 11.4p on operating profit, excluding non-recurring transaction costs, assumes
that the non-recurring costs are not allowable for tax and is therefore based upon a post tax profit of profit for the year plus the 
non-recurring costs.

immediately exercisable and five years.
Expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which a share price is expected to fluctuate during a period. The volatility 
of the company’ s share price was calculated using the basic Hull-White model.
The risk-free rate is the yield on deposits held by the company.
The dividend yield of 5% is based on the dividends paid during the period.

25 Related party transactions
Ashley House plc and AH Medical Properties plc (including its subsidiary Medical Properties Limited) were related as a consequence
of the share stapling agreement entered into in September 2004. The stapling was severed on 11 January 2007. Under the share
stapling arrangement, the two companies had identical shareholders’ registers and a number of common directors. During the 
year Ashley House plc made sales at an arm’ s length basis of £7,190,000 (2006: £9,915,000) to AH Medical Properties plc. 
At 30 April 2007 the balance due from AH Medical Properties plc was £2,955,000 (2006: £2,717,000).
During the year Ashley House plc made sales on an arm’ s length basis to Medical Properties Limited, a subsidiary of 
AH Medical Properties plc, of £11,247,000 (2006: £4,441,000). At 30 April 2007 the balance due from Medical Properties Limited 
was £1,451,000 (2006: £563,000).
Since the termination of the share stapling agreement and subsequent share issues by both Ashley House plc and 
AH Medical Properties plc, and the change in their respective board members, these companies are no longer related parties.
All supplies made to AHMP and Medical Properties Limited are related to the design and construction of medical centres. In every
case, the rent for the building which drives the value of the scheme is set by the District Valuer acting for the Primary Care Trust
(NHS). Transactions between Ashley House plc and AH Medical Properties plc are entered into on the basis of market equivalent
pricing and are ratified by the independent non-executive directors of AHMP , who are not connected to Ashley House plc.
During the year the group received invoices from directors or their companies of £20,000 (2006: £16,000) from Scheidegg Limited,

38 Ashley House plc Report and accounts 2007 Illustrative reconciliation of net assets and profit under 
UK GAAP to IFRS – not audited
Ashley House plc Report and accounts 2007 39
Ashley House plc has reported under UK GAAP for its financial statements for the years ended 30 April 2007 and 30 April 2006.
The analyses below show illustrative reconciliations of how the net assets at 30 April 2006 and of how the profits and net assets 
at 30 April 2007 would have been reported at these dates had they been reported under IFRS. The board is currently considering
when it would be most appropriate to adopt IFRS but is providing this information for guidance and it does not form part of the
audited accounts. The illustrative reconciliations are set out below and are followed by notes which explain the reconciling items
and set out key assumptions.

Explanation of reconciling items between UK GAAP and IFRS
a Holiday pay accrual
Under IAS 19 when an employee has rendered service to a company during an accounting period, the company should recognise
the amount of short-term employee benefits, e.g. compensated absences, profit sharing or bonuses payable, expected to be paid 
in exchange for that service as a liability, after deducting any amounts already paid. The estimated accruals under IAS 19 for holidays
not taken at 30 April 2006 and 2007 are £15,000 and £15,000 respectively.
b Goodwill
Under IFRS 3 goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Under UK GAAP
the group had been amortising goodwill over its estimated economic life. The group has taken advantage of the transitional
provisions of IFRS 3 and eliminated the accumulated amortisation at 30 April 2005 against the original gross amount of goodwill.
Goodwill is now subject only to periodic testing for impairment. Amortisation of goodwill charged under UK GAAP for the year
ended 30 April 2006 and 30 April 2007 was £65,000 and £67,000 respectively.
c Assumptions
The illustrative reconciliations show the expected impact of IFRS on the group’ s key financial information for the year ended 
30 April 2007 on the assumption that the group decided to adopt IFRS in its financial statements for the year ending 30 April 2008.
They are, therefore, based on elections to take advantage of certain exemptions that are available on first-time adoption of IFRS on
the assumption that the effective transition date is 1 May 2005. In addition, the information is necessarily based on the recognition
and measurement requirements of IFRS in issue and effective for the year ending 30 April 2006. In practice, if the group were to
adopt IFRS for the year ending 30 April 2007, it would need to take account of IFRS in issue and effective for that year which is
likely to differ from those used in preparing the information. 42 Ashley House plc Report and accounts 2007

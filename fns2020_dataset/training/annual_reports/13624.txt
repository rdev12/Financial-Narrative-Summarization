ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  EUROPE
Rotork has a well established
presence in Europe with eight
assembly locations across the
region, supported by six direct
customer support centres. Europe
continues to have a strong
valvemaker base with a powerful
engineering and production
heritage that is integral to the
major infrastructure development
projects that are active across 
the world.
AFRICA
This is a diverse market with some
signiﬁcant project development
programmes. Investment in the
power industry as well as in 
oil & gas is supported through 
our direct presence, local agents
and distributors as well as
regionally from our European
production units.
ASIA
Rotork has traditionally been strong
throughout Asia and now counts
mainland China as the biggest
market for Rotork electric valve
actuators. We are making progress
in bringing these and the Rotork
Gears products into the wider and 
more price competitive areas of
infrastructure development in this
important market. India has long
been core to Rotork’ s strategy with
two production plants and 
a further three sales ofﬁces.
AUSTRALASIA
This large geographic area is
supported by three customer
support centres, one dedicated to
the Fluid Systems products, and
one to Rotork Controls products.
Australia has a well developed
hydrocarbons market, a strong
power industry and complex water
and irrigation systems across its
landmass.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT THE PAST YEAR HAS SEEN ROTORK
CELEBRATE ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY IN A PERIOD WHEN STRONG
TRADING HAS ENABLED US TO ACHIEVE RECORD RESULTS AND 
A SOUND POSITION FROM WHICH TO ENTER 2008.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
The past year has seen Rotork
celebrate its 50th anniversary in 
a period when strong trading in
each of our underlying markets
has enabled us to achieve record
results and a sound position from
which to enter 2008. We have
passed a number of milestones
including record performances in
terms of revenue and proﬁts from
each of the three operating
divisions and ﬁnished the year with
our highest ever reported order
book, up 29% at £98m. Total sales
revenue was £236m, up 14% on
2006, and proﬁt before tax
increased by 24% to £57.3m. 
The trading ﬁgures are after the
negative impact of currency in a
year where the weakening US
dollar reduced the value of part of
our earnings. However, in spite of
this currency headwind, we were
still able to improve operating
proﬁt margin from 21.8% to
23.5% due to operational gearing
and the robustness of Rotork’s
business model. At constant
currency, sales revenue and proﬁt
before tax increased by 18% and
31% respectively.
DIVISIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
Rotork Controls
The oil & gas, power and water
markets, which the Controls
Division serves, continued to be
active in the year particularly in
Asia and Europe. The new
production facility in Shanghai
had a successful ﬁrst full year in
operation and met all of its goals.
This facility will be of increasing
signiﬁcance in supporting the
important Chinese market in 
the future.
The division increased revenue to
£164m, up 11% on the prior year
with operating proﬁt at £44m, up
18%. We now believe that the mix
of facilities that we have in the
Controls Division across the world
gives us the capacity to support
our customer base in each of our
markets for the foreseeable future.
New marketing initiatives took
place in the year and we opened
our ﬁrst direct presence in Brazil. 
Rotork Fluid Systems
Rotork Fluid Systems continued 
its pattern of strong growth
established over the last few years,
and expanded its share of the
available market as well as
capitalising on the signiﬁcant
investment currently being seen
worldwide in the markets for its
products. Sales revenue grew 18%
to £48m and operating margin
achieved our 15% target. We are
increasingly being seen as
providing the actuator of choice 
by leading industry participants.
This has been helped by our
exacting approach to product
quality, constant investment in
facilities and products, and our
drive to bring technology originally 
developed for our electric actuator
products into our Fluid Systems 
product offering.
Rotork Gears
Rotork Gears produced strong
results in the year, with sales
revenue up 31% at £32m and
operating proﬁt up 57% to £7m.
We are now the largest
manufacturer of products of our
type, and have production facilities
in ﬁve countries in Europe, the US
and Asia. We can effectively offer
a local service to customers
wherever they are based from our
global facilities. We are continually
improving products and services,
and developing new products for
use on standard and specialist
applications. The net margins in
this business have increased as we
continue to improve efﬁciency and
reduce costs.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  CASH
Cash generation in the year has
been strong due to the buoyant
trading position and good control
of working capital. In addition,
except for a £2m additional
contribution to the UK ﬁnal salary
pension scheme, there have been
no unusual cash outﬂows in the
year with the result that cash
balances increased at the year end
to over £38m. Subsequent to the
year end, we announced two
acquisitions. The acquisition of
Remote Controls Sweden was
completed on 30 January 2008 
for a consideration of £13m. 
Much smaller, but strategically
important, was the acquisition of
the intellectual property and
business of the Drallim SVM
product on 13 February 2008, 
for £630,000. Both of these
transactions were settled for cash. 
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending an
increase in the ﬁnal dividend for
2007 and the payment of an
additional interim dividend for
2008. The ﬁnal dividend for 2007
of 14.0p per share (an increase of
20% year on year) will be paid on
9 May 2008 to shareholders on
the register on 18 April 2008. 
A one off additional dividend 
of £10m (11.5p per share) will 
be paid on 18 July 2008 to
shareholders on the register on 
27 June 2008. 
PERFORMANCE AND RISK
In his Business Review, the 
Chief Executive discusses the
application of the Group’s
approach to performance
measurement through KPIs, 
our approach to the assessment
and mitigation of risk, and how 
we ensure that we have correct
health & safety procedures, and
environmental policies. We take
great care to deal with these
matters responsibly, ensuring 
that controls and processes are
embedded in working practices
where possible and that reporting
is prompt and transparent. 
Our increased disclosure this 
year underscores the importance 
which we attach to these matters.
BOARD CHANGES
John Matthews has been the
Senior Independent Director 
since joining the Board in 1998
and for much of this time has
chaired both Audit and
Remuneration Committees.
Having now completed nine years
on the Board, John will retire 
at the forthcoming AGM. 
He leaves with our best wishes
and appreciation for his much
valued advice and support.
I am pleased to welcome John
Nicholas to the Board as a non-
executive director. John is currently
Group Finance Director of Tate &
Lyle plc prior to which he held the
same position at Kidde plc. He will
chair the Audit Committee and be
a member of both the Nomination
and Remuneration Committees. 
BILL WHITELEY
Bill Whiteley, who will retire at this
year’s Annual General Meeting,
has been a director of Rotork p.l.c.
for twenty-four years, the last
twelve of which he has served as
Chief Executive. During his tenure
as Chief Executive, Bill has led the
Group to outstanding success and,
consequently, its world leadership
position in its specialised sector
and its position as a highly rated
constituent of the FTSE 250. He
leaves a strong and experienced
executive team who under the
leadership of his successor, Peter
France, are well placed to deliver
further growth. On behalf of the
Board I extend to Bill our
appreciation and gratitude for his
enormous contribution and wish
him well for the future.
OUTLOOK
Projects across nearly all of our
geographic and end user markets
remain active. Order intake at the
start of the year has been
particularly buoyant, including 
a strong start from our North
American and Chinese operations.
In contrast with recent years, it
would appear that our trading
results are likely to be enhanced 
by a more favourable currency
environment in 2008.

ROGER LOCKWOOD
CHAIRMAN
29 FEBRUARY 2008 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S BUSINESS REVIEW FOR OVER 10 YEARS
ROTORK HAS BEEN THE WORLD LEADER IN ACTUATION SOLUTIONS
FOR THE OIL & GAS, POWER AND WATER & WASTE WATER
TREATMENT SECTORS OF THE CAPITAL GOODS MARKET .
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
For over 10 years Rotork has been
the world leader in actuation
solutions for the oil & gas, power
and water & waste water
treatment sectors of the capital
goods market. Our products are
also used in a wide range of
applications in a variety of
industries, including shipboard
control systems, ventilation and 
air handling control. Rotork is a
genuinely global business, with
both marketing and production
operations across the world. 
We are known for our ability to
support customers in the ﬁeld at
very short notice from our own
resources. Rotork has a reputation
for innovative solutions to
complex problems and our
product development history 
has shown a pattern of improving
the efﬁciency, quality and cost
effectiveness of the product
through the application of
technology. This, and a constant
drive to improve customer
support, has lead to us being 
the number one heavy duty
actuator group in the world. 
We are structured around 
three divisions:
Rotork Controls, the original
and largest division supplying
high quality, state of the art
electric actuator products for
controlling industrial valves;
Rotork Fluid Systems, 
which supplies heavy duty
pneumatic and hydraulic valve
actuators for operation in plant
control, emergency shut 
down and other critical
applications, primarily for 
the oil & gas sector;
Rotork Gears, a world leader 
in the supply of gearboxes,
adaptors and ancillaries for 
the valve industry.
Rotork supports customers across
the world mainly through directly
owned operations. We have 14
production plants internationally
and multiple direct sales and
support operations in 22 countries.
This, together with an extensive
network of indirect sales ofﬁces,
gives total coverage of our
customers and markets globally.
We have around 12,000 
active customers. 
The key drivers for the Group’s
businesses relate to investment in
oil & gas, power generation and
water & waste water installations
around the world with demand
being generated by new and
expanded capacity, upgrades to
existing facilities and replacements.
This is often linked to projects
which are aimed at improving 
the efﬁciency, safety and
environmental performance of
plants. Valve actuators are critical
components and their long-term
reliability and performance is
extremely important to users. 
They also act as a key interface
between plant control systems and
related hardware. Rotork’s
reputation for quality, worldwide
support and technical innovation 
is crucial to its leadership position
in the ﬁeld. The broad geographic
spread of our operations and
applications means that we have a
large number of repeat customers
around the world and no one
customer accounts for more than
5% of our revenue in any year.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
The objective of Rotork p.l.c. is to
increase shareholder value by
developing its leadership position
in worldwide valve actuator
activities. The Group’s businesses
are focused on the specialist area
of valve automation. The origins 
of the Company go back to the
1950s and over its 50 years in this
business Rotork has continued to
build on its reputation as an
innovator of new concepts in this
ﬁeld and has provided users with
increasing levels of functionality,
performance and assurance. Our
strategy of providing modern
innovative products that leverage
technology, while remaining
focussed on the technical
applications that our customers
need, has enabled us to provide
quality solutions to the industries
that we serve. We have been able
to do this partly as a result of our
methodology of selling directly to
our end user customers and their
technical advisers. This ensures
that, where possible, plant
speciﬁcations have the correct
products for the application and
support the customer’s need for
plant efﬁciency and control.
ROTORK’S FOCUS ON 
TECHNICAL APPLICATIONS 
THAT OUR CUSTOMERS NEED 
HAS ENABLED US TO PROVIDE 
QUALITY SOLUTIONS TO THE 
INDUSTRIES WE SERVE.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE
29 FEBRUARY 2008 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
The Group’s recent strategy has
focused on opportunities to
leverage our leadership position 
in heavy duty electric actuation
into other closely associated areas
of valve automation. Key
programmes relate to the
development of products and
control systems, marketing
initiatives, creating service revenue
opportunities and driving cost
reductions relating to these
businesses. The most important
current product initiative relates 
to the development of our range
of actuators aimed at the process
control market, which is referred
to further in the research &
development section.
YEAR UNDER REVIEW
In 2007, Rotork celebrated its 
50th Anniversary in style with 
end user and geographic markets
very active throughout the year.
The rate of investment in
infrastructure in energy and water
projects continued to increase
which beneﬁted all three of our
operating divisions. Overall order
intake was up 12.6% and revenue
up 14.0%. The order book
increased to £97.6m which is
28.5% up on the start of 2007.
Proﬁt before tax was up 24.3%.
Return on sales (as deﬁned on
page 11), a key performance
indicator of the business, increased
to 24.3% from 22.3% last year.
ROTORK CONTROLS
Revenue from our electric actuator
division, Rotork Controls, increased
by 11.1% to £164.2m while
operating proﬁt rose by 17.6% to
£43.5m. At constant currencies
these increases would have been
15.4% and 23.7% respectively. 
As a percentage of unit actuator
order input, the principal markets
for electric actuators were: oil &
gas 39% (2006: 40%); water 22%
(19%); power 31% (32%) and
miscellaneous 8% (9%). As can 
be seen the end user markets 
were similar to the prior year but
with an above average increase in
the number of actuators going
into the water market. This 
was driven by growth in the
markets worldwide and improved
penetration in some key markets.
UK Operations
We continued to see good levels
of business emanate from the 
UK, with the water market
beneﬁting from AMP4 investment
requirements laid down by 
the regulator and the power
market from the large Combustion
Plant Directive.
There was a strong sales and proﬁt
performance from the main electric
actuator assembly plant in Bath,
which was assisted by continuing
sourcing initiatives limiting the cost
of component increases. We are
looking for additional initiatives 
in 2008 to continue to mitigate
cost pressures.
Europe
The European sales and support
companies all increased proﬁts
from the prior year, with
particularly strong performances 
in Italy and Germany. Europe
accounted for 16% of the total
input units against 13% in 2006.
Work on existing oil & gas
installations was active throughout
the region; in particular we
beneﬁted from increased
investment in oil and product
storage facilities. Our business in
the water market in continental
Europe also continued to grow,
with our French subsidiary making
encouraging progress. Elsewhere
our relatively new Russian sales
company continued to develop its
business while the Dutch company
doubled the size of its facility to
enable it to expand its factory ﬁt
and site service capabilities. 
The European businesses also
beneﬁted from increased business
from valvemakers in their
territories. The Italian valvemakers,
in particular, had extensive order
books built on the high level of
worldwide energy projects,
particularly those being built in 
the Middle East.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  The Americas
Rotork Controls Inc had a number
of challenges entering 2007, which
included a high hurdle set by its
prior year proﬁt performance, a
softening US$ and an economy
which was displaying weaknesses
in some areas. Against this
background, the company
performed well and continued 
to beneﬁt from investment in
water & waste water treatment
facilities. It also beneﬁted from the
US valve industry’ s competitiveness
on international projects. US
Process Controls saw a good
recovery of its business, mainly
based on improved sales to the
power companies. 
The Canadian company had a
disappointing year, due to slower
than expected project activity,
especially in the West. The
Venezuelan subsidiary continued
to face difﬁcult challenges in what
is potentially a promising market
for our products.
For the Americas, order input in
units increased in total but reduced
to 16% from 17% of the Group.
Asia Paciﬁc and the Rest 
of the World
Asia continued to be a major
engine for growth for the business.
Asia Paciﬁc accounted for 50% of
the input of electric actuators up
from 49% last year. China
continued to be the most
important contributor with
increased levels of business. 
The Indian market maintained the
high levels of business seen in
2006, driven by investment in
power generation and large
reﬁnery projects. Our electric
actuator manufacturing plants in
Kuala Lumpur, Shanghai, Chennai
and Bangalore all performed well
and achieved increases in proﬁts.
Elsewhere, the Singaporean,
Malaysian and Thai sales
companies all saw increased levels
of business as did those in Japan
and Korea. The latter did well to
overcome some local difﬁculties
and ended the year with a
stronger operation. 
The Australian operation
continued to perform well while
the turnaround in the fortunes of
our South African company, which
made a loss in the prior year, was
also most encouraging.
ROTORK FLUID SYSTEMS
Rotork Fluid Systems, which
designs, assembles and markets
pneumatic and hydraulic valve
actuators continued to achieve
exceptional growth. The main
markets served by our products 
are oil & gas related and unlike
electric actuators the majority are
used on upstream applications,
transmission and LNG plants &
terminals. These markets continue
to beneﬁt from high levels of
investment. A notable success was
winning substantial orders on the
very large Shell GTL (‘Gas to
Liquids’) Pearl project in Qatar. 
The principal assembly plant is
based in Lucca, Italy, with products
also assembled in Rochester, N.Y.
and Melle in Germany. The division
had two long-term key
performance goals. Firstly to
achieve 20% of Group revenue
and secondly a 15% return on
sales. It just achieved both of these
objectives this year, having
narrowly missed the revenue target
in 2006 (19%) and increased
return on sales from 13.3% to
15.0% in 2007. This is despite its
main cost base being in euros and
the euro/dollar rate having
averaged $1.38 against a prior
year of $1.26.
Order input was 34.6% up on 
the prior year, while revenue
increased by 18.3% to £47.9m
and operating proﬁt was up
33.3% to £7.2m.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
The Italian operation performed
very well and we increased our
investment in the facility, improving
the ofﬁce area and installing an
upgraded ERP system both there
and in the plant in Melle. 
The product range was extended
and improved, while further
progress was made in gaining
additional customer and market
approvals. The division had
increasing success on projects
requiring engineered solutions
particularly in the electro-hydraulic
(‘EH’), gas over oil, linear and
subsea product areas. A notable
success was the large EH order for
the Aramco Khurais project in
Saudi Arabia. The US operation
also beneﬁted from the upsurge in
engineered solutions business. 
The division’ s global capabilities
continued to be enhanced, mainly
through the development of the
Group’ s worldwide sales companies
and ofﬁces. Among these, the UK
based operation in Leeds and the
Spanish ofﬁce had excellent results.
The acquisition of Remote 
Controls Sweden was completed
on 30 January 2008 for a
consideration of £13m. This
company, which is based in Falun,
Sweden, was established in 1961
and has a worldwide reputation
for supplying high quality lower
torque actuators to a wide array 
of markets. These products
complement the mainly heavy 
duty products of the existing RFS
ranges and will be sold through
Rotork’s worldwide network of
sales ofﬁces.
The acquisition of the Drallim SVM
partial stroke and valve monitoring
patented product for £630k on 
13 February 2008 provides the
division with a platform to further
develop products for safety critical
applications. Rotork has sold the
SVM product for some years and
sees the demand for this type of
diagnostic system increasing due
to its ability to improve plant safety
and productivity while also
reducing plant capital costs.
ROTORK GEARS
Rotork Gears manufactures
gearboxes, adaptors and other
ancillary devices for industrial
valvemakers worldwide. Through
these valvemakers it serves a wide
variety of end user industries.
Rotork Gears achieved growth 
well above our plans and beneﬁted
from an active worldwide valve
market, especially in Europe and
America, and investment in its
worldwide operations and supply
chain. Revenue was up 31.3% to
£31.9m and operating proﬁt was
up 56.5% to £7.3m. The star
performers were the two main
plants in Leeds and Losser in 
The Netherlands. Both achieved
signiﬁcant growth in revenue 
and proﬁts.
Much work and investment was
centred on the new Chinese
facility which met an ambitious
production target and achieved a
number of important milestones,
including the assembly of the
updated 232 aluminium range 
of units and further progress 
was made in opening up the 
Asian market.
The engineering team was re-
organised to create a dedicated
R&D resource and progress was
made with a number of important
product initiatives. New or
improved product ranges will be
launched in 2008.
One of the key objectives for the
coming year will be to develop the
existing operations, those already
mentioned plus the operation in
Italy; ﬁrstly to ensure that the
business continues to increase
capacity to improve service levels
to our customers; secondly to
make sure that opportunities to
rationalise production and reduce
costs are delivered.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
(‘KPIs’)
Rotork has a culture of customer
service and support and this ethos
is reﬂected in the way that the
business is controlled on a day to
day basis. We manage the
operations through targets
primarily related to trading
activities and have well established
systems and procedures to support
this. KPIs have long been used to
aid management in monitoring
progress in achieving its objectives.
Most targets are ﬁnancial KPIs but
more recently we have developed
a similar approach to non ﬁnancial
issues connected with areas such
as environmental matters and
health & safety. 
Rotork’s philosophy of product
assembly only, using sub
contractors to manufacture
components, gives signiﬁcant
ﬂexibility in the production model
and KPIs assist in monitoring 
the efﬁciency of this model.
Management’s focus is on what
we regard as the high added value
activities of design, marketing and
management control. This means
that our approach to measuring
performance is oriented towards
success in penetrating the markets
in which we operate, the
development and proﬁtability of
our products, a desire for a high
return on capital, and strong cash
generation. We have produced
consistent improvement in
performance in these measures
through the year under review.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  The Group uses a range of
indicators to assess performance at
individual company, divisional and
Group level. The following are the
main key performance indicators
at Group level showing four years
performance and explanation
where appropriate of issues
underlying some of the measures.
Financial KPIs
Growth of the business, market
penetration and quality of earnings
are crucial target areas for Rotork
and we have a number of
measures of performance used
throughout the Rotork
organisation. Revenue growth is 
a simple but effective measure of
our performance against our
objectives in this area and,
supported by the relationship of
our net proﬁt to sales and the
growth in earnings per share,
provides a small but powerful
range of ratios that enable
management to quickly view the
performance of the business and
drill down to divisional level and
below to view returns. With an
asset light business model, we
have a target of growth in return
on capital which provides an
effective view of balance sheet
performance and each of the
divisional businesses review this.
Conversion of proﬁt into cash has
a high priority within the Group
and is embedded within reward
schemes at divisional management
as well as Group level.
Sales revenue growth
This is reported in detail for all
operating businesses and is a key
driver in the business. These
measures enable us to track our
success in speciﬁc project activity
and our progress in increasing 
our market share by products 
and region. This also is an
important driver in our product
development programme. 
Return on sales
This is calculated as proﬁt before
tax (after ﬁnancing and interest)
shown as a percentage of sales
revenue. This measure brings
together the combined effects 
of procurement costs and pricing
as well as the leverage of our
operating assets. Our overall aim 
is for continuous improvement
over time, notwithstanding the
impact of currency.
Cash generation
The conversion of proﬁt into cash is
an important measure for Rotork.
This is calculated as the ratio of
operating cash ﬂow to operating
proﬁt. Operating cash ﬂow is
deﬁned as the movement in cash
and cash equivalents, adjusted to
add back cash ﬂows from
ﬁnancing activities, the acquisition
of subsidiaries, income taxes paid,
exceptional cash outﬂows and less
interest received. It is used
internally as a measure of
performance where a target of
85% is regarded as a base level of
achievement. This also forms one
of the constituent parts of the
reward system where management
is incentivised to achieve a
performance beyond this level. 
Return on capital employed
Rotork has an asset light business
model by design, and reporting
this ratio internally helps
management at Group level to
monitor our adherence to this
philosophy. The calculation shows
proﬁt before tax as a percentage
of capital employed. Capital
employed is deﬁned as
shareholders’ funds less net cash
held, and the pension deﬁcit net of
related deferred tax is added back.

EPS growth
The measurement of earnings 
per share reﬂects all aspects of the
income statement including
management of the Group’s 
tax rate. We aim to increase EPS
each year.
Non-ﬁnancial KPIs
We monitor non-ﬁnancial areas 
in our businesses particularly in 
the environmental, health & safety 
and quality control areas and 
put strong emphasis within our
organisation on improving our
performance here.
Waste recycling
This KPI measures the proportion
of total waste produced which 
is recycled. We have an active
programme aimed at reducing 
our environmental footprint
throughout the organisation. 
We collect this information
through regular submissions
through our extranet site. 
DIVIDENDS
Rotork is a cash generative
business and has a policy of
returning funds to shareholders
where they are not required for
reinvestment in the business in the
foreseeable future. The Board’s
policy is one of increasing
dividends generally in line with
earnings. In recent years where
there has been excess cash in the
business this has been distributed
back to shareholders in the form
of additional dividends. In the year
under review cash generation has
been good and the Board is
recommending to shareholders
that the ﬁnal dividend for 2007 
be 14.0p per share which is an
increase of 20% over the prior
year. In addition, the Board is
intending to pay an additional
interim dividend for 2008 of 
11.5p per share, representing the
distribution of £10m of excess
cash. This will be paid to
shareholders on 18 July 2008, to
shareholders on the register on 
27 June 2008.
TREASURY
The Group’s treasury function in
Bath manages ﬁnancial risk
relating to foreign currency
exposure, debtor risk and cash
movements within the Group. 
Rotork is affected by movements
in world currencies and aims to
mitigate the effect of this through
the diversity of location of
production units as well as taking
action through derivative
instruments. The main currency
exposure results from trading
transactions between our
production plants and trading
companies and customers around
the world. This exposure is covered
by simple forward cover derivative
instruments aimed at protecting
known income streams: no
speculative or non trading hedging
takes place within the Group. 
The impact of currency on the
results of the Group can best be
seen by converting the 2007 results
to the effective exchange rates for
2006, so comparing results at
constant currency, see table below.
Overall we believe that proﬁt for
the year would have been
approximately £2.8m higher if the
2006 exchange rates had prevailed.
The increase in operating proﬁt,
reported as 22.8%, would have
shown an increase of 29.0% at
constant currency. Weighted
average rates for translation of 
our two main trading currencies 
for the last few years are shown 
in the table below.
Receivables management is done
at each operating business unit 
but controlled centrally in Bath.
There is commonality in our
customer base across many of the
geographic units and debts outside
the UK are insured centrally on 
a limit per customer basis, and this
operates across the operating
divisions. Overall we believe a level
of 65 days sales outstanding for
receivables is appropriate for 
our mix of business. At the year
end this ﬁgure was 60 days, an
improvement of 2 days compared
with 2006.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  PENSION SCHEMES
Over the last few years there has
been a lot of focus on pension
schemes, particularly company
liabilities relating to under funded
legacy deﬁned beneﬁt schemes.
Rotork’s UK ﬁnal salary scheme
was closed to new entrants in
2002, when a deﬁned contribution
scheme was opened for employees
joining from the beginning of
2003. The Group has made
additional contributions into the
UK ﬁnal salary scheme between
2004 and 2007 and the scheme
had its latest actuarial valuation
review during 2007. The results of
this showed it was 98% funded
on an actuarial basis, which is
precisely the position that the
additional contributions were
aiming to achieve, and it is now
felt that the scheme is back in
equilibrium. The main issue for
schemes of this type in recent
years has been the effect of longer
life expectancy, the fact that
pensions in payment will have to
be paid for longer as people
expect to live longer. This issue
could continue to affect schemes
as mortality assumptions evolve
further over the next few years.
However, management and the
pension scheme trustees, with the
advice of the scheme actuary,
consider that the potential for
adverse mortality assumptions to
impact the scheme further is
controllable within the current
range of contributions.
The impact of improved mortality
is not presently anticipated to have
an impact on cash contributions
beyond normally expected funding
levels. In terms of the charge to
the income statement under IFRS
these assumptions will have an
impact as a result of the last
actuarial valuation by increasing
the charge against proﬁt. The
charge against proﬁt before tax
will increase to around £1.6m in
2008, compared with the charge
of £0.7m in 2007.
ROTORK COMMUNITY
Rotork celebrated its 50th year of
incorporation with a number of
marvellous events which were
attended by both past and present
employees as well as others who
have had much to do with the
Group’s success. We also
celebrated this milestone with a
publication which drew very
positive comments from a wide
group of stakeholders. 
The events demonstrated the
commitment and affection 
that everyone has for the
organisation which makes it such 
a formidable presence in its ﬁeld. 
I have enormously enjoyed every
aspect of my involvement with
Rotork over the past thirty-four
years and feel very privileged to
have led it over the past twelve.
Rotork has always had a unique
spirit which I feel conﬁdent under
the talented leadership of Peter
France will propel it to even
greater success. I would like to
thank all of our employees around
the world for their dedication, skill,
good humour and friendship and it
is them that I will miss most when I
retire on 2 May.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  Rotork has been a leading actuator
manufacturer for over 50 years
and its valve actuators and
gearboxes are designed to provide
a signiﬁcant service life, often 
in arduous conditions. Long-term
cost of ownership is an important
factor to our customers along 
with reliability, and these issues
drive the choice of Rotork over 
any alternative. With Rotork
providing the after sales support,
customers know that the
equipment will be maintained to
its original speciﬁcation and
operational efﬁciency, which is
particularly beneﬁcial where the
product is certiﬁed. 
Rotork Site Services (‘RSS’), the
new projects, service and retroﬁt
arm of the Group which supports
all three divisions, is active in 47
service centres in over 20 countries
around the world, with agents
providing support services in
another 55 countries. This brings
the total number of expert
technicians supporting Rotork
customers to well over 1,000.
RSS provides support at plant level
on all applications where our
products are used. Embedded
within the site structure, and often
within the customer’s operating
team, our engineers can provide
total support to ensure that the
plant operator gets maximum
advantage from its investment. In
addition, we are able to aid the
customer when investment
programmes are being considered
by providing technical input to the
expansion and upgrading of
equipment and to ensure that the
correct equipment is considered
and commissioned appropriately.
Within RSS, our aim is to make the
application and utilisation of our
products and services easy
whether it is by:
Delivering small turnkey
projects to actuate existing
manual valves for customers;
Refurbishing aging actuators
(typically 25+ years old) to give
them another lifetime of utility;
Project managing the
upgrading of site’s entire
actuation assets and associated
equipment;
Connecting actuators to 
valves for new build projects 
for valve makers and end
customers to facilitate easier
installation on site;
Delivering preventative
maintenance programmes;
Availability of our engineers on
a call out basis to support the
customer’s own maintenance
programme.
Through delivering added value
services across the world we
continue to differentiate our
business, strengthen relationships
with our customers and contribute
to the growth in the Group’ s
revenue and proﬁts.
One signiﬁcant area of growth in
2007 has been the uptake of multi-
year preventative maintenance
contracts, particularly by the
petrochemical sector where uptime
is of critical importance. We now
have over 100 maintenance
contracts covering over 50,000
actuators worldwide. Through
combining technology built into
our actuators, expert service
engineers and data evaluation
processes, we are able to identify
deterioration within a valve early.
This enables unnecessary outages
to be minimised whilst focusing
maintenance expenditure where 
it is needed.
2008 will see RSS grow further in
terms of the service centres we
operate from, the scope of the
services we provide and the value
we bring our customers.

ROTORK SITE SERVICES PROVIDES SUPPORT AT PLANT LEVEL
ON ALL APPLICATIONS WHERE OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED. ONCE INSTALLED, 
OUR PRODUCT IS
PRACTICALLY
IGNORED BY OUR
CUSTOMER.
JUST AS WE INTENDED. With a signiﬁcant proportion of
our income derived from products
introduced within the last ﬁve
years, investment in our product
portfolio is an important part of
Rotork’s success. In addition to
continuous improvement of our
main electric and ﬂuid power
actuator ranges, we have
continued to invest in our
proprietary Pakscan networking
system with further development
of the master station to extend its
functionality and enable it to be
installed outside the protected
environment of the control room.
Development of a mesh based
wireless system has now reached 
a stage where the initial technical
hurdles have been overcome and
ﬁeld trials are anticipated during
2008. This is an important
development, which will enable
our customers to extend their
plant visibility and control systems
at very reasonable cost and with
minimal disruption. The continued
development of, and improvement
to, plant control and monitoring
systems is an important part of the
drive towards more energy
efﬁcient intelligent plant processes,
and Rotork has established a
market leadership role in valve
actuator control systems.
The release of an optional module
that enables the IQ series of
products to be used within safety
instrumented systems signalled the
successful conclusion of this
development. Initial market
response indicates that the addition
has been well received and will
assist users in complying with
regulatory requirements. Other IQ
related research has focused on the
use of alternate materials as a
means of reducing costs.
Work continues on the
development of a variant of the
IQT product for naval applications
with ﬁrst shipments expected
during the last quarter of 2008.
Following the extensive feasibility
exercise reported last year, work
commenced at the beginning of
2007 on the detailed design of a
family of actuators for the process
control market. This is an important
area of development for Rotork. It
is expected that initial sizes of this
product will commence production
in the second half of 2008. 
A marketing structure has been
deﬁned and is being built up. 
T est products have been giving
excellent performances at a
number of Beta sites and the
launch of this new product line for
Rotork is eagerly awaited.
The Fluid Systems division has
continued to work closely with its
key customers resulting in the
approval of fast acting spring
return actuators suitable for use
within high integrity pressure
protection systems (‘HIPPS’). 
Such actuators are an essential
component of the safety
instrumented systems required to
mitigate over pressure events. 
The HIPPS approach can provide
environmental beneﬁts in the form
of reduced venting to atmosphere
and in some cases may eliminate
the need for ﬂaring. Other
developments have included
increasing the torque capability of
the pipeline solutions to enable
their use in severe service mining
applications, where the latest
autoclave valves require in excess
of 5 million Nm.
Development work has also been
undertaken in a combined effort
between the Fluid Systems and
Gears divisions to provide a sea
bed solution for the hydraulic
automation of subsea valves with
independent manual override.
Within the Gears division a project
commenced to develop a new
range of manual quarter-turn
gearboxes for valve operation. 
The aim is to increase ﬂexibility as
well as performance, making the
product suitable for stocking and
modiﬁcation at customisation
centres around the world. This
project is expected to continue
throughout 2008 with design and
testing of a number of prototype
units already well underway.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT CONTINUAL INVESTMENT 
IN OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF
ROTORK’S SUCCESS. RELIABILITY COUNTS.
WHATEVER THE
CONDITIONS, OUR
ACTUATORS ARE
DESIGNED TO 
WORK EFFECTIVELY
FOR A LIFETIME. The Group has an established risk
management process which works
within the corporate governance
framework set out in our corporate
governance statement. The major
risks affecting the Group are
identiﬁed by senior management in
association with the Board and
with the support of the external
auditor. This involves regular risk
assessment and a process for
ensuring that the Group’ s approach
to dealing with individual risks is
robust and timely. These risks are
categorised by likely impact on the
business and the likelihood of the
event occurring. They can be seen
to fall into three main risk areas:
Risks affecting the strategic
aims of the business, or those
issues that affect the strategic
objectives faced by the Group;
Financial risks – issues that
could affect the ﬁnances of 
the business both externally
and from a perspective of
internal controls;
Operational risks – matters
arising out of the operational
activities of the Group relating
to areas such as procurement,
product development and
interaction with commercial
partners.
PRINCIPAL STRATEGIC RISKS
As an international business,
Rotork operates in all markets
across the world mainly through 
a direct presence but in the smaller
territories through agents. Implicit
in this is the benevolent trading
environment that comes with
stable regimes across the globe,
and disruptions to this stability
regionally could affect our ability 
to trade effectively. It is not
possible to fully mitigate this as a
risk but our truly global spread of
business and visibility of potential
risk areas enables us to contain 
our exposure.
Product and control systems
development which threatens our
market leadership position is a
signiﬁcant risk. This is an important
factor driving us to maintain
technological leadership with our
actuators and systems. We aim to
give customers increasingly greater
control over their applications and
value for money as we enhance
diagnostics, functionality and
control. We also recognise the
need for global manufacturing 
by sourcing components across the
world and have created production
facilities in lower cost areas which
are often closer to end user
markets. Our successful expansion
into Asia has been as a result of
recognising this. Our business
model is less vertically integrated
than our competitors and we are
able to take strategic sourcing and
build decisions quickly.
PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL RISKS
Foreign currency management is
an important area for Rotork and
the potential for signiﬁcant
movements in world markets for
the currencies in which we operate
present signiﬁcant risks for us.
There are a number of ways in
which we can approach these
risks. Short-term movements are
addressed using forward exchange
contracts to ensure that when we
have contractual liabilities we can
effectively mitigate and ﬁx the
exposure. This does not of itself
avoid the impact of long-term
trends, which are ultimately best
handled through a spread of
vendor programmes across the
geographical areas over which 
we operate. This, plus the
development of local production
facilities, provides natural hedging
where it is needed.
Internal control within the
businesses is supported by a strong
ethos of ﬁnancial internal audit
which Rotork has developed over 
a number of years utilising the
skills of accountants from across
the businesses. This methodology
ensures that we have auditors 
who are aware of the business
issues and risks involved in them.
Independence is maintained by
ensuring that any auditor with
divisional responsibility only 
audits companies outside their
own division. 
Further ﬁnancial risk areas have
been identiﬁed in cash control and
credit management. Both functions
are centrally controlled within the
Group and are monitored through
the audit process for compliance,
and are reported on to the 
Audit Committee. 
While these are the principal risks,
the risk assessment process goes
far beyond this to identify medium
grade and relatively minor risks and
provide a process for their regular
review aiming to give action plans
to create, wherever possible, an
embedded approach to the
containment and management 
of risks in the businesses.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
STATEMENT OF PRINCIPAL RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES THE
GROUP HAS AN ESTABLISHED RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS WHICH
WORKS WITHIN THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK. PRINCIPAL OPERATIONAL RISKS 
Having the right people in the
right place at the right time is 
key for a business like Rotork. 
We devote a lot of effort to
developing our employees and
giving opportunities for those who
want to develop their skills and
experience across our operational
landscape. This approach to
succession planning has enabled
us to identify candidates for
promotion within the businesses,
ensure that the necessary training
and career development
programmes are open to them 
and to secure a good ﬂow of
potential future management 
as the Group develops.
In our risk assessment and review
programme the issue of quality is a
constant theme. Quality in design,
quality in component supply, and
quality in production are all under
continual review. The need to
maintain our deserved reputation
for the highest quality standards
and customer facing approach 
to our markets is fundamental to
Rotork. Quality is a core part of 
the Rotork culture, and quality
management programmes are
embedded within all of our
operating procedures. We have an
active quality management
function which includes regular
supplier visits and audits. This
process is connected to our
product development programme
for existing and proposed products
ensuring that all areas of
operational experience are fed
back into the design process. 
As the manufacture of our
components is outsourced, the
relationship and support from
vendors is crucial to our business.
Design of components is done
recognising the manufacturing
issues involved and our vendor
involvement in the design and
quality processes is an important
part of how the product comes
into production and maintains its
integrity. There are a number of
inherent risks in not managing
these processes properly and
signiﬁcant effort is expended in 
the Group in ensuring that this is
done well. The current dual
sourcing programme for key
components is an example of how
we have responded to these
matters and we have introduced
this seamlessly and with the
support of our suppliers.
19
ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S BUSINESS REVIEW CONTINUED
QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ROTORK’S ACTIVE QUALITY
MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME IS CENTRED ON PROCESS CONTROL.
QUALITY
Rotork’ s active quality management
programme is centred on process
control. Throughout each product’ s
life cycle, from initial concept to
volume production, every business
and production process is subject
to robust scrutiny. The three key
processes are product
development, component
procurement and ﬁnal assembly.
As customer sites become 
more sophisticated, their plant
automation requirements change.
Rotork’s Research & Development
teams seek innovative means of
offering customers the
enhancements they demand.
Representatives from all
departments examine new designs
at every stage and from every
perspective; compliance with
customer requirements, ease of
assembly and cost optimisation.
Control of the component
procurement process is crucial.
Rotork purchases complex
components to exacting quality
standards, through global supply
chains. The purchasing and
Supplier Quality Assurance (‘SQA’) 
functions are increasingly
international in makeup, sourcing
products in the country most
appropriate for each particular
commodity. A mutually supportive
worldwide supply network is being
established, with local purchasing
and SQA teams representing the
whole Group for component
supply. SQA teams work closely
with suppliers from product
inception onwards, to ensure
suppliers’ processes are properly
controlled, resulting in consistent
and compliant parts.
The assembly process is the
culmination of all the development
and supplier controls. Operator
training programmes, ‘mistake-
proof’ assembly methods, clear
instructions and world class
performance monitoring tools
combine to control the build
process. These controls are well
established at the main
manufacturing sites and are now
being rolled out to newer divisions
and more recent acquisitions.
ENVIRONMENTAL
The principal manufacturing site in
Bath maintains an Environment
Management System (‘EMS’),
which is independently veriﬁed as
compliant with the requirements
of ISO 14001: 2004. The EMS 
was developed to identify, manage
and reduce the signiﬁcant
environmental aspects and ensure
compliance with environmental
legislation. The Bath site is now
assisting subsidiaries in raising
awareness of environmental issues
and implementation of essential
controls. During 2007, Rotork
Gears in Leeds implemented an
EMS in accordance with the
requirements of ISO 14001. 
Due to the nature of the Rotork
business, one of the most
signiﬁcant aspects is packaging
waste. To address the impact and
to minimise waste to landﬁll,
Rotork made recycling a reportable
KPI in 2006. The last year has
shown continual improvement:
Group recycling totals increased 
to 57% in 2007 from 46% in
2006 and 38% in 2005. 
Rotork sites that generate high
levels of waste are being targeted
for improvement. In the second
half of 2007, Rotork Gears
installed recycling systems for
cardboard, wood and plastic and
expect to recycle 75% of total
waste generated in 2008. Work is
also in progress to reduce the
waste generated at the factory in
Rochester N.Y., in conjunction with
initiatives to increase re-use and
recycling. These two sites each
generate over 200 tonnes of
packaging waste per annum.
Rotork remains committed to
meeting the requirements for
continued inclusion in the
FTSE4Good Index. Rotork is very
conscious of the need for improved
environmental awareness and the
need to minimise the Group’ s
environmental impacts. In 2006,
Rotork reported environmental KPI
data for 29 subsidiaries. The 2007
environmental report will include
KPI data from 33 subsidiaries.

ENVIRONMENTS IN 
THE WORLD.
FORTUNATELY, OUR PEOPLE ARE TOO. GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES ROTORK HAS LONG-TERM
RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CUSTOMER BASE AND THIS IS A KEY
FEATURE OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL.
Rotork is a collection of strong
businesses organised within a
divisional structure to provide the
best line of support to our
customers. We have pro-active
management teams following
common goals, allowing
independent but co-ordinated
product development programmes
to give the best solutions to our
customers’ problems. We help
guide customers through the
technological advancements that
we offer to improve their
processes, enhance efﬁciency and
reduce the environmental impact
of their operations. Our products
have differing technical issues to
overcome in achieving the required
functionality. However, through 
co-ordinating our collective
offering to the industries that we
serve, we are able to provide an
homogenous integrated set of
solutions that make Rotork the
provider of choice for the world
leaders in the oil & gas, power and
water & waste water markets.
We have begun the process of
reﬁning the divisional structure and
are now refocusing our efforts to
maximise penetration of our
markets, and to develop offerings
for newer markets and those
where we are not traditionally
strong. This involves re-examining
parts of our product portfolio and
how it integrates, where and how
we produce our products and
importantly how we offer ongoing
support to customers after the
initial sale is completed. Rotork has
long-term relationships with its
customer base and this is a key
feature of our business model. 
It is the trust built up within these
relationships that is fundamental
to the successful development of
new and existing products. 
We have for some time
strengthened our offering to
customers by enhancing the range
with niche products through
business acquisitions. These have
then been brought into
mainstream use through our
product development and
marketing programmes. This has
been a successful strategy for
Rotork and there are clear beneﬁts
in pursuing this where we are able
to ﬁnd quality businesses that ﬁt
Rotork’s product philosophy and
where we can bring added value. 
Our underlying markets, oil & gas,
the power industry and water 
& waste water, are all looking
positive at the moment and we
have conﬁdence in our prospects
for growth in all of these areas
during the coming year and
beyond. Investment in
infrastructure development across
the world in pipelines, new
reﬁneries, liqueﬁed natural gas 
and the constant need for
improvements in energy supply,
water availability and the need
generally to move product through
valves, will continue to demand
high quality valve actuators. 
Our drive for improvements in
technology in our approach to
processes and systems, makes us
well placed to take advantage of
these developments.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’
RESPONSIBILITY FOR PREPARING
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The following statement, which
should be read in conjunction 
with the Auditors’ Statement of
Auditors’ Responsibilities, included
in the audit report, is made with 
a view to distinguishing for
shareholders the respective
responsibilities of the directors and
of the Auditors in relation to the
ﬁnancial statements.
Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities in Respect of
the Annual Report & Accounts
The directors are responsible for
preparing the Annual Report and
the Group and Company ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.
26
ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  Company law requires the directors
to prepare Group and Company
ﬁnancial statements for each
ﬁnancial year. Under that law they
are required to prepare the Group
ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with IFRS as adopted by the EU and
applicable law and have elected to
prepare the Company ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with UK
Accounting Standards and
applicable law (UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice).
The Group ﬁnancial statements 
are required by law and IFRS as
adopted by the EU to present 
fairly the ﬁnancial position and
performance of the Group; the
Companies Act 1985 provides in
relation to such ﬁnancial
statements that references in the
relevant part of that Act to
ﬁnancial statements giving a true
and fair view are references to
their achieving a fair presentation.
The Company ﬁnancial statements
are required by law to give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Company.
In preparing each of the Group
and Company ﬁnancial
statements, the directors are
required to:
�
Select suitable accounting
policies and then apply them
consistently;
�
Make judgements and
estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
For the Group ﬁnancial
statements, state whether they
have been prepared in
accordance with IFRS as
adopted by the EU;
For the Company ﬁnancial
statements, state whether
applicable UK Accounting
Standards have been followed,
subject to any material
departures disclosed and
explained in the Company
ﬁnancial statements; 
Prepare the ﬁnancial statements
on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the Group and
the Company will continue in
business. 
The directors are responsible for
keeping proper accounting records
that disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the Company and
enable them to ensure that its
ﬁnancial statements comply with
the Companies Act 1985. They
have general responsibility for
taking such steps as are reasonably
open to them to safeguard the
assets of the Group and to prevent
and detect fraud and other
irregularities.
Under applicable law and
regulations, the directors are also
responsible for preparing 
a Directors’ Report, Remuneration
Report and Corporate Governance
Statement that comply with that
law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible 
for the maintenance and integrity
of the corporate and ﬁnancial
information included in the
Company’s website. Legislation in
the UK governing the preparation
and dissemination of ﬁnancial
statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
CREDITOR PAYMENT POLICY
While there is no formal code or
standard, it is Company and Group
policy to settle terms of payment
with creditors when agreeing the
terms of each transaction and to
abide by creditors’ terms of
payment provided that the supplier
is also complying with all relevant
terms and conditions. There are no
creditors subject to special
arrangements outside suppliers’
terms and conditions. The
Company does not have any trade
suppliers so that a creditor day
payment period is not appropriate.
DIRECTORS’ AND OFFICERS’
INDEMNITY INSURANCE
Subject to the provisions of 
the Companies Acts the
Company’s Articles of Association
provide for the directors and
ofﬁcers of the Company to be
appropriately indemniﬁed. The
Company purchases and maintains
insurance for the directors and
ofﬁcers of the Company, in
undertaking their duties, in
accordance with section 309(A) of
the Companies Act 1985.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION 
TO AUDITORS
The directors who held ofﬁce at the
date of approval of this Directors’
Report conﬁrm that, so far as they
are each aware, there is no relevant
audit information of which the
Company’ s auditors are unaware;
and each director has taken all the
steps that he ought to have taken
as a director to make himself aware
of any relevant audit information
and to establish that the
Company’ s auditors are aware of
that information.
AUDITORS
Resolutions to re-appoint KPMG
Audit Plc as auditors and to
authorise the directors to determine
their remuneration are to be
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The AGM of the Company 
will be held at the Company’s
ofﬁces at Rotork House, Brassmill
Lane, Bath BA1 3JQ on Friday, 
2 May 2008 at 12 noon. 
A separate circular containing the
Notice of the Meeting is 
sent to shareholders with this
Annual Report & Accounts.
ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD
STEPHEN RHYS JONES
COMPANY SECRETARY
29 FEBRUARY 2008
27
ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Set out within this section is a
commentary on how the Company
applies the main and supporting
principles of the Combined Code
on Corporate Governance 
(‘the Code’). Speciﬁc disclosures
required within the provisions of
the Code are also made within 
this section.
CODE COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
All current serving executive
directors now have a one year
notice period or less in their service
contracts. By November 2007 
JW Matthews, a non-executive
director, had served 9 years on the
Board. By the end of February
2008 he will resign as a member
of Audit, Remuneration and
Nomination Committees and as
Chairman of Audit and
Remuneration Committees.
Following the appointment of JE
Nicholas as a director in February
2008, currently there are three
independent non-executives as
accepted by the Code on the
Board and the Board Committees.
As Rotork p.l.c. is considered a
large company by the Code it is
recognised that for full
compliance, Code provision A.3.2
currently would require further
independent non-executives to be
appointed so that half the Board
excluding the Chairman comprise
independent non-executive
directors. The recent appointment
of JE Nicholas is considered by the
Board to be a further signiﬁcant
step towards full compliance in
respect of the relevant Code
provisions, concerning Board
composition in addition to
facilitating full compliance for
Committee membership and
composition particularly given that
following the retirement of WH
Whiteley in May 2008 there will
then be four executive directors
remaining on the Board. Subject to
the matter of the number of
independent non-executives
referred to in this paragraph the
Company considers that it
complies with the provisions of 
the Code. 
INTERNAL CONTROL
During the year the Group has
operated procedures necessary to
comply with the guidance issued in
the ‘Turnbull Report’, and reported
in accordance with that guidance.
The Board has ultimate
responsibility for the Group’s
system of internal control and is
required to set appropriate policies
and to review its effectiveness. The
role of management is to
implement Board policies.
The system of internal control is
designed to reduce but cannot
eliminate the risks of failure to meet
business objectives. Internal control
therefore can only provide
reasonable but not absolute
assurance in meeting such business
objectives or against material
misstatement or loss.
A continuous process for
identifying, evaluating and
managing the signiﬁcant risks
faced by the Group continued to
be applied and developed during
the year under review and
operated up to the date of
approval of the Annual Report &
Accounts. Senior managers with
responsibility across all functions
participate in the risk management
process that identiﬁes and
evaluates the key risks (including
consideration of social and
environmental risks) facing the
Group’s businesses. Their
deliberations are reported to the
Audit Committee and Board. 
This process is based on senior
managers’ detailed knowledge
and understanding of key risks
within and external to the business
based on formal management
information and reports and their
interaction and daily dealings with
those reporting directly to them,
their colleagues and external
parties. The principal risks and
uncertainties facing the Group are
commented on in the Business
Review section of this Annual
Report & Accounts.
Internal ﬁnancial audits are
undertaken on a regular basis 
by a selected group of accountants
drawn from head ofﬁce and across
the divisional businesses and
geographic centres. All these
accountants have received relevant
and speciﬁc training in internal
audit, best practice and control
procedures, including health &
safety. Work will continue to
further embed internal control and
risk management in the operations
of the business and to further
enhance and add to the relevant
processes including consideration
of social and environmental risks.
The processes that are used by the
Board to review the effectiveness
of this system of internal control
include the following:
During the year the Audit
Committee:
Monitored and reviewed 
the effectiveness of internal
audit activities;
Reviewed and monitored
external auditor independence
and objectivity and the
effectiveness of the audit
process;
Considered reports from
management, internal and
external audit on the system of
internal ﬁnancial control and
any material control
weaknesses;
Received reports on health 
& safety and environmental
issues;
Discussed with management
the range of actions taken on
problem areas for the business
identiﬁed by Board members or
in the internal and external
audit reports.
Additionally:
The Board received copies of
the minutes of all Audit
Committee meetings;
The Board reviewed the role of
insurances in managing risk
across the Group;
The Board regularly receives
written and oral reports from
management on all aspects 
of production, operations,
ﬁnancial and risk management
matters.
Prior to the year end the full Board,
following discussion at the Audit
Committee, formally reviews the
effectiveness of the Group’s system
of internal control.
THE BOARD
The Board currently has ten
members comprising: the
Chairman, the three independent
non-executive directors as accepted
by the Code, JW Matthews a non-
executive director, and ﬁve
executive directors. The Company’ s
Articles of Association provide that
one third of the directors shall retire
from ofﬁce by rotation at each
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’).
Additionally new directors are
subject to election by shareholders
at the ﬁrst opportunity after their
appointment. In line with the Code
guidance non-executive directors
are normally appointed for an
initial term of three years, which is
then reviewed and extended for up
to a further two three year periods.
On appointment directors receive 
a suitable and tailored induction.
There is a clear division of
responsibility approved by the
Board in writing between the
28
ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  Chairman, RC Lockwood, and the
current Chief Executive, WH
Whiteley, that ensures that there is
a balance of power and authority
between the running of the Board
and the executive responsibility for
the running of the Company’s
business. JW Matthews will
continue to act in the role of the
Senior Independent non-executive
Director until his retirement from
the Board on 2 May 2008 when 
a replacement independent 
non-executive director will be
appointed to that position.
Attendance at Board and
committee meetings is shown
above.
During the year Board meetings
are scheduled at manufacturing
sites other than the Company’s
headquarters in Bath. This allows,
in particular, non-executive
directors to meet management at
these sites and receive
presentations from them. During
the year under review the Board
visited and held a Board meeting
at its manufacturing site in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.
The Chairman ensures through the
Company Secretary that the Board
Agenda and all relevant
information is provided to the
Board sufﬁciently in advance of
meetings. The Chairman and
Company Secretary discuss the
Agenda ahead of every meeting.
At meetings the Chairman ensures
that all directors are able to make
an effective contribution
throughout meetings and every
director is encouraged to
participate and provide opinions
for each Agenda item. The
Chairman always seeks to achieve
unanimous decisions of the Board
following due discussion of
Agenda items. The Schedule of
Reserved Matters details those
matters speciﬁcally reserved for
Board decision. The types of
decision which are reserved for
Board decision relate to matters
which cannot, or the Board
considers should not, be delegated
to the Chief Executive and
executive management. They
include approval of Group
commercial strategy and
succession planning, approval of
Group annual operating and
capital expenditure budgets and
recommendations for payment of
the ﬁnal proposed dividend and
decisions for interim dividends and
dividend policy, approval of the
Annual Report & Accounts and
announcements of ﬁnal and
interim results, ensuring sound
internal control and risk
management, executive director
remuneration, corporate
governance matters including
Board and Committee
performance appraisals and Board
and Committee membership. 
The directors also have powers to
issue and buy back the Company’ s
shares conferred annually by the
shareholders at the AGM. The
Board regularly considers and
discusses future strategy, following
submissions by management, 
at Board meetings and, on
occasion, separate strategy
meetings. The non-executive
directors constructively challenge
and help develop proposals on
strategy at those meetings. The
decisions which are left to
management are all those related
to the successful operation and
management of the Company’ s
business and in implementing the
commercial strategy within the
limits set by the Board annually for
overall operational budgets and
capital expenditure.
The Chairman ensures that
meetings of non-executives
without the executives present are
held. The Company maintains
appropriate directors’ and ofﬁcers’
insurance cover. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
A formal process for performance
evaluation of the Board, its
Committees and individual
directors takes place annually. For
2007 the evaluation took the form
of a questionnaire prepared in
conjunction with external
consultants covering 
a wide range of Board related
matters. JW Matthews, the Senior
Independent non-executive
Director led the performance
evaluation of the Chairman.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee’s ﬁve
members during the year under
review were RC Lockwood (who
chairs the Committee), JW
Matthews, A Walker, IG King and
WH Whiteley. 
Following the appointment of the
third independent non-executive
director, JE Nicholas, the
Nomination Committee now
comprises the three independent
directors, the Chief Executive and
the Chairman. A majority of the
members of the Nomination
Committee are therefore
independent non-executive
directors as accepted by the Code.
The Terms of Reference of the
Nomination Committee can be
accessed on the Company’s
website in the Investors’ section.
A major part of the work of 
the Committee during the year
was to identify and recommend 
to the Board a successor to 
WH Whiteley as Chief Executive.
This task was duly completed
following a comprehensive
internal selection process
conducted by and on behalf of the
Nomination Committee and PI
France was duly recommended by
the Committee to the Board as
the next Chief Executive.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee was, during
the year under review, comprised
of the three independent non-
executive directors, JW Matthews
(Chairman), A Walker and IG King.
JW Matthews will step down 
as Chairman and as a member 
of the Committee on 29 February
2008. JE Nicholas has now joined
the Committee as the third
independent non-executive
director and will be its’ Chairman
from 1 March 2008. The
Committee usually meets three

times a year to review published
ﬁnancial information, the
effectiveness of both external and
internal audit and internal ﬁnancial
and other controls. The Finance
Director, Chief Executive,
Chairman and the external
auditors normally attend meetings
and there is a meeting at least
once a year between the
Committee and the external
auditors at which management 
is not present. 
The matter of auditor
independence is considered by the
Committee. The Auditor does
provide non-audit services. The
Audit Committee has approved 
a written policy for non-audit 
work conducted by the Auditor.
Whenever a non-audit work
instruction (excluding tax advice)
exceeds £10,000 in fee value the
Finance Director must clear the
instruction in advance with the
Audit Committee Chairman. If
non-audit instructions in aggregate
exceed £40,000 in any year then
the excess must be approved on an
item by item basis by the Audit
Committee Chairman. For
signiﬁcant general consulting
projects more than one service
delivery provider is normally
considered. Categories of non-
audit work provided by the Auditor
are set out in note 8. T ax advice
provided by the Auditor
substantially relates to compliance
matters. Within the Audit
Committee’ s T erms of Reference is
a requirement for the Committee
to assess the independence of the
external auditor ensuring key
partners are rotated at appropriate
intervals and to ensure that the
provision of non-audit services does
not impair the external auditor’ s
independence or objectivity. This
assessment was undertaken by the
Committee during the year. The
T erms of Reference of the Audit
Committee are available to view 
on the Company’ s website
www.rotork.com in the 
Investors’ section.
The internal audit function is
undertaken by members of the
Group’s ﬁnance departments who
all have other distinct posts. The
Finance Director is also Head of
Internal Audit. The work
undertaken by the Committee in
discharging its internal control
responsibilities is described under
the Internal Control section above.
During the year the Committee
actively reviews the actions and
judgements of management in
relation to the Group’s ﬁnancial
statements, Business Review,
interim reports and preliminary
announcements before their
submission to the Board with the
Committee’s recommendations 
for approval or otherwise. The
Committee considers the
appointment of the Auditor 
and recommends the audit fees 
to the Board. 
The Committee discusses with the
external auditor before the audit
commences the nature and scope
of the audit and reviews steps
taken by the Auditor to respond to
regulatory requirements.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The work of the Remuneration
Committee is described in the
Remuneration Report on pages 34
to 40. The Chairman and Chief
Executive were invited to and did
attend all meetings but the Chief
Executive was not in attendance
when his own remuneration and
beneﬁts were considered.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Communication with shareholders
is given high priority. All members
of the Board receive copies of all
analysts’ reports of which the
Company is made aware. The
Board receives non-attributable
analyst comments from analyst
meetings and shareholder
meetings after both interim 
and ﬁnal results. The Chief
Executive reports at each Board
meeting upon his meetings with
analysts, fund managers and
shareholders. The Company
Secretary has written on behalf of
the Board to the Company’s major
shareholders offering meetings
with the non-executive directors
and requesting shareholders to
conﬁrm they are content with
current Board level contact with
the Company and communication
to non-executives. The Chairman
attends the preliminary and interim
announcements in London with
the Chief Executive and Finance
Director and is available to meet
fund managers and analysts on
those days.
Individual shareholders have an
opportunity to put questions to
the Chairman at the AGM and
individual shareholder enquiries are
dealt with throughout the year by
the Company Secretary’s
department. For the AGM all proxy
votes are counted and (except in
the event of a poll being called) at
the AGM the balance for and
against the resolution and the
number of abstentions is displayed
for shareholders after it has been
dealt with on a show of hands.
Prior to the AGM the Company
Secretary reports to the Board on
the results of the proxy returns and
on the comments and analysis
undertaken by voting agencies.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
The Company has considered the
guidelines on Social Responsibility
published by the Association of
British Insurers and takes full
account of the signiﬁcance of
environmental and ethical matters
in the conduct of its business and
in its risk assessment processes.
Rotork remains fully committed to
the principles laid down for its
inclusion in the FTSE4Good Index
and the 10 Principles of the UN
Global Compact of which it is 
a signatory.
ENVIRONMENTAL
The Group environmental policy
includes commitments to the
prevention of pollution, compliance
with all relevant legal and other
regulatory requirements and to the
continuous improvement of
environmental performance. The
environmental policy applies to all
manufacturing sites in the Group
worldwide. The complete policy
can be found at www.rotork.com
under ‘Environment’.
The Group’ s 2007 Environmental
Report (‘the Report’) can be
accessed in full at www.rotork.com
under ‘Environment’. Envolve
Partnership (‘Envolve’) were
engaged to provide an
independent assessment of the
Report and this assessment is
included within it. Environmental
performance data is included
within the Report from all Rotork’ s
major sales and service facilities
around the world in addition to
manufacturing sites. The Report
also includes qualitative
information about environmental
improvement programmes,
achievements and initiatives. 
The Group has identiﬁed its key
negative environmental impacts to
include the use of energy, water
and packaging and the disposal of
waste. The Group is continually
developing policies and procedures
on these issues to minimise its
impact on the environment, for
example, the Leeds manufacturing
site recently introduced new waste
recycling systems.
Rotork considers its positive
environmental impacts include its
contribution to sustainable
development and environmental
improvement through the
products and services it sells. 
The Group’s products are used
around the world to operate
industrial valves in all
environments, including those
which are hazardous, and in many
types of industries, including water
puriﬁcation, sewage, food
processing, marine, irrigation,
power generation and oil & gas. 
Rotork products help reduce
human error and thus potential
environmental disasters, whilst
saving energy and resource. 
Rotork is continuing to develop
and produce energy efﬁcient
products with improved
performance.
Wherever possible, new products
and components are marked with
the appropriate EU recycling
symbols or labels. Information has
also been included in product
handbooks about the materials the
products contain and any speciﬁc
advice about disposal.
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM
A major milestone was reached 
in the development of the
environment management system
when the main Bath site achieved
independent veriﬁcation of
compliance with ISO 14001:2004.
Independent assessor Envolve now
annually audits the system. As 
a result of complying with this
standard waste sent to landﬁll
from Bath is reduced substantially.
This reduction is achieved by
minimising waste generation and
by increased recycling especially of
wood and cardboard. The number
of subsidiaries reporting their
environmental data had increased
from 29 to 33 when it was
independently audited by Envolve
for sustainability. Rotork will,
through its Environmental
Management System:
Allocate formal environmental
responsibilities to ensure
compliance with legislation;
Support a culture of
consultation with employees,
key stakeholders and other
interested parties;
Provide environmental
information, guidance and,
where necessary, provide
training that meets best
practice;
Monitor, measure, audit and
seek continuous improvement
in its environmental
performance;
Work with external agencies
and bodies to ensure continued
adoption of best practice
solutions in environmental
management;
Communicate best practice and
publish internal and external
information detailing its aims
and achievements;
Foster open communication
with employees, customers,
suppliers and other
stakeholders via both electronic
publishing and face-to-face
discussion.
Within the 2007 Environmental
Report at www.rotork.com
information and data can be
accessed about how Rotork
managed its key environmental
impacts. The data includes
information on gas and electricity
consumption, CO2 emissions,
water consumption and waste
including recycling of waste.
ETHICS AND VALUES
Rotork is a signatory to the United
Nations Global Compact and its 10
Universal Principles around human
rights, labour, environment, bribery
and corruption. These Principles
are derived from the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,
which the Group supports and the
International Labour Organisation’s
Declaration of Fundamental
Principles and Rights at Work.
Rotork supports all United Nations’
efforts to ensure the effective
abolition of child forced
compulsory labour and will never
use any such labour in any of its
operations worldwide. At Rotork
the rights of every employee are
respected. The Company acts in
ways that ensure all employees are
treated with openness, mutual
trust, dignity and respect. Everyone
working at Rotork will be treated
fairly and without discrimination
on the basis of race, gender,
language or religion. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
Rotork’s Ethics and Values
Statement can be accessed at
Rotork’s website www.rotork.com
under the Investors’ section, 
sub-section ‘Responsibilities and
Ethics’. Additionally, at that part 
of the website, the Rotork ‘Doing
the Right Thing’ document, which
describes some of the beneﬁts
Rotork provides for employees 
and the wider community, can 
be accessed.
SUPPLIERS
Business integrity and fair dealing
is key to the Group’s relationships
with suppliers and contractors.
Many of the Group’s suppliers
have long-term relationships with
the Group. Most key suppliers are
registered to ISO 9000. Supplier
development is ongoing and
involves elements (developed in
the motor industry) of the 
QS 9000 system.
EMPLOYEES
Employees in the UK and many
overseas subsidiary companies
enjoy participation in long
standing Rotork proﬁt sharing and
share schemes.
At the Bath plant, an Employee
Committee sits regularly to 
discuss staff issues and suggests
improvements in working
conditions and practices. All issues
are reviewed by directors and
acted on as appropriate. 
An Equal Opportunities policy is
applied throughout the Group and
in almost all cases, it is nationals
from those countries in which the
Company operates who manage
those companies locally.
Financial support for training and
learning programmes directly
related to employees working roles
are provided. There are two full
time training ofﬁcers at the Bath
site who co-ordinate product
training initiatives for employees
and customers. Four year
apprenticeship programmes
underline the commitment to staff
development for the long-term.
HEALTH & SAFETY
The Group actively promotes the
health, safety and welfare of
employees, site visitors and related
parties and utilises a number of
policies and procedures to ensure
best practice.
During 2007 we continued to roll
out our health & safety audit
programme throughout the 
Group and completed a total of
forty audits, equating to 83% of
our key sites. Our increased focus
has enabled more sites to be
audited and audited to a more
detailed level. We have seen some
signiﬁcant improvements being
achieved particularly within the
manufacturing facilities. Our 
focus on health & safety will
continue and we expect further
improvements across all facilities
during 2008.
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
Rotork considers it important to
contribute and engage positively in
the communities in which it
operates and particularly where it
has substantial sites with relatively
large numbers of employees, for
example its Bath site. Rotork’s
objectives include being a good
community neighbour as well as 
a responsible corporate entity.
For many years Rotork has pursued
a policy of community involvement
through ﬁnancial support and
fostering partnership with local
charitable and voluntary
organisations, trusts and local
support groups. A Charity
Committee made up of employees
at all levels considers local
community charitable and similar
requests at the Bath site. Projects
are then followed through with
visits and reports by employees
and feedback to the Charity
Committee. Sponsorship is also
given to local youth and sporting
clubs and to cultural and social
events. There is also direct
engagement in community issues
for example, providing transport
for charitable events in the area. In
Bath a representative of the
Company sits on a local group
supporting local initiatives for
cultural, social and economic
development. During the year the
Company became a participating
member of an initiative of the
Engineering Development Trust
and will be sponsoring a relevant
project being undertaken by pupils
in the sixth form of a local Bath
school studying science subjects.
Individual employees or groups of
employees also engage in
community activities and the
Charity Committee normally
matches monies raised by
employees who undertake
appropriate charitable events
personally. During the year the
Charity Committee paid the entry
fee for employees participating 
in the Bath half marathon and
matched sponsorship sums raised
by employees for their selected
charities.
The Charity Committee has agreed
to a grant of £35,000 to the
Research Institute for the Care of
the Elderly to provide a Rotork
room in a new research facility
now built at the Royal United
Hospital in Bath. Half of the award
was paid in 2006 as the project
progressed and the balance in
2007. The Rotork room will be 
one of four examination rooms
that will be used on a daily basis
for the Institute’s research projects
and memory clinics. The memory
clinics provide a much valued
service to people in the Bath area.
Like Rotork, the Institute is
committed to research as a means
of progress in ﬁnding solutions to
practical problems. With the aging
of the population, research to
improve the care of older people 
is of growing importance and
Rotork is pleased to be involved
with this initiative.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  REMUNERATION REPORT 
This report is presented to
shareholders by the Board and sets
out the Board’s remuneration
policy and details of the
remuneration of each director.
The Remuneration Committee
(‘the Committee’) of the Board is
currently comprised of three
independent non-executive
directors, A Walker, IG King and 
JE Nicholas. During the year under
review JW Matthews chaired the
Committee until December 2007
when A Walker became Chairman.
The Chairman and Chief Executive
are invited to attend the meetings
of the Committee. The Company
Secretary participates in the
Committee discussions and advises
the Committee. The Committee
makes recommendations as
required to the Board on the
Company’s framework of
executive remuneration and its
costs and determines on the
Board’s behalf the individual
salaries and other terms and
conditions of employment for 
the executive directors and the
Chairman. The Committee
determines the terms of any
discretionary share schemes 
in which executive directors 
may be invited to participate. 
The Committee’s Terms of
Reference are available on the
Company’s website.
During the year the Committee
received salary and remuneration
advice from their appointed adviser,
T owers Perrin, for executive
directors and senior management.
The Chief Executive also provides
comment and recommendations
on the remuneration of the 
other executive directors and 
senior managers. 
For the year under review, the
Board continued to consider that it
was critical that the Company had
remuneration policies that enabled
it to retain, motivate and, when
required, recruit high quality
management. In recommending
the level of remuneration for
executive directors, the Committee
took account of the size and
nature of the Company, including,
in particular, its market
capitalisation, as well as its
international scope and revenue
using data from a number of
sources including Towers Perrin’s
own survey and proprietary data.
The Committee considers it
important that a signiﬁcant
proportion of executive directors’
potential total remuneration is
performance related. This is
demonstrated by the maximum
percentage of basic salary
potentially payable as cash or share
awards under the annual cash
bonus scheme and long-term
incentive plan. The Committee
conﬁrms that Towers Perrin do not
have any other connection with
the Company. For 2008 and
subsequent years the directors’
current intention is to continue
with the remuneration policy
referred to above. 
The Company accepted WH
Whiteley’s request to retire on 
2 May 2008 being some 6 months
ahead of his contractual retirement
age of 60 years. No special
compensation payment becomes
payable on this retirement. 
RE Slater, RH Arnold, GM Ogden
and PI France’s service contracts
are all rolling service contracts with
a one year notice period. For
future executive director
appointments, the Board’s
intention will be to continue to
limit service contracts to one year
on a rolling basis. 
The fees of the non-executive
directors, other than the
Chairman, are determined by a
Board Committee which includes
the Chief Executive and Chairman.
Non-executive directors are offered
engagement agreements of three
years duration, subject to earlier
termination by either party on
three months notice, with no
provision for any compensation
payment on termination.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  None of the executive directors has
any external directorships with the
exception of WH Whiteley, who is
a non-executive director of Dialight
plc (fees for this directorship,
which are £25,000 per annum, are
payable to Rotork p.l.c.), Spirax-
Sarco Engineering plc (fees for this
directorship, which are £46,000
per annum, are payable to Mr.
Whiteley) and is also a director of
the British Valve and Actuator
Manufacturers Association Limited
for which no fee is paid.
The remuneration packages of
each individual director currently
include basic salary, an annual
bonus, beneﬁts in kind (car and
fuel, or car and fuel allowance,
and private medical insurance for
employee only), membership of
the all employee Rotork Share
Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) or Overseas
Proﬁt-Linked Share Scheme
(‘OPLSS’), discretionary Rotork
Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
and participation in a Rotork
Group pension scheme. Further
details of all elements of each
individual director’s remuneration
package are set out elsewhere in
this report. Salary and beneﬁts
including pension and car and fuel,
or car and fuel allowance,
constitute ﬁxed pay.
From 2004 LTIP Awards to
executive directors have been
100% of basic salary being the
maximum level of award under the
plan rules as approved by
shareholders in May 2000.
Following a review by the
Committee, for LTIP Awards from
2006 onwards shareholders
agreed a reduction in the median
vesting percentage of the LTIP to
30% of the Award value. For
previous Awards the scheme pays
40% at median performance. 
A 100% vesting of the Award
remains for performance at or
above the 75th percentile with a
pro-rata vesting scale down to the
median. Additionally, and to bring
the LTIP incentive performance
period in line with market norms,
shareholder approval was obtained
to introduce a three year
performance period for Awards
granted from 2006.
The Committee has recommended
and the Board approved an
executive share retention policy.
The policy supports the
accumulation of signiﬁcant
shareholdings in the Company 
by executive directors and other
senior executives. The policy
requires executive directors to
achieve a minimum holding of
ordinary shares in the Company
equivalent to 50% of their basic
salary. Executives are required to
make use of vesting LTIP shares to
meet this minimum target.
The Committee considered that the
comparator group of companies
continued to be the appropriate
primary measurement of
performance as supported by the
Association of British Insurers in its
latest ‘Principles and Guidelines on
Remuneration’ document.
In 2007 the Committee reviewed
the constituents of the comparator
group and brought in additional
companies to bring the number
back up to twenty for future grants
as the number had reduced to
seventeen. Certain companies were
also replaced with more suitable
companies where the nature of
those companies’ businesses had
changed over time so as to no
longer make them suitable
comparators. The comparator
groups used up to the 2006 grant
and following the review described
above for the 2007 grant and
onwards are set out on page 38.
The Committee has given
consideration to the implications
of the legislative changes to
pensions in the UK which came
fully into effect from April 2006.
The Committee has agreed to pay
reasonable professional fees for
the UK executive directors who will
be affected by these changes to
obtain individual advice. The
Committee has decided, that
potential alternative offers to
current pension provision for
executive directors affected by the
legislative changes referred to
above and who may request such
alternative provision, would only
be considered on the basis that
they do not increase the beneﬁt
cost to the employer.
The Committee approved a revised
annual cash bonus plan from 2005
which rewards increases in proﬁt,
when compared with the average
proﬁt over the three immediately
preceding years. The plan
additionally rewards high levels 
of free cash generation and
growth in earnings per share
together with the achievement 
of budgeted targets. For 2007 the
total annual bonus payment was
capped at 60% of basic salary for
executive directors.
35
ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
For 2007, for the proﬁt element of
bonus, a sum equal to 1% of basic
salary will be paid as bonus for
each 1% by which adjusted proﬁt
exceeds the average adjusted proﬁt
of the three prior years, save that in
any year where growth in proﬁt
equals or exceeds 30% of that
average proﬁt, the proﬁt ﬁgure to
be used in respect of that year as
part of any future year’ s average
proﬁt calculation shall be 130% of
the average proﬁt used to
determine that year’ s bonus, i.e.
the ﬁgure equivalent 
to achieving the proﬁt element
bonus maximum for that year.
Adjustments to proﬁt comprise
exceptional items, non-recurring
proﬁts/losses and excluding interest
receivable/payable. This element 
of bonus pays up to a maximum of
30% of salary. 
The earnings per share (‘EPS’)
element of bonus pays 1% of
basic salary for each 1% growth in
basic EPS to a maximum payment
of 20% of basic salary. Where EPS
growth equals or exceeds 20% in
a year, the EPS ﬁgure equal to
20% growth shall be termed ‘the
EPS maximum’ and the base point
for comparison of the next year’s
EPS bonus shall be the prior year’s
EPS maximum. 
A further maximum 10% of basic
salary is payable as bonus based on
free cash generation as a
percentage of earnings before
interest and tax (‘EBIT’). Free cash
generation being net increase in
cash and cash equivalents,
excluding adjustments for interest
or tax receipts or payments,
acquisitions or disposals of
businesses, cash ﬂows from
ﬁnancing activities or exceptional
cash payments. These cash
adjustments, where relevant, are
disclosed in the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows at page
44. The maximum 10% bonus is
achieved where free cash
generation equals 110% of EBIT .
Up to a maximum 10% of 
basic salary will be payable on
achievement of Group budget
EBIT. This reduces by 1% for each
1% less than budget EBIT is
achieved down to 90% of budget
EBIT from when there is a nil
payment. 
The graph measures the
Company’ s performance against
other companies in the FTSE
Industrial Engineering sector by
showing the total shareholder
return (‘TSR’) on a holding of
ordinary shares in the Company
compared with the average total
shareholder return of other
companies in its sector being the
sector within which the Company
is quoted on the London Stock
Exchange and which is therefore
considered the most appropriate
index over the ﬁve year period to 
31 December 2007.
INTERESTS IN SHARES 
The interests of the directors in the
ordinary share capital of the
Company according to the register
required to be kept by section 325
of the Companies Act 1985, at 
31 December were as follows, see
table below.
All interests were beneﬁcial and
include directors’ directly held and
family share interests and in total
represent less than 1% (2006: less
than 1%) of voting shares of the
Company.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  The Auditor is required to report on the information contained in the following sections of this report:
ROTORK LONG-TERM INCENTIVE
PLANS (‘LTIP’)
Following shareholder approval 
of the LTIP at the Company’s AGM
on 18 May 2000, Awards over
shares were made to executive
directors and senior managers
every year from 2000. Those LTIP
Awards still outstanding at the
time of publication of this report
made to executive directors are set
out on the left.
The LTIP is a performance, 
share or cash unit plan under
which shares or cash units are
conditionally allocated to selected
members of senior management
at the discretion of the Committee
on an annual basis. No shares or
cash units will normally be released
to participants unless they are still
in the Group’s service following
completion of the relevant full
performance period and the
Company’s relative TSR against 
a comparator group of companies
places it in at least the 50th
percentile position in the
comparator group at the end of
the relevant performance period.
TSR measures the change in value
of a share and reinvested dividends
over the period of measurement.
The actual number of shares or
cash units transferred will be
determined by the number of
shares or cash units initially
allocated multiplied by a vesting
percentage which for Awards
granted up to and including the
year 2005 will be 40% at the 
50th percentile rising to 100% at
the 75th percentile with each
percentile position above the 
50th adding 2.4% to the vesting

relevant vesting percentages are
30% at the 50th percentile rising
to 100% at the 75th percentile
with each percentile position
above the 50th adding 2.8% to
the vesting percentage.
The Company’ s EPS is also
monitored during the relevant
performance period to ensure it
meets a minimum average annual
growth equal to the rise in the
Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) plus 2%
per annum. Failure to meet this RPI
plus 2% per annum requirement
will result in nil vesting. The relative
TSR against a comparator group
performance measure was chosen
as it enabled the Committee to
select a comparator group
considered to be sufﬁciently
challenging given the historic
performance of the Company.
The comparator companies used
for the LTIP up to and including
grants in 2006 were:

SHARE AWARDS TO EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS
In common with all eligible
employees, UK based executive
directors receive an entitlement to
ordinary shares under The Rotork
Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) which is

Under the SIP and Rotork Overseas
Proﬁt-Linked Share Scheme
(‘OPLSS’) an aggregate total of up
to 5% of proﬁts are distributed to
employees each year in the form
of ordinary shares. The distribution
is calculated by reference to years
of service and salary subject, for
the SIP , to HMRC limits.
The beneﬁcial interests at 
31 December included ordinary
shares held under the SIP and 
the OPLSS in trust as shown in 
the table above.
Details of total free share Awards
under the SIP and OPLSS and
Awards made to executive
directors in 2007 and the prior
year are set out above.
Free shares awarded to all four UK
executive directors under the SIP
are subject to the HMRC upper
limit of £3,000 by value.
Additionally Mr. Slater and 
Mr. Whiteley have purchased
‘partnership’ shares under the SIP .
Their current SIP partnership 
total holdings are 1,424 ordinary
shares and 784 ordinary shares
respectively.
Mr. Arnold, in common with other
eligible overseas employees,
participates in the OPLSS. The
scheme trustee is based in
Guernsey, Channel Islands. 
The ﬁgure shown for Mr. Arnold
relate solely to OPLSS.
UK based executive directors, in
common with other eligible UK
employees, have the opportunity 
to invest in the Rotork Sharesave
Scheme. RE Slater, GM Ogden and
PI France participate in the Scheme.
Mr. Slater was granted 5,170 share
options on 8 October 2004 at an
option price of £3.196 under the
Scheme, Mr. Ogden was granted
2,964 share options on that date at
the same option price. Mr. France
was granted 3,484 share options on
5 October 2005 at an option price
of £4.62. These options are
exercisable ﬁve years from grant for
Mr. Slater and Mr. France and three

Notes: 
1. The figures shown for the increase in accrued pension over the year
exclude any increase for inflation.
2. The accumulated accrued pension is that which would be paid annually
on retirement from normal pension age, based on service to 
31 December 2007.
3. A lump sum death benefit of 4 times basic annual salary is payable on
death in service.
4. A dependant’s pension of 50% of prospective pension is payable on
death in service, and of 50% of pre-commutation pension on death in
retirement.
5. Post-retirement increases are applied at the rate of increase of the Index
of Retail Prices up to a maximum of 5% per annum, except that for
pension benefits in respect of pensionable service up to 15 May 2000 the
minimum inflationary increase is 4.5% per annum.
6. WH Whiteley was entitled to an immediate pension from age 55 of two-
thirds of his final pensionable salary. He has now passed age 55 and on
his eventual retirement his pension will be uplifted to reflect its later
commencement date.
7. PI France became a Category 3 member in the Scheme on 23 February
2007. As a result his Normal Retirement Age for all benefits was changed
from 65 to 60. PI France’ s benefits include a fixed pension in respect of a
transfer in. This pension has been reduced from £8,539 to £5,123 to
reflect earlier payment from age 60.
8. PI France’s Pensionable Salary used to calculated benefits in the defined
benefit scheme is restricted to a Scheme specific earnings cap which is
currently £112,800. In addition PI France will receive a cash payment of
22.5% of salary above the earnings cap.
9. The figures shown for RH Arnold are in respect of his membership of the
Rotork Controls Inc. pension scheme and a supplemental executive
retirement plan so that, in aggregate, the pension arrangements for 
RH Arnold will provide a pension of at least 60% of uncapped basic 
salary at age 65.

of directors’ contributions (if any).
3. The transfer value of accrued pension for RH Arnold reflects the benefits
provided by the US schemes together with a US valuation of these
benefits and is therefore not directly comparable with the transfer values
for directors in the UK scheme.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF
ROTORK P.L.C.
We have audited the Group 
and parent company ﬁnancial
statements (the ‘ﬁnancial
statements’) of Rotork p.l.c. for the
year ended 31 December 2007
which comprise the Consolidated
Income Statement, the
Consolidated and Parent Company
Balance Sheets, the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows, the
Consolidated Statement of
Recognised Income and Expense
and the related notes. These
ﬁnancial statements have been
prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have
also audited the information in the
Remuneration Report that is
described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the
Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of
the Companies Act 1985. Our
audit work has been undertaken
so that we might state to the
Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for
no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s
members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the
opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES
OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The directors’ responsibilities for
preparing the Annual Report and
the Group ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with applicable law
and International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as
adopted by the European Union,
and for preparing the parent
company ﬁnancial statements and
the Remuneration Report in
accordance with applicable law
and UK Accounting Standards
(United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are
set out in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the
ﬁnancial statements and the part
of the Remuneration Report to be
audited in accordance with relevant
legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to
whether the ﬁnancial statements
give a true and fair view and
whether the ﬁnancial statements
and the part of the Remuneration
Report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985
and, as regards the Group ﬁnancial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation. We also report to you
whether in our opinion the
information given in the Directors’
Report is consistent with the
ﬁnancial statements. The
information given in the Directors’
Report includes that speciﬁc
information presented in the
Business Review that is cross
referred from the Principal activities
section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, 
in our opinion, the Company 
has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if
information speciﬁed by law
regarding directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not
disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate
Governance Statement reﬂects the
Company’s compliance with the
nine provisions of the 2006
Combined Code speciﬁed for our
review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and
we report if it does not. We are
not required to consider whether
the Board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls,
or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures
or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information
contained in the Annual Report
and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited
ﬁnancial statements. We consider
the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with 
the ﬁnancial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to
any other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in
accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the
Remuneration Report to be
audited. It also includes an
assessment of the signiﬁcant
estimates and judgments made 
by the directors in the preparation
of the ﬁnancial statements, and 
of whether the accounting policies
are appropriate to the Group’s 
and company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our
audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations
which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufﬁcient
evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the
Remuneration Report to be
audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of
the presentation of information in
the ﬁnancial statements and the
part of the Remuneration Report
to be audited.
OPINION
In our opinion:
the Group ﬁnancial statements
give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European
Union, of the state of the
Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2007 and of its
proﬁt for the year then ended;
the Group ﬁnancial statements
have been properly prepared in
accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation;
the parent company ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair
view, in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the
state of the parent company’ s
affairs as at 31 December 2007;
the parent company ﬁnancial
statements and the part of the
Remuneration Report to be
audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985; and
the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent
with the ﬁnancial statements.

NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007
Except where indicated, values in these notes are in £000.
Rotork p.l.c. is a Company domiciled in England. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2007 comprise the
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). The accounting policies contained below in note 1 and the disclosure in notes 2 to 27 all
relate to the Group statements. The Company balance sheet can be found following note 27. As the Company has elected to continue reporting under UK
GAAP , the applicable accounting policies are contained in note a, and notes b to k relate to the Company’s financial statements.
1. Accounting policies
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’). 
IFRS 8 – Operating Segments, IFRIC 9 – Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives, IFRIC 10 – Interim Reporting and Impairment, IFRIC 11 – IFRS 2: Group and
Treasury Share Transactions, IFRIC 12 – Service concession arrangements, IFRIC 13 – Customer loyalty programmes and IFRIC 14 – Recognition of a Defined
Benefit Pension Scheme Surplus, together with the amendments to IAS 23, IAS 27, IFRS 2 and IFRS 3 which are adopted by the European Union but not
effective as at 31 December 2007 will be applied in 2008, 2009 or 2010 as applicable. They are not expected to have a material effect on the reported results
or financial position of the Group. 
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention subject to the items referred to in the derivative financial
instruments accounting policy below. The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied by the Group in preparing the 2006 and 2007
financial information within its consolidated financial statements except for the first time application of IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: disclosures, the
complementary amendment to IAS 1 – Presentation and Financial Statements and IFRIC 8 – Scope of IFRS 2. They have not had a material effect on the
reported results or financial position of the Group for 2007 or 2006. The accounting policies have been applied consistently in respect of Group entities.
CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 31 December 2007. The
financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date control ceases.
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains or losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the
consolidated financial statements.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising
on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency
are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at
fair value are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the values were determined.
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at rates of
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to sterling at rates approximating those ruling at
the date of the transactions. Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries, and from the translation of
the results of those subsidiaries at average rate, are recognised directly in equity. 
Any differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity. Translation differences
that arose before the date of transition to IFRS in respect of all foreign entities are not presented as a separate component.
REVENUE
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the
buyer in accordance with the contracted shipping terms. Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of
completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed. No revenue is
recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated completion costs, the possible return of goods or
continuing management involvement with the goods. ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007 46
NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 (CONTINUED)
1. Accounting policies (continued)
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
i) Goodwill
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries. In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents 
the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions would
be recognised directly in the income statement.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP on
transition. The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 has not been reconsidered in
preparing the Group’s opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004. 
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any impairment losses. The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is allocated 
to cash-generating units. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
ii) Research & development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the
income statement as an expense as incurred. Development costs incurred after the point at which the commercial and technical feasibility of the product
have been proven, and the decision to complete the development has been taken and resources made available, are capitalised. The expenditure capitalised
includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Development expenditure has an estimated useful life of 5 years and is written off on a straight-line basis.
iii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The useful life of each of
these assets is assessed based on discussions with the management of the acquired business and takes account of the differing natures of each of the
intangibles acquired. The assessed useful lives of intangibles acquired so far range from 1 year for order back log at acquisition to 15 years for long standing
customer relationships. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Freehold land is not depreciated. Long leasehold buildings are amortised over fifty years or the expected useful life of the building where less than fifty years.
Other assets are depreciated by equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates:
Freehold buildings 2% to 4%
Short leasehold buildings period of lease
Plant and equipment 10% to 33%
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation. Certain items of property that had been revalued to
fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of
that revaluation.
LEASES
Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements, which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased
and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases. Assets acquired under finance leases are initially recognised
at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and
liability, which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding lease obligations. Costs in respect of operating
leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in arriving at the operating profit.
TAXATION
Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates
to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not
deductible for tax purposes and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits. The amount of deferred tax
provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007 47
1. Accounting policies (continued)
INVENTORY AND WORK IN PROGRESS
Inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost, on a ‘first in, first out’ basis, and net realisable value. In respect of work in progress and 
finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses which are required to bring inventories
to their present location and condition. The net realisable value in respect of old and slow moving inventory is assessed by reference to historic usage patterns
and forecast future usage.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term (with an original maturity less than three months) deposits. Bank overdrafts that are
repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.
EQUITY
Equity comprises issued equity capital, share premium, reserves and retained earnings.
When issued equity capital is repurchased, the amount paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. Repurchased shares 
are debited direct to equity and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
PROVISIONS
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty cost data, known
issues and management expectations of future costs.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
i) Pension plans
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes and contributes to these schemes in accordance with qualified actuaries’
recommendations. All actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were recognised. In respect of all actuarial gains and
losses that arise after that date in calculating the Group’s obligation in respect of the plan, these are recognised in equity. Interest on pension scheme liabilities
has been recognised within financing expenses and the expected return on scheme assets within financing income in the consolidated income statement. 
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. The costs for these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
ii) Share-based payment transactions
The Rotork Share Option Scheme allows certain employees to acquire shares in Rotork p.l.c. This scheme is now closed and the last grant of new options 
took place in 2004. Details of the scheme are given in note 19. The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding
increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the
options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options
were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only 
to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The Rotork Sharesave Plan, introduced in 2004, offers certain employees the opportunity to purchase shares in Rotork p.l.c. at a discounted price compared
with the market price at the time of grant. Details of the scheme are given in note 19. The fair value of the right/option is recognised as an employee expense
with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period between grant and maturity. The right/option
reaches maturity when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled. The fair value of the grant is measured using a Black-Scholes model, taking into
account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of
share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The Rotork Long-Term Incentive Plan grants awards of shares to executive directors and senior managers. These awards may vest after a period of three or
four years dependent upon both market and non-market performance conditions being met. Details of the grants are given in note 19. This plan gives share
awards or cash awards (of equivalent value to the share awards) dependent upon the employee’s country of residence at date of grant. The fair value of the
award is measured at grant date, using a Monte Carlo simulation model which takes into account the market based performance criteria, and spread over
the vesting period. The fair value of the award is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity for the share settled award and
a provision within employee benefits for the cash settled award. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to exclude options that do not vest as a
result of non-market performance conditions not being met. In the case of the cash awards, the liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date and at
settlement date and any changes in fair value recognised in the income statement, spread equally over the vesting period.
All grants under these schemes made after 7 November 2002 have been accounted for under IFRS 2. Those made before this date are accounted for under
UK GAAP and any accruals in respect of these schemes are held in employee benefits. ANNUAL REPORT

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 (CONTINUED)
1. Accounting policies (continued)
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
iii) Long-term service leave
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service leave is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the
current and prior periods.
iv) Other employee incentive schemes
In addition to the above schemes the Group offers a number of other bonus and incentive schemes to employees around the world. The costs of these
schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred. This includes the Share Incentive Plan and Overseas Profit Linked Share Scheme both of which
are a known liability at the year end.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and financing activities. These are the
only form of derivative financial instruments used by the Group. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue forward exchange
contracts for trading purposes. However, forward contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at cost and then subsequently re-measured at fair value. Where a forward exchange contract is
designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised liability, a firm commitment or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective
part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity. Any effective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in
the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately. 
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction still is expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point
remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take
place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss held in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately. 
DIVIDENDS
Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when they are paid. Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period which
they are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies the Board has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the
amounts recognised in the financial statements.
i) Impairment of Goodwill
Determining whether Goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of CGUs to which Goodwill has been allocated. The value in use
calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to
calculate present values. Details of the estimates and judgements in respect of the current year are in note 11.
ii) Deﬁned Beneﬁt Pension Scheme Liabilities
Determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation requires judgement in respect of the assumptions used to calculate present values. These
include future mortality, discount rate, inflation and salary increases. Management makes these judgements in consultation with an independent actuary.
Details of the estimates and judgements in respect of the current year are in note 19. ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007 49
2. Analysis of revenue, profit and net assets
The primary format used for segmental reporting is by business segment as this reflects the internal management structure and reporting of the Group.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated
expenses comprise corporate expenses and unallocated assets and liabilities comprise cash, borrowings, tax assets and liabilities respectively. Intra group
trading is determined on an arm’s length basis.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Group comprises the following business segments:
Controls – the design, manufacture and sale of electric valve actuators
Fluid Systems – the design, manufacture and sale of heavy duty pneumatic and hydraulic valve actuators
Gears – the design, manufacture and sale of gearboxes, adaption and ancillaries for the valve industry
GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS
Rotork has a worldwide presence in all three business segments through its subsidiary selling offices and through an agency network. A full list of locations
can be found at www.rotork.com.

3. Acquisition of subsidiaries
On 13 January 2006 Rotork Italia Srl acquired all of the business and assets of Omag Snc when it acquired a newly set up company for up to £1,061,000.
£924,000 was paid on completion and a further £137,000 was paid during 2006. The company manufactures and sells heavy duty quarter-turn and multi-
turn gearboxes. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of consolidation. In the 11 months to 31 December 2006 the subsidiary
contributed £2,439,000 to Group revenue and £320,000 to the consolidated net profit for the year before the £71,000 amortisation of intangible charge.
Goodwill has arisen on this acquisition as a result of the value attributed to staff expertise and the assembled workforce which did not meet the recognition
criteria for an intangible asset and post acquisition synergies within the Gears division. Due to a lack of reliable information for the part month prior to
acquiring the assets, full year proforma financial results are not given in these financial statements although they would not be expected to differ significantly
from the results post acquisition.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities.

A tax credit of £577,000 (2006: £551,000) in respect of share based payments has been recognised directly in equity in the year.
The Group continues to expect its effective rate of corporation tax to be slightly higher than the standard UK rate due to higher rates of tax in the US,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and India.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries. Rotork p.l.c. controls the dividend policies
of its subsidiaries and subsequently the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences. It is not practical to quantify the unprovided temporary differences
as acknowledged within paragraph 40 of IAS 12. ANNUAL REPORT

IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR GOODWILL
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (‘CGUs’) identified according to business segment. A segment level summary of goodwill allocation
is presented below.
2007 2006
Controls 5,839 5,717
Fluid Systems 8,513 8,102
Gears 7,175 7,128
21,527 20,947
The recoverable amounts of all CGUs are based on value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections and are based on actual operating
results and the latest Group three year plan. The three year plan is based on management’ s view of the future and experience of past performance. Cash flows
for the remainder of the next twenty years are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which reflects the long-term nature of many of the markets the Group
serves. This rate has been consistently bettered in the past so is believed to represent a prudent estimate. A pre-tax discount rate of 9%, being the Group’ s
weighted average cost of capital, has been used in discounting the projected cash flows. On this basis no impairment write downs are required. ANNUAL REPORT

A deferred tax asset of £6,614,000 (2006: £5,739,000) has been recognised at 31 December 2007. This asset principally relates to other temporary
differences in the defined benefit pension schemes. The directors are of the opinion, based on recent and forecast trading, that the level of profits in the
current and future years make it more likely than not that the asset will be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items:
2007 2006
Tax losses 2,254 2,915
Tax credits 494 326
2,748 3,241
A deferred tax asset of £2,748,000 (2006: £3,241,000) has not been recognised in relation to capital losses and certain tax credits, tax losses and other
temporary differences. These assets may be recovered if sufficient taxable or capital profits are made in future in the companies concerned.

17. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
Earnings per share is calculated for both the current and previous years using the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders for the year. The earnings per
share calculation is based on 86.1m shares (2006: 86.1m shares) being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (net of own ordinary shares
held) for the year.

Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the year ended 31 December 86,146 86,101
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the ordinary shareholders and 86.9m shares (2006: 86.9m shares). The number of
shares is equal to the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (net of own ordinary shares held) adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially
dilutive ordinary shares. The Company has three categories of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees under the Share
option scheme and Sharesave plan where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and
contingently issuable shares awarded under the Long-term incentive plan.

The individual return assumptions for each asset class are based on market conditions at 31 December 2007 and represent a best estimate of future returns
for that class allowing for risk premiums where appropriate. The Group estimates that contributions to the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes payable
during 2008 will be approximately £2,300,000.
The mortality assumptions used are the PNXA00 year of birth tables with future improvements in mortality based on the CMI medium cohort projections
subject to a minimum improvement of 1.5% per annum (2006: PA92 c2004 with an adjustment to the discount rate of -0.1% per annum to allow for future
improvements in mortality).
By way of example the respective mortality tables indicate the following life expectancy:

Defined contribution pension liabilities
The Group makes a contribution to a number of defined contribution plans around the world to provide benefits for employees upon retirement. Total
expense relating to these plans in the year was £1,030,000 (2006: £1,135,000). 
(ii) SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
Volatility assumptions for equity based payments
The expected volatility of all equity compensation benefits is based on the historic volatility (calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of each
benefit), adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
a) Share option scheme
At 1 January 1995 the Group established a share option programme for employees. The allocation of options was linked to the completion of 5 years service.
In accordance with the programme, once vested the options grant the right to purchase shares at the market price they were at the date of grant. Exercise
prices range from 278p to 387p. Options vest after three years and expire ten years after being granted.
Only the 2003 and 2004 grants occurred after 7 November 2002, the start date for recognition under IFRS 2. Therefore only charges in respect of these
grants have been made to the accounts in accordance with IFRS 2 and the relevant disclosures made below. Additionally, four share option arrangements
granted before 7 November 2002 exist. The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to these grants in accordance with the
transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.

b) Sharesave plan
Following shareholder approval of the Sharesave plan at the Company’s Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) on 18 May 2000, the first offer was made to
employees in 2004. 
UK employees are invited to join the Sharesave plan when an offer is made each year. All the offers to date were made at a 20% discount to market price at
the time. There are no performance criteria for the Sharesave plan. Employees are given the option of joining either the 3 year plan or the 5 year plan.

c) Long-term incentive plan
The Long-term incentive plan (‘LTIP’) is a performance share or cash unit plan under which shares or cash units are conditionally allocated to selected
members of senior management at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis. No shares or cash units will normally be released to
participants unless they are still in the Group’s service following completion of four year performance periods for awards made up to and including 2005 and
the Company’s relative total shareholder return (‘TSR’) against a comparator group of companies places it in at least the 50th percentile position in the
comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period. The performance period for 2006 and future awards under the plan has been reduced to
three years. TSR measures the change in value of a share and reinvested dividends over the period of measurement. The actual number of shares or cash units
transferred will be determined by the number of shares or cash units initially allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage. For the awards made up to and
including 2005 this will be 40% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile with each percentile position above the 50th adding 2.4% to
the vesting percentage. From the 2006 award onwards, the actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be 30% at the 50th percentile rising to
100% at the 75th percentile with each percentile position above the 50th adding 2.8% to the vesting percentage. The Company’s earnings per share is also
monitored during the relevant performance period to ensure it meets a minimum average annual growth equal to the rise in the Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) plus
2% per annum. Failure to meet the RPI requirement will result in nil vesting.
Following shareholder approval of the LTIP at the Company’s AGM on 18 May 2000, awards over shares were made to executive directors and senior
managers in each year from 2000 to 2007. 
The performance period for the 2003 award ended at 31 December 2006. Messrs. Hewitt Bacon and Woodrow as independent actuaries have certified to
the Remuneration Committee that there was a 100% vesting of this award as the Company’s position relative to the comparator group at the end of the
relevant performance period was on the 88th percentile position and the Group’s earnings per share growth has exceeded the minimum average annual
growth in the RPI plus 2% per annum. The awards vested during 2007.
The performance period for the 2004 award ended at 31 December 2007. Messrs. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent actuaries have certified to
the Remuneration Committee that there was a 100% vesting of this award as the Company’s position relative to the comparator group at the end of the
relevant performance period was above the 75th percentile and the Group’s earnings per share growth has exceeded the minimum average annual growth in
the RPI plus 2% per annum. The awards will vest during 2008.

The warranty provision is based on estimates made from historical warranty data associated with similar products and services. The provision relates mainly to
products sold during the last twelve months, the typical warranty period is now eighteen months.
The deferred consideration arose on the acquisition of PC Intertechnik during 2005. The penultimate tranche was settled in 2007 resulting in a payment to
the vendor of £8,000 and a release of the provision of £321,000 (see Goodwill – note 11). Payment or release of the final tranche of this provision is still
subject to negotiation and is expected to be settled in 2008. ANNUAL REPORT

22. Financial instruments
Financial risk and treasury policies
The treasury department maintains liquidity, manages relations with the Group’s bankers, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk and provides a
treasury service to the Group’s businesses. Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying
business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of foreign exchange and interest rate risk. The Group treasury department is not 
a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure. Exposures resulting from
sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged by the use of forward exchange contracts.
(i) CREDIT RISK
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises
principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and monies on deposit with financial institutions. 
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is both monitored on an ongoing basis and reduced through the use of credit insurance
covering 60-75% of trade receivables at any time. Credit evaluations are carried out on all customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying
approval levels set above this depending on the value of the sale. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of non-insured receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:

44,870 (608) 37,933 (548)
(ii) LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to
ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without
incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group is highly cash generative, and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on investments. Typically
the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses, but it maintains a £2m overdraft facility on which interest
would be payable at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. 
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements:

(iii) MARKET RISKS
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s results. The objective of market risk
management is to manage and control market risk within suitable parameters.
a) Currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than sterling. The currencies giving rise to this
risk primarily are US dollar and related currencies and the euro. The Group hedges up to 80% of forecast US dollar or euro foreign currency exposures using
forward exchange contracts. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than sterling, the Group ensures that the net exposure
is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value. The net fair value 
of forward exchange contracts used as hedges at 31 December 2007 was a £544,000 liability (2006: £290,000 asset) comprising an asset of £95,000 
(2006: £291,000) and a liability of £639,000 (2006: £1,000). 
Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge
accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
All forward exchange contracts in place at 31 December 2007 mature within one year.
The Group entered into a currency swap in February 2005 when 19.0m was borrowed to finance the acquisition of PC Intertechnik, linked to a deposit 
of £6.2m, at an exchange rate of 11.444/£1.000. The 19m was paid to Rotork Controls (Deutschland) GmbH in a form of redeemable equity as this 
company purchased the assets of PC Intertechnik. This swap was entered into to protect the Group from currency movements on the repayment of equity
from Germany.
Sensitivity analysis
It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal (in particular other exchange rates), a general change of one cent in the value of the US dollar against
sterling would have had a £200,000 impact on the Group’s profit before tax and a one euro cent movement against sterling would have had a £200,000
impact on the Group’s profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2007. The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves
assessing the transaction impact of US dollar and euro cash flows and the translation impact of US dollar and euro profits.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year:
AVERAGE RATE CLOSING RATE
2007 2006 2007 2006
US dollar 2.01 1.84 1.99 1.96
Euro 1.45 1.47 1.36 1.48
b) Interest rate risk
The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area. All foreign currency cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and where rates are
fixed the period of the fix is generally no more than 1 month. The main element of interest rate risk concerns sterling deposits which are made on a floating
LIBOR based rate and short-term overdrafts in foreign currencies which are also on a floating rate.
The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank loans/overdrafts bearing interest rates fixed by reference to the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial liabilities is 3.9% per annum.
The weighted average period for which interest rates on the fixed rate financial liabilities are fixed is one year.
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows:
2007 2006
In one year or less 118 589
In more than one year but not more than two years 98 68
In more than two years but not more than five years 66 66

Financial assets 24,058 20,435
Financial liabilities (228) (295)
23,830 20,140
All foreign currency cash deposits are held on fixed rates of interest in the UK. All other cash amounts are on floating rates or overnight rates based on the
relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
(iv) CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders
and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue
new shares.
The Group’s net funds at the balance sheet date were:
2007 2006
Total borrowings (327) (706)
Cash and cash equivalents (note 15) 38,253 28,398

* As the elements of the currency swap can legally be offset, although the values of the loan and deposit are shown above they have been offset in the consolidated balance sheet.
The forward exchange contracts are designated hedges, the assets are held at fair value through profit and loss and the liabilities at amortised cost.
Basis for determining fair values
The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table above.
Derivatives
Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end spot rates adjusted for the forward points to the contract’s value date, and gains and losses taken to
equity. No contract’s value date is greater than one year from the year end.
Secured loans
As the loans have a flexible repayment schedule, and may be paid down in less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect 
the fair value.
Trade and other receivables/payables
As the majority of receivables/payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value. ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007 72

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007
a. Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently (except for the adoption of FRS 29 – Financial Instruments – disclosure) in dealing with items
which are considered material in relation to the financial statements. Notes a to k relate to the Company rather than the Group.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting
standards. Under section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account. Under
FRS 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the Group includes the Company in its own
published consolidated financial statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 and has not disclosed transactions with entities which are subsidiaries of the Group.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers
these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until
such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee. The Company continues to account for intra-
group cross guarantees under FRS 12.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit
and loss account.
Investments
Investments are measured at cost less any provision for impairment and adjusted where equity settled share based payments are made to the subsidiary
company’s employees. They comprise investments in subsidiary companies.
Depreciation and amortisation
Freehold land is not depreciated. Long leasehold buildings are amortised over fifty years or the expected useful life of the building where less than fifty years.
Other assets are depreciated by equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates:
Freehold buildings 2% to 4%
Short leasehold buildings period of lease
Plant and equipment 10% to 33%
Post retirement beneﬁts
The Company participates in a Group wide pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. The assets of the scheme are held separately
from those of the Company. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable
basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17 Retirement benefits, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount
charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Classiﬁcation of preference shares
Following the adoption of the presentation elements of FRS 25, Financial instruments, the cumulative redeemable preference shares issued by the Company
are classified as long-term debt. The preference dividends are charged within interest payable.
Share based payments
The Company has adopted FRS 20 and the accounting policies followed are in all material respects the same as the Group’s policy under IFRS 2. This policy is
shown in note 1 to the Group financial statements.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full, without discounting, on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to
pay less tax, at a future date at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law, except for the items explained below. Timing
differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in
the financial statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell
the assets or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit those earnings. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent
that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when they are paid. Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period which
they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007 75
b. Personnel expenses in the Company Profit and Loss Account
2007 2006
Wages and salaries (including bonus and incentive plans) 1,662 719
Social security costs 194 60
Pension costs 138 434
Share based payments 209 127
2,203 1,340
There are 4 (2006: 4) employees of Rotork p.l.c. plus the 5 (2006: 5) executive directors. The personnel costs accounted for within the Company include the
full costs of the employees but not the full costs of the executive directors. Half of the salary costs, bonus and benefits of the Group Chief Executive, Group
Chief Operating Officer and Group Finance Director are reported within the Company but the balance of their costs and those of the other two executive
directors are reported within the subsidiary where they are based as this approximates the basis on which their time is split.

37,730 37,695
A deferred tax asset of £77,000 (2006: £36,000) has been recognised. This asset principally relates to other timing differences. The directors are of the
opinion, based on recent and forecast trading that the level of future and current profits make it more likely than not that the asset will be recovered.

failing to fulfil its contractual obligations.
k. Capital risk management in the Company
The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for

issue new shares.

The above ten year history has not been restated to apply IFRS to all periods. Had this exercise been undertaken the major changes would have been the
removal of amortisation of goodwill and the introduction of amortisation of separable intangibles, capitalisation and amortisation of development costs and
charges for share based payments. Dividends shown in the IFRS columns are on a paid basis but in the UK GAAP columns are on an accrued basis. ANNUAL REPORT

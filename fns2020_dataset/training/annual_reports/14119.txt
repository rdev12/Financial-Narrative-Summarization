Chairman’s statement
jOh N DODDS, CHairman
against the backdrop of a continued challenging  
u K trading environment i am very pleased with  
the Company’s results for the year and with  
its progress and direction. 
Overview
t he year to 31 December 2011 was my 
first full year as a Director with severfield–
rowen and included my appointment to 
the role of Chairman in september 2011.
against the backdrop of a continued 
challenging u K trading environment i am 
very pleased with the Company’s results for 
the year and with its progress and direction. 
Our u K companies are market leaders in 
their respective fields and they work 
vigorously, individually and collectively, to 
sustain the Group’s key competitive 
advantages.
t he Group’s view is that the u K market 
conditions over the coming years will 
remain lacklustre contrasting markedly with 
the increasing and exciting prospects for 
our joint venture company in india.
Results
t he Group has made an underlying 
operating profit of £11.7m (2010: £16.2m) 
on revenue of £267.8m (2010: £266.7m). 
Group profit after tax is £5.8m (2010: 
£7.6m) with basic earnings per share of 
6.52p (2010: 8.58p), both reflecting the 
impact of non-underlying items.
Dividend
Our u K markets remain challenging and 
consequently the Group continues to adopt 
a cautious dividend policy. We recommend 
a final dividend of 3.50p, giving 5.00p for 
the full year (2010: 7.50p) which is 1.6 
times covered by underlying earnings per 
share.
Board Changes
as we announced at the time of our interim 
results in august 2011, i was appointed 
Chairman on 1 september 2011 in 
succession to t oby Hayward, who remains a 
non-executive Director and Chairman of 
the Group’s audit Committee.
earlier in February 2011 Derek randall, 
executive Director for Business 
Development and international including 
JsW severfield structures Ltd in india, 
joined the Group’s Board.
Jonathan rhodes was appointed as 
Company secretary in June 2011.
We were pleased that Chris Holt, formerly 
Chief executive of mJ Gleeson Financial Plc, 
joined us as a non-executive Director of the 
Group in november 2011, succeeding 
David ridley who left his role after nine 
years of valued service.
in response to new and emerging 
opportunities, we continue to review the 
operation of the Board in order to provide 
the Group with the appropriate level of 
support as the shape and scale of the 
business changes.
Our People
Our management teams and employees 
continue to operate very well in challenging 
market conditions, which have now been in 
occurrence for a number of years. t he 
expertise, experience and dedication of our 
people is a major asset of the business and, 
on behalf of the Board, i would like to thank 
them all for their continued support.
During a visit to JsW severfield structures 
Ltd in india in February this year, i was able 
to see the outcome of our joint efforts which 
has resulted in an effective and highly 
motivated team of management and 
employees working in a modern and safe 
environment.
Outlook
notwithstanding the prevailing u K market 
conditions, the Board is confident that the 
business has the talent, ambition and 
resource to achieve its strategic objectives 
both at home and abroad and i am very 
optimistic for its future. 17 OUR BUSINESS 17

Chief executive’s review
TOM hAUG h Ey, CH ieF exeCuti Ve OFFiCer
in 2011 the u K structural steel sector endured a 
further year of slow demand and tough trading 
conditions. against this background we were 
conditioned and prepared for the market and have 
produced resilient results and performance. 
UK Overview
in 2011 the u K structural steel sector 
endured a further year of slow demand and 
tough trading conditions, which was 
exacerbated by diminishing confidence 
levels for business prospects in 2012 as a 
result of the economic environment.
against this background we were 
conditioned and prepared for the market 
and have produced resilient results and 
performance. encouragingly, our u K 
businesses entered 2012 with a strong 
order book of good quality contracts having 
now successfully executed all of our 
Olympic related work.
While there is little evidence of imminent u K 
recovery, either in the broad economy or 
the overall construction industry, we are 
confident that our capabilities, focus and 
relative financial strength will in the 
meanwhile sustain creditable results and 
enhance our competitive position.
Order Book
t he u K order book at £221m (march 
2012) is similar to the order book 12 
months previously (march 2011 £226m), 
which contained Olympic related structures. 
t he current order book contains a broad 
quality mix of London Commercial Offices, 
industrial, Warehousing, Waste to energy 
projects, t ransport including airports, 
education and Leisure.
t he prospective u K projects which we have 
identified as appropriate opportunities for 
the Group total some £510m and gives us 
confidence for the remainder of 2012 and 
beyond.
Costs
Costs within the business continued to be 
managed tightly and are under constant 
review, aided by the Group’s new financial 
software and revised authority limits at all 
levels. Procurement related initiatives 
launched in 2011 are translating into 
benefits for 2012.
Prices and Margins
Prices remain generally tight in the u K 
market as surviving competitors seek to 
obtain a share of a smaller market.
t he Group is pleased with its margin 
achievements of 5.3% against a tough 
backdrop and anticipates that margins will 
remain stable in 2012.
Projects
some of the notable projects during 2011 
include those from the predicted key sectors 
of t ransport/a viation, Commercial Offices, 
industrial, Distribution and Power/energy.

Business Investment
u K investment was largely restricted to 
essential replacement and new financial 
systems. t he Company continues to invest in 
health and safety training and initiatives, both 
in our factories and for our project sites.
India
in the relatively short time since the plant in 
india was opened in november 2010 we 
have now clearly established strong 
foundations for a successful business 
capable of significant growth.
t he order mix in 2010 was reflective of our 
entry into a new market with a new offering 
and a steep learning curve with some 
complex work, which contributed to lower 
productivity and higher start-up losses than 
planned.
t he indian order book at £43m (march 
2012) covers almost all of our production 
plans for 2012 and is strong in terms of 
quality and importantly product mix. t he 
reduction in the size of the order book 
since november 2011 (£61m) is largely the 
result of a single contract cancellation which 
failed to conclude its project financing. t he 
pipeline of potential orders continues to 
grow with some £80m of good 
opportunities being identified.
as a result of these positive developments, 
we are now in a position to consider 
extending our production capacity in india 
and will be evaluating this further during the 
course of the first half of this financial year.

Corporate Social Responsibility
in our 2010 statement we outlined our 
intention to proactively implement our 
strategy for continuous improvement 
through our steel Futures programme.
in 2011 we have been pleased with the 
significant progress that has been made 
across all of our operating companies.
some highlights of progress are:
X X roll-out of the i Os H Directing safely to 
38 Operational Directors within the 
Group to help underpin the desired 
leadership behaviours.
X X t he roll-out of our Behavioural safety 
strategy through an innovative 
theatre-based learning programme. 
Working with our external consultants, 
the Group has engaged in excess of 
800 direct employees and subcontract 
supply chain.
X X t he implementation and communication 
of our Golden rules to help drive 
improved standards across all

responsible sourcing of materials.
We also have an ambitious plan for 2012 
and we expect to see further momentum as 
we continue our journey to be recognised 
as industry leaders.
Summary and Outlook
Given the uncertain economic outlook, the 
u K market is likely to remain extremely 
challenging. it is likely that more companies 
in our sector will exit their positions as 
pressures remain on their volumes, costs 
and cash. Overall, however, we believe that 
it is unlikely that the balance of supply and 
demand in the u K will worsen.
significant opportunities are evident for 
severfield–rowen Plc in several important 
sectors, including t ransport/a viation,  
Power/ energy, industrial, Commercial and 
others where the Group is well positioned to 
challenge and compete.
in india our joint venture is well established 
and has made progress in terms of 
operational outputs and market presence. in 
2012 we anticipate a positive return on our 
investment and will seek to grow our scale 
of operations further.
Overall the Group continues to perform  
in line with the Board’s expectations despite 
the challenging conditions in the u K, and 
we are encouraged by the competitive 
position of the business.

Financial review
Al AN DUNSMORE, FinanCia L DireC t Or
t he Group’s results for 2011 reflect a steady 
performance in a trading environment which remains 
very challenging. underlying operating margins 
(before results of associates) have compressed as 
expected to 5.3% but the order book remains strong 
and the Group continues to operate at its current 
operating capacity.
Overview
t he Group’s results for 2011 reflect a steady 
performance in a trading environment 
which remains very challenging. underlying 
operating margins (before results of 
associates) have compressed as expected to 
5.3% but the order book remains strong 
and the Group continues to operate at its 
current operating capacity.
2011 represented the first full year of 
operations at the Group’s indian joint 
venture business. it was very much a year of 
establishing commercial and production 
foundations and the loss of £2.5m reflects 
this. t hese foundations have now been 
established providing the basis for a more 
positive performance in future.
as expected, debt levels increased during the 
year and continue to be managed very closely 
in the current difficult trading environment. 
t his is supported by the new bank facility 
which was agreed in november 2011.
Revenue and Operating Profit
revenue of £267.8m was flat year on year 
(2010: £266.7m). t his reflects stable 
production volumes in the year along with 
relative stability in underlying steel prices.
t he underlying operating profit before 
results of associates of £14.2m was 14% 
down on prior year (2010: £16.6m), 
reflecting the expected operating margin 
compression from 6.2% to 5.3%. although 
overall pricing stabilised during the year, 
margins remain tight and there are still 
examples of uneconomic pricing from 
competitors.
Share of losses of Associate 
Companies
t he Group’s share of losses from its indian 
joint venture was £2.5m for the year (2010: 
£0.4m underlying). t his has been generated 
from the first full year of operation at the 
business. t he results reflect a gradual 
increase of production during the year but 
at levels which, for most of the year, were 
below the required break-even position. 
although the order book developed very 
well during the year, a number of customer 
driven contractual delays were experienced 
which, as well as impacting the production 
ramp-up, also impacted the extent to which 
profit could be accounted for on some of 
the larger contracts. t he position achieved at 
year end however, provides a better 
platform for a more positive contribution 
from the joint venture during 2012.
finance Costs
net finance costs for the Group amounted 
to £1.6m (2010: £0.9m). t his reflects 
higher prevailing debt levels throughout the 
year, along with some costs relating to the 
refinancing of the Group’s bank facilities in 
november 2011.
Non-underlying Items
non-underlying items reduced the profit 
before tax for the year by £3.3m (2010: 
£4.2m) and include the following:
X X Amortisation of acquired intangibles — 
£2.7m (2010: £2.7m).
X X Legal costs and provision movements 
— £0.6m (2010: £2.0m gain). During 
the year, some litigation involving the 
Group expanded in scope resulting in 
additional costs of £0.6m. a provision 
for future costs of £0.6m is also being 
retained.
X X share of pre-operating losses of indian 
joint venture — nil (2010: £1.4m).
X X impairment in valuation of investment 
Property — nil (2010: £2.1m). 23 OUR BUSINESS 23

Taxation
t he underlying tax charge of £2.9m 
represents an effective rate of 23.2% (on 
applicable profit which excludes results of 
associates) compared with 26.6% in the 
previous year. t his reflected a benefit from the 
satisfactory conclusion of some outstanding 
matters relating to previous years.
t he total tax charge for the year was £1.0m 
which represents an effective tax rate of 
10.3% (on applicable profit which excludes 
results of associates). t his includes the 
additional deferred tax benefit from the 
reduction in u K corporation tax to 25%. 
t his is categorised as non-underlying and is 
included in other items.
Earnings per Share
underlying basic earnings per share was at 
8.05p, a decrease of 36% over the previous 
year. t his calculation is based on the 
underlying profit after tax of £7.2m and 
89,251,076 shares, being the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during 
the year.
Basic earnings per share, based on profit 
after tax after non-underlying items is 6.52p 
(2010: 8.58p). For 2011, there is no 
difference between basic and diluted 
earnings per share (2010: no difference).

Dividend
t he Board recommends a final dividend of 
3.50p payable on 21 June 2012 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 25 may 2012. t his will give a 
total dividend for the year of 5.00p.
Balance Sheet
shareholders’ funds increased during the 
year from £130.9m to £132.3m. t his 
equates to a total equity value per share at 
31 December 2011 of 148.2p, compared 
with 146.7p at the end of 2010.
Goodwill on the Balance sheet is valued at 
£54.7m (2010: £54.7m) and is subject to an 
annual impairment review under iFrs 3. no 
impairment existed at either 31 December 
2011 or 2010.
Other intangible assets on the Balance sheet 
are valued at £18.2m (2010: £20.5m). t his 
represents the net book value of the intangible 
assets identified on the acquisition of Fisher 
engineering in 2007, along with new software 
assets installed during 2011. t he amortisation 
charged in the year was £2.7m (2010: 
£2.7m), giving a total amortised at the 
year-end of £21.3m (2010: £18.5m).
t he Group has property, plant and 
equipment and investment property totalling 
£83.6m (2010: £86.9m). Depreciation 
charged in the year amounted to £4.5m 
(2010: £4.5m). Capital expenditure in the 
year was £2.1m (2010: £3.0m). t his 
included investment in new financial systems 
and in value-add equipment for the Light 
steel Division and plate profiling capability.
During the year, the Group invested £0.1m 
(2010: £2.9m) as equity into the joint 
venture company in india.
t he Group’s capital expenditure in 2012 in 
the u K is not expected to be more than £3m.
t he Group’s atlas Ward subsidiary has a 
defined benefit pension scheme which, 
although closed to new members, had an 
ias 19 deficit of £8.5m as at 31 December 
2010. at 31 December 2011, the deficit 
increased to £9.6m and is shown as a 
liability in the Group Balance sheet. t he 
increase in the deficit is as a result of the 
changes in the assumptions made, including 
a reduction in corporate bond yields and an 
increase in mortality rates, partly offset by 
higher than expected returns on the 
scheme’s assets.
Cash flow
t here was an increase in net debt during 
the year of £16.3m to leave the year-end 
position at £31.3m (2010: £15.0m). t his 
movement includes a cash outflow from 
operating activities of £9.0m, and also 
includes dividends of £3.6m, investment in 
capital expenditure of £2.1m, and £3.7m of 
corporation tax payments. an increase in the 
overall level of net debt was expected, but 
the outflow from operating activities was 
higher than expected, driven by the contract 
mix and phasing at the year-end, coupled 
with greater tightness in customer 
settlements. We expect the effects of the 
contract mix and phasing to start unwinding 
over the next 2–3 months.
t he Group secured new and increased 
credit facilities from r Bs and Yorkshire 
Bank, a member of national australia Bank 
Group, in november 2011. it now has 
borrowing facilities of £50m, a £10m 
increase over its previous facility. t hese will 
remain in place until november 2016 and 
will enable the Group to continue trading 
from a position of relative strength in its 
markets, in what continues to be a tough 
environment.
Treasury
Group treasury activities are managed and 
controlled centrally. risks to assets and 
potential liabilities to customers, employees 
and the public continue to be insured. t he 
Group maintains its low risk financial 
management policy by insuring all 
significant trade debtors.
t he treasury function seeks to reduce the 
Group’s exposure to any interest rate, 
foreign exchange and other financial risks, 
to ensure that adequate, secure and 
cost-effective funding arrangements are 
maintained to finance current and planned 
future activities and to invest cash assets 
safely and profitably.
t he Group continues to have some 
exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, 
currently between sterling, the euro and the 
us dollar. in order to maintain the projected 
level of profit budgeted on contracts foreign 
exchange contracts are taken out to convert 
into sterling at the expected date of receipt.

Going Concern
in determining whether the Group’s annual 
consolidated financial statements can be 
prepared on a going concern basis, the 
Directors considered all factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance 
and its financial position, including cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities and the risks and uncertainties 
relating to its business activities. t he key 
areas of uncertainty considered by the 
directors were as follows:
X X t he u K order book, (standing at £221m 
in march 2012), the pipeline of 
potential orders, including the relative 
attractiveness of the market sectors 
which are feeding that pipeline, and the 
anticipated conversion of this pipeline;
X X t he implications of the continuing 
challenging economic environment on 
the Group’s revenues and profits. t he 
Group undertakes forecasts and 
projections of trading and cash flows on 
a regular basis. Whilst this is essential for 
targeting performance and identifying 
areas of focus for management to 
improve performance and mitigate the 
possible adverse impact of a 
deteriorating economic outlook, they 
also provide projections of working 
capital requirements;
X X t he impact of the very competitive 
environment within which the Group 
operates, including pressures on 
margins and counterparty risks. t his 
included an assessment of the current 
stage of the economic cycle of the 
construction industry, the prospects for 
any recovery in the short to medium 
term, and the potential development of 
the competitive environment;
X X t he impact on our business of key 
suppliers being unable to meet their 
obligations to the Group including the 
ability of the Group to find alternative 
suppliers who could also enable the 
business to continue trading 
satisfactorily;
X X t he potential mitigating actions that 
could be taken in the event that 
revenues are worse than expected, to 
ensure that operating profit and cash 
flows are protected.
X X t he committed finance facilities to the 
Group, including both the level of the 
facilities and the banking covenants 
attached to them. t he Group has access 
to £50m in credit facilities to meet 
day-to-day working capital requirements, 
which is available until november 2016. 
t his facility provides the Group with 
sufficient headroom both on the facility 
itself and on the bank covenants in place. 
t his position is forecast to continue for 
the foreseeable future.
Having considered all the factors impacting 
the Group’s business, including downside 
sensitivities, the Directors are satisfied that 
the Group will be able to operate within the 
terms and conditions of the Group financing 
facilities for the foreseeable future.
t he Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
2011 annual report.
Summary
Overall, results for the year have been 
steady in a difficult trading environment.  
t he Group’s new banking facilities have 
reinforced our relative competitive strength 
in the current challenging market. While the 
indian joint venture contributed a loss for 
the year, strong foundations have now been 
established for the future and a positive 
contribution is expected in 2012.

t he operating margin is the principal measure 
used by the Group to assess the success of 
its u K strategy. it is the profit before non-
underlying items such as the amortisation 
of intangible fixed assets, expressed as a 
percentage of revenue.
a reduction in 2011 to 5.3% (2010: 6.2%). t he 
reduction has been the result of lower contract 
pricing as a result of overcapacity in the market. 
Continuing weakness in the u K market has led 
to continued margin weakness. Whilst the latter 
part of the year saw improved pricing, this is still 
at very tight margins.

Cash is critical for providing the financial 
resources to develop the Group’s business and 
to provide adequate working capital to operate 
smoothly. t he Group has a robust and detailed 
cash forecasting procedure that considers the 
Group’s position on a contract by contract basis.
net debt as at 31 December 2011 was £31.3 
million (2010: £15.0 million). t he movement 
primarily reflects an outflow of cash from 
operating activities. t his has been driven by 
higher working capital levels and an overall 
extension in customer payment cycles as weak 
market conditions persist.
OrDer BOOK
t he order book provides visibility on future activity 
and allows the Group to plan production and adapt 
accordingly. it only includes future revenue from 
legally committed contracts comprising both ongoing 
and newly won work.
Whilst only the revenue within the order book is 
reported externally, a key forward indicator of future 
profitability that is tracked internally is the margin 
inherent within the forward order book.
t he order book (march 2012) for the Group 
(excluding the indian Joint Venture) is £221 million. 
t his represents a strong position at a time of weak 
market conditions and also provides a good loading 
for the majority of the Group's production facilities for 
the remainder of 2012.

t he Group’s ongoing operations and growth plans are subject to a number of different risks and uncertainties. risk management processes 
are put in place to assess, manage and control these on an ongoing basis. t he principal ones facing the business are set out below, and are 
listed in no particular order.
risk
People/skills
steel price 
movements
t he Group has established a 
market leading position over 
many years due in large part 
to the experience and skills of 
its key people.
steel is the key material used 
within the business and the 
largest single cost within a 
contract. steel prices can vary 
significantly in a short period 
of time.
commercial 
and market 
environment
t he u K construction market, 
within which the Group 
operates, is currently at the 
bottom of the economic cycle, 
placing significant pressure on 
all parts of the supply chain, 
from end customers through 
to material and subcontract 
suppliers. 
Weak demand is resulting in 
increased competition, tighter 
margins and the transfer 
of commercial, technical 
and financial risk down the 
supply chain, through more 
demanding contract terms 
and longer payment cycles.
Loss of key people could 
adversely impact the Group’s 
existing market position. 
insufficient growth and 
development of its people 
and skill sets could restrict its 
growth ambitions both in the 
u K and overseas.
such movements have 
the potential to impact 
the profitability of both 
individual contracts and the 
whole business significantly, 
particularly given the long 
duration of many of its 
contracts.
 X increased senior management review of 
technical and commercial risks within each 
contract before acceptance.
 X strengthening of commercial functions to 
manage contract progress and variations.
 X Close engagement with both customers 
and suppliers and monitoring of payment 
cycles.
 X Continuing use of credit insurance to 
minimise impact of customer failure.
 X t alent reviews undertaken regularly.
 X Development opportunities identified for 
staff to broaden their range of skills and 
experience.
 X a staff appraisal process continues to align 
the short and long term needs and goals of 
the business with those of key staff.
 X remuneration policy is regularly reviewed 
to ensure that it is competitive and strikes 
the appropriate balance between short and 
long term rewards and incentives.
 X skills gaps are continually identified and 
actions put in place to bridge these by 
either training, development or external 
recruitment.
 X supply and pricing agreements with steel 
suppliers are negotiated to minimise 
individual contract risk.
 X Customer bids are structured to reflect the 
prevailing conditions within the market for 
raw steel.

Health &

indian joint 
venture
t he Construction industry sets 
very high standards of Health 
and safety which the Group 
aims to exceed to maintain 
the health and well-being of 
its employees.
t he Group has invested in a 
Joint Venture in india, where 
the growth prospects are 
believed to be substantial.
interruption 
to fabrication 
facilities
t he Group’s production 
facilities are at the core of 
its business and the Group 
relies on smooth continued 
operation of them. 
interruption could impact 
both the Group’s performance 
on existing contracts and 
its ability to bid for future 
contracts, thereby impacting 
its financial performance.
Construction activities can 
result in injury or death to 
employees, with subsequent 
financial loss to the business, 
potential loss of reputation, 
where at fault, and ultimately 
exclusion from future 
business.
t he growth, management and 
performance of this business 
will be a key element of the 
Group’s development for the 
foreseeable future. effective 
management of the Joint 
Venture is therefore key to the 
Group’s continuing success.
 X Drive market leading standards for all 
employees at all times.
 X Director led safety leadership teams 
established to bring innovative solutions 
and to engage with all stakeholders 
to deliver continuous improvement in

 X Key positions within Joint Venture 
management structure are occupied by Group 
employees seconded to the Joint Venture.
explanation impact mitigation/comment
 X t he Group has four main production 
facilities so interruption at one facility could 
to some extent be absorbed by increasing 
capacity at a sister facility.
 X a wide network of subcontract fabricators 
is used on a recurring basis, both for short 
term peak capacity requirements and for 
more specialised fabrication. t his network 
could also be used to mitigate disruption to 
the Group’s own fabrication facilities.
 X appropriate levels of Business interruption 
insurance cover are maintained and 
reviewed regularly with the assistance of 
independent advisers and brokers.

or convert any security into, shares if 
authorised to do so by shareholders. t he 
authority granted at the last annual 
General meeting is due to expire at the 
conclusion of this year’s annual General 
meeting. accordingly, resolution 9 to be 
proposed at the annual General meeting 
will be proposed as an ordinary resolution 
to grant new authorities to allot shares and 
grant rights to subscribe for, or convert 
any security into, shares (a) up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of £743,015, 
and (b) in connection with a rights issue 
up to an aggregate nominal amount 
(reduced by allotments which may be

these authorities will expire at the annual 
General meeting of the Company in 
2013 or on 30 september 2013, 
whichever is the earlier.
 t he Directors have no present intention of 
issuing shares pursuant to this authority.
 Following aB i guidance published on
 31 December 2008, if the authority under 
resolution 9(b) to allot share capital up to 
an aggregate nominal value of 
£1,486,030 is given, where allotments 
exceed £743,015 and one-third of the

resolution 9(a), if given), all the Directors 
of the Company will stand for re-election

Company in 2013.
(ii)  t he directors of the Company also 
require a power from shareholders to 
allot equity securities or sell treasury 
shares for cash and otherwise than to 
existing shareholders pro rata to their 
holdings. t he power granted at the last 
annual General meeting is due to

meeting. accordingly, resolution 10 to 
be proposed at the annual General 
meeting will be proposed as a special 
resolution to grant such a power. apart 
from offers or invitations in proportion 
to the respective number of shares held, 
the power will be limited to the 
allotment of equity securities for cash up 
to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£111,564 (being approximately 5%. of 
the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital at 13 april 2012, the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of 
this document). if given, this power will 
expire at the conclusion of the annual 
General meeting of the Company in 
2013 or on 30 september 2013,

meeting they are given the authority to 
buy, by way of market purchases, up to 
10% of the issued share capital of the 
Company representing a maximum of 
8,925,108 shares. t he price to be paid 
will be no lower than 2.5p per share

price of the last independent trade and 
the highest current independent bid on 
the London stock exchange as 
stipulated in article 5(1) of the Buy-back 
and stabilisation regulation 2003.
 Purchases would not be made in the

announcement of the Company’s 
interim or final results. t his proposal 
does not indicate that the Company will 
purchase shares at any particular time or 
price, or imply any opinion on the part 
of the directors as to the market or other 
value of the Company’s shares. t his 
authority will expire at the end of the 
2013 annual General meeting, or on 
30 september 2013, whichever is the

annually. t he directors have no present 
intention of exercising this authority and 
will only do so at price levels which they 
consider to be in the interests of 
shareholders after taking account of the 
Group’s overall financial position, and 
which would lead to a beneficial impact 
on the earnings per share of the 
Company.
Rights Attaching to Shares
t he rights attaching to the ordinary shares 
are defined in the Company’s articles of 
association. t he articles of association may

shareholders. a shareholder whose name 
appears on the Company’s register of 
members can choose whether his shares are 
evidenced by share certificates (i.e. in 
certificated form) or held in electronic (i.e. 
uncertificated) form in Crest (the electronic 
settlement system in the u K).
subject to any restrictions below, 
shareholders may attend any general 
meeting of the Company and, on a show of 
hands, every shareholder (or his 
representative) who is present at a general 
meeting has one vote on each resolution 
and, on a poll, every shareholder (or his 
representative) who is present has one vote 
on each resolution for every ordinary
share of which they are the registered 
shareholder. a resolution put to the vote of 
a general meeting is decided on a show of 
hands unless before, or on the declaration of 
the result of, a vote on a show of hands, a 
poll is demanded by the chairman of the 
meeting, or by at least five shareholders 
present in person or by proxy and having 
the right to vote, or by any shareholders 
present in person or by proxy having at 
least 10% of the total voting rights of all 
shareholders, or by any shareholders 
present in person or by proxy holding 
ordinary shares in which an aggregate sum 
has been paid up of at least one-tenth of the 
total sum paid up on all ordinary shares.
shareholders can declare final dividends by 
passing an ordinary resolution but the 
amount of the dividends cannot exceed the 
amount recommended by the Board. t he 
Board can pay interim dividends on any 
class of shares of the amounts and on the 
dates and for the periods they decide the 
distributable profits of the Company justify 
such payment. 40 Severfield—Rowen Plc Annual Report 2011

passed by the shareholders, divide among 
the shareholders all or any part of the assets 
of the Company and he can value any 
assets and determine how the division shall 
be carried out as between the members or 
different classes of members. t he liquidator 
can also transfer the whole or any part of 
the assets to trustees upon any trusts for the

electronic form, not less than 48 hours 
before the time appointed for holding the 
meeting or adjourned meeting at which the 
person named in the appointment proposes  
to vote.
no shareholder is, unless the Board decides 
otherwise, entitled to attend or vote either 
personally or by proxy at a general meeting 
or to exercise any other right conferred by 
being a shareholder if he or any person  
with an interest in shares has been sent a 
notice under section 793 of the Companies 
act 2006 (which confers upon public 
companies the power to require information 
with respect to interests in their voting 
shares) and he or any interested person 
failed to supply the Company with the 
information requested within 14 days after
delivery of that notice. t he Board may also 
decide (where the shares represent at least 
0.25% in nominal value of the issued shares 
of the same class) that no dividend is 
payable in respect of those default shares 
and that no transfer of any default shares 
shall be registered.
t hese restrictions end seven days after 
receipt by the Company of a notice of an 
approved transfer of the shares or all the 
information required by the relevant section 
793 notice, whichever is the earlier.

Corporate social responsibility
Introduction
Our Corporate Social Responsibility agenda 
is key to the way we do business. Our 
people consider the safety, environmental, 
ethical and financial impacts of what we do 
and, through our ‘Steel Futures’ continuous 
improvement programme, we continue 
to create a point of differentiation for our 
business in the marketplace.
In 2011 we have been pleased with the 
significant progress that has been made 
across all of our operating companies, 
including:
•	 Development and implementation of 
our Golden Rules of Health and Safety
•	 Roll-out of our behavioural safety 
training programme
•	 Focussed leadership reviews across our 
Design, Construction and Production 
activities 
•	 Significant investment in improved 
technology and IT solutions to 
maximise interaction, communication 
and team collaboration
•	 Increased intake of apprentices to help 
sustain the skills necessary for the 
future success of the Group
•	 Improved employee and workforce 
engagement
•	 Development of our Skills Academy 
training centre to further enhance the 
professional skills of our employees
Health and Safety 
The Group is committed to high standards 
of Health and Safety for all employees and 
promotes safety excellence through all its 
operations. The Executive Committee has 
been working hard with our employees and 
supply chain partners throughout 2011. 
The Group’s network of Safety Leadership 
Teams (SLTs), chaired by each business unit’s 
Managing Director with representation 
from unions and shopfloor employees, have 
created a proactive environment for change 
and achieved some excellent progress. SLTs 
work closely with our key clients to set a 
strategy for improving safety standards 
and this is bringing real recognition for the 
efforts and results our employees are now 
delivering.
The Group’s Health and Safety teams 
support operational directors across the 
Group in developing and maintaining a 
positive Health and Safety culture for all 
aspects of our operations. Each operating 
company has a worker Health and Safety 
committee with direct access into the 
main Board via monthly Health and Safety 
meetings.
The Group operates in challenging working 
environments and is proud of its good safety 
record. 
In 2011 there has been specific focus on 
the development of leadership skills and 
behaviours of our employees and the 
engagement of our subcontractors to help 
deliver our improvement strategy.
The Group has invested significant time 
and resource during an intensive roll-out 
of behavioural safety training and, to date, 
more than 900 employees and subcontractor 
construction teams have been through our 
innovative programme.
Our efforts are being recognised internally 
by our own staff and externally by our clients 
and the wider construction industry.
The successful roll-out and communication 
of our Health and Safety Golden Rules across 
all our factory and construction sites has 
reinforced our commitment to proactively 
addressing safety wherever we have a 
presence.

Carbon Agenda 
The Group continues to pursue a carbon 
agenda that differentiates us in the 
marketplace.
In 2011 the decision was taken to proactively 
tackle our energy usage throughout the 
business. 
As part of the first phase, our Watson 
business has negotiated its electricity supply 
to be from a renewable energy source, 
enabling them to be Climate Change Levy 
exempt. 
At Severfield-Rowen Structures Ltd we 
took the decision to move to a low sulphur 
and reduced carbon heating oil while we 
negotiate an alternative renewable and 
possible self-generation solution.
The Group has commissioned a full strategic 
review of its energy usage and we expect 
further positive progress to be achieved in 
2012.
Skills Development
The Group is developing the lifelong 
learning skills of our shop floor employees, 
over 50 of our factory staff are undertaking 
full NVQ training. This investment will 
underpin the successful delivery of current 
and future projects.
Environment & Sustainability
The Group is committed to minimising the 
impact of its business and its processes on 
the natural environment and the community 
at large by going beyond just complying 
with laws, directives and regulations 
pertaining to its field of operations.
The Group has continued its successful 
accreditation to the standard of BES 6001 
for the Responsible Sourcing of Materials 
and remains the only Steel Fabrication 
Contractor to have achieved this industry 
leading standard.

Head Office in Dalton, north Yorkshire. 
However, during the year three of the

Group’s other operating subsidiaries 
providing non-executive directors the 
opportunity to increase their knowledge and 
understanding of the Group’s operations.

t he Board has established three standing 
committees, all of which operate within

available from the Company secretary by 
request and will be available for inspection

X X t o consider the need for an internal 
audit function. t he Committee agrees 
with the directors’ opinion that the 
Group is not of sufficient size and 
complexity to require an internal audit 
function. 
Consistent with exercising these 
responsibilities the Committee has 
considered in detail both the final and 
interim results for 2011 specifically 
reviewing the appropriateness of significant 
accounting policies, financial reporting issues 
and judgements and relevant reports from 
both management and the external auditor. 
t hroughout the year the Committee has 
continued to assist the Board in achieving its 
obligations under the Code in areas of risk 
management and internal control, focussing 
particularly on areas of compliance with 
legal requirements, accounting standards 
and the Listing rules, and ensuring that an 
effective system of internal financial and 
non-financial controls is maintained.
t he Committee recognises that, given their 
knowledge of the business, there are often 
advantages in using the auditor to provide 
certain non-audit services. t he Committee is 
satisfied that the independence of the 
auditor has not been impaired by providing 
these services. non-audit services provided 
by the auditor during the year ended 
31 December 2011 included corporation 
tax compliance advice and advice in 
connection with the Group’s banking 
arrangements. t he Committee has a policy 
of limiting fees to the auditor for non-audit 
services to 100% of the audit fee and 
requiring competitive tender for all work 
with a fee over £30,000. t here are no 
specific types of non-audit work from which 
the auditor is specifically excluded but the 
Committee may reserve the right to insist 
that the auditor be excluded from tendering 
for work that may present a potential conflict 
of interest. t he auditor complies with the 
accounting Practices Board (aPB) ethical 
standards applying to non-audit services.
Details of the auditor’s fees are shown in 
note 4 on page 75.
On invitation, the Finance Director, other 
executive directors, executive Committee 
members and the auditor attends meetings 
to assist the Committee to fulfil its duties. 
t he Committee can access independent 
professional advice if it considers it 
necessary.
During the course of the past year the audit 
Committee has received external guidance 
in reviewing its effectiveness.  Following this 
review the scope and depth of its activities 
are expected to increase over the coming 
year.

t he Board has formally acknowledged its overall 
responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of internal 
control. it believes that senior management within the 
Group’s operating businesses should also contribute in a 
substantial way and this has been built into the process.
t here are inherent limitations in any system of internal 
control and, accordingly, even the most effective system can 
provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance with 
respect to the preparation of financial information and the 
safeguarding of assets. t he system is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives.
in carrying out its review of the effectiveness of internal 
control in the Group the Board has taken into consideration 
the following key features of the risk management process 
and system of internal control:
X X senior management from all key disciplines and 
subsidiary companies within the Group are involved in 
the process of risk assessment in order to identify and 
assess Group objectives, key issues and controls. a 
further review has been performed to identify those 
risks relevant to the Group as a whole. t his assessment 
encompassed all aspects of risk including operational, 
compliance, financial and strategic. a risk register is in 
place and is updated on an ongoing basis and a control 
strategy has been determined for each of the significant 
risks.
X X t he risk management committee, chaired by t G 
Haughey, has the primary responsibility to identify, 
monitor and control the significant risks to an acceptable 
level throughout the Group. t he committee receives 
information on relevant risk matters from line 
management and other sources on a regular basis.
X X t he Group operates a comprehensive budgeting and 
financial reporting system which, as a matter of routine, 
compares actual results with budgets. management 
accounts are prepared for each subsidiary company and 
the Group on a monthly basis. material variances from 
budget are thoroughly investigated. in addition, a more 
detailed profitability forecast based on actual contracts 
secured is regularly prepared to monitor the performance 
of the main operating company of the Group as the year 
progresses. risks are identified and appraised throughout 
the annual process of preparing budgets. t he Board 
approves the Group’s annual budget.
X X a credit insurance committee comprising t G Haughey, 
P a emerson and a D Dunsmore has been established 
to review matters when adequate credit insurance on 
the Group’s customers cannot be purchased in the 
present economic climate.

Directors’ remuneration report
Introduction
as an independent body, this year, our 
remuneration Committee faced a 
challenging dichotomy: the balancing of 
reward to executive management for strong 
performance in exceptionally difficult market 
conditions against reduced shareholder 
returns.
in the aftermath of the u K recession, 
starting in 2008, the u K construction 
industry has declined steadily year on year 
through 2011, both in public and private 
sector investment. several competitors 
ceased trading in the past 12 months. in 
contrast, the Group achieved its challenging 
profitability budget, strengthened its market 
share, ended the year with a strong order 
book, managed its investment in india to 
provide significant returns in future years 
and renegotiated its banking facilities.
t he market contraction combined with 
downward pressure on margins caused an 
inevitable decline in shareholder returns 
including dividend yield. t he share price 
remained relatively stable, reflecting, we 
believe, the market’s confidence in the 
strong management performance and our 
investment in the future.
t he remuneration Committee met several 
times throughout the past year seeking an 
equitable solution to the dichotomy. Our 
conclusions remain strictly within our 
published policies which are consistent with 
regulatory guidelines and best practice.
t his report summarises our conclusions, sets 
out the remuneration payable for 2011 and 
our forward planning.
Reporting Regulations 
t his report, approved by the Board, has been 
prepared in accordance with schedule 8 to 
the accounting regulations under the 
Companies act 2006 and the Listing rules of 
the Financial services authority. it also 
describes how the Board has applied the 
Principles relating to directors’ remuneration 
under the u K Corporate Governance Code. 
t he remuneration Committee has also taken 
into consideration guidelines published by 
institutional investor advisory bodies such as 
the aB i and rreV. as required by the legal 
regulations, a resolution to approve this 
report will be proposed at the annual 
General meeting of the Company at which 
time the financial statements will be 
approved. 
t he regulations require the auditors to 
report to the Group’s shareholders on the 
“auditable part” of the Directors’ 
remuneration report and to state whether, 
in their opinion, that part of the report has 
been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies act 2006. t he report has 
therefore been divided into separate 
sections for audited and unaudited 
information.
UNAUDITED INf ORMATION
Remuneration Committee
t he Group has an established remuneration 
Committee which is constituted in 
accordance with the recommendations of 
the u K Corporate Governance Code. t he 
Committee comprises five non-executive 
directors, J K elliott, t J L Hayward, G H 
Wright, J Dodds and C Holt, and is chaired 
by J K elliott. t he Committee met on six 
occasions during the year with full 
attendance. C Holt joined the Board on 
1 november 2011 and attended all 
meetings subsequent to his appointment. 
Prior to his resignation in October 2011 D P 
ridley also served on the remuneration 
Committee. all members of the Committee 
are considered to be independent. no 
executive directors attended remuneration 
Committee meetings or otherwise play a 
part in any discussion about their own 
remuneration.
t he statements made herein regarding 
remuneration policy apply equally to four of 
the divisional directors who serve on the 
executive management Committee and to 
the four executive directors who sit on the 
Board of severfield–rowen Plc. 
t hroughout 2011 new Bridge street (a 
trading name of aon Corporation) served as 
an independent adviser to the remuneration 
Committee. neither new Bridge street nor 
any other part of aon Corporation provided 
other services to the Group during the year.
t he terms of reference for the remuneration 
Committee are available from the Company 
secretary and are published on the Group’s 
website.
Remuneration Policy
Our policy objectives are unchanged: 
designing executive remuneration to attract 
and retain executive directors of the highest 
calibre, structured to reward excellent 
performance, to provide longer term 
motivation, to align directors’ interests with 
those of external shareholders and to 
rationalise directors’ pay policy with policy in 
the broader workforce.
Directors’ Total Remuneration
Looking at the group of eight directors 
within the purview of the remuneration 
Committee, the recent history and current 
status of directors’ pay are as follows:
2009 to 2010: payroll reduced by 
25%. all directors took a 20% pay-cut on 
1 January 2010. t his has not been 
reinstated. Bonus payments declined by 
60%. t otal remuneration was down by 41% 
in aggregate, a reduction of £1.5 million. 
2010 to 2011: payroll remained 
unchanged. Bonus payments increased by 
29%. Overall remuneration was up by 9%, 
an increase of £195,000. 
2011 salaries remained at 80% of the 
2009 level, bonuses at 50% and total 
remuneration at £2.4 million, two-thirds of 
that in 2009, a reduction of £1.2 million 
over two years.
The future
Future executive remuneration policy will 
continue to incorporate our established 
policies and strive for consistency with best 
practice guidelines. in addition, the following 
initiatives will be implemented in 2012. 
1. On 1 January 2012 a base salary 
increment of 3.1% will be awarded to 
directors mirroring that paid in July 2011 
to the broader workforce.
2. t he remuneration Committee will 
commission a directors’ remuneration 
benchmarking survey paying particular  53
21153.04 27/04/12   Proof
53 OUR gO veRnance
attention to the selection of companies in 
the comparator groups and generally 
using any data with due care.
3. in addition, the remuneration Committee 
will undertake a general review of our 
existing remuneration policies including 
cash bonus awards and performance 
criteria, long term incentive plans, directors’ 
shareholding guidelines and directors 
benefits. Our terms of reference will 
include fitness for purpose, market parity, 
the balance between fixed and variable 
pay and adherence to best practice.
4. Changes to our policies based on the 
results of our review may be implemented 
in 2012 by the remuneration Committee. 
any such changes will, of course, be 
communicated fully to shareholders 
through our established reporting cycle.
Base salaries
Other than in respect of D randall who was 
appointed as a main Board Director, base 
salaries (after allowance for increments to 
compensate for the introduction of a 
£50,000 pension contribution cap in 2011) 
were unchanged from the previous year.
t hey will be increased by 3.1% on 1 January 
2012 mirroring a similar increase in 
workforce pay in July 2011.
Base salaries in 2011 originated in mid 
2007 with the restructuring of the Company 
Board. since that time a 3% increment was 
awarded in January 2008 and a 20% 
reduction in January 2010. as a result, 
current base salaries are significantly below 
their levels five years ago. Parity with 
comparable market norms is to be 
evaluated.
Annual Bonuses 
We employ a two tier approach for bonus 
assessment with 60% of the maximum 
bonus being awarded based on financial 
performance, the Profit Before t ax ("PBt") 
out-turn versus the budgeted PBt, and 40% 
of the maximum bonus against a group of 
non financial performance targets aligned 
with corporate strategy such as Health and 
safety and Corporate and social 
responsibility targets and international 
diversification strategy. t he non financial 
performance targets are established by the 
remuneration Committee and are reset 
annually at the start of each year. 
Both the PBt (60%) segment and the 
maximum bonus for the non-Financial 
segment (40%) are based on the following 
previously published formula:
in 2011, our PBt budget was met but not 
exceeded. t herefore, for the financial 
segment of the bonus, the ranges in the 
table at 100% of budget (highlighted) were 
applied.
in accordance with our established policy, 
setting of bonuses within the allowable 
ranges is at the discretion of the 
remuneration Committee taking into 
account our assessment of individual 
contribution to financial results, prevailing 
market conditions (budget performance in 
difficult market conditions being better 
rewarded than in a seller’s market) and 
contribution to the implementation of 
strategic initiatives which we anticipate will 
deliver profits in future years. 
For the non-Financial segment (40%), the 
remuneration Committee selected three 
subsets in 2011:
X X Development of Health and safety  
strategies – 16%
X X Customer Performance Feedback from  
five customers with active projects in the 
year – 12%
X X indian subsidiary production and 
efficiency goals – 12%
t he results against each subset target were 
evaluated and consolidated using the above 
weightings resulting in a 7 out of 10 score 
for the non-Financial segment. t he most 
significant shortfall was in the india 
production targets which lagged the 
progress anticipated as discussed in the 
CeO’s statement in this report. Progress in 
development of H&s strategies was 
excellent and feedback from all five 
customers showed a high level of client 
satisfaction with performance.
t he 7 out of 10 score was applied against 
the 40% of the maximum allowable bonus 
for each director to compute entitlement to 
bonus awards in this segment.
t he combination of the financial and 
non-financial assessments gave rise to total 
bonus awards from 39% to 64% of the 
maximum allowable for individual directors 
under the published ranges. On average, 
bonus awards represented 57% of base 
salary and 36% of total remuneration, 
excluding pensions and benefits. 
Details of the resulting bonuses paid for 
2011 are set out in the table of directors’ 
emoluments. t he bonus payments are not 
pensionable.

Non-Executive Directors
t he remuneration of non-executive directors 
is considered by the executive directors and 
reflects the time that they commit to the 
Company. non-executive directors cannot 
participate in any of the annual bonus, long 
term incentive or the Company’s pension 
scheme.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
under the P s P rules shares are awarded at 
the start of a three-year period which can 
vest in whole or in part at the end of the 
three-year term subject to the achievement 
of a performance goal, the Performance 
Condition (PC). Participation is limited to the 
eight executive directors, comprising the 
four main Board directors and, currently, 
four divisional directors. t he normal 
maximum limit for the value of shares 
comprising an award is 150% of salary in 
any year. 
The Performance Condition (PC) 
t he PC is based on earnings Per share 
(ePs) assessed at the end of a three-year 
performance period. t he ePs target ranges 
for each Ps P award is set by the 
remuneration Committee, prior to grant, 
with a three-year look ahead. 
Vesting Record & Outlook
Ps P awards made in 2008 and 2009 did 
not vest at the end of 2010 and 2011 due 
to the substantial contraction of the market 
and margins. a wards made in 2010 are 
unlikely to vest at the end of 2012, 
reflecting our overly optimistic assessment 
(at that time) of the timing and strength of 
the market recovery.
as a result, we expect three consecutive 
years of no vesting under the Ps P. t he PC 
established by the remuneration Committee 
for awards at the start of 2011 will require  
a strong recovery over the next two years to 
deliver significant vesting at the end of 
2013. 
Forecasts vary widely on the timing and 
strength of the recovery and we find 
ourselves in markets where longer term 
forecasting is difficult and unreliable. 
Our role as remuneration Committee 
includes the establishment of performance 
goals through long terms incentive plans 
which are challenging but achievable 
through superior performance, thereby 
incentivising and rewarding success. We try 
to set performance conditions in our rolling 
three year targets that achieve that balance. 
and the difficulty in forecasting in the 
current unstable economic and political 
environment has heightened. 
notwithstanding, we have reset the 
Performance Condition and Ps P awards as 
set out below. 
Performance Condition for 2012 
Awards Based on Performance in 
2014
at the lower threshold, below which no 
awards will vest, we have set a target ePs of 
12.5p for 2014 representing approximately 
£15 million PBt . at the higher end the 
target ePs is set at 22.5p equivalent to a 
PBt approaching £27.5 million. t hese 
targets constitute annual growth rates in 
profitability between 14% p.a. and 40% p.a. 
over the three years 2012 through to 2014; 
that is, a forecast of between steady 
recovery and strong recovery. 
PSP Award levels
attendant with setting the three-year PC, 
Ps P awards will be granted at the start of 
2012. t he remuneration Committee has 
elected to make awards in the range of 
100% to 145% of base salary versus 150% 
maximum allowable in the Ps P rules. t he 
CeO will be granted 145% of base salary, 
three main Board directors will each be 
granted 125% and four divisional directors 
will each receive 100% awards. t he award 
levels have been scaled back marginally this 
year in the context of some reduction in 
share price at the time of award. each award 
will vest only on achievement of the 
three-year Performance Condition. a wards 
for an ePs in 2014 within the target range 
are based on linear interpolation. 
Shareholding Guideline
a policy was introduced in 2004 whereby 
executive directors will be required to retain 
shares acquired under long term incentive 
schemes until such time they have built up a 
holding equivalent in market value (at the 
date of vesting) to the executive’s base 
salary. t hereafter, the executive directors will 
be under a continuing obligation to maintain 
at least such a holding. t he requirement 
underscores the Committee’s policy to align 
executive director remuneration and 
shareholder interests.
Pensions
t he Group contributes to each executive 
director’s money purchase pension fund. 
Contribution rates for each director are 
£50,000 pa resulting in contribution levels 
in the range of 15–30% of base salary. 
Service Contracts
t he service contracts of executive directors 
run on a rolling basis and are no longer 
than 12 months’ duration. notice periods  
of 12 months are required to be given by  
all parties.
Full details of the contracts of each director 
including the date, unexpired term and any 
payment obligations on early termination 
are available from the Company secretary 
and at the annual General meeting.  56 Severfield—Rowen Plc Annual Report 2011

62 Severfield—Rowen Plc Annual Report 2011
We have audited the Group financial statements of Severfield–
Rowen Plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise 
the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 32. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for 
our report.
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
X X give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended;
X X have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and
X X have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on Other Matter Prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
X X the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
X X the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
X X certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
X X we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
X X the Directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ Report 
in relation to going concern;
X X the part of the corporate governance statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
X X certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
Directors’ remuneration.
other Matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of Severfield–Rowen Plc for the year ended 
31 December 2011.

1. Significant accounting policies
 Basis of accounting
 The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
 The financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
 In 2011, several new, revised and amended standards and 
interpretations became effective. These are IAS 24 (revised) 
“Related party disclosures”, IFRS 1 (amendment) “First time 
adoption: financial instrument disclosure”, IAS 32 (amendment) 
“Financial instruments: Presentation on classification of rights 
issues”, IFRIC 19 “Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity 
instruments”, IFRIC 14 “Prepayments of a minimum funding 
requirement”, and improvements to IFRSs (2010). The adoption 
of these standards and relevant interpretations has not had a 
material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
 
 Going concern
 After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgement 
at the time of approving the financial statements that there is a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason the directors continue to adopt a going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. The key factors 
considered by the directors in making the statement are set out 
within the Financial Review on pages 22 to 26.
 Basis of consolidation
 The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and the entities controlled by the 
Company made up to the reporting date each year. Control 
is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities. 
 Where relevant, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed 
of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income 
Statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the 
effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
 Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used 
into line with those used by the Group.
 All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation.
  
 consolidated income Statement disclosure
 In order to give an indication of the underlying earnings of the 
Group, certain items are presented in the middle column of the 
Consolidated Income Statement entitled “Other Items”. In 2011 
these comprise:
X X amortisation of acquired intangibles;
X X movements in the valuation of derivative financial 
instruments;
X X costs provided in respect of a contract legal claim during 
the year; 
X X release of a contract legal provision which was no longer 
required; and
X X the associated tax impact of the above items together with 
the impact of future reductions in corporation tax rates 
on the Group’s deferred tax liability.
 In 2010 they also included:
X X pre-operating losses of the Indian JV; and
X X an impairment charge in relation to an investment property.
 Business combinations 
 The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the 
acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets 
given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus 
any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The 
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that 
meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised 
at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
 investments in associates
 An Associated Company is an entity over which the Group is 
in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control, 
through participation in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the power to 
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the 
investee but is not control over those policies. 
 A Joint Venture is an entity over which the Group is in a position 
to exercise joint control.  The Group has chosen to adopt the 
equity method of accounting (as discussed below) for Joint 
Ventures and Associated Companies (together “Associates”), in 
accordance with IAS 31.
 The results and assets and liabilities of Associates are 
incorporated in these financial statements using the equity 
method of accounting unless it meets the exceptions described 
in IAS 28. Investments in Associates are carried in the balance 
sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the 
Group’s share of the net assets of the Associate, less any 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Year ended 31 December 2011 21153.04   26/04/12   Proof 4
69 Group Accounts 69
impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of the 
Associates in excess of the Group’s interest in those Associates 
are not recognised unless, and only to the extent that, the 
Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations on behalf of 
the Associates.
 Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of 
the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the Associate at 
the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency 
of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair 
values of the identifiable net assets of the Associate at the date 
of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in the 
Consolidated Income Statement in the period of acquisition.
 The Consolidated Income Statement includes the Group’s share 
of Associates’ profit less losses while the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the Associates is shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 Goodwill
 Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for 
impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately as a loss and is not subsequently reversed.
 For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units 
to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the 
unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount 
of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets 
of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each 
asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is 
not reversed in a subsequent period.
 On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled 
entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
 Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition 
to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill 
arising prior to 1 January 1998 of £1,122,000 was taken 
directly to reserves in the year in which it arose. Such goodwill 
has not been reinstated on the balance sheet.
 Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
 revenue recognition
 Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in accordance 
with the Group’s accounting policy on construction contracts 
(see below).
 
 Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
 Dividend income from investments is recognised when the 
shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
 construction contracts
 Profit is recognised on contracts, if the final outcome can be 
assessed reliably, by including in the income statement revenue 
and related cost as contract activity progresses. Revenue is 
calculated as the proportion of total expected contract value 
which corresponds to the proportion of costs incurred to date to 
total expected costs for that contract. Variations in contract work, 
claims and incentive payments are included in revenue to the 
extent that there is appropriate certainty that they will ultimately 
be accepted by the customer and can be measured reliably.
 Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be 
estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent 
contract costs have been incurred and it is probable they will be 
recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the 
period in which they are incurred.
 When it is probable that total expected contract costs will exceed 
total expected contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised 
as an expense immediately.
 leases
 Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the 
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
 Amounts payable under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
 Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases 
are capitalised in the balance sheet at fair value and depreciated 
in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. The capital 
element of the leasing commitment is included as obligations 
under finance leases. The rentals payable are apportioned 
between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and 
capital, which reduces the outstanding obligation.
 operating profit
 Operating profit is stated after charging any restructuring costs, 
impairment and amortisation charges, gains or losses arising 
on the fair value of foreign exchange derivative contracts and 
after the share of results of Associates and the impact of any 
movements in legal provisions but before investment income 
and finance costs.
 Additionally, we present a separate additional, non-statutory, 
heading “Operating Profit before results of Associates” to assist 
in isolating the impact of the Group’s Indian Joint Venture. This 
also excludes the results of two other non-material Associates. 21153.04   26/04/12   Proof 4
70 Severfield—Rowen Plc Annual Report 2011
1. Significant accounting policies continued
 retirement benefit costs
 The Group operates two defined contribution pension schemes 
and costs of these schemes are charged to the income statement 
in the period in which they are incurred.
 In addition, Atlas Ward, acquired on 31 March 2005, has a 
defined benefit scheme which is now closed. The liability in 
respect of this scheme is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of the 
plan assets, together with adjustments for actuarial gains/losses.
 The finance cost of liabilities and expected return of assets are 
included within administrative expenses in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
 The actuarial gain or loss is charged through the Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income and is made up of 
the difference between the expected return on assets and 
those actually achieved, the difference between the actuarial 
assumptions for liabilities and actual experience in the period 
and any changes in the assumptions used in the valuations.
 The pension scheme deficit is recognised in full and presented 
on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The associated 
deferred tax asset is recognised within the net deferred tax liability 
within non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
 taxation
 The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable 
and deferred tax.
 The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. 
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
 Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases 
used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for 
using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities 
are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit.
 
 The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow 
all or part of the asset to be recovered.
 Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is 
realised. These are determined based on future changes in tax 
rates that have been enacted rather than simply future changes 
that have been proposed but not enacted. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it 
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which 
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied 
by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle 
its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
 Dividends
 Dividends are recorded in the Group’s financial statements in 
the period in which they are declared, appropriately authorised 
and no longer at the discretion of the Company.
 Property, plant and equipment
 Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply 
of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, and plant 
and machinery are currently stated at cost in the balance sheet. 
Depreciation on buildings is charged to income.
 Depreciation is provided on other property, plant and 
equipment to write off the cost of each asset over its estimated 
useful life at the following rates:
 Freehold buildings/
 Investment properties 1% straight-line
 Plant and machinery 10% straight-line
 Fixtures, fittings and
 office  equipment 10% written down value
 Computer equipment 20% straight-line
 Motor vehicles  25% written down value
 Site safety equipment 20% straight-line
 
 Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their 
expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, 
where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
 The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset 
is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.

 investment property
 Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/
or for capital appreciation, is stated at cost less provision for 
impairment. Depreciation will be charged annually based on 
the Group’s stated depreciation policy together with an annual 
impairment review. Where properties have been impaired below 
cost and are being held at directors’ valuation the directors have 
taken appropriate external guidance on the likely current value 
of properties. No investment properties have been subject to 
formal external valuation.
 intangibles
 The Group recognises intangible assets at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired 
through acquisitions arise as a result of applying IFRS 3 which 
requires the separate recognition of intangible assets from 
goodwill on all business combinations from 1 January 2004.
 Other acquired intangible assets include software costs.
 Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful economic lives as follows:
 Amortisation 
period
 Customer relationships 10 years
 Brands 25 years
 Know-how 10 years
 Software costs 7 years
 impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
 excluding goodwill
 At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the 
extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the 
Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an 
indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
 The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for 
which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
 If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a 
revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as 
a revaluation decrease.
 Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to 
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the 
increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined had no impairment loss 
been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior 
years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income 
immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued 
amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is 
treated as a revaluation increase.
 inventories
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, 
direct labour costs and those overheads that have been 
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and 
condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling 
price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
 Financial instruments
 Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group’s Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
 t rade receivables
 Trade receivables are classified as loans and receivables, and 
therefore measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method.
 cash and cash equivalents
 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand 
deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 21153.04   26/04/12   Proof 4
72 Severfield—Rowen Plc Annual Report 2011
1. Significant accounting policies continued
 Bank borrowings
 Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs, are accounted for in the income statement 
using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in 
the period in which they arise. The effective interest method is a 
method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and 
of allocating interest over the relevant period.
 t rade payables
 Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost.
 equity instruments
 Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
 Share-based payment transactions
 The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments. These 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date 
of grant based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest. The fair value determined is then expensed in 
the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity. 
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-
settled share-based transactions are set out in note 22.
 Provisions
 Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions 
are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure 
required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and, 
as appropriate, are discounted to present value where the effect 
is material.
 Derivative financial instruments
 The Group enters into certain foreign exchange forward 
contracts to manage its exposure to currency movements. 
Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in 
note 21 to the financial statements.
 Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date 
a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The 
resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty
 Key sources of estimation  uncertainty
 The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial 
year, are also discussed below.
 Revenue and margin recognition
 The Group’s revenue recognition and margin recognition are 
central to the way the Group values the work it has carried 
out in each financial year. These policies require forecasts to 
be made of the outcomes of long term construction contracts, 
which require assessments and judgements to be made on 
recovery of pre-contract costs, changes in work scopes, contract 
programmes and maintenance liabilities.
 The Group applies rigorous internal control procedures over 
the determination of each of the above variables to ensure that 
profit take as at the balance sheet date and the extent of future 
costs to contract completion are reasonably and consistently 
determined.
 Retirement benefit obligations
 Details of the Group’s defined pension scheme are set out in 
note 30. The scheme has been valued in accordance with IAS 
19 “Employee Benefits”. At 31 December 2011 the defined 
benefit obligation recognised on the Group’s balance sheet was 
£9,552,000. The benefit obligation is calculated using a number 
of assumptions including increases in pension benefits, mortality 
rates and inflation and the future investment returns from the 
scheme’s assets. The present value of the benefit obligations is 
calculated by discounting the benefit obligation using market 
rates on relevant AA corporate bonds at the balance sheet date.
 The scheme’s assets are valued at market rates at the balance 
sheet date. Effects of changes in the actuarial assumptions 
underlying the benefit obligation, discount rates and the 
difference between expected and actual returns on the scheme’s 
assets are classified as actuarial gains and losses.

 critical judgements in applying the Group’s  
 accounting policies
 In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
which are described in note 1, management has made the 
following judgements that have the most significant effect on 
the amounts recognised in the financial statements. Those 
judgements involving estimations are dealt with below.
 Impairment of goodwill and intangible  assets arising  
 from acquisitions
 Determining whether goodwill or associated intangible assets 
are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units to which these assets have been allocated. 
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the 
future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating 
unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present 
value. The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet 
date was £54,712,000 and of intangible assets arising from 
acquisitions was £18,227,000. No impairment adjustment has 
been made for the year ended 31 December 2011.
 Impairment of investment property
 In the absence of a formal valuation, determining the carrying 
value of the Group’s investment property requires an 
assessment of fair value. The key factors considered by the 
directors in determining fair value are the possible open market 
valuation and rental yields on the property. The written down 
value of the Group’s investment property as at the balance sheet 
date was £3,960,000. This reflects the impact of an impairment 
charge of £2,073,000 made during 2010 as well as an ongoing 
depreciation charge of £40,000 in 2011. 21153.04   26/04/12   Proof 4

10. Goodwill
The carrying value of goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) as follows:
£000
On the Fisher Engineering acquisition in 2007 47,980
On the Atlas Ward acquisition in 2005 6,571
On the Watson Steel Structures acquisition in 2001 161
54,712
 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
 The recoverable amounts of goodwill are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use  
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the 
period. The directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the CGUs. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations on future changes 
in the market. It is anticipated that sales volumes in the UK will not increase materially over the next three years.
 The Group prepares forecast cash flows based on the following years’ operating budget, approved by the directors, together with cash 
flows based on budgets for the following two years which are derived from the directors’ views on revenue prospects to the end of 2014 
(this equates to a compound annual growth rate from budgeted 2012 levels of 2%). After this period, the growth rate applied to the 
cash flow forecasts is the projected economic growth rate for the industry. The cash flow forecasts have been discounted using a pre-tax 
discount rate of 9% (2010: 9%).
 The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test for the Fisher Engineering goodwill. A reduction in growth rates  
to 0% in 2012–13 and flat thereafter would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill being reduced to its carrying value of  
£48.0 million.
 The Group has also undertaken an assessment of the Atlas Ward position and no requirement for impairment has been identified. 21153.04   26/04/12   Proof 4

12. Property, plant and equipment, investment property continued
 The net book value of the Group’s plant and machinery includes £438,000 (2010: £Nil) in respect of assets held under finance leases.
 The investment property represents land and buildings held in Leeds. The Group is receiving rental income on this property until the end 
of 2012 at a current rate of £378,000 per annum. This has been subject to an annual depreciation charge at 1% as required under the 
Group’s depreciation policy. During 2010 the carrying value of this property was written down to £4,000,000 reflecting the continued 
poor state of the property market and the approaching end of the lease. Following soundings over future divestment and leasehold 
potential the current carrying value of £3,960,000 is considered appropriate. No independent valuation by an appropriately qualified 
surveyor has been obtained.

 During the year ended 31 December 2005 the Board reviewed the investment of long term loans outstanding from Fabsec Ltd of 
£614,000 and concluded that there was an element of doubt over the collection of this loan in the short to medium term. Consequently, 
after considering the net liabilities of Fabsec Ltd, a provision of £543,000 was made against the debt. This provision remains in place at 
31 December 2011.
 In 2006 Severfield–Reeve Structures Ltd entered into a 50/50 joint venture agreement with Murray Metals Group Ltd to form Steel 
UK Ltd, a company involved in steel buying activities. To date, both parties have continued to purchase steel through the individual 
companies and no trade has passed through Steel UK Ltd. The share capital invested by the Group is a nominal sum of £50. Steel UK 
Ltd is registered in England.

 The average credit period taken on revenue, calculated on a count-back basis to make appropriate allowance for monthly revenue 
phasing, is 83 days (2010: 70 days). No interest is charged on receivables.
 The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
 Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit rating to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines 
credit limits by customer. It is Group policy that adequate credit insurance is taken out on all customers to manage the exposure that may 
arise as the contractual work proceeds. Accordingly, no bad debt provisions are held or expenses incurred. The Group’s credit insurance 
committee reviews situations where adequate credit insurance on the Group’s customers cannot be purchased in the present economic 
climate as required.
 Due to the nature of the business involving applications for payment, contractually overdue amounts within trade and other receivables 
are limited to retentions. The Group has rigorous procedures in place for monitoring and obtaining settlement of retentions in a prompt 
manner. 
 Amounts overdue at 31 December 2011 in respect of retentions were £189,000 (2010: £227,000). 21153.04   26/04/12   Proof 4

Deferred tax in relation to pension scheme losses 172 123
At 31 December (11,177) (13,199)
 The deferred tax assets reducing the deferred tax liability relate to 25% (2010: 27%) of the Group’s deficit on its defined benefit 
retirement scheme of £9,552,000, the valuation of financial instruments and other timing differences.
 Unprovided deferred tax amounted to £59,000 (2010: £71,000).
 The Government announced in March 2011 that it intended to reduce the rate of corporation tax from 27%, to 25% and the Finance 
Act 2011, which was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, included provisions to reduce the rate of corporation tax to 25% with 
effect from 1 April 2012. Accordingly, deferred tax balances have been revalued to the lower rate of 25% in these accounts, which has 
resulted in a credit to the Consolidated Income Statement of £1,085,000 and the Consolidation Statement of Comprehensive Income of 
£191,000.
 The Government has announced in March 2012 a further reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012 
and then by a further 1% each year to 22% by 1 April 2014. As this legislation was not substantively enacted by 31 December 2011, 
the impact of the anticipated rate change is not reflected in the tax provisions reported in these accounts. If the deferred tax assets and 
liabilities of the Group were all to reverse after 1 April 2014, the effect of the changes from 25% to 22% would be to reduce the net 
deferred tax liability by approximately £1,341,000. To the extent that the deferred tax reverses more quickly than this the impact on the 
net deferred tax liability will be reduced.
21. Financial instruments
Capital risk management
 The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the 
return to stakeholders. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and 
equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Gearing ratio
 The Board reviews the capital structure of the Group on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, it considers the cost of capital and the 
risks associated with each class of capital.
 The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 21153.04   26/04/12   Proof 4

 The Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into 
Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
X X Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
X X Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
X X Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
 Derivative financial instruments are the only instruments valued at fair value through profit or loss, and are valued as such on initial 
recognition. These relate to foreign currency forward contracts measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves matching 
the maturities of the contracts. These derivative financial instruments are categorised as Level 2 financial instruments. Except for derivative 
financial instruments, the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities are recorded at amortised cost in the financial 
statements and are considered to approximate their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents
 This comprises cash held by the Group and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of 
these assets approximates their fair value. 21153.04   26/04/12   Proof 4

General risk management principles
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. A formal risk 
assessment and management framework for assessing, monitoring and managing the strategic operational and financial risks of the 
Group is in place to ensure appropriate risk management of its operations. Internal control and risk management systems are embedded 
in the operations of the divisions.
Financial risks and management
 The Group has exposure to a variety of financial risks through the conduct of its operations. Risk management is governed by the 
Group’s operational policies, which are subject to periodic review by the Board of directors.
Credit risk
 The Group’s primary exposure to credit risk arises from the potential for non-payment or default from construction contract debtors. 
The degree to which the Group is exposed to this credit risk depends on the individual characteristics of the contract counterparty 
and the nature of the project. The Group’s credit risk is also influenced by the general macroeconomic conditions. The Group does 
not have significant concentration of risk in respect of amounts due from construction contract customers at the reporting date with 
them being spread across a wide range of customers. Due to the nature of the Group’s operations, it is normal practice for customers 
to hold retentions in respect of contracts completed. Retentions held by customers at 31 December 2011 were £6,991,000 (2010: 
£12,966,000).
 The Group manages its exposure to credit risk through the application of its credit risk management policies which specify the minimum 
requirements in respect of the creditworthiness of potential customers, assessed through reports from credit agencies, and the timing 
and extent of progress payments in respect of contracts. In addition, before accepting any new customer adequate credit insurance 
is taken out as reported in note 17. Where credit insurance is difficult to acquire, the credit insurance committee (comprising T G 
Haughey, P A Emerson and A D Dunsmore) convenes to determine the appropriate exposure for the Group to take with a customer.
 The Group manages the collection of retentions through its post-completion project monitoring procedures and ongoing contact with 
customers so as to ensure that potential issues that could lead to the non-payment of retentions are addressed as soon as they are 
identified.
 Amounts outstanding from construction contract customers are due with reference to the payment terms for each particular contract but 
the majority would be receivable within four months from the end of the reporting period. Amounts due for settlement after 12 months 
are disclosed in note 16.
liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. The ultimate 
responsibility for liquidity risk rests with the Board.
 The Group generates cash through its operations and aims to manage liquidity by ensuring that it will always have sufficient liquidity to 
meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stress conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the 
Group’s reputation. Forecast and actual cash flow is continuously monitored.
 Borrowings represent the Group’s revolving credit facility from the Royal Bank of Scotland and Yorkshire Bank, a member of National 
Australia Bank Group, jointly which provides credit support of up to £50 million at an interest rate of between 1.90% and 2.65% above 
LIBOR subject to the ratio of Group net debt to EBITDA. This facility was renewed in November 2011 and is available for five years 
ending November 2016.
 As at December 2011 £40 million was drawn down on this facility with £10 million of further facility not drawn but available. Up to  
£10 million of this facility is available by way of an overdraft.
 Borrowings outstanding, net of associated issue costs, at 31 December 2011 amounted to £33,159,000 (2010: £18,629,000).

21. Financial instruments continued
Market risk
 The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in credit risks described above, in foreign currency exchange rates 
and interest rates. The Group has entered into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk.
 Market risk exposures are monitored and are supplemented by sensitivity analysis. There has been no change to the Group’s exposure 
to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.
Foreign currency risk management
 The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
 The Group seeks to minimise the effects of currency risks by using derivative financial instruments when appropriate to hedge these 
risk exposures against contracted sales. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board 
of Directors. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments including derivative financial instruments, for speculative 
purposes.
 The carrying value of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
 The Group is only significantly exposed to the euro and US dollar.
 The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in sterling against the relevant foreign currencies.  
Ten per cent is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding 
foreign currency denominated monetary items and derivative financial instruments, and adjusts their translation at the period end for 
a 10% change in foreign currency rates. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other equity where the sterling 
strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. For a 10% weakening of the sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an 
equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.

 The Group’s sensitivity to euros has decreased in 2011 due to the reduced amount of work in the Republic of Ireland.
 At present the Group’s translation exposure to the Indian rupee via its Indian Joint Venture is not significant. Going forward, as the 
business grows, this exposure is expected to become more significant.
Forward foreign exchange contracts
 It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover future euro and US dollar currency receipts on 
relevant contracts.
 At 31 December 2011, the Group had forward exchange contracts held for the sale of 4.90 million euros (2010: 1.20 million euros)  
and 1.04 million US dollars (2010: 8.49 million US dollars) at an average exchange rate of 1.189 euros/£ (2010: 1.166 euros/£) and  
1.544 US dollars/£ (2010: 1.572 US dollars/£) to the pound and maturing within 12 months of the year end. 21153.04   26/04/12   Proof 4
91 Group Accounts 91
interest rate risk management
 The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as described under the borrowings paragraph earlier in this note. The Group does not 
currently hedge any of its interest rate exposure.
interest rate sensitivity analysis
 The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date. For floating rate 
liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the gross amount of liability outstanding at balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole 
year. A 0.5% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
 If interest rates had been 0.5% higher and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 31 December 
2011 and the Group’s equity at that date would decrease by £180,000 (2010: £150,000). This is attributable to the Group’s exposure to 
interest rates on its variable rate borrowings. If the £50 million facility is fully utilised the exposure increases to £250,000.
 The Group’s sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current period due to the increase in the level of borrowings in the year. 
Current indications are that the level of Group borrowings will reduce during 2012 (reducing this exposure accordingly).
22. Share-based payments
 The Group operates a share-based incentive scheme open to all employees of the Group although the current intention is that  
only the Company’s executive directors (being both Main Board directors and certain members of the Executive Committee) and selected 
senior employees will participate in the scheme. Further details are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 58. The 
Group recognised a total charge of £145,000 in the year (2010: charge of £nil) with a corresponding entry to reserves.
Performance Share Plan
 The vesting of awards is subject to performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee. Three outstanding awards had been 
granted to 31 December 2011; a further two have now expired:
X X During 2009 the Remuneration Committee granted 599,151 ordinary shares of 2.5p each at Nil value to the executive directors. 
The vesting of these awards will be dependent on the Company’s earnings per share performance over the three year period from 
1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011, with the following vesting schedule to apply:
Company’s EPS performance for year ending 31 December 2012 % of award vesting
Equal to less than 25.0p 0%
Equal to 30.0p 25%
Equal to 40.0p or better 100%
Between 25.0p and 30.0p Pro rata between 0% and 25%
Between 30.0p and 40.0p Pro rata between 25% and 100%
 The Black–Scholes pricing model has been used to measure the fair value of the shares granted. The assumptions used in the model are 
as follows:
Share price on date of grant £1.53*
Exercise price Nil
Expected volatility (using historic performance) 50%
Risk-free rate 5%
Dividend 15.0p
Expected percentage options exercised versus granted Nil
Actual life three years
 * Granted on 4 February 2009.

 The Black–Scholes pricing model has been used to measure the fair value of the shares granted. The assumptions used in the model are 
as follows:
Share price on date of grant £2.04*
Exercise price Nil
Expected volatility (using historic performance) 50%
Risk-free rate 5%
Dividend 10.0p
Expected percentage options exercised versus granted Nil

 * Granted on 5 March 2010.
 The Black–Scholes model produced, using the above assumptions, an annual charge of £Nil.
X X During 2011 the Remuneration Committee granted a further 720,408 ordinary shares of 2.5p each at Nil value to the executive 
directors. The vesting of these awards will be dependent on the Company’s earnings per share performance over the three year 
period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013, with the following vesting schedule to apply:
Company’s EPS performance for year ending 31 December 2013 % of award vesting
Equal to less than 12.5p 0%
Equal to 25.0p or better 100%
Between 12.5p and 25.0p Pro rata between 0% and 100%
 The Black–Scholes pricing model has been used to measure the fair value of the shares granted. The assumptions used in the model are 
as follows:

Expected volatility (using historic performance) 50%
Risk-free rate 5%
Dividend 10.0p
Expected percentage options exercised versus granted Nil
Actual life three years
 
 * Granted on 14 April 2011.
 The Black–Scholes model produced, using the above assumptions, an annual charge of £145,000.
Share incentive Plan
 During 2010 the Group implemented a Share Incentive Plan for Group employees. As part of the scheme 202,384 new ordinary shares 
of 2.5p were issued which are being held in trust for a three-year period on behalf of 973 Group employees. The vesting of these awards 
will be subject to continued employment for each of the relevant employees. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group 
before the options vest. The share price on the date of issue of the shares (29 October 2010) was £2.41 and the fair value was measured 
based on the market price of the shares at the date of grant. The aggregate of the estimated values of the awards granted in 2010 is 
£488,000. A charge of £155,000 (2010: £35,000) was recognised in the current year in relation to the Share Incentive Plan.

 The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 5 April 
2008 by Mr Christopher Hunter, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related 
current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.

 When investments are held in bonds and cash, the expected long term rate of return is taken to be the yields generally prevailing on 
such assets at the balance sheet date. A higher rate of return is expected on equity investments, which is based more on realistic future 
expectations than on the returns that have been available historically. The overall expected long term rate of return on assets is then the 
average of these rates taking into account the underlying asset portfolio of the pension plan.

102 Severfield—Rowen Plc Annual Report 2011
We have audited the parent company 
financial statements of Severfield–Rowen 
Plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 
which comprise the Company Balance Sheet 
and the related notes 1 to 15. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of 
directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the Audit of the Financial 
Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the 
parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements. If we 
become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report.
Opinion on Financial Statements
In our opinion the parent company financial 
statements:
X X give a true and fair view of the state of 
the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2011 and of its loss for 
the year then ended;
X X have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; 
and
X X have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006.
Opinion on Other Matters Prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for 
which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the parent company 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
following matters where the Companies Act 
2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
X X adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
X X the parent company financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
X X certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or
X X we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our 
audit.
Other Matter
We have reported separately on the Group 
financial statements of Severfield–Rowen 
Plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 
and on the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as 
having been audited.

1. Significant accounting policies
basis of accounting
 The separate financial statements of the 
Company are presented as required by 
the Companies Act 2006. They have 
been prepared under the historical cost 
convention and in accordance with 
applicable UK accounting standards (UK 
GAAP).
Going concern
 After making enquiries, the directors 
have formed a judgement at the time 
of approving the financial statements 
that there is a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason 
the directors continue to adopt a going 
concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. The key factors considered 
by the directors in making the statement 
are set out within the Financial Review 
on pages 25 to 26.
Profit and loss account
 In accordance with the exemption 
allowed by section 408 of the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company has 
not presented its own profit and loss 
account.
Cash flow
 The Company is exempt from the 
requirements of Financial Reporting 
Standard No. 1 (Revised) “Cash Flow 
Statements”.
Tangible fixed assets
 Freehold and long leasehold land is held 
at cost and not depreciated.
 Depreciation is provided on other fixed 
assets to write off the cost of each asset 
over its estimated useful life at the 
following rates: 
 Freehold buildings 1% straight-line
intangible fixed assets
 Intangible fixed assets relate to 
capitalised software costs.
 These are in relation to systems that 
as at 31 December 2011 were in the 
commissioning phase and accordingly, 
to date, no amortisation has been 
charged.
 Going forward amortisation will be 
applied over the following periods:
 Software costs  7 years 
investments
 Fixed asset investments are shown at 
cost less provision for impairment.
Taxation
 Current tax, including UK corporation 
tax and foreign tax, is provided 
at amounts expected to be paid (or 
recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
 Deferred tax is provided in full on 
timing differences which result in an 
obligation at the balance sheet date 
to pay more tax, or a right to pay less 
tax, at a future date, at rates expected 
to apply when they crystallise based 
on current tax rates and law. Timing 
differences arise from the inclusion 
of items of income and expenditure 
in taxation computations in periods 
different from those which they are 
included in financial statements.
 Deferred tax is not provided on timing 
differences arising from the revaluation 
of fixed assets where there is no 
commitment to sell the asset, or on 
unremitted earnings of subsidiaries 
and associates where there is no 
commitment to remit these earnings. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is regarded as 
more likely than not that they will be 
recovered. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not discounted.
Share-based payments
 Share-based payments are accounted 
for as described in the Group 
accounting policies on page 72.
Related party transactions
 The Company has taken advantage of 
the exemption granted by paragraph 
3(b) of FRS 8 (Related Party Disclosures) 
not to disclose transactions with other 
wholly owned Group companies.

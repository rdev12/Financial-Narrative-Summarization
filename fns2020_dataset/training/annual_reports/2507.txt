Our Strategy
Is to achieve world class operational and 
safety excellence through investment in 
our plant and people and secure a pivotal 
role in the Nuclear New Build programme 
in the UK.
ACHIEVE WORLD 
CLASS OPERATIONAL 
SAFETY AND 
EXCELLENCE 
With safety at the heart of everything we do, we are focused 
on producing more electricity, more reliably, by channelling 
our investment and resources into optimising our plant, and 
achieving outstanding human performance. 
IMPROVE OUR 
FINANCIAL STABILITY 
We work to improve our ﬁ nancial stability through careful 
management of the ﬁ xed price trading book and management 
of our credit facilities. By contracting ahead the sale of 
electrical output, we achieve greater price certainty, 
minimising exposure to short-term market prices.

 BUSINESS SUMMARY
Key Performance Indicators
We measure our performance against our 
strategic priorities and by reference to a 
number of key performance indicators. 
Output is the amount of electricity produced by our ﬂ eet of 
power stations. Output for the year was 58.4TWh, the same 
as last year. Output in the year was adversely affected by 
the Boiler Closure Unit issue at Hartlepool and Heysham 1 
and the boiler temperature restrictions at Hinkley Point B 
and Hunterston B, offset by a signiﬁ cant improvement in 
the level of small unplanned losses and higher output from 
our coal-ﬁ red power station, Eggborough.
UCLF provides a measure of unplanned energy losses. 
In 2007/08 UCLF increased to 24% compared with 23% 
in 2006/07, mainly reﬂ ecting losses attributable to the 
Boiler Closure Unit issue in 2007/08 and boiler issues 
at Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B in both years.
Realised price is a measure of the price we achieve for 
output sold. In 2007/08 we achieved a realised price 
of £40.7/MWh, down from £44.2/MWh in 2006/07. 
Nuclear Reportable Events (NRE) are events reported to the 
Nuclear Installations Inspectorate in compliance with our 
nuclear site licences. These reduced from a peak of 77 in 
2003/04 to four in 2007/08, a best ever record.
Unplanned Automatic Trips are a source of unplanned 
losses, where a reactor shuts down through its inbuilt 
safety system. Eight Unplanned Automatic Trips 
occurred in 2007/08, sustaining the performance 
achieved in 2006/07, down from 25 in 2003/04. 
Our employees and contractors incurred 19 Lost Time 
Accidents (LTA), resulting in one or more days off work, 
whilst working at our nuclear sites and support functions 
during the year, a reduction from 22 in 2006/07.
Environmental events arise from wastes or discharges 
above permitted levels or breaches of permitted conditions. 
We monitor our environmental performance conservatively, 
and in 2007/08, all of the 15 Environmental Events that we 
classiﬁ ed as being of greatest signiﬁ cance (our lowest annual 
total) were categorised by our environmental regulator as 
being minor or having no environmental impact.

Chairman’s Statement
Our objectives are clear: to maximise 
value in the existing asset base through 
careful stewardship and investment, 
while positioning ourselves for a pivotal 
role in the New Nuclear Build programme.
Output from our nuclear power stations 
during the year was materially impacted 
by boiler temperature restrictions at two 
stations and a further two stations coming 
ofﬂ ine to rectify the Boiler Closure Unit 
issue. As a result, total output for the 
year masked positive progress in the 
management of small generation losses 
and safety and environmental performance 
across the ﬂ eet. The progress that has been 
made in developing a culture of increasing 
operational safety and excellence across 
our ﬂ eet is most visible in the world class 
operation of Sizewell B, our Pressurised 
Water Reactor. Our ongoing investment 
in our plant and our people underpins our 
ambition to continue extending the life 
of our plants. This year we announced the 
extension of the accounting lives of Hinkley 
Point B and Hunterston B by ﬁ ve years, 
from 2011 to 2016.
There is growing recognition of the 
importance of energy policy in the United 
Kingdom and around the world. With 
increased awareness of climate change, the 
issue of reducing carbon emissions is now 
recognised alongside energy price stability 
and security of supply as one of the major 
challenges facing the United Kingdom 
economy. As the lowest carbon emitter 
of the major electricity generators in the 
United Kingdom and the only low carbon 
baseload generator, the contribution that 
British Energy is making towards meeting 
this complex challenge has become 
increasingly clear.
The case has now been made for nuclear 
to play a role within a balanced energy 
policy. We welcome the Government’s 
commitment to remove barriers to the 
industry taking forward new nuclear 
projects. Initiatives include making progress 
on radioactive waste management and 
decommissioning policy, reform of the 
planning system, reviewing the regulatory 
framework and clarifying national policy 
on the need for new generation capacity. 
We also welcome Government’s plans 
to strengthen commitments to combat 
climate change and set ambitious targets 
for CO
2
 reduction combined with a market 
driven approach to reducing emissions 
through emissions trading. Delivery of 
a major programme of investment in 
new nuclear for the United Kingdom 
will require a disciplined approach and, 
on occasion, competing priorities will 
need to be evaluated.

BUSINESS SUMMARY
Given the scale of interest in potential 
nuclear new build opportunities, and 
the signiﬁ cant investment required to 
construct a new ﬂ eet, the Board has 
engaged in discussions with interested 
parties in the context of the Company’s 
future and its plans to play a pivotal role 
in any nuclear new build programme. 
On 17 March 2008, we announced that, as 
part of the full range of strategic options 
under consideration, the discussions could 
lead to a business combination or an offer 
for the Company. On 16 May 2008, we 
updated the market on these discussions, 
which are continuing.
An additional dividend of 14.5p per 
ordinary share was paid to shareholders 
on 3 April 2008. I am now pleased to 
conﬁ rm that, in line with the stated 
dividend policy, the Board has agreed to 
recommend the payment of this year’s 
base dividend of 13.6p per share, subject 
to approval at the AGM.
Robert Walvis joined the Board in 
August 2007 as a Non-Executive Director. 
This year, Ian Harley, David Pryde, Robert 
Walvis and I will be standing for election 
to the Board at our AGM.
Notwithstanding the ongoing technical 
issues affecting our plant and the 
challenges this will bring in the coming 
year, there is much to be positive about. 
We have a superb team of nuclear 
professionals at British Energy, dedicated 
to the safe operation of the ﬂ eet. Their 
expertise will be invaluable as the United 
Kingdom looks towards the next 
generation of nuclear assets. Our 
objectives are therefore clear: to maximise 
value in the existing asset base through 
careful stewardship and investment, while 
positioning ourselves for a pivotal role in 
the new build programme.

Chief Executive’s Business Review
Nuclear output and earnings were 
lower than the prior year. However, 
investment in the ﬂ eet has resulted 
in signiﬁ cant operational improvement 
across the stations – small losses were 
at their lowest recorded level.
We will consider the lifetime extension 
of other stations three years before their 
current accounting closure dates.
We are embedding a culture of operational 
safety and excellence through investment 
in our people and our working practices. 
Many visits to British Energy have been 
made by other nuclear operators to 
learn from our human performance 
programmes. We have taken on over 
60 graduates and apprentices in the year 
as part of our human resource planning 
initiatives, to train the nuclear professionals 
needed to accommodate succession 
planning, station life extensions and 
provide a core of employees for nuclear 
new build.
Despite difﬁ cult market conditions, good 
progress has been made in extending 
the depth of the trading book, and we 
successfully managed the ﬁ nancial impact 
of buying back power as a result of the 
BCU issue at Hartlepool and Heysham 1. 
We believe that the low carbon nature of 
our nuclear generation has the opportunity 
to create additional value as businesses 
search for cost effective ways to lower 
their carbon footprints.
Government has clearly made the case for 
nuclear new build in the United Kingdom as 
part of a balanced energy strategy. We are 
uniquely positioned to participate in nuclear 
new build. Our sites are particularly attractive 
assets for a new build programme and we 
seek to maximise the value of those sites for 
our shareholders. An equally important asset, 
however, is our large complement of skilled 
nuclear professionals who will be key for a 
successful new build programme.
Market and Strategic Priorities
Our principal activities are the generation 
and sale of electricity. Our strategic 
priorities are to:
achieve world class operational safety • 
and excellence;
improve our ﬁ nancial stability; • 
pursue life extensions for our stations; • 
and
position British Energy for nuclear new • 
build. 
Underlying these priorities is our individual 
and corporate commitment to 
environmental excellence.
 
We use a number of key performance 
indicators to measure performance against 
our strategic priorities and our commitment 
to safety and environmental excellence. 
These include output, Unplanned Capability 
Loss Factor (UCLF), Unplanned Automatic 
Trips, Lost Time Accidents (LTA), 
Environmental Events and the depth of the 
ﬁ xed trading book, as well as the progress in 
achieving low or zero collateral sales.
Operations Review
Nuclear Stations
Our nuclear output for the year was 
50.3TWh which was 0.9TWh lower 
than last year’s output of 51.2TWh. UCLF 
increased slightly to 24% compared with 
23% in the previous year. While nuclear 
output was signiﬁ cantly impacted during 
the ﬁ nancial year, principally in respect 
of BCUs and boiler issues (which also 
affected output last year), we have made 
considerable progress to manage the 
challenges presented.
Overview
In ﬁ nancial year 2007/08 nuclear output 
and earnings were lower than the prior year 
because of signiﬁ cant technical challenges 
with the Boiler Closure Unit (BCU) issue at 
Hartlepool and Heysham 1 and lower loads 
at Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B to 
reduce boiler tube temperatures.
Looking beyond the challenges with the 
BCUs, the investment in the ﬂ eet has 
resulted in signiﬁ cant operational 
improvement across the stations.
Small losses
1
 were at their lowest recorded 
level, and there are improvements in many 
other performance metrics, with some at 
best ever levels. Sizewell B, our Pressurised 
Water Reactor (PWR), is operating to 
world class standards, having operated 
continuously for 516 days between statutory 
outages – a best ever run for the station.
We are conﬁ dent in our strategy for 
managing original design issues inherent in 
our unique Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactors 
(AGRs) to increase their reliability, output 
and prospects for life extension.
We continue to invest to improve the safe, 
long-term reliability and performance of 
the ﬂ eet by proactively targeting 
investment to improve materiel condition. 
Building on the progress over the past 
three years, we are now targeting more 
investment to mitigate risks that might 
give rise to future losses. During the year 
we announced the lifetime extension of 
Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B by ﬁ ve 
years to 2016. Further extension of these 
stations’ lives will be reviewed by 2013.

(Numbers rounded)
Output is stated after total non-routine 
nuclear losses of 23.5TWh compared to 
21.0TWh of losses in the previous year. 
Losses in the year comprise 11.1TWh 
attributable to boiler inspection/repair 
outages and reduced load operation at 
Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B (of which 
6.6TWh were planned at the start of the 
year), 8.6TWh attributable to the BCU issue 
at Hartlepool and Heysham 1 and 3.8TWh 
attributable to other events.
Sizewell B, our PWR power station, 
continues to perform to excellent standards, 
achieving a record continuous reactor run 
of 516 days between its statutory/refuelling 
outages in September 2006 and March 
2008. The station has since returned to 
service after a 25 day outage, another 
station record. The outage was completed 
with no LTAs, Nuclear Reportable Events 
(NRE) or Environmental Events.
The four units at Hartlepool and 
Heysham 1 remain shutdown as a result 
of the BCU issue. An update on the 
progress of this issue is set out below.
During the year we returned to service 
all four units at Hinkley Point B and 
Hunterston B following boiler inspections 
and repairs. Losses associated with the 
delayed return to service and the 
subsequent boiler inspection outage
at Hunterston B Reactor 3 were 3.1TWh. 
During the year, the four units achieved
 a maximum output of between 55% and 
69% of their former full load output, with 
associated boiler restriction losses of 
8.0TWh. Since returning to service at the 
new operating load, both stations have 
achieved very low levels of unplanned 
losses with one unit at Hinkley Point B 
completing its longest recorded 
continuous run.
In addition to these major 
unplanned losses, there were 4.1TWh 
(2006/07: 8.6TWh) of smaller losses of 
under 1TWh each. After taking account 
of outage and refuelling under/overruns, 
the net loss arising was 3.8TWh.
 
Boiler Closure Unit Status 
BCUs are unique to Hartlepool and 
Heysham 1 power stations. There are 
eight BCUs on each reactor which form 
part of the reactor pressure boundary. 
Each BCU is pre-stressed with nine layers 
of wire windings, wound around its outer 
periphery. In the September 2007 
statutory outage at Hartlepool Reactor 1, 
a broken wire was found on one BCU 
during a planned inspection. Having 
identiﬁ ed a broken wire, we took the 
conservative decision to take the sister 
units at Hartlepool and Heysham 1 out 
of service, pending inspection and 
assessment.
To date, over 660,000 man hours have 
been spent inspecting and assessing 
the condition of the wire windings on 
all 32 BCUs. Engineering modiﬁ cations 
have been identiﬁ ed and developed to 
reduce reliance on the wire windings. 
These include a mechanism to lock in the 
existing pre-stress in the BCUs, installation 
of an engineered steel restraint, upgrading 
the BCU cooling systems and installing 
additional instrumentation to monitor 
the BCUs whilst in operation. The testing, 
materials procurement, manufacture 
and installation of these modiﬁ cations 
is progressing to plan. We expect the 
ﬁ tting of circumferential bands, which are 
designed to lock in the existing pre-stress, 
to commence in June 2008.
A restart team has been established 
which has the responsibility for delivering 
the smooth return to service of all four 
units, expected to be in a phased process 
over the second and third quarters of 
ﬁ nancial year 2008/09. Return to service 
requires regulatory approval of the safety 
case for each reactor. From the outset, 
the Regulator has had full view of the 
project and we continue to work with 
the Regulator to achieve the return to 
service of all four units.
Costs of £20m were incurred in the year 
in connection with BCUs. The remaining 
cost of commissioning and installing the 
Output is the amount of electricity produced by our ﬂ eet of 
power stations. Output for the year was 58.4TWh, the same 
as last year. Output in the year was adversely affected by 
the Boiler Closure Unit issue at Hartlepool and Heysham 1 
and the boiler temperature restrictions at Hinkley Point B 
and Hunterston B, offset by a signiﬁ cant improvement in 
the level of small unplanned losses and higher output from 
our coal-ﬁ red power station, Eggborough.
UCLF provides a measure of unplanned energy losses.
In 2007/08 UCLF increased to 24% compared with 23% 
in 2006/07, mainly reﬂ ecting losses attributable to the 
Boiler Closure Unit issue in 2007/08 and boiler issues at 
Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B in both years.
Realised price is a measure of the price we achieve for 
output sold. In 2007/08 we achieved a realised price 
of £40.7/MWh, down from £44.2/MWh in 2006/07.

engineering modiﬁ cations is expected to 
be around £50m, and will be incurred in 
ﬁ nancial year 2008/09. An arrangement 
is in place to incentivise suppliers to return 
the units to service ahead of schedule.
We have managed our trading book to buy 
back power which we had contracted to sell 
prior to Hartlepool and Heysham 1 power 
stations being taken out of service. As at 
18 May 2008 we had incurred a total net 
cost of £70m in relation to power buybacks 
in respect of ﬁ nancial year 2007/08 and 
£50m in respect of ﬁ nancial year 2008/09. 
We continue to manage our trading book 
position in line with the expected phased 
return to service of the units.
Boiler Issues Status
Following the completion of boiler 
inspections and required repairs at Hinkley 
Point B and Hunterston B, all four units 
returned to service during May 2007 and 
June 2007. We have been operating at 
reduced load to limit boiler tube 
temperatures. 
A further planned boiler inspection outage 
at Hunterston B Reactor 3 was undertaken 
between February 2008 and April 2008. 
During the outage, a number of previously 
isolated boiler tubes were returned to 
service and further boiler balancing work 
was undertaken. Thermocouples were 
installed in one boiler to provide additional 
temperature measurements. A number of 
prototype boiler tube bifurcation insulation 
boxes (‘clamshells’) were installed for 
evaluation. Subject to satisfactory 
operating results and development of a 
satisfactory safety case, these may allow 
future operation at higher loads. Following 
an update to the safety case using the 
latest inspection data, the unit was 
returned to service in May 2008 and is 
currently operating at around 70% load, the 
maximum allowed load within our target 
temperature limits.
Hinkley Point B Reactor 4 is also operating 
at around 70% load. Hinkley Point B 
Reactor 3 has been running at around 
64% load, and boiler balancing work is 
to be performed in a scheduled boiler 
outage next ﬁ nancial year.
The statutory/boiler outage at 
Hunterston B Reactor 4 is currently 
underway. Boiler inspections and 
modiﬁ cations will also be undertaken 
during the planned statutory outage at 
Hinkley Point B Reactor 4 later this ﬁ nancial 
year, 2008/09. As a result of updated boiler 
modelling, the Hinkley Point B Reactor 3 
boiler inspection planned for this ﬁ nancial 
year, 2008/09, has been deferred and it will 
be combined with the planned statutory 
outage next ﬁ nancial year, 2009/10. A 
reduced duration outage is still planned 
this summer for Hinkley Point B Reactor 3, 
to complete a number of plant 
modiﬁ cations and carry out graphite 
core inspections.
Overall, boilers are assessed as the plant 
system at most risk of causing generation 
losses across the ﬂ eet and therefore 
considerable investment focus is placed 
on mitigating these risks.
Dungeness Fuel Plug Status
The length of refuelling outages at 
Dungeness B has been temporarily 
extended since September 2006 to 
address an issue with certain welds 
within the fuel plug units. A crimping 
device which mitigates the issue has been 
developed, installed and commissioned. 
As our work has progressed we have 
identiﬁ ed the need for further conﬁ rmatory 
testing to support a safety case, following 
which the plug units can be crimped and 
refuelling can proceed.
Hot Box Dome Status
Load was reduced on Heysham 1 Reactor 2 
to approximately 80% of full load in 
October 2006 to reduce the surface 
temperature on the Hot Box Dome, below 
380°C. Over the course of the year we 
partially recovered output to 
approximately 87% of full load.
We plan to submit a revised safety case 
to the Regulator later this ﬁ nancial year, 
applicable to all four units at Hartlepool 
and Heysham 1, to increase the operating 
temperature limit to 390°C. This would 
enable the potential for Heysham 1 
Reactor 2 to increase to approximately 
95% of full power.
Heysham 2 Fuelling Machine Status
The intermittent problem with the fuelling 
machine at Heysham 2 was determined to 
be related to the turret top bearing and has 
been corrected.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
BUSINESS REVIEW
Eggborough
Output from Eggborough, our coal-ﬁ red 
power station, was 8.1TWh for the year, 
compared with 7.2TWh in 2006/07. Unlike 
the nuclear stations, which operate as 
baseload plant, Eggborough operates 
as ﬂ exible generation. We continue to 
maximise Eggborough’s contribution by 
optimising its running against changing 
power, coal and carbon prices and at the 
same time meeting our environmental 
commitments.
During the year, the European Commission 
released its plans for Phase III of the 
European Union Emissions Trading Scheme 
(EU ETS), which will run from 2013 to 2020. 
Under the plans, which aim to reduce 
carbon emissions by 20% by 2020, the 
power sector will receive no free carbon 
allowances and will instead operate a full 
auctioning system. Under Phase I of the 
EU ETS (which ended in December 2007) 
Eggborough received 4.54m free carbon 
allowances per annum, increasing to 4.75m 
free allowances per annum under Phase II of 
the scheme, which runs from 2008 to 2012.
The Large Combustion Plant Directive 
(LCPD) became effective on 1 January 2008 
and introduced new requirements 
impacting emissions by Eggborough. 
Eggborough is now operating within the 
National Emission Reduction Plan (NERP) 
regime under the LCPD. Subject to fuel 
choice, market prices and plant availability, 
output is expected to be in line with, or in 
excess of, recent levels whilst complying 
fully with emission restrictions.
During ﬁ nancial year 2007/08, a statutory 
outage was completed on Eggborough 
Unit 3. This was the largest single unit 
outage programme carried out at the 
station under British Energy ownership, 
and incorporated an extensive investment 
programme. The outage was completed 
on schedule, to budget and with no LTAs.
Investment in Plant and People
Investment in Plant in ﬁ nancial year 
2007/08 was £283m (of which investment 
at Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B was 
£73m). In addition, £20m incremental 
expenditure in respect of the BCUs at 
Hartlepool and Heysham 1 was incurred. 
Investment in Plant in the prior year was 
£264m, together with £24m incremental 
expenditure in respect of boiler issues at 
Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B.
Investment in Plant in the year includes: 
regulatory and essential works, including 
preparation of Periodic Safety Review 
documentation; works to enhance the 
prospects of lifetime extensions, including 
investment in underground cast iron 
pipework and in boiler safety cases for 
Hartlepool and Heysham 1; and works to 
maintain reliability, including the ﬂ eet fuel 
route investment programme, investment 
in sea water pipework replacement at 
Heysham 2 and Torness and investment 
in the intermediate level waste storage 
facility at Sizewell B.
Work also continues at Hinkley Point B and 
Hunterston B to balance and inspect the 
boilers and at Hartlepool and Heysham 1 
in connection with the BCU project.
Statutory outages have been completed 
in the year at Heysham 2, Heysham 1, 
Torness and Hartlepool. Hunterston B 
and Hinkley Point B also completed their 
outages which had commenced in 2006/07. 
Hunterston B Reactor 3 was returned to 
service in May 2008 following planned 
boiler inspection and repair. The statutory 
outage at Sizewell B commenced in 
March 2008 and was successfully completed 
on 15 April 2008. Hartlepool and Heysham 1 
remain out of service for BCU inspections 
and assessment.
We continue to focus on human 
performance across the business and 
recently opened our Nuclear Power 
Academy at Barnwood, a facility speciﬁ cally 
designed to support operational safety and 
excellence and reinforce the key principles 
of nuclear professionalism. Our human 
performance programme was commended 
by the World Association of Nuclear 
Operators (WANO). During the year, we 
increased our headcount by approximately 
100, as part of human resource planning 
initiatives across the business.
Our sustained focus on improvement 
throughout the organisation continues 
to produce successes in underlying 
performance. Materiel condition 
improvements are targeted investments 
to repair, refurbish or replace plant 
components to deliver increased reliability. 
Achievements in the year include attaining 
the lowest ever recorded level of small 
unplanned losses, an indication of the 
improvements we have made to the 
materiel condition of our plant together 
with improvements in human performance.

Underpinning these successes is a culture 
of nuclear professionalism which is evident 
throughout our workforce and I am 
extremely proud of the team we have 
at British Energy. Nuclear professionalism 
means taking responsibility for the plant, 
promoting an open reporting culture, 
continually learning from past experience 
and applying simple error prevention 
techniques.
Safety Performance
Our overriding priority is to ensure that 
the nuclear, industrial, radiological and 
environmental safety of our operations is 
effectively managed and assured. Having 
a strong safety culture embedded in the 
organisation is crucial to achieving 
these goals.
The actual and potential signiﬁ cance of 
individual nuclear events is measured 
against the International Nuclear Event 
Scale (INES). During ﬁ nancial year 2007/08 
we had no nuclear safety events rated 
higher than INES Level 1, where Level 1 
represents events that have no impact 
on the safety of the general public or our 
workforce. In addition, we monitor the 
number of NREs arising. In ﬁ nancial year 
2007/08 we achieved our lowest recorded 
level ever, with only four events, compared 
to 77 four years ago in 2003/04.
We operate to strict procedures to 
minimise and control the radiation doses 
received by employees and contractors 
at all of our nuclear power stations. Any 
worker required to enter a radiation 
controlled area is issued with an electronic 
personal dosemeter which measures 
radiation dose and warns the wearer if 
pre-determined dose levels are exceeded.
Radiation dose is measured in units of 
milliSieverts (mSv). We impose a dose 
restriction of 10 mSv per annum, beyond 
which dose may only be incurred with 
prior permission. This is half the annual 
legal dose limit. In calendar year 2007 
the average individual dose received by 
all workers on our sites was 0.081 mSv. 
The highest individual dose received by 
a British Energy employee was 4.648 mSv 
and the highest individual dose received 
by a contractor was 5.987 mSv. The 
Company’s collective dose performance 
remains amongst the best when compared 
to nuclear operations worldwide.
In addition to the signiﬁ cant improvement 
in the number of NREs, we have achieved 
improvements in the number of LTAs 
incurred in recent years. 19 LTAs were 
sustained by employees and contractors 
working at our nuclear sites and support 
functions in ﬁ nancial year 2007/08. 
British Energy employees had the lowest 
number of LTAs in the Company’s history. 
Continuous improvement in our safety 
performance has been, and continues to be, 
a high priority for our staff and contractors.
During the year we engaged with our 
principal contractor partners in a 
collaborative approach to being Incident 
and Injury Free (IIF), an initiative to promote 
common standards and the behaviours 
which underpin safe working practice and 
actions. A new behavioural safety initiative 
known as ALTA (Ask, Listen, Think, Act) was 
launched during the year at Eggborough to 
encompass staff and long-term contractors 
at the site. On 3 April 2008 Eggborough 
celebrated a full year without an LTA.
Environmental Performance
As with safety, environmental excellence 
is achieved through a constant focus, 
addressing issues before there is 
environmental impact. We have 
established very conservative monitoring 
of environmental performance at British 
Energy, well below any regulatory limits, in 
which every incident is reported, no matter 
how trivial. The key to preventing more 
serious incidents is to mitigate and learn 
from the less signiﬁ cant ones. During 
ﬁ nancial year 2007/08 our staff and 
contracting partners reported over 2,000 
environmental observations, of which 
15 were classiﬁ ed as being of higher 
signiﬁ cance on the British Energy scale. 
This was the lowest ever annual total. 
All 15 were rated by our environmental 
regulators as having minor or no 
environmental impact.
All radioactive waste produced by our 
power stations is regulated and carefully 
managed to minimise and control 
discharges. During the course of the year 
none of our stations exceeded authorised 
radiological discharge limits. 
Financial Stability from our Trading and 
Sales Strategy
The overriding priority of our Trading and 
Sales strategy is to increase ﬁ nancial 
stability for the business. Our objectives 
are to trade our output to optimise value, 
minimise the market costs of unplanned 
output losses and increase the depth of

 DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
BUSINESS REVIEW
the ﬁ xed price portion of the trading book. 
We have developed zero-collateral and 
collateral efﬁ cient routes to market to 
reduce the impact of price volatility on 
collateral. A future focus of our Trading 
and Sales division will be to capture the 
beneﬁ t of the low carbon nature of our 
nuclear generation.
 
The forward price of annual baseload 
electricity commencing October 2008 rose 
from £39/MWh at the start of April 2007 to 
£61/MWh as at 31 March 2008. Coal prices 
rose throughout the year to record highs. 
The price of annual coal delivered to 
European ports, commencing January 
2009, rose from $72/tonne at the start 
of April 2007 to $124/tonne as at 31 March 
2008. Prices of Phase II carbon allowances 
for delivery in December 2008 rose from 
€17/tonne CO
2
 at the start of April 2007, 
peaked at €25/tonne CO
2
 in May 2007, 
and ended the year at €22/tonne CO
2
 
as at 31 March 2008.
 
Clean dark spread prices (being the 
electricity price, less costs of coal and 
carbon allowances) for the Winter 08 
and Summer 09 seasons reduced during 
the ﬁ rst six months of the year as coal 
prices rose, then increased as power prices 
increased. Clean dark spread prices for 
Winter 08 and Summer 09 at the start 
of April 2007 were £16/MWh and £11/MWh 
respectively, rising to £22/MWh and 
£12/MWh respectively as at 31 March 2008.
Our realised price for ﬁ nancial year 2007/08 
was £40.7/MWh, a decrease of £3.5/MWh 
compared with a realised price of 
£44.2/MWh in 2006/07. The reduction 
reﬂ ects the prevailing market price at the 
time of contracting forward sales of power, 
together with the net cost of buying back 
power as a result of the lost output arising 
from the BCU issue at Hartlepool and 
Heysham 1. Our contracted price position 
continues to include the impact of capped 
price contracts entered into at a time when 
signiﬁ cantly lower market prices prevailed. 
The contract portfolio also includes 
proﬁ led contracts (both wholesale and 
direct sales) and therefore the contracted 
price is not directly comparable to a 
baseload market price.
Cash posted as collateral in support 
of trading activities and cash held for 
variation margin calls was £280m as at 
31 March 2008, compared to £141m as 
at 31 March 2007, and reached a peak of 
approximately £360m in December 2007. 
As at 31 March 2008, we had committed 
letter of credit facilities of £350m, undrawn 
and available to support collateral calls.
In addition to our wholesale sales, British 
Energy Direct delivered around 27.1TWh of 
electricity during the ﬁ nancial year 2007/08 
and signed contracts for the supply of 
around 15.6TWh including future year 
deliveries. As at 31 March 2008 British 
Energy Direct was supplying over 1,080 
customers across more than 8,700 sites 
within the United Kingdom.
Pursuing Lifetime Extensions
In December 2007, having completed 
the necessary technical and economic 
evaluation and received the relevant 
external consents, we took the decision 
to extend the accounting lives of 
Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B by ﬁ ve 
years to 2016. The decision extends the life 
of these stations for accounting purposes to 
40 years. Further studies will be conducted 
by 2013 regarding the potential for 
additional life extension of these stations 
beyond 2016.
We will consider lifetime extensions for 
other stations, which will be completed 
a minimum of three years before the 
scheduled closure date of each station.
Nuclear New Build
Following a process of consultation, the 
Government published a White Paper on 
Nuclear Power on 10 January 2008, stating 
that nuclear power should be part of the 
country’s balanced future energy mix, and 
that it is in the public interest for energy 
companies to have the option to invest in 
new nuclear power stations. We welcome 
their statements of support for new 
nuclear as part of a balanced energy policy.
The Government is taking forward a number 
of actions that will facilitate new investment. 
These include reform of the planning system, 
strategic assessment of siting options, 
co-ordinated regulatory reviews and 
strengthening the emissions trading scheme. 
In addition, the Energy Bill, which was 
introduced in January 2008 includes 
important clauses on the arrangements for 
funding of decommissioning and radioactive 
waste disposal. A Government consultation 
on the requirements for a funded 
decommissioning programme was issued on 
22 February 2008. The Government is also 
taking forward its policy on radioactive waste 
management through a consultation that 
Nuclear Reportable Events (NRE) are events reported to the 
Nuclear Installations Inspectorate in compliance with our 
nuclear site licences. These reduced from a peak of 77 in 
2003/04 to four in 2007/08, a best ever record.
Our employees and contractors incurred 19 Lost Time 
Accidents (LTA), resulting in one or more days off work, 
whilst working at our nuclear sites and support functions 
during the year, a reduction from 22 in 2006/07.
Environmental events arise from wastes or discharges 
above permitted levels or breaches of permitted conditions. 
We monitor our environmental performance conservatively, 
and in 2007/08, all of the 15 Environmental Events that we 
classiﬁ ed as being of greatest signiﬁ cance (our lowest annual 
total) were categorised by our environmental regulator as 
being minor or having no environmental impact.

started in 2007 and appointments to an 
advisory Committee on Radioactive Waste 
Management (CoRWM). A White Paper in 
response to the consultation on managing 
radioactive waste safely is expected shortly.
We continue to make prudent investments 
to secure a pivotal role in new nuclear 
build, maximise the value of our sites 
and, especially, the contribution from our 
experienced staff. We have established 
a dedicated team to take forward all 
aspects of new build, drawing on particular 
strengths in licensing, planning, waste 
management, engineering and operations 
from across British Energy.
 
We own eight sites next to existing licensed 
nuclear facilities that are among the best 
potential candidates for the construction 
of new nuclear power stations. We are 
evaluating all eight sites, although our four 
priority sites for the ﬁ rst new build units 
are in the south of England – at Sizewell, 
Hinkley Point, Dungeness and Bradwell. 
We have commissioned a range of surveys 
to gather data for environmental impact 
assessment at these four locations and 
in November 2007 we secured transmission 
connection and construction agreements 
with National Grid for a total of 
approximately 10.8GW gross capacity 
from 2016 at these sites. In line with 
standard industry terms, we have provided 
security of around £2/kW of transmission 
capacity to National Grid. This will increase 
by a further £1/kW in ﬁ nancial year 2008/09. 
We are continuing an active dialogue with 
local stakeholders around all our sites, in 
order to keep the local community informed 
and assure that we understand local issues 
ahead of any planning applications.
Four candidate reactor designs were 
submitted to the regulatory authorities for 
generic design assessment in June 2007. 
Based on the initial review, the regulators 
concluded that there were no fundamental 
reasons to disqualify any of the designs. 
Following the withdrawal of one design, 
three have gone forward to the next 
phase of generic design assessment. 
We are reviewing their construction and 
operational characteristics, projected 
performance, commercial attractiveness 
and suitability for use in the United 
Kingdom. We have not ruled out any 
of the three designs at this stage.
Outlook for Financial Year 2008/09
Operations
Moving into ﬁ nancial year 2008/09 our 
priorities remain unchanged. We will 
continue to focus on delivering 
improvements to our performance 
throughout our organisation to ensure 
safe, reliable generation. 
Total output to 18 May was 5.8TWh, 
comprising 4.7TWh of nuclear output 
and 1.1TWh of output from Eggborough, 
after total non-routine losses of 4.8TWh, 
of which 4.2TWh were planned, mainly 
in respect of BCU outage and boiler 
temperature restrictions. 
During ﬁ nancial year 2008/09 we will 
be undertaking statutory outages at 
Heysham 1, Hunterston B, Dungeness B, 
Heysham 2 and Hinkley Point B. In addition, 
a reduced duration outage will take place 
at Hinkley Point B Reactor 3 to complete 
a number of plant modiﬁ cations and to 
undertake graphite core inspections. This is 
the largest programme of outages that we 
have undertaken for many years. We have 
sought to mitigate the inherent risk of 
delayed return to service through careful 
planning and by proactively identifying 
potential safety case requirements.
The boiler inspection outage at Hunterston B 
Reactor 3 which started in February 2008 
and the statutory outage at Sizewell B 
which started in March 2008 were 
completed in May 2008 and April 2008 
respectively. Hartlepool and Heysham 1 
remain out of service while the BCU project 
is ongoing, although we expect the units to 
return to service during the second and 
third quarters of this ﬁ nancial year.
 
We plan to submit a revised safety case 
to the Regulator in respect of the Hot Box 
Dome which would enable the potential 
for Heysham 1 Reactor 2 to increase to 
approximately 95% of full power.
As described in the Operations Review, 
refuelling outages at Dungeness B continue 
to be affected by the fuel plug unit weld 
issue. As our work has progressed we have 
identiﬁ ed the need for further conﬁ rmatory 
testing to support a safety case, following 
which the fuel plug units can be crimped 
and refuelling can proceed.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
BUSINESS REVIEW
We continue to focus investment to 
improve the long-term reliability and 
safe operation of the ﬂ eet by proactively 
targeting investment to deliver equipment 
reliability and to reduce the risk of future 
losses. In ﬁ nancial year 2008/09, we expect 
Investment in Plant to be in the range 
£280m to £305m, which will help us to 
mitigate current risks and lifetime risks 
in areas such as availability of strategic 
spares, neutron ﬂ ux detectors, gas 
circulators and digital processing systems. 
In addition, we expect to incur BCU 
engineering modiﬁ cation costs at 
Hartlepool and Heysham 1 of around £50m.
In ﬁ nancial year 2009/10, we expect 
Investment in Plant to be in the range 
£260m to £280m.
In ﬁ nancial year 2008/09, underlying 
materials and services costs are expected 
to rise with inﬂ ation. Staff costs are 
expected to increase as a result of wage 
inﬂ ation across the sector and the full 
year effect of previous headcount 
increases. The agreed reduction in pension 
deﬁ cit repair contributions following the 
March 2007 triennial valuation is expected 
to be largely offset by higher employer’s 
future service contributions.
Trading and Sales
We continue to manage our trading 
book position in line with the expected 
phased return to service of the four units 
at Hartlepool and Heysham 1, expected to 
be over the second and third quarters of 
ﬁ nancial year 2008/09. As at 18 May 2008, 
we had ﬁ xed price contracts in place for 
approximately 38.7TWh for the ﬁ nancial 
year 2008/09 at an average contract price 
of £43/MWh (excluding the impact of 
capped contracts). The capped contracts 
are for delivery of approximately 5TWh per 
annum up to March 2011, at prices currently 
capped at around £32/MWh. The realised 
price takes into account the difference 
between the purchase price of power in 
connection with buybacks (for delivery 
in ﬁ nancial year 2008/09) and the average 
contract price of ﬁ xed price contracts in 
place prior to unplanned losses associated 
with Hartlepool and Heysham 1, being 
approximately £50m.
Although the large outage programme 
will reduce output and cash generated 
from operations in ﬁ nancial year 2008/09, 
we will continue to seek to enhance the 
depth of the ﬁ xed price trading book. As at 
18 May 2008, we had ﬁ xed price contracts 
in place for approximately 32.2TWh for 
the ﬁ nancial year 2009/10 at an average 
contract price of £41/MWh (excluding the 
impact of approximately 5TWh of capped 
contracts at around £33/MWh).
As at 18 May 2008, we had 104TWh of zero/
capped collateral sales that will deliver 
over the period to March 2013 at ﬁ xed 
prices (excluding power already delivered 
under these contracts), up from 76TWh 
at 20 May 2007, for delivery over the 
period to April 2012. One of these trades 
has deferred cash receipts by a total of 
approximately £300m, excluding interest, 
for the two years ended 31 March 2007 and 
2008. This cash will be received over the 
period up to April 2011 or sooner to the 
extent substituted by letters of credit.
Concluding Remarks
Despite disappointing ﬁ nancial 
performance, we have made good 
operational progress, with Sizewell B 
operating to world class standards and 
some best ever metrics being realised across 
the AGR ﬂ eet. We are well positioned to 
manage our existing ﬂ eet to best advantage 
and look ahead to playing a pivotal role in 
the new build programme.

Financial Review
Overview 
As anticipated at the start of the year, 
the Group’s ﬁ nancial performance in 
comparison to the prior year shows a 
reduction in the key ﬁ nancial indicators: 
revenue, adjusted EBITDA, operating proﬁ t 
and proﬁ t before tax. Although output is 
unchanged on last year, a combination of a 
reduced realised price and an increase in the 
unit operating cost has signiﬁ cantly reduced 
the Group’s operating margin in comparison 
with the prior year. The reduction in 
realised price from £44.2/MWh in 2007 
to £40.7/MWh in 2008 for the most part 
reﬂ ects the Group’s policy of reducing 
uncertainty of income by selling future 
output at ﬁ xed prices. As previously 
reported, the Group had ﬁ xed price 
contracts in place, as at 20 May 2007, for 
approximately 57TWh of output ﬁ xed at 
an average contract price of £42/MWh and 
approximately 5TWh of capped contracts 
at around £30/MWh.
 
The increase in unit operating cost from 
£27.1/MWh in 2007 to £30.0/MWh was also 
largely anticipated with the increases in 
individual cost categories.
The reduction in key ﬁ nancial indicators 
was however exacerbated by the signiﬁ cant 
impact of the Boiler Closure Unit (BCU) 
issue at Hartlepool and Heysham 1. The 
lost output from this event was partially 
mitigated by the signiﬁ cant improvement 
in the level of small losses, a less extensive 
statutory outage programme and increased 
output from Eggborough, although at 
signiﬁ cantly reduced margins due to tighter 
clean dark spreads. Although the output for 
the year at 58.4TWh was unchanged on 
2007, this was behind expectations at the start of the year. The lower than expected output, 
the effect of additional power buybacks and costs associated with the BCU issue have 
resulted in the reduction of the operating margin from £17.1/MWh in 2007 to £10.7 /MWh 
being greater than anticipated at the start of the year.
 
The net cash position, which excludes restricted cash and other ﬁ nancial assets, has only 
marginally declined from £528m at the beginning of the year to £512m at 31 March 2008. 
The Group’s net cash position has been maintained whilst paying the ﬁ rst dividend since 
Restructuring of £140m, paying the 2007 Cash Sweep Payment of £171m and continuing 
with the investment programme. Investment in Plant spend was £283m, with an 
additional £20m spend in respect of inspection and assessment of the BCU issue.

Coal-ﬁ red power station – Eggborough   8.1 7.2
Total output   58.4 58.4
Total output for the year of 58.4TWh is unchanged on the prior year. Output from 
Eggborough increased by 0.9TWh to 8.1TWh whilst there was a reduction in output from 
the nuclear ﬂ eet by 0.9TWh to 50.3TWh. 
Nuclear output for the year was 0.9TWh lower than last year’s output primarily due to 
unplanned losses incurred in connection with the BCU issue at Hartlepool and Heysham 1. 
The signiﬁ cant adverse impact of the BCU issue has been partially mitigated by an 
improvement in the level of small losses. A full discussion of the Group’s nuclear 
generation performance and the performance of the Group’s coal-ﬁ red power station 
at Eggborough is contained in the Operations Review section on pages 6 to 10 of the 
Chief Executive’s Business Review.
Although total output is unchanged on the 
prior year, wholesale generation sales and 
direct supply sales, excluding recovery of 
energy supply costs and renewable energy 
purchases recharged to customers, have 
decreased by £21m and £182m respectively 
from 2007. This is as a result of the decrease 
in realised prices from £44.2/MWh last year 
to £40.7/MWh this year. Realised price is 
calculated as revenue from generated 
electricity divided by total output. The 
reduction in realised price from £44.2/MWh 
in 2007 to £40.7/MWh in 2008 for the most 
part reﬂ ects the Group’s policy of reducing 
uncertainty of income by selling future 
output at ﬁ xed prices. As previously 
reported, the Group had ﬁ xed price 
contracts in place, as at 20 May 2007, for 
approximately 57TWh of output ﬁ xed at 
an average contract price of £42/MWh and 
approximately 5TWh of capped contracts 
at around £30/MWh. The power buybacks 
of £70m, that the Group made in order to 
address the impact of the BCU issue, also 
adversely affected realised price achieved. 
A discussion on the movement of market 
prices, market conditions and the Group’s 
strategy for trading is contained in the 
Financial Stability from our Trading 
and Sales Strategy section of the 
Chief Executive’s Business Review.

Operating and Energy Costs Summary
The Group operating and energy costs are analysed as follows:
   Year Year
   ended ended
   31 March 31 March
   2008 2007
   £m £m
Fuel costs – nuclear   300 278
Fuel costs – Eggborough   227 156
Total fuel costs   527 434
Materials and services   583 562
Staff costs   396 374
Operating costs of generated electricity   1,506 1,370
Energy supply costs recharged to customers   367 362
Renewable energy purchases recharged to customers   56 46
Total operating and energy costs    1,929 1,778
Unit Operating Cost and Operating Margin
Unit operating cost increased to £30.0/MWh for the year from £27.1/MWh in 2007, and 
is calculated as operating costs of generated electricity plus depreciation and software 
amortisation, divided by total output. The increase in unit operating costs of £2.9/MWh 
is mainly due to an increase in fuel costs and the depreciation charge as a result of capital 
expenditure on plant. Materials and services and staff costs, excluding the costs relating 
to Investment in Plant, have increased. The increase in unit fuel costs is primarily due to 
the accounting treatment of carbon allowances and the estimated provision for unburnt 
nuclear fuel in the reactors at station closure. Further information on each of these 
categories is provided below.
Realised price less unit operating cost results in an operating margin per unit of 
£10.7/MWh for 2008 (2007: £17.1/MWh).
Operating and Energy Costs
Nuclear fuel costs consist of the costs of procurement of uranium, conversion and 
enrichment services and fuel element fabrication (front end) and the costs of reprocessing, 
long-term storage and eventual disposal of the resulting waste products (back end). 
Full provision is also made for the projected costs of unburnt fuel at station closure.
Nuclear fuel costs have increased by £22m to £300m (2007: £278m) which reﬂ ects an 
increase in nuclear fuel unit cost from £5.4/MWh to £6.0/MWh. This increase is mainly due 
to the revaluation of the provision for unburnt fuel at station closure, which is not linked to 
the output for the year but to the amount of unburnt fuel in each individual reactor at the 
balance sheet date. After adjusting for this 
provision movement, the underlying unit 
cost is consistent with last year.
Eggborough fuel costs in respect of coal, 
oil, biomass and carbon allowances totalled 
£227m for the year (2007: £156m), or 
£28.0/MWh (2007: £21.7/MWh). Excluding 
carbon allowances, Eggborough fuel costs 
were £154m (2007: £134m) or £19.0/MWh 
(2007: £18.6/MWh) which reﬂ ects the 
upward movement in coal prices.
Carbon allowance costs totalled £73m 
for the year (2007: £22m), or £9.0/MWh 
(2007: £3.0/MWh). This includes the 
recognition of £58m (2007: £41m) for the 
write down in the value of Phase I carbon 
allowances to almost nil, that had been 
purchased in the prior year but delivered 
in the year. The impact of the carbon 
allowance write down on fuel costs in the 
current year was previously reﬂ ected in the 
2007 unrealised net losses on derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments and commodity 
contracts, when these contracts were 
marked to market as at 31 March 2007. It 
should be noted that it is the Group’s policy 
to ﬁ x the fuel costs at the time of selling 
Eggborough’s output and therefore losses 
on forward purchase contracts of carbon 
allowances are matched with the revenue 
derived from the associated forward sales 
contracts of Eggborough output recognised 
in the period.
 
Materials and services costs have increased 
by £21m to £583m (2007: £562m) in the year 
and comprises the operating expenses of 
the power stations and support functions.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
BUSINESS REVIEW
expenditure projects (NRR), which is part of 
the investment programme, has increased 
by £27m to £159m in the year (2007: £132m). 
Also included in materials and services is 
£20m spent on the BCU issue at Hartlepool 
and Heysham 1. The operating expenses of 
the stations are consistent with the prior 
year, with inﬂ ation increases being offset 
by savings in insurance and rates.
Staff costs totalled £396m (2007: £374m), 
an increase of £22m from the prior year. 
Higher staff numbers and the annual 
pay rise contributed to the increase. The 
Group’s headcount increased from 6,062 
at the beginning of the year to 6,176 at 
31 March 2008. 
Energy supply costs were £367m for the 
year (2007: £362m) and primarily comprise 
the costs to the Group of the Renewables 
Obligation Scheme, Transmission Use of 
System (TNUoS) costs, Distribution Use 
of System (DUoS) costs and Balancing 
Services Use of System (BSUoS) costs, all 
of which are fully recovered within revenue. 
The Group purchases energy from renewable 
sources for two reasons, ﬁ rstly to satisfy 
customers’ demands, and secondly to obtain 
Renewables Obligation Certiﬁ cates (ROCs) 
to contribute towards satisfying the Group’s 
obligations under this scheme. The cost of 
purchased electricity from renewable sources 
is accounted for in renewable energy 
purchases, net of the value of ROCs and Levy 
Exemption Certiﬁ cates (LECs). The value of 
ROCs and LECs are accounted for separately 
within intangible assets. The volume of 
energy purchased from renewable sources 
was 1.6TWh (2007: 1.1TWh). The increased 
cost in renewable energy purchased of 
£56m (2007: £46m) is as a result of higher 
volume being purchased offset by a 
reduction in the average price paid.
 
Other Operating Income
Other operating income of £10m 
(2007: £93m) consists of the utilisation 
of £2m (2007: £93m utilisation and release) 
of the contracts provision, which was 
established at RED and an £8m (2007: £nil) 
realisation of a contingent asset, relating 
to the Group’s disposal of its interest in 
Bruce Power LP . 
Cash Sweep Payment Accrual, NLF Partial 
Conversion, Cash Sweep Payment Credit 
and Amortisation of Conversion Asset 
As part of the Contribution Agreement 
made at the time of Restructuring, the 
Group has an obligation to make annual 
Cash Sweep Payments to the Nuclear 
Liabilities Fund (NLF) should certain criteria 
be met. In accordance with the terms of 
the Contribution Agreement, a Cash Sweep 
Payment of £102m (2007: £305m) has 
been accrued in the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy.
The annual Cash Sweep Payment was 
initially equal to 65% of the Group’s net cash 
ﬂ ow, adjusted for certain items outlined in 
the Contribution Agreement. The NLF has 
the right to convert some or all of its 
entitlement to receive Cash Sweep 
Payments into convertible shares and to sell 
those shares. On disposal, the convertible 
shares automatically convert into ordinary 
shares of British Energy Group plc. On a full 
conversion of its remaining interest, the NLF 
would hold up to approximately 35% of the 
thereby enlarged equity share capital of 
British Energy Group plc.
 
On 30 May 2007 the Secretary of State for 
Trade and Industry (now the Secretary of 
State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory 
Reform) announced his intention to direct 
the NLF to convert and sell part of its 
interest in British Energy Group plc. 
On 1 June 2007 British Energy Group plc 
received notice from the NLF intimating its 
intention to convert and sell approximately 
400 million shares in the Company, with an 
over allotment option of a further 50 million 
shares in the Company. As a result on 
6 June 2007 British Energy Group plc issued 
450 million convertible shares of 10p each 
to the NLF , which were re-designated as 
450 million ordinary shares of 10p each and 
admitted to the Ofﬁ cial List of the UKLA and 
to trading on the London Stock Exchange 
on the same day. Following the conversion 
and share issue the Cash Sweep Payment 
percentage was reduced to approximately 
36% and resulted in the recognition of a 
conversion asset of £2,340m, additional 
equity share capital of £45m and additional 
share premium of £2,295m representing the 
excess of the conversion share price of £5.20 
over the nominal value of shares issued. The 
conversion asset represents the fair value 
of the obligation which was removed as a 
result of the exercise of the conversion right.
Following initial recognition, the conversion 
asset is being amortised over the estimated 
useful accounting lives of the Group’s power 
stations. For the period from 6 June 2007 to 
31 March 2008 the amortisation charge was 
£167m (2007: £nil).

Under the terms of the original Contribution 
Agreement, on a conversion by the NLF of 
part or all of its Cash Sweep Payment right, 
the NLF was entitled to both a Cash Sweep 
Payment on the part converted for the 
period up to conversion and any dividend 
in respect of the same period on the shares 
arising from the conversion. British Energy 
Group plc obtained agreement from the 
NLF and the Secretary of State for Trade 
and Industry (now the Secretary of State for 
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform) 
to an amendment to the Cash Sweep 
Payment right and Cash Sweep Payment 
percentage adjustment formula in relation 
to the partial conversion, which took place 
in the year, so as to ensure the principle 
of economic parity was maintained and 
to avoid an unintended dilution of the 
Company’s equity shareholders’ interests. 
As a result, the £305m accrued in the 2007 
Annual Report and Accounts for the Cash 
Sweep Payment due for the year ended 
31 March 2007 was reduced by £134m to 
£171m to reﬂ ect the NLF’s agreement to 
waive the proportion of the 2007 obligation 
due that was extinguished by the partial 
conversion in June 2007. The £134m 
reduction has been recognised as a credit in 
the consolidated income statement for this 
year, with the remaining £171m obligation 
paid in July 2007. In the event of further NLF 
conversions, British Energy Group plc plans 
to seek a similar waiver. The NLF and the 
Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise 
and Regulatory Reform have not given any 
commitment to agree to waive the NLF’s 
entitlement to any additional Cash Sweep 
Payment amounts in respect of any future 
NLF conversions. Additionally, the new 
shares issued on conversion were entitled 
to the base dividend of 13.6p per ordinary 
share approved at British Energy Group plc’s 
Annual General Meeting on 19 July 2007. 
The effect of the new shares issued was to 
increase the amount of dividends paid on 
31 July 2007 from the £80m anticipated in 
the 2007 Annual Report and Accounts 
to £140m.
The formula in the Contribution Agreement 
which adjusts the Cash Sweep Payment 
percentage after the Cash Sweep Payments 
and dividends has also been amended with 
the agreement of the Secretary of State for 
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform 
and the NLF so as to more clearly adhere 
to the principle of economic parity and to 
partially mitigate any unintended dilution 
of British Energy Group plc’s equity 
shareholders’ interests under the formula 
in the original Contribution Agreement. 
 
The Cash Sweep Payment percentage 
was 35.1% as at 31 March 2008, down from 
64.0% at 31 March 2007. It reduced by 
approximately 28% because of the NLF’s 
partial conversion into equity of its Cash 
Sweep Payment right in June 2007. The 
remainder of the decrease relates to the 
exercise of 6,955,809 of British Energy 
Group plc’s Warrants and the Cash Sweep 
Payment, offset by the impact of the 
dividend payment made during the year. 
At 31 March 2008 there were 6,764,057 
unexercised Warrants remaining.
The basis of the computation of the Cash 
Sweep Payment is described in more detail 
in note 9 to the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements.
Depreciation and Other Amortisation
Depreciation of £238m was £31m higher 
than the prior year due to expenditure 
on power stations and other plant and 
equipment, including overhaul. This increase 
is after a £6m reduction in the depreciation 
charge in respect of the accounting life 
extensions at Hinkley Point B and 
Hunterston B. Other amortisation of 
£9m (2007: £6m) relates to amortisation 
on software in the year. 
Unrealised Net Losses on 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
and Commodity Contracts
Unrealised net losses or gains on derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments and commodity 
contracts arise as a result of fair value 
movements in the Group’s commodity 
contracts which fall within the scope of 
IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement (IAS 39). Some of these 
contracts are accounted for as cash ﬂ ow 
hedges, with movements in fair value 
taken directly to equity in the hedge reserve. 
The fair value movements in all other 
contracts within the scope of IAS 39 are 
presented in the unrealised net losses on 
derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and 
commodity contracts line of the 
consolidated income statement.
The charge to the consolidated income 
statement this year of £3m (2007: £2m) 
represents a credit for the fair value 
movements in carbon allowance forward 
contracts of £64m (2007: £73m charge) 
offset by a charge for the fair value 
movement of electricity and other 
forward commodity contracts of 
£67m (2007: £71m credit).

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
BUSINESS REVIEW
Financing (Charges)/Credits
Interest payable of £77m (2007: £61m) 
relates to interest on the Group’s Bonds, 
together with ﬁ nance fees on structured 
trading contracts and committed letter 
of credit facilities. As a consequence of the 
annual repayment of the Bond principal, 
the interest payable on the Bonds has 
decreased by £4m to £40m. 
Interest receivable of £89m (2007: £53m) 
relates to interest earned on cash deposits 
and interest earned on deferred cash receipts 
in respect of a capped collateral power sales 
contract. This has increased as a result of 
higher interest bearing cash deposits, higher 
interest rates in 2008 compared to 2007 and 
higher interest received on deferred cash 
receipts as a result of increased amounts 
due under this contract.
For details of other ﬁ nance income of 
£19m (2007: £10m), refer to note 10 in the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
Taxation
The taxation charge of £203m (2007: £331m) 
has been recognised in the consolidated 
income statement for the year. This 
comprises a deferred tax credit of 
£2m (2007: £272m charge) and a current 
tax charge of £205m (2007: £59m). This 
represents an effective tax rate of 
38% (2007: 42%) of proﬁ ts before tax. 
The current year tax charge includes a 
£29m prior year charge of which £23m 
relates to revisions to the amount of capital 
allowances and tax losses originally 
anticipated to be utilised in the year to 
31 March 2007. As this relates to a timing 
issue, there is a corresponding prior year tax 
credit reﬂ ected in the deferred tax credit 
for the year. Adjusting for the impact of 
the Cash Sweep Payment accrual, the Cash 
Sweep Payment credit and conversion asset 
amortisation (which are non-deductible for 
tax) and the prior year adjustments, results 
in an effective tax rate of 29% (2007: 30%) 
which is broadly consistent with the 
standard rate of tax of 30%. 
The Group has made instalment payments 
of £46m and £72m during the year in 
respect of the current tax payable for the 
year ended 31 March 2007 and 31 March 
2008 respectively. The remaining current 
tax liability of £23m reﬂ ects the anticipated 
beneﬁ t of the utilisation of £74m advance 
corporation tax paid in previous years. 
Net Proﬁ t and Earnings per Share
Net proﬁ t for the year attributable to 
shareholders was £335m compared to 
£465m for 2007.
Basic earnings per share for the year was 
35.4p (2007: 81.5p). This is based on the net 
proﬁ t for the year divided by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue 
during the year. For this calculation the net 
proﬁ t includes £134m relating to the waiver 
of part of the Cash Sweep Payment for the 
year ended 31 March 2007.
Diluted earnings per share for the year was 
35.2p (2007: 79.9p). The diluted earnings per 
share calculation is based on the weighted 
average of ordinary shares in issue together 
with the dilutive weighted average of 
potential ordinary shares in respect of 
Warrants.
Adjusted earnings per share for the year 
was 29.6p (2007: 48.2p). As described in 
note 14 of the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements, the Cash Sweep Payment 
accrual of £102m (2007: £305m) and the 
net proﬁ t attributable to shareholders of 
£335m (2007: £465m) do not reﬂ ect the 
respective economic interests of the NLF 
and equity shareholders in the proﬁ ts of 
the Group. The calculation in any given year 
of the annual Cash Sweep Payment accrual 
is based on cash ﬂ ows and the retention 
of appropriate cash (Target Amount) and 
expenditure reserves (Forecast Expenditure 
Reserve) (see note 9 of the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements). 
An adjusted earnings per share has 
therefore been calculated by excluding the 
following from the net proﬁ t for the year 
attributable to shareholders:
the Cash Sweep Payment credit relating • 
to the year ended 31 March 2007;
the Cash Sweep Payment accrual for the • 
year; and 
the amortisation of the conversion asset • 
for the year.
The weighted average share capital is 
adjusted by the number of shares that 
would have been in issue if:
the NLF had fully converted their • 
remaining interest at the balance sheet 
date; and
the partial conversion had taken place at • 
the start of the year, rather than during 
the year.

Investment in Plant for the year ended 31 March 2008 was £283m (2007: £264m) of which 
investment at Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B was £73m (2007: £70m). In addition, £20m 
of expenditure has been incurred in respect of inspection and assessment of the BCU issue 
at Hartlepool and Heysham 1. Of the £207m (2007: £235m) of capital expenditure, £197m 
(2007: £224m) was capitalised within property, plant and equipment, and the remaining 
£10m (2007: £11m), relating to software, was capitalised in intangible assets.
Further details of the investment programme are contained in the Chief Executive’s 
Business Review.
Financial Position
Liquidity, Cash Flows and Capital Resources 
As at 31 March 2008 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £1,028m compared to £1,101m 
at 31 March 2007 . The decrease in cash and cash equivalents is analysed in the following table:
   Year Year
   ended ended
   31 March 31 March
   2008 2007
   £m £m
Net cash inﬂ ow generated from operations   322 751

Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year   1,101 638
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year   1,028 1,101
Net cash inﬂ ow generated from operations 
was £322m, a reduction of £429m compared 
to the prior year. The main reason for the 
reduction in cash generated is due to the 
reduction in operating proﬁ ts. Other 
signiﬁ cant reasons include the increases 
in Cash Sweep Payment, tax payments 
and cash required to be held as collateral. 
Deferrals of cash receipts from the 
capped collateral power sales contract 
have increased by £152m to £320m at 
31 March 2008. This deferred cash will 
be received over subsequent periods up 
to April 2011 or earlier to the extent that 
it is substituted by letters of credit.
Net cash used in investing activities, which 
primarily relates to plant and equipment 
additions, was £203m for the year 
(2007: £235m). 
Net cash used in ﬁ nancing activities 
was £192m for the year (2007: £53m). 
This comprises the payment of the base 
dividend in July 2007 of £140m (2007: £nil), 
£57m (2007: £53m) repayment of bond 
principal, £2m (2007: £6m) consideration 
for the purchase of own shares to satisfy 
share incentive schemes, less £7m 
(2007: £6m) of proceeds from the exercise 
of Warrants.
In addition to cash and cash equivalents 
there are restricted cash and other 
ﬁ nancial assets of £286m (2007: £146m) 
at 31 March 2008, of which 
£267m (2007: £90m) is cash posted as 
collateral in support of trading activities. 
The increase in cash collateral reﬂ ects the 
increase in electricity prices.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
BUSINESS REVIEW
At 31 March 2008, there was total debt 
of £516m (2007: £573m) resulting in a 
net cash position (excluding restricted 
cash and other ﬁ nancial assets) of 
£512m (2007: £528m). The total 
debt comprised:
a long-term “project ﬁ nance” loan of • 
£111m (2007: £123m) secured on the 
assets of Eggborough Power Limited, 
a subsidiary company that operates the 
Eggborough coal-ﬁ red power station; 
and 
an aggregate principal amount of £ • 405m 
(2007: £450m) sterling denominated 
guaranteed bonds due between 2009 
and 2022. 
During the year the Group increased its 
committed letter of credit facilities by 
£50m to £350m. The balance of £350m 
now comprises ﬁ ve separate bilateral 
facilities. Two of the ﬁ ve bilateral facilities, 
totalling £175m, expire in June 2008 and 
September 2008 with the remaining 
three facilities, totalling £175m, expiring 
in September 2009. All ﬁ ve facilities were 
undrawn in the year ended 31 March 2008.
Net Assets and Equity
Net assets increased by £2,335m to £4,982m 
at 31 March 2008, due primarily to the 
recognition of the conversion asset, net of 
amortisation, of £2,173m as a result of the 
NLF’s partial conversion in June 2007. Other 
signiﬁ cant movements in the net asset 
position include the movements in the net 
cash position and restricted cash described 
in the previous section and an increase in 
the retirement beneﬁ ts obligations by £151m 
to £216m at 31 March 2008.
Total shareholders’ equity was £4,982m 
(2007: £2,647m) and is fully explained in 
note 31 to the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements.
Nuclear Liabilities and Funding 
Arrangements 
Under the arrangements with the 
Secretary of State implemented on 
Restructuring, the NLF will fund, subject to 
certain exceptions, the Group’s qualifying 
uncontracted nuclear liabilities and 
qualifying decommissioning costs. As part 
of the arrangements the Group will make 
certain payments to the NLF, including the 
Cash Sweep Payment. The NLF has the 
right, from time to time, to convert all or 
part of the Cash Sweep Payment into 
convertible shares. 
The Government provides an indemnity to 
cover liabilities for spent AGR fuel loaded 
pre-Restructuring. The nuclear liabilities 
receivable is recognised as an asset on the 
Group’s consolidated balance sheet in 
respect of this indemnity. The Government 
also indemniﬁ es the Group against any 
future shortfall in NLF funding of 
qualifying uncontracted nuclear liabilities 
(including PWR back end fuel services) and 
qualifying nuclear decommissioning costs. 
The NLF receivable asset represents the 
aggregate value of the investments held 
by the NLF and the Government indemnity. 
The Group will continue to recognise 
nuclear liabilities on its consolidated 
balance sheet pending their discharge 
by payments received from the NLF. 
Both the nuclear liabilities receivable 
and the NLF receivable are stated in the 
consolidated balance sheet at current 
price levels. Each year the ﬁ nancing 
charges in the consolidated income 
statement will include the revalorisation 
of these receivables which will match 
the revalorisation of the nuclear liabilities, 
provided the Group does not incur any 
non-qualifying nuclear liabilities. 
At 31 March 2008 the total NLF and 
nuclear liabilities receivables was £5,512m 
(2007: £5,469m). Of the total, £202m was 
included in current assets (2007: £195m) 
and £5,310m (2007: £5,274m) was included 
in non-current assets. This equates to the 
present value of associated nuclear liabilities 
included in the Group’s current liabilities of 
£202m (2007: £195m) and non-current 
liabilities of £5,310m (2007: £5,274m). 
Financial Risk Management
Overview
The Group’s principal ﬁ nancial instruments 
include derivative commodity contracts 
for the sale and purchase of electricity, 
purchase of coal and carbon allowances, 
interest bearing debt, loans, investments 
in short-dated commercial paper, cash held 
in collateral accounts, cash and short-term 
deposits. Refer to note 22 in the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements for 
further details on the Group’s ﬁ nancial 
assets and liabilities.

Server: studio 3 Set-up: Dave First Read/Revisions
The main ﬁ nancial risks faced by the Group 
are trading risks in respect of the sale of 
electricity. Electricity trading risks include: 
exposure to electricity price ﬂ uctuations, 
balancing of output volume with 
contractual commitments, commodity 
(coal, carbon allowances and uranics) price 
risk and counterparty credit risk. These are 
managed by the Group’s Trading and Sales 
division which operates within policies 
and procedures that are approved and 
monitored by the Board. The Trading and 
Sales division is not permitted to take 
speculative open positions.
Non-trading ﬁ nancial risks, including 
liquidity, interest rate and foreign exchange 
risks are managed by the Group’s central 
treasury department which also operates 
within policies and procedures that are 
approved and monitored by the Board. 
The treasury department is not permitted 
to take speculative open positions. 
In addition the Group has exposure to risks 
associated with its pension schemes and 
the funding of certain nuclear liabilities not 
funded by the NLF or covered by the 
Government indemnity.
Electricity Price and Balancing Risk
The Group is exposed to electricity price 
risk. Electricity price cash ﬂ ow risk exists 
where the Group has uncontracted sales 
volumes or ﬂ oating priced contracted 
sales. Electricity price fair value risk exists 
where contracts are ﬁ xed in price, thereby 
exposing the Group to changes in fair 
values as a result of changes in 
market prices. 
During the year, the Group focused on 
extending its ﬁ xed price contract portfolio 
to provide more future income certainty 
while operating within collateral 
constraints to protect the business 
against the effects of potential power 
price movements. Wherever possible 
the Group will continue to develop 
new and innovative arrangements with 
counterparties to deliver an increase in the 
volume of zero/capped collateral trades so 
that the ﬁ xed price contract portfolio can 
be extended further.
Under BETTA any mismatch between 
actual metered generation (or demand) 
and the notiﬁ ed contract position is settled 
through the balancing mechanism at 
generally unfavourable prices. The Group 
aims to manage the portfolio of ﬁ xed price 
contracts to minimise exposure to the 
balancing mechanism and short-term 
electricity prices. While operating primarily 
as a ﬂ exible mid-merit plant, the Group’s 
Eggborough coal-ﬁ red power station 
provides a ﬂ exible generation capability 
that assists in managing risks associated 
with non-availability of nuclear plant.
In compliance with IFRS 7 – Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7), the 
following sensitivity is required to be 
disclosed in respect of electricity price risk. 
The sensitivity only covers contracts within 
the scope of IAS 39 and solely relates to 
the change in the mark to market impact 
as at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007. In 
addition, it should also be noted that only 
a small proportion of the Group’s electricity 
contracts fall within the scope of IAS 39. 
For every 5% higher/lower movement in 
electricity prices, whilst holding all other 
variables constant, the Group’s:
proﬁ t after tax for the year ended • 
31 March 2008 would increase/decrease 
by £18m (2007: decrease/increase by 
£11m); and 
other equity reserves would decrease/ • 
increase by £6m (2007: £2m).
A 5% decrease or increase represents the 
Group’s assessment of a reasonably 
possible change in electricity prices as at 
31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007.
Commodity Price Risk
The Group manages exposure to 
ﬂ uctuations in market prices within 
the coal market either by securing ﬁ xed 
prices on a variety of delivery bases or 
by entering into coal contracts as natural 
hedges against power and carbon price 
movements. The Group manages its 
exposure to prices of carbon allowances 
by matching carbon allowance purchases 
with sales of electricity, taking account 
of free allowances held at the time.
In compliance with IFRS 7, the following 
sensitivity is required to be disclosed in 
respect of commodity price risk. The 
sensitivity only covers contracts within 
the scope of IAS 39 and solely relates to 
the change in the mark to market impact 
as at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007. In 
addition, it should also be noted that only a 
small proportion of the Group’s commodity 
contracts fall within the scope of IAS 39.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
BUSINESS REVIEW
For every 5% higher/lower movement in 
coal and carbon prices, whilst holding all 
other variables constant, the Group’s:
proﬁ t after tax for the year ended • 
31 March 2008 would increase/decrease 
by £2m (2007: £2m); and
other equity reserves would remain • 
unchanged (2007: unchanged).
A 5% decrease or increase represents the 
Group’s assessment of a reasonably 
possible change in coal and carbon prices 
as at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007.
The Group’s ability to maintain 
competitively priced front end nuclear fuel 
supplies is dependent on its procurement 
of uranium (U
3
O
8
) and uranium related 
services in a competitive world market and 
it is the Group’s policy to have 100% supply 
contractually secured for at least two years 
into the future. Currently uranium and 
uranium related services contracts exist, 
which provide nearly 100% coverage of the 
Group’s anticipated requirements until 
31 March 2011. 
The market price of uranium and uranium 
related services has increased signiﬁ cantly 
from the level at which the Group entered 
its existing fuel agreements. The long-term 
market price of uranium was US$95 per 
pound as at 31 March 2008. If uranium 
and uranium related services increased 
to 31 March 2008 long-term market prices, 
this could eventually increase the Group’s 
total nuclear fuel costs by approximately 
£166m per annum, based on current 
nuclear output. It is anticipated that the 
impact of this potential increase would 
start within the ﬁ nancial year ending 
31 March 2012 and be fully recognised in 
the income statement by 31 March 2017. 
Counterparty Credit Risk
The Group’s policy is to manage credit 
exposure to trading counterparties 
within deﬁ ned limits. All of the Group’s 
counterparties are assigned internal 
credit limits. 
The main counterparty credit risks occur in 
relation to direct sales contracts, wholesale 
customers and cash and cash equivalent 
balances.
British Energy Direct sells electricity to 
large industrial and commercial customers. 
The Group has credit insurance in place 
to minimise losses from the failure of 
customers to pay their debts. At 31 March 
2008, over 70% (2007: over 75%) of the 
amounts receivable from large industrial 
and commercial customers was insured.
Bilateral structured contracts for the 
wholesale electricity market are normally 
based upon Grid Trade Master Agreements 
(GTMA) or International Swap Dealers 
Association (ISDA) terms and conditions. 
Counterparties with an investment grade 
rating (from Standard and Poor’s and/or 
Moody’s) are usually not required to 
provide credit support for trading activities. 
Counterparties without an investment 
grade rating are normally required to 
provide credit support which takes the 
form of a guarantee from an investment 
grade rated entity or cash deposits. Where 
appropriate the Group has purchased 
credit default swaps.
At 31 March 2008, the Group’s maximum 
credit exposure from wholesale 
counterparties was £17m (2007: £786m). 
This includes both the value of trade 
receivable balances in respect of power 
delivered and mark to market of all future 
contracted sales at the balance sheet date. 
The signiﬁ cant reduction in maximum 
credit exposure is driven by the rise in 
electricity prices throughout the year.
The Group is also exposed to counterparty 
credit risk on its cash and cash equivalent 
balances. The Group holds cash on deposit 
with a number of ﬁ nancial institutions. 
The Group manages its credit risk exposure 
by limiting individual deposits to clearly 
deﬁ ned limits. As at 31 March 2008 
the Group held cash deposits with one 
AA–rated UK ﬁ nancial institution of £100m. 
Capital and Liquidity Risk
The capital structure of the Group consists 
of cash and cash equivalents, debt and 
equity attributable to equity holders as 
disclosed in notes 21, 23 and 31 respectively.
The Group’s objective when managing 
capital continues to be the safeguarding 
of the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and beneﬁ ts for other 
stakeholders.
The Group maintains a mixture of cash 
and cash equivalents, long-term debt 
and short-term committed facilities that 
are designed to ensure the Group has 
sufﬁ cient available funds for business 
requirements. The cash and cash 
equivalents position and the facilities

available at 31 March 2008 are discussed 
above in the Liquidity, Cash Flows and 
Capital Resources section.
The Group’s main source of liquidity is 
its operating businesses. The treasury 
department uses regular forecasts of 
operational cash ﬂ ow, investment and 
trading collateral requirements to ensure 
that sufﬁ cient liquid cash balances are 
available to service ongoing business 
requirements. Factors such as the 
seasonality of cash ﬂ ows, servicing of debt 
and funding requirements in respect of 
the NLF and pension schemes are also 
assessed. Liquid assets which are surplus 
to immediate operational requirements are 
invested in line with the Group’s treasury 
investment policy. The Board reviews 
liquidity risks in detail as part of the annual 
business planning process. Cash generation 
activities are then monitored by the Board 
through monthly reports.
Cash generation by the operating 
businesses is dependent upon the 
reliability of the Group’s power stations 
in producing electricity, the realised selling 
price for electricity, operational risk and 
capital investment expenditure and 
maintenance requirements. The Group 
has mitigated some of its nuclear output 
risk by entering into business interruption 
insurance for its power stations. Claims 
under this policy can only be brought for 
a limited number of circumstances and 
in order to claim there ﬁ rst needs to be 
an insurable material damage event. The 
Group’s conservative decision taking 
approach towards operating its power 
stations safely means there are a small 
number of circumstances where a claim 
could be made. As a consequence, the 
majority of unplanned outages are not 
covered by business interruption insurance. 
Due to the Group’s current sub-investment 
grade rating, the counterparties to the 
Group’s standard ﬁ xed price electricity 
contracts require that cash is deposited as 
collateral to cover their risk that the Group 
may be unable to fulﬁ l contract delivery 
obligations. Collateral is required to cover 
both initial and variation margin.
In a volatile electricity market the 
requirements to post collateral can 
ﬂ uctuate signiﬁ cantly and could result in a 
signiﬁ cant risk to liquidity. The Group aims 
to mitigate this risk by utilising routes to 
market that are collateral efﬁ cient. These 
include the direct sale of electricity to 
industrial and commercial customers on 
a collateral free basis and the use of zero/
capped collateral ﬁ xed price contracts. 
In addition, the Group also has available 
£350m of bilateral standby letter of credit 
facilities to support calls for collateral.
Interest Rate Risk 
The Group uses ﬁ xed interest rate 
borrowings and deposits to reduce 
exposure to ﬂ uctuations in interest rates as 
considered necessary. The Group does not 
enter into instruments which are leveraged 
or held for speculative purposes. 
At 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007 the 
Group had no interest rate derivatives.
In compliance with IFRS 7, the following 
sensitivity is required to be disclosed in 
respect of interest rate risk.
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower 
and all other variables were held constant, 
the Group’s proﬁ t after tax for the year 
ended 31 March 2008 would increase/
decrease by £11m (2007: £8m).
 
A 1% decrease or increase represents the 
Group’s assessment of a reasonably 
possible change in interest rates.
Foreign Exchange Risk
Throughout the year the Group has 
economically hedged its foreign exchange 
exposure in relation to its contracted 
carbon purchases, including related 
collateral and cash provided to satisfy 
variation margin calls, and has reviewed its 
foreign exchange exposure to both nuclear 
fuel purchases and coal procurement and 
hedged the exposures as appropriate. 
It is the Group’s policy not to engage in 
speculative foreign currency transactions.
In compliance with IFRS 7, the following 
sensitivity is required to be disclosed in 
respect of foreign exchange risk.
The Group has concluded that a 5% higher/
lower change in the USD/GBP exchange rate 
or a 5% higher/lower change in the EUR/GBP 
exchange rate, with all other variables held 
constant, would not have had a signiﬁ cant 
impact on the net proﬁ t or other equity 
reserves for either of the years ended 
31 March 2008 or 31 March 2007.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
BUSINESS REVIEW
A 5% higher/lower change in these 
exchange rates represents the Group’s 
assessment of a reasonably possible 
ﬂ uctuation.
Retirement Beneﬁ t Obligations
The retirement beneﬁ t obligations 
for the pension schemes included on 
the consolidated balance sheet at 
31 March 2008 of £216m (2007: £65m) 
has been computed in accordance with 
IAS 19 – Employee Beneﬁ ts (IAS 19). The key 
assumptions used in the IAS 19 valuation 
are detailed in note 27 to the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements. The IAS 19 valuation 
of the pension schemes’ deﬁ cit is based 
on a valuation of assets and liabilities at 
a particular point in time and does not 
necessarily take account of the long-term 
nature of pension schemes. Movements in 
equity markets and bond yields can create 
considerable volatility in the actuarial 
valuation. The deﬁ cit reported should not, 
therefore, be taken as an indication of the 
IAS 19 valuation of the pension schemes’ 
ﬁ nancial position on any date other than 
31 March 2008.
The funding of the pension schemes is 
based on the results of triennial valuations 
by independent actuaries rather than on 
the results of the IAS 19 valuation used for 
accounting purposes. The latest triennial 
valuation of the British Energy Generation 
Group scheme was carried out as at 
31 March 2007 and the actuarial assessed 
past service deﬁ cit at that date of £174m 
has been agreed with the Trustees. The 
impact on the Group’s regular employer 
contributions for future service is an 
increase of 4.9% to 27.3% of members’ 
pensionable salaries from 1 April 2008. An 
additional employer’s contribution schedule 
to address the past service deﬁ cit has been 
agreed at £35m per annum, paid monthly 
from 1 April 2008 to 31 December 2013. The 
revised assessment of members’ mortality 
used in the triennial valuations as at 
31 March 2007 has been incorporated into 
the IAS 19 valuation at 31 March 2008. 
Nuclear Liabilities Risk
The Group’s nuclear liabilities are in respect 
of costs for the management of spent fuel, 
nuclear decommissioning and other 
uncontracted nuclear liabilities. 
As described in the Financial Position 
section, the Government provides an 
indemnity to cover liabilities for spent 
AGR fuel loaded pre-Restructuring and, 
in relation to qualifying uncontracted 
nuclear and decommissioning liabilities, 
the Government will also indemnify any 
future funding shortfall of the NLF. The 
Group continues to be responsible for funding 
certain excluded or non-qualifying nuclear 
liabilities and will not be compensated or 
indemniﬁ ed by the NLF and the Secretary 
of State in relation to such liabilities. At 
both 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007 
the Group did not have any excluded or 
non-qualifying nuclear liabilities.
Other Financial Issues
Dividend Policy 
In the Restructuring Prospectus, the 
Board stated its intention to distribute 
to shareholders as much of the Group’s 
cash ﬂ ow as prudently possible.
The Board currently intends that the 
Company will pay 13.6p per ordinary share 
per annum as a base dividend, payable as a 
ﬁ nal dividend (equivalent to £141m in total 
based on current issued share capital fully 
diluted by the exercise of all remaining 
Warrants) provided it is approved at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. It is 
anticipated that the annual base dividend 
will be sustainable for the foreseeable 
future based on the Group’s assessment 
of forecast electricity prices and its current 
view of output. The total amount of the 
base dividend will increase if the NLF 
chooses to further convert its contractual 
right to the Cash Sweep Payment
into Shares.
In addition to the base dividend, the Board 
intends to consider the payment each year 
of an additional dividend from available 
cash in February following the third quarter 
results announcement. The Board will seek 
to return all surplus capital to shareholders 
as an additional dividend after taking into 
account the Group’s need to increase 
ﬁ nancial stability, make appropriate 
investments, address the pension scheme 
funding requirements, meet the collateral 
requirements of the Group and, over time, 
allow for its investment in nuclear new build. 
It is anticipated that the amount of additional 
dividend will vary from year to year.

The amount of cash British Energy Group plc 
is able to pay out as dividends is subject 
to restrictions under the Contribution 
Agreement. These require British Energy 
Group plc a) to maintain as a cash reserve 
£490m plus the amount by which cash 
employed as collateral exceeds £200m 
(Target Amount) and b) not to pay a 
dividend unless i) the cash at the ﬁ nancial 
year end prior to the year in which the 
dividend is to be paid exceeded the 
aggregate of, amongst other things, the 
dividend proposed and the Target Amount 
and ii) the cash at the ﬁ nancial year end 
in which the dividend is paid would or 
would be likely to exceed the aggregate 
of, amongst other things, the dividend 
proposed and the Target Amount. The 
restrictions are also, in effect, replicated 
in the terms of the Bonds.
Dividend Distributions 
In line with the Group’s dividend policy and 
following approval at the Annual General 
Meeting on 19 July 2007, a base dividend 
distribution, payable as a ﬁ nal dividend, 
of 13.6p per share (equivalent to £140m in 
total) was paid on 31 July 2007.
An additional dividend distribution, 
payable as an interim dividend, of 14.5p 
per share (equivalent to £150m in total) 
was declared following the 2008 third 
quarter results announcement. This was 
paid on 3 April 2008 and accordingly is 
not recognised as a distribution in the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements as it was 
not paid until after the balance sheet date.
Following the Cash Sweep Payment in 
respect of the year ended 31 March 2008, 
the maximum amount under the 
Contribution Agreement available for 
distribution to shareholders will be £257m 
or 24.9p per share, of which £71m or 6.8p 
per share reﬂ ects amounts brought 
forward from previous years. The Board has 
agreed to recommend that British Energy 
Group plc will pay a base dividend of 13.6p 
per share (equivalent to £141m in total 
based on current issued share capital fully 
diluted by the exercise of all remaining 
Warrants) as a ﬁ nal dividend for the year 
ended 31 March 2008, subject to approval 
at the Annual General Meeting on 
17 July 2008. If approved, this dividend 
distribution will be paid on 31 July 2008 to 
shareholders on British Energy Group plc’s 
shareholder register at close of business on 
27 June 2008.
Distributable Reserves 
The amount British Energy Group plc is 
able to distribute lawfully (by way of a 
dividend or other distribution) is governed 
by, amongst other things, the Companies 
Act 1985 and the application of UK GAAP , 
and requires that distributable reserves be 
available within the listed parent company. 
Share premium reserves are not 
distributable to shareholders. 
The NLF partial conversion in June 2007, 
and any subsequent conversions, could 
have an impact on British Energy Group 
plc’s future dividend policy. The impact 
could arise because the partial conversion 
signiﬁ cantly increased the carrying value 
of British Energy Group plc’s investments 
in its subsidiary and intermediate group 
holding company, British Energy Bond 
Finance plc (formerly British Energy 
Holdings plc) due to the recognition of 
a conversion asset of £2,340m in British 
Energy Generation Limited. The increase in 
carrying value of the investments increases 
the risk that impairment charges arising 
at a later date may impact upon British 
Energy Group plc’s distributable reserves 
position and could restrict its ability to pay 
dividends to the enlarged shareholder base, 
following the conversion and sale by the 
NLF, in accordance with the dividend policy.
In order to minimise the risk of impairment 
charges adversely affecting British Energy 
Group plc’s distributable reserve position, 
the Company initiated a process to obtain 
a court approved reduction of the share 
premium account. On 22 October 2007 
the Court of Session in Edinburgh approved 
a £2,295m reduction of British Energy 
Group plc’s share premium account, 
thereby creating distributable reserves 
of this value. The reduction of the share 
premium reserve by £2,295m equates to 
the amount of new share premium created 
in relation to the NLF partial conversion.
Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B 
Accounting Life Extensions
On 11 December 2007, British Energy 
Group plc extended the accounting lives 
of Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B power 
stations by ﬁ ve years to 2016. Following 
the change, the level of undiscounted 
estimated nuclear decommissioning 
liabilities remains unchanged, however, the 
decommissioning workstreams will occur 
later, therefore reducing the discounted 
nuclear decommissioning liabilities by 
£125m. The Government has indemniﬁ ed 
any future shortfall of NLF funding in

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
BUSINESS REVIEW
respect of qualifying decommissioning 
costs and therefore the reduction in 
discounted nuclear decommissioning 
liabilities is fully offset by a corresponding 
decrease in the Government’s indemnity. 
As a result there is no net revalorisation 
impact for this change. Additionally the 
change has not had a signiﬁ cant impact 
on the property, plant and equipment 
depreciation charge or the conversion 
asset amortisation during the period 
from 11 December 2007 to 31 March 2008. 
As a result of these extensions the Group 
expects the impact next ﬁ nancial year to 
be that nuclear decommissioning liabilities 
revalorisation and NLF receivable 
revalorisation will both decrease by £7m, 
therefore having no income statement 
impact, amortisation of the conversion 
asset will reduce by £41m and property, 
plant and equipment depreciation will 
reduce by £27m.
Eggborough Legal Proceedings
During the year ended 31 March 2007, 
British Energy Power and Energy Trading 
Limited, Eggborough Power (Holdings) 
Limited and Eggborough Power Limited 
instigated proceedings against Credit Suisse 
in relation to its involvement in transactions 
which it believed were in breach of the 
rights of the aforementioned companies 
under the terms of ﬁ nance agreements 
relating to the Eggborough Power Station. 
The transactions in question related to 
the exercise of the lending banks’ options 
to acquire the power station in 2010. The 
arrangements involved the consolidation 
of interests into a company called Ampere 
Limited, which would control the exercise 
of the options to acquire Eggborough. The 
Group received legal advice that such 
arrangements are not permitted under 
the Eggborough ﬁ nance agreements. In 
addition, the transactions in question were 
not considered to be in the best interests 
of the Group and its shareholders. 
On 19 June 2007, British Energy Group plc 
announced that it had been successful in 
its court action, however, on 26 September 
2007 Credit Suisse was granted leave to 
appeal. On 7 February 2008 British Energy 
Group plc announced that, in a unanimous 
judgement of the court, Credit Suisse’s 
appeal was dismissed. The Group was 
awarded its costs of the appeal. The 
outcome preserves the Group’s 
pre-emption rights, should the lending 
banks seek to sell or transfer their option 
rights to a third party before 31 March 2010.
Post Balance Sheet Events
On 21 March 2007, the Government 
announced its intention to phase out 
industrial buildings allowances with effect 
from 1 April 2008. This change has not been 
reﬂ ected in the ﬁ nancial statements at 
31 March 2008 because it is not considered 
to be substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. An estimate of the ﬁ nancial 
impact of this change at 31 March 2008 
is that it would increase the net deferred 
tax liability by £37m to £82m.
Basis of Presentation of 
Financial Statements
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements for 
the years ended 31 March 2008 and 2007 
have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union, 
International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 
interpretations and the provisions 
of the Companies Act 1985 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The ﬁ nancial statements of the parent 
company continue to be prepared under 
UK GAAP .
Accounting Policies
In preparing the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements under IFRS, management are 
required to make certain critical accounting 
estimates and judgements that affect 
amounts reported in the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements.
In the year ended 31 March 2008 the only 
new accounting policy adopted related 
to the accounting treatment of the 
conversion asset recognised as a result of 
the NLF partial conversion in June 2007.
Full details of the accounting policies, 
including those which involve signiﬁ cant 
estimates and judgements, are provided 
in note 2 to the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Our nuclear power stations play a very 
important role in reducing the UK’s 
carbon footprint. In the ﬁ nancial year 
2007/08 our nuclear stations avoided 
the emission of 34.8 million tonnes of 
carbon dioxide. 
Overview
As an operator of nuclear facilities 
British Energy is acutely aware of its 
responsibilities to its staff, the 
communities in which it operates, and to 
the environment. Our corporate culture 
is founded on personal responsibility – a 
commitment to being open, ethical, and 
above all, operating to the highest levels 
of safety at all times. Within British Energy 
it is referred to as ‘nuclear safety culture’.
We are proud of the contribution that 
we make to the environment. Our nuclear 
power stations play a very important 
role in reducing the UK’s carbon footprint. 
In the ﬁ nancial year 2007/08 our nuclear 
stations avoided the emission of 
34.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide 
(MtCO
2
) compared with 33.7MtCO
2
 in 
2006/07. By extending the lives of our 
existing stations and planning for the 
advent of nuclear new build, we intend 
to continue this valuable contribution 
to tackling climate change.
A measure of our commitment to 
responsible operation is our inclusion 
of Environmental Events and Lost Time 
Accidents in our seven Key Performance 
Indicators (see page 03). In addition, three 
critical aspects of corporate responsibility 
are an integral part of the Chief Executive’s 
Business Review and are reported on 
quarterly. These are safety performance, 
environmental performance, and 
investment in people. Further details 
are discussed below.
To evaluate our performance in broader 
aspects of corporate social responsibility 
we participated for the ﬁ rst time in the 
Business in the Community Corporate 
Responsibility Index this year. As a 
newcomer, we were pleased to receive 
a Bronze medal. 
We publish a full annual Corporate Social 
Responsibility Report which includes 
details of our carbon footprint and how 
we calculate the carbon emissions avoided. 
The report for 2007/08 will be available 
on our website over the summer. 
Marketplace
British Energy is the UK’s largest generator 
of electricity, yet has by far the lowest 
carbon dioxide emissions of any of the 
UK’s large electricity generators. We sell 
electricity through the wholesale market 
and directly to industrial and commercial 
customers. We are committed to supplying 
our customers with low carbon electricity 
and ensuring security of the country’s 
electricity supply. 
During the year, British Energy has taken 
a high proﬁ le role in raising awareness of 
the carbon impact of electricity consumption 
in the UK. This year our 11th annual 
customer conference ‘Talk Power’ was 
our largest to date, attracting more than 
260 customers and energy specialists, 
including senior representatives from 
some of the UK’s largest energy users. 
The debates during the day encouraged 
the consideration of carbon emissions 
not just a part of energy decision making, 
but as a more fundamental driver of 
business strategy. 
Customer service is critical and, for the 
fourth year running, we ranked in the 
top two of the UK’s major suppliers in 
the annual Datamonitor customer
service survey.
As part of our commitment to investors 
we held an investor day at Sizewell B in 
May 2007. In addition, we held a visit for 
Socially Responsible Investors, also at 
Sizewell B, in January 2008. Through these 
and other initiatives the Company’s senior 
management participated in meetings 
with over 300 investors and analysts 
during the year.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
BUSINESS REVIEW
Workplace
Within the workplace, our primary focus 
must always be on operational safety and 
the health of our employees. This year both 
our nuclear and industrial safety records 
are the best in the recorded history of the 
Company (see Key Performance Indicators 
on page 03). Commentary on our safety 
performance and our investment in 
continuous improvement in this area 
is covered on pages 09 and 10.
The Royal Society for the Prevention 
of Accidents (RoSPA) presents awards 
for excellence in managing health and 
safety at work. We received outstanding 
accolades at the RoSPA awards this year, 
with all our nuclear power stations 
receiving an award for outstanding safety 
performance. The highest honour, an Order 
of Distinction, was awarded to Hunterston B, 
Torness, Heysham 1 and Heysham 2. 
Second highest honours, the President’s 
award, was given to Dungeness B, 
Hartlepool and Sizewell B, and Hinkley 
Point B received a Gold medal.
We are committed to developing the 
considerable talents of our staff in each 
part of the business. This year we have 
built a new skills centre at Heysham Power 
Station and a Nuclear Power Academy 
at the Company’s technical centre, at 
Barnwood. The Academy will provide 
state-of-the-art centralised training 
courses in nuclear operation for new 
graduates and apprentices, as well as 
refresher courses for existing staff. On 
average, each employee across the ﬂ eet 
devoted 8.8 days to training – up on last 
year’s ﬁ gure of 8.4 days. We are also testing 
the effectiveness of our training by 
measuring our courses against the high 
standard benchmark of the Training 
Standards and Accreditation Board.
We have also recruited around 430 
individuals, increasing our employee 
number to an average of over 6,100 people 
in 2007/08. This year, we invested in 
recruitment to critical operational areas. 
A campaign commenced in September 2007 
to ensure an adequate supply of suitably 
qualiﬁ ed and experienced people for 
the future. 
The Company continues to champion 
equality of opportunity, and maintains 
policies and procedures to support best 
practice, rather than being satisﬁ ed with 
legislative compliance. The roll out of 
‘Dignity at Work’, is a joint project between 
the trade union Unite, the Department for 
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform 
(BERR), and a number of companies 
including British Energy, BT and Royal Mail. 
The fourth annual British Energy 
Excellence Awards were held in 
February 2008. This year’s awards were 
presented in recognition of individual 
contributions to safety, operational 
excellence and business performance by 
staff and contract partners. The awards 
are an opportunity to celebrate the 
achievements of committed employees 
and contractors from across the business. 
Environment
Our nuclear power stations play a very 
important role in reducing the UK’s carbon 
footprint. In the ﬁ nancial year 2007/08 
they avoiding the emission of 34.8MtCO
2
 
compared with 33.7MtCO
2
 in 2006/07. 
Eggborough, our coal-ﬁ red power station 
which provides ﬂ exible generation to 
meet peak demands, emitted 7.8MtCO
2
 
in 2007/08 compared with 6.9MtCO
2
 
in 2006/07.

Even though we are already making a 
major contribution towards the UK’s 
climate change objectives with our 
nuclear generation, we aim to go further. 
One example is that our largest ofﬁ ce, 
Barnwood, has set a target to reduce 
electricity usage by 10% in the coming year.
In 2007/08 British Energy reported its 
lowest ever number of Environmental 
Events, a Key Performance Indicator. 
Commentary on this area is covered on 
page 10.
During the year, we have continued to work 
with the Environment Agency (EA) on the 
Nuclear Sector Plan, a collaborative project 
between the EA and the nuclear industry 
in England and Wales. The plan aims to 
reduce the impact of the nuclear sector. 
Last year we agreed with the EA to focus 
on the minimisation and management of 
the solid waste we produce. As a result, 
across the ﬂ eet last year we recovered for 
re-use, or recycled, approximately 30% of 
our general waste.
Over the year our nuclear ﬂ eet has 
succeeded in reducing its accumulated 
Low Level Waste (LLW) by over 15%. We 
will explore further opportunities to reduce 
our accumulated LLW over the coming year. 
Intermediate Level Waste (ILW) is stored 
on site at the relevant station. The level 
of production of ILW is fairly constant and 
each station produces typically a few tens 
of cubic metres each year. Spent nuclear 
fuel from our AGR stations is transported 
in specially designed steel ﬂ asks to 
Sellaﬁ eld, Cumbria, where it is managed 
through a well established process. Spent 
nuclear fuel from our PWR Sizewell B 
power station remains in safe storage on 
site. 2006/07 was a year of particularly 
good progress in reducing site inventories 
of uranium. In 2007/08 we sent 134 tonnes 
of uranium to Sellaﬁ eld, compared with 
224 tonnes of uranium in the previous year, 
reﬂ ecting both improved efﬁ ciency and 
lower generation.
During the year a number of our stations 
were audited and have retained their 
ISO 14001 certiﬁ cation for a further three 
years. All our power stations are certiﬁ ed 
to the relevant internationally recognised 
environmental management standard 
and have been since such standards ﬁ rst 
came into being some 13 years ago. In line 
with the requirements of ISO 14001 all 
of our stations have, over the past year, 
implemented environmental improvements 
such as recycling lubricating oil and 
improving oil storage and solid waste 
management facilities.
The Large Combustion Plant Directive, a 
mandatory government initiative, aims 
to reduce acidiﬁ cation, ground level ozone, 
and particles throughout Europe. This is 
being achieved by controlling emissions of 
sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and dust 
(particulate matter) from large combustion 
plants. Eggborough, our coal power 
station, has ‘Opted-In’ to this Directive and 
is included in the UK’s National Emissions 
Reduction Plan.
In 2007 the Group’s Biodiversity Action Plan 
was updated and integrated into British 
Energy’s environmental management 
system, helping to ensure that we minimise 
the impact on biodiversity from our 
business operations. Throughout 2008 
we are sponsoring the BTO Business Bird 
Challenge, a bi-annual competition to ﬁ nd 
the country’s best industrial and commercial 
sites for diversity of bird species.
Community
Maintaining good relationships with the 
communities around our power stations 
is essential for our operations. Last year, 
British Energy added ‘community’ to 
its company values to demonstrate its 
commitment to the people who live and 
work around all our sites. We have also 
appointed site-based community liaison 
ofﬁ cers to progress community relations 
plans tailored to the needs of the 
different sites.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
BUSINESS REVIEW
In addition to the formal stakeholder 
engagement we carry out through 
established meetings held regularly at our 
stations, we also run broader community 
meetings on subjects of special interest. 
This year, we held two additional 
programmes of community meetings. 
The ﬁ rst followed the Government’s 
announcement in May 2007 that it was 
going to carry out a consultation on the 
future of nuclear power. This programme 
was run in conjunction with BERR at all 
our sites during the summer. The second 
programme was held at potential sites 
for new nuclear build to explain the 
Government’s policy on new nuclear 
power stations, the role that British Energy 
intends to play and the potential 
opportunities and impacts for 
communities.
Ensuring there are enough people with 
specialist skills in the marketplace in the 
future is a challenge British Energy and 
many other employers are increasingly 
facing. By working in partnership with 
local schools, such as Leiston High in 
Suffolk, and by sponsoring high proﬁ le 
events such as the Cheltenham and 
Edinburgh Science Festivals we are helping 
to stimulate interest in science, technology, 
engineering and maths subjects. Our 
ambition is to increase the supply of high 
quality new applicants with the necessary 
skills. British Energy also offers a service 
providing presenters to schools and 
other local events.
British Energy extended its partnership 
with Help the Hospices to December 2007, 
following its success as our charity of the 
year. This year our employees raised 
£268,000 bringing the total for the two 
years to over £530,000 for the hospice 
movement, including £200,000 in matched 
funding from British Energy.

Corporate Governance
The Board is committed to ensuring that high standards of 
corporate governance are maintained by the Group. It supports 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) and has 
reviewed its corporate governance practices in the light of the 
Code published by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2006 
and considers that it complies with section 1 of the Code. 
Corporate governance best practice is also monitored, and 
appropriate recommendations from relevant professional 
bodies are adopted. 
During the year the Company instructed an external review of 
its corporate governance procedures and received a positive 
report. The training and induction programmes for Directors and 
communication with shareholders were particularly commended.
The Board 
Membership
Sir Adrian Montague held ofﬁ ce as Chairman and Bill Coley held 
ofﬁ ce as Chief Executive throughout the year. The roles of the 
Chairman and Chief Executive are distinct. The Chairman is 
responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of the Board, while the 
Chief Executive directs the executive functions and is responsible 
for safety throughout the Group. Stephen Billingham continued 
in ofﬁ ce as Finance Director. In addition to the Chairman, there 
are currently seven further Non-Executive Directors. Biographies 
of the Directors are set out on pages 32 and 33. 
The Directors are satisﬁ ed that the Company complied with 
the sections of the Code concerning the balance of the Board 
throughout the year. During the year, the number of Non-Executive 
Directors was greater than the number of Executive Directors, 
with two Executive and seven Non-Executive Directors in addition 
to the Chairman. Sir Adrian Montague held an executive ofﬁ ce 
with British Energy plc temporarily for part of the ﬁ nancial year 
ended 31 March 2003 (following his appointment as Executive 
Chairman in November 2002 until the appointment of a chief 
executive in March 2003). As Chairman he is not categorised as 
an independent director. The other Non-Executive Directors are 
all considered to be independent. The Company’s independent 
Non-Executive Directors are currently: 
Pascal Colombani • 
Bob Davies • 
John Delucca • 
Ian Harley • 
David Pryde • 
Sir Robert Walmsley • 
Robert Walvis • 
The Remuneration Committee Report on pages 42 to 48 provides 
details of appointments to and resignations from the Board. 
Clare Spottiswoode retired at the 2007 AGM and Ian Harley took 
over as the Company’s Senior Independent Director and Deputy 
Chairman on the same date. Robert Walvis joined the Company 
as a Non-Executive Director in August 2007.
The Company re-entered the FTSE 100 during the year. Sir Adrian 
Montague remained as Chairman and also served as Chairman 
of Friends Provident plc, which was an existing member of the 
FTSE 100 at the time of British Energy’s re-entry to the index. 
The Board is satisﬁ ed in these circumstances not only that his 
chairmanship of both companies did not constitute a breach 
of Rule A.4.3 of the Code, but that he remained able to devote 
sufﬁ cient time and attention to the Company’s business. The 
Board does not believe that the position has had any adverse 
impact on the Board’s operations and is satisﬁ ed that in the 
circumstances it was and is appropriate for him to continue 
as Chairman. 
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that at each 
AGM any Director who has been appointed by the Board since 
the previous AGM is required to retire and may seek re-election, 
together with such other Directors so as to ensure that the 
number nearest to but not less than one third of the Directors, 
for the time being, stand for election or re-election. In order to 
comply with the provisions of Rule A.7 of the Code, all Directors 
are required to seek re-election at least every three years. The 
Company’s policy was that Directors should retire at the ﬁ rst 
AGM after their 66th birthday. However, the Board will seek 
shareholder approval to remove this provision at the Company’s 
forthcoming AGM in order to align with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 and age discrimination legislation.
Conduct of Business
The Board meets sufﬁ ciently regularly to discharge its duties 
effectively. It is scheduled to meet eight times a year, and met 
eleven times during the year. There is contact among the 
Directors between Board meetings as necessary to progress 
the Company’s business. The Company also organises periodic 
executive sessions involving the non-executives, members of 
the Company’s senior management and external advisers to 
improve the Directors understanding of the business and aid 
effective communication.
Although the normal operational management of the Company 
has been delegated to the Chief Executive, the Board has a 
number of matters reserved to it, particularly, appropriate 
strategic, ﬁ nancial and organisational matters. These are 
considered at the Board meetings. 
The Board receives reports covering operational, ﬁ nancial, 
safety, risk management and regulatory performance to assist it 
in identifying key issues for the business on a regular and timely 
basis. Where appropriate, matters have been delegated to Board 
committees, all of which have written constitutions and Terms 
of Reference. 
Details of the Directors who served throughout the year are 
set out on pages 32 and 33 of the Annual Report. Information 
required under the provisions of the Companies Acts and the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority regarding the 
remuneration and share options of Directors, the interests of 
the Directors and their families in the share capital of the 
Company, and Directors’ service contracts, is detailed in the 
Remuneration Committee Report on pages 42 to 48.
All of the Non-Executive Directors serving on the Board have 
held and/or hold senior positions in other major organisations 
either in the UK and/or internationally. Each of them is involved 
in decision making on key issues facing the Group and 
collectively bring a wide range of experience to the Board.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Non-Executive Directors of the Company meet as a group 
without Executive Directors present and from time to time also 
meet without the Chairman present.
It is the Company’s policy that Directors may obtain independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense and all Directors 
have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary 
and General Counsel, who is accountable to the Board through 
the Chairman on all corporate governance matters.
Performance Evaluation
All Board members have participated in structured training 
sessions during the year. These sessions included trading and 
market issues and strategy, legal and regulatory changes 
affecting the business; issues of interest to shareholders and 
governance, risk assessment and mitigation, and stakeholder 
engagement. The Board received training on the new directors’ 
duties under the Companies Act 2006. All Board members are 
also expected to attend at least one meeting of the Safety, 
Health and Environment Committee, which meets quarterly, 
and all are expected to undertake at least one external 
management course relevant to British Energy in any three year 
period. In addition, one Board member attended the governance 
course for non-executives of nuclear companies held at Emory 
University Atlanta in conjunction with the Institute of Nuclear 
Power Operators, and all Board members are expected to 
attend this annual course at some point during their term of 
ofﬁ ce. During the year the Company further developed its 
induction programme for Directors. The induction programme 
includes presentations and interview sessions with key 
managers to ensure the Director has an understanding of the 
business, including legal, governance, ﬁ nancial, trading and 
operational issues. The induction also includes tours of the 
power stations and attendance at one of the Company’s nuclear 
safety culture workshops.
Performance evaluation of the Board, Chairman and individual 
Directors and the effectiveness of individual Board committees 
and the committee structure is reviewed annually using a 
detailed questionnaire which is completed by the Board. 
In the 2007 Review, the Board identiﬁ ed the following areas 
for focus in 2007/08: strategy and the amount of time the 
Board devote to strategic issues; oversight of nuclear operations 
and performance; obtaining investor feedback on Company 
performance and strategy; reviewing and optimising the 
Board committee structures and governance arrangements; 
and succession planning. As part of its overall performance 
review the Board also instructed an independent review of 
the effectiveness of the Board, Board committees, committee 
and department structures speciﬁ cally in relation to nuclear 
oversight of operations and nuclear governance.
As a result of these reviews the remit of certain Board 
committees and their membership has been revised. The 
membership of the six Board committees is now exclusively 
non-executive and the members have been rotated to bring 
fresh perspectives. The Technical Advisory Committee has 
evolved into the Technical Performance Oversight Committee 
which has oversight of the technical and operational risks facing 
the Company. The membership of the Safety, Health and 
Environment Committee has also been refreshed with the 
appointment of a new independent member with experience 
in both the nuclear and oil and gas industries. The roles of the 
committee and the relationships with, and expectations of, 
line management were clariﬁ ed. Performance metrics have 
been reﬁ ned and clearer, more focused reporting has allowed 
the Board to devote more time to strategic issues and 
appropriate oversight.
The 2008 surveys indicated good progress in the areas of focus 
identiﬁ ed in the 2007 Review and satisfaction with the new 
arrangements. As in 2007, the survey will be followed up with 
one to one meetings between the Chairman and each Director 
and the issues arising will be considered by the Board in autumn 
2009, informing the Board on further priorities for performance 
improvement.
The Board also devoted effort to succession planning (see the 
section headed Governance and Nominations Committee on 
page 37) and made good progress in this area which will 
continue to be a priority.
Risk Management 
The Board is responsible for determining strategies and policies 
for risk and control, and management is responsible for 
designing, operating and monitoring risk and control processes 
which implement Board policies effectively. In accordance with 
the revised Turnbull Guidance, risk management and internal 
control are considered by the Board and its committees during 
the year. Further details on the Group’s present committee 
structure appear below.
The risk management process operating throughout the year 
and up to the date of approval of the report was based on the 
identiﬁ cation, mitigation and monitoring of the key risks that 
inﬂ uence the Company’s strategy and business objectives. 
The Board reviews the Group’s business objectives and the 
strategic, ﬁ nancial, legal and regulatory and operational risks 
and controls associated with these. Risks reviewed by the Board 
include:
safe operation of our plant; • 
security; • 
plant condition and reliability; • 
human performance; • 
IT systems and business continuity; • 
major contracts; • 
the procurement of radioactive waste management services; • 
the ﬁ nancial position of the Group; • 
treasury and trading ﬁ nancial exposures including collateral; • 
changes in energy markets; • 
policy proposals by legislative bodies in the markets in which • 
we operate; 
nuclear safety and safety regulations; and • 
commercial and environmental regulation. • 
Throughout the year the Company’s reporting arrangements 
operated across the Group’s operating subsidiaries and corporate 
functions, monitoring business performance against key 
performance indicators and the business plan. Risk logs

Corporate Governance
identifying business risks facing the Group as a whole, and 
particular parts of the business, were regularly considered 
at subsidiary and divisional level and reported to the Group’s 
senior management, and mitigation plans were established 
and monitored. The Group’s principal operating subsidiaries 
monitored internal controls and risk mitigation throughout 
the year. Risks to the operation of the Group’s nuclear power 
stations and risk and internal control issues affecting the nuclear 
business are reviewed by the Generation Risk Committee and by 
the Board of British Energy Generation Limited (the Generation 
Board), our nuclear subsidiary. The Generation Board also reports 
on management and decommissioning liabilities to the Board 
which, in turn, is required to approve the annual liabilities report 
required under the Nuclear Liabilities Funding Agreement. The 
Technical Performance Oversight Committee and the Safety, 
Health and Environment Committee, both committees of the 
Board, monitor the management of technical and safety risks.
Risks managed by corporate functions such as Finance, 
Legal, HR and Information Management are reviewed by 
the Corporate Functions’ Risk Committee. The conduct of risk 
assessment involves senior management of all the Group’s 
business units in addition to the Executive Directors. The results 
of these assessments are summarised and reported to the 
Board. These risk assessments will continue to be used as part 
of the Company’s evaluation of the risks it faces. In addition, 
the Board receives half yearly reports from the Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer 
addressing risk appetite, effectiveness of risk mitigation and 
priorities for risk management.
Electricity Trading Risk Management
Electricity trading activities predominantly relate to supporting 
the generation business. Our trading department therefore acts 
as our wholesale marketer rather than as a ﬁ nancial trader, with 
the principal objective of increasing the return on assets while 
managing the market risk (including the risks relating to collateral 
requirements) associated with the output of the power stations.
Under the British Electricity Transmission and Trading 
Arrangements (BETTA), which took effect from 1 April 2005, 
any mismatch between actual metered generation (or demand) 
and the notiﬁ ed contract position is settled through the balancing 
mechanism at generally unfavourable prices. The Company aims 
to manage its portfolio of ﬁ xed price contracts and minimise 
exposure to the balancing mechanism and short-term electricity 
prices. The risks in the wholesale market are managed through a 
contracting strategy that builds a portfolio of forward contracts.
Trading risks are reviewed by management through the Trading 
Risk Standing Committee and the Power and Energy Trading 
(BEPET) Board. The Commercial Risk Committee, a committee 
of the Board, monitors hedging and risk management strategy 
for trading as well as non-technical risks facing the Group to 
ensure that activities are conducted within overall limits. 
Additional control is provided through delegated authorities, 
which form part of an overall energy trading risk management 
policy. Clearly deﬁ ned limits are established and monitored for 
ﬁ nancial headroom risk, market risk, credit risk and collateral 
exposure to trading and ﬁ nancial counterparties. Any breaches 
would be reported to the Board.
Committee Structure 
The Chairman of each committee reports to the Board following 
each committee meeting on decisions taken or endorsed and 
makes recommendations as appropriate to the Board. The Board 
may delegate authority to each of the committees where the 
subject of the delegation does not require Board approval. The 
papers for each committee are made available to all Board 
members, other than those for the Remuneration Committee 
and the Governance and Nominations Committee, which are 
only circulated to independent members or as those 
committees may direct. The committee structure is intended to 
allow the committees to scrutinise performance in more detail 
than the Board could achieve in full session and so allows the 
Board to focus on strategic issues to a greater extent.
It is the Company’s policy that committees are provided with 
sufﬁ cient resources to undertake their duties. The Company 
may make further changes to committee structures or roles in 
due course in order to comply with further developments in 
corporate governance best practice and to ensure the effective 
and efﬁ cient operation of those committees. The current Terms 
of Reference for each committee are available on the Company’s 
website.
Board Committees
The current committee structure is described below:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Ian Harley is Chairman and ﬁ nancial 
expert and John Delucca is Deputy Chairman of the committee. 
The remaining members of the committee are identiﬁ ed on 
page 39. The committee has the primary purpose of assisting 
the Board in overseeing the integrity of the Company’s ﬁ nancial 
statements, and the Company’s compliance with legal and 
regulatory requirements. The committee is also responsible for 
considering and recommending appropriate accounting policies 
for the Group, reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of 
internal control and compliance procedures within the Group 
and ensuring that it complies with all statutory requirements 
in relation to the principles, policies and practices adopted in 
the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements. The committee 
reviewed risk management processes across the Group 
including actions to mitigate or control key risks facing the 
Group. The committee receives reports from both external and 
internal auditors in relation to matters arising from their work 
and is also responsible for encouraging and monitoring the 
adoption of best practice in corporate governance. 
The committee receives reports periodically from the Chief Risk 
Ofﬁ cer and the Commercial Risk Committee. The committee 
reviews the scope and results of the external audit including the 
auditors’ cost-effectiveness, independence and objectivity, and is 
responsible for making recommendations to the Board in relation 
to the appointment and independence of the external auditors 
and their remuneration. It also reviews the nature and extent of 
the non-audit services provided by the external auditors to the 
Group to ensure that these are appropriate, and that a balance 
of objectivity and value for money is maintained. The committee 
normally meets the day prior to Board meetings and otherwise 
as required by the business of the Company. The committee met

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
nine times during the year. In the course of these meetings, 
the committee considered the following matters:
Financial Reporting
The committee reviewed the annual audited ﬁ nancial 
statements, quarterly ﬁ nancial statements and investor 
presentations before recommending their publication to the 
Board. It discussed with the Finance Director and external 
auditors the Company’s compliance with ﬁ nancial reporting 
and governance standards and reviewed signiﬁ cant accounting 
policies, changes to them and any signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial estimates 
and judgements applied in their preparation. It also received 
reports on due diligence on proposed statements from the 
Disclosure Committee and reviewed management’s going 
concern analysis on a quarterly basis.
External Audit
The committee has direct responsibility for the appointment, 
compensation, retention and oversight of external auditors and 
approves their terms of engagement. It reviews and monitors 
the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and 
management’s responsiveness to external audit ﬁ ndings and 
recommendations. The committee pre-approves all auditing 
services and permitted non-audit services undertaken by the 
external auditors to ensure the appropriateness of the work 
and value for money. The Board has approved policies covering 
the provision of non-audit services, which are designed to 
ensure that such services do not impair the external auditors’ 
independence or objectivity. The policies include procedures to 
examine the relationships between the Company, the auditors 
and assurances on the interests of the auditors’ staff in order 
to ensure independence is maintained. The policies set out 
the approval requirements for speciﬁ c categories of work and 
require justiﬁ cation as to why non-audit work should be placed 
with the auditors rather than another ﬁ rm, on grounds of best 
value or conﬁ dentiality. The fees recharged to a third party 
which are disclosed in note 5 to the Financial Statements 
were justiﬁ ed on grounds of conﬁ dentiality and synergy with 
concurrent audit work.
The committee recommended that the Board present 
a resolution to shareholders at the 2008 AGM for the 
reappointment of the external auditors. This followed 
an assessment of the quality of service provided, auditor 
independence and the effectiveness of the audit process. 
Whistleblowing
The committee is responsible for the company policy on 
conﬁ dential reporting of serious concerns and oversees its 
effectiveness. The committee considered quarterly reports 
summarising concerns reported and the outcome of any 
investigatory work.
Internal Controls and Risk Management
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system 
of internal controls, including ﬁ nancial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management. The committee 
has ongoing arrangements designed to assist the Board in the 
performance of this responsibility and periodically reports to 
the Board on controls and risk management. Accordingly, during 
the year it considered reports from internal audit on internal 
control issues and a year-end report from the internal control 
and ﬁ nancial processes team summarising the outcome from 
their testing activity. The committee also sought the views of 
the external auditors in making its assessment of the internal 
control environment.
Internal Audit
The committee received reports from internal audit at each of 
its meetings including quality reports on the reviews conducted 
by the internal audit team. The Chairman of the committee 
meets with the Head of Internal Audit regularly to discuss 
current issues and the whole committee held ﬁ ve private 
sessions with the Head of Internal Audit during the year. 
The committee commissioned an external review of the 
effectiveness of the internal audit function in September 2006 
and the outcome was considered by the committee in
May 2007. The review concluded that the internal audit function 
is effective, generally highly regarded, technically competent, 
objective, responsive, professional and adequately resourced. 
Actions arising relating to improving coverage/relationships 
in trading; addressing resourcing constraints and working on 
communications in speciﬁ c areas have all been progressed 
during 2007/08.
Commercial Risk Committee
The Risk Review Committee was renamed the Commercial 
Risk Committee during the year and its terms of reference 
and membership were revised. It is now comprised entirely 
of Non-Executive Directors (as identiﬁ ed on page 39) and is 
chaired by Robert Walvis. Its remit is to review the processes 
for the identiﬁ cation, mitigation and management of risks 
(other than technical risks which are reviewed by the 
Technical Performance Oversight Committee) and the control 
procedures to minimise them. It also advises on risk appetite. 
The committee receives regular reports from the Chief Risk 
Ofﬁ cer, the Head of Trading Risk, the Head of Regulation and 
the Trading Risk Standing Committee on risk and compliance 
matters. It is advised of any material policy or authority limit 
breaches and ensures that management action is 
commensurate to address issues arising.
During 2007/08 the committee received regular updates on 
the trading environment and the Group’s contracting strategy 
and collateral and headroom management. Other areas of 
focus were business continuity planning, disaster recovery, 
information technology, the arrangements for uranium 
procurement, compliance with prudent trading policies and 
undertakings to HM Government; controls in the gas, oil, 
power trading business; the structure of risk control in the 
Group; and non-technical risk management and mitigation. The 
Commercial Risk Committee met seven times during the year.
Governance and Nominations Committee 
The Governance and Nominations Committee is comprised 
entirely of Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by Sir Robert 
Walmsley. The committee is responsible for encouraging and 
monitoring the adoption of good corporate governance practice. 
It reviews the Company’s code of conduct and ethics and

Corporate Governance
compliance with this code and the Company’s legal obligations 
generally. The committee also reviews the corporate social 
responsibility performance of the Group and advises the Board 
in relation to senior appointments throughout the Group. Board 
appointments recommended by the committee are made after 
an appropriate search and selection process has been undertaken 
including, where appropriate, the use of external advisers to 
identify suitable candidates. 
During the year the committee reviewed the results of the 
Board performance and nuclear oversight reviews and considered 
what action should be taken to address the issues identiﬁ ed; 
the terms of reference for the Board Committees were reviewed 
as part of this exercise. Considerable time was devoted to Board 
succession, particularly to identifying an appropriate successor 
to Clare Spottiswoode who stepped down as Senior Non-Executive 
Director and Deputy Chairman in July 2007. As a result Robert 
Walvis was appointed as a Non-Executive Director in August 2007 
and Ian Harley became Senior Non-Executive Director and Deputy 
Chairman with effect from the 2007 AGM. The Governance and 
Nominations Committee met ﬁ ve times during the year.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee Report containing details of the 
activities of the Remuneration Committee appears on pages 42 
to 48. 
Safety, Health and Environment Committee
The Safety, Health and Environment Committee provides 
advice to the Board in relation to the health and safety of staff, 
contractors, visitors and the general public, plant safety and the 
environmental performance of the Group. It reviews key safety 
and environmental risks affecting the Group’s business and the 
actions taken to mitigate or control them. It is chaired by David 
Pryde and also includes three independent experts as well as 
certain other Non-Executive Directors identiﬁ ed on page 39. 
Two meetings in each year are held at one of the power stations 
with the station director and site safety representatives in 
attendance to consider both site-speciﬁ c and generic issues. 
During 2007/08 the committee received regular updates 
on the Group’s safety and environmental performance. Over 
the year the Company focused on efforts to improve human 
performance and knowledge of nuclear safety and the 
committee considered the actions taken and the Company’s 
progress against key performance indicators. In addition the 
committee reviewed the Company’s approach to safety, 
including radiation dose and contractor management on the 
BCU Project. The Safety, Health and Environment Committee 
met four times during the year.
Technical Performance Oversight Committee
The Technical Advisory Committee was renamed the Technical 
Performance Oversight Committee during the year and its 
terms of reference and membership were reviewed. The 
committee is chaired by Pascal Colombani. The committee 
also includes senior managers with technical expertise. The 
remaining members of the committee are identiﬁ ed on page 39. 
The committee considers and advises the Board on issues of a 
technical nature referred to it relating to the performance 
of, and improvements to, British Energy’s nuclear ﬂ eet. The 
committee considers and advises on technical and operational 
issues and signiﬁ cant management of change issues facing the 
nuclear generation business. Members of the Generation Board 
continue to have responsibility for, and direct, the operational 
and safety policy of British Energy’s nuclear operations. 
During 2007/08 the committee reviewed the business plan 
priorities for the generation business including outage and 
equipment reliability improvement plans. The technical issues 
dominating the year were the boiler issues at Hunterston B and 
Hinkley Point B, the periodic safety reviews of these stations, the 
boiler closure units at Hartlepool and Heysham 1, the prospects 
for life extension and planning for output recovery and all these 
issues were reviewed. The committee received regular reports 
on the technical risk proﬁ le of the Company and considered how 
the issues identiﬁ ed were being managed and mitigated. The 
committee normally meets the day prior to a Board meeting and 
met ﬁ ve times during the year.
Other Committees
Finance and Policy Committee
The Finance and Policy Committee is a management committee 
chaired by Bill Coley and includes Stephen Billingham, Robert 
Armour, Company Secretary and General Counsel, and Jim Meechan, 
HR Director, as members. The Finance and Policy Committee meets 
frequently and maintains scrutiny of the corporate business of 
the Group and, in particular, cross business issues including 
Finance, Human Resources, Strategy, Information Management, 
Corporate Affairs, Internal Audit and Risk functions and areas not 
falling under remit of the Generation Board or the BEPET Board.
Management Committees and Subsidiary Boards
Throughout the year a number of management committees 
and subsidiary boards were used to assist the Directors in 
controlling the business. These included the Generation Board, 
which directs operational and safety policy in the Group’s 
nuclear operations, the BEPET Board, which reviews the 
operational performance strategy and controls in the power 
trading business, and the Eggborough Power Limited Board, 
which oversees operational and safety policy for the 
Eggborough coal-ﬁ red power station.
Management Risk Committees 
The Trading Risk Standing Committee meets monthly to review 
the identiﬁ cation and management of risks to the trading business. 
It is chaired by the Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer and reports top risks to the 
BEPET Board and the Commercial Risk Committee quarterly. 
The BEGEN Risk Committee meets quarterly to review the 
identiﬁ cation and management of risks to the generation business. 
It is chaired by the Head of Asset Planning and Investment and 
reports top risks to the Generation Board and the Board’s Technical 
Performance Oversight Committee quarterly. The Corporate 
Functions Risk Committee meets quarterly to review the 
identiﬁ cation and management of risks to the activities of 
corporate functions such as Finance, Legal, Human Resources and 
Information Management. It is chaired by the Chief Risk Ofﬁ cer and 
reports top risks to the Finance and Policy Committee quarterly.

Corporate Governance
Organisational Structure 
There are clearly deﬁ ned lines of accountability throughout 
the Group. These include strict authorisation approval and 
control procedures within which senior management operate. 
Similarly, the senior management team within each subsidiary 
or division is responsible for its internal ﬁ nancial controls. 
Those management teams operate within an overall framework 
determined by the Board. 
External Non-Executive Directorships
We permit the Chief Executive to retain certain external 
non-executive directorships provided they do not cause a 
conﬂ ict or inhibit his ability to work for the Company. Each such 
appointment including the details of emoluments is subject 
to Board approval. Details of such fees are included on page 45.
Investment Approval
The approval of capital and revenue schemes above certain 
limits is reserved to the Board. Other investment decisions are 
delegated for approval in accordance with authority limits. The 
Group has comprehensive appraisal and monitoring procedures 
which apply to all material investment decisions. 
Business Planning 
A comprehensive business planning and budgeting process 
to establish plans and targets, against which performance 
is regularly monitored, is undertaken each year. Key business 
risks are reviewed regularly throughout the year and inform 
investment prioritisation in the business plan. The Board 
receives monthly reports and management accounts and 
reviews the overall Group performance against budget 
and the latest forecasts for the current year. Similarly, each 
subsidiary and divisional management team meets regularly 
to monitor performance. 
Internal Compliance and Control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
controls and reviewing its effectiveness. The identiﬁ cation 
of key business risks, the evaluation of their ﬁ nancial and 
non-ﬁ nancial implications and formulation of policies to 
manage such risks is the responsibility of the Directors. 
This system is designed to identify and manage, rather 
than eliminate, risk and can provide only reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Board assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
controls as of the date of this report. In making this assessment, 
the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
Compliance with the Group’s internal ﬁ nancial, risk management 
and other controls is monitored by a number of methods 
including management reviews and self-certiﬁ cation reports 
from Directors and senior ofﬁ cers of each of the key subsidiaries 
or divisions. The Group’s internal audit function is responsible for 
providing assurance on the performance of the internal ﬁ nancial 
and risk management control system and computer operations 
and reports regularly to the Audit Committee. Internal audit work 
is focused on the areas of highest risk as agreed and prioritised by 
the Audit Committee. The scope of work, authority and resources 
of the internal audit function are reviewed by the Audit 
Committee at least annually. The role of the internal audit 
function is discussed further below.
Steps are being taken to embed internal controls and risk 
management further into the operations of the business and 
to explore areas of improvement which come to management 
and the Board’s attention. Although the Company is no longer 
bound by the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act it has sought 
to retain the revised arrangements which were implemented 
to meet the Act’s requirements. A more streamlined and 
risk-based approach has now been established and to support 
this change, a self-certiﬁ cation process was adopted in 2007/08. 
Testing and certiﬁ cation of key ﬁ nancial controls has been 
performed at divisional level with central co-ordination by 
Finance and independent oversight performed by Internal 
Audit. As part of this process, management has been 
encouraged to explore opportunities for improvement which 
may come to their attention. This self-certiﬁ cation process 
will continue to be embedded and reﬁ ned during 2008/09.
Internal Audit
The Group’s internal audit function provides independent 
assurance that the risk management processes in place across 
the Group are of sound design and are operating as intended. 
Evaluation of the adequacy of the framework of controls in 
place to mitigate risks to an acceptable level is conducted as 
part of that assurance. Within its scope, the function examines 
the Group’s controls and procedures and attempts to identify 
any potential best practices/weaknesses within the systems. 
Internal audit work follows an annually developed risk-based 
plan which is agreed by the Audit Committee and encompasses 
all areas of the Group. Development of the annual plan is based 
on a range of information sources, including review of corporate 
risk log information and discussion with key management 
across the Group to understand their view of risks and priorities. 
In addition to the approved plan the function responds to 
emerging risks and issues arising within the year as appropriate 
or at the request of management and the Audit Committee.
An external review of the internal audit function was 
undertaken in late 2006/07 which gave an overall view that 
the function is effective at providing independent assurance 
to the Board in relation to the internal control environment 
in the Group. The review identiﬁ ed a number of actions and 
recommendations to enhance current arrangements which 
were built into a structured plan and delivered in 2007/08. This 
exercise will be repeated on at least a ﬁ ve year cycle to continue 
to independently assess the function and identify opportunities 
for ongoing development.
To ensure independence of the internal audit function, the Head 
of Internal Audit reports functionally to the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee considered the scope of internal audit’s 
work, its plans for the year and resources in May 2007. 
Subsequent changes to the plan were communicated throughout 
the year to the Audit Committee, and the results of the year’s 
work were presented to the Audit Committee at the year end.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Five routine private sessions were held between the members 
of the Audit Committee and the Head of Internal Audit. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
The Company will shortly publish a separate Corporate Social 
Responsibility Report for 2007/08 on its website. This will 
include details of the Group’s record on safety and 
environmental performance. A summary of the Company’s 
approach to Corporate Social Responsibility is contained on 
pages 28 to 31. Our 2006/07 Corporate Social Responsibility 
Report is available on the Company’s website. 
Conﬁ dential Reporting of Serious Concerns
The Company operates a procedure to allow staff to raise 
serious concerns, suspicions of fraud or money laundering, 
suspicious accounting treatment or practices, and any other 
suspicious, unsafe or non-compliant activity which an employee 
may observe on a conﬁ dential basis. In relation to allegations 
of serious fraud this procedure involves direct referral to an 
external independent organisation which will record concerns 
and determine the appropriate person to investigate them and 
recommend any action required to address resulting issues.
Communication with Shareholders 
The Company recognises the importance of maintaining an 
ongoing relationship with its shareholders and stakeholders. 
It intends to use its AGM on 17 July 2008 as an opportunity 
to communicate with shareholders. It is the Company’s policy 
that all Directors are available to answer shareholders’ 
questions at the AGM. In addition, the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, the Finance 
Director and the Senior Independent Director will meet with the 
Company’s principal shareholders on request to discuss relevant 
issues when they arise. The Company seeks to ensure that the 
Directors, particularly the Non-Executive Directors, develop 
an understanding of the views of major shareholders through 
various routes including meetings and analysts’ or brokers’ 
brieﬁ ngs. The Chairman has met with a number of institutional 
shareholders during the year. The Company Secretary’s ofﬁ ce 
responds to numerous letters from shareholders on various 
issues throughout the year. Information sent to shareholders 
and copies of all Company announcements are made available 
on the Company’s website.
The notice of British Energy Group plc’s AGM last year (held 
on 19 July 2007), was dispatched to shareholders not less 
than 20 working days before the meeting and details of proxy 
votes received were made available in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Code.
Directors’ Statement as to Disclosure of Information 
to Auditors
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of 
approving the Directors’ Report are listed on pages 32 and 33. 
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the auditors, 
each of these Directors conﬁ rms that:
to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is • 
no information relevant to the preparation of their Report 
of which the auditors are unaware; and
each Director has taken all the steps a Director might • 
reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant 
audit information and to establish that the auditors are 
aware of that information.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibility
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
The Directors are required to prepare ﬁ nancial statements for 
each ﬁ nancial year which present fairly the ﬁ nancial position 
and performance of the Group and give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company for that year.
In preparing the ﬁ nancial statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them • 
consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and • 
prudent;
state whether applicable accounting standards have been • 
followed; and
prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis • 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors conﬁ rm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
ﬁ nancial position of the Group and the Company. This enables 
them to ensure that the ﬁ nancial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 1985 in respect of the Group and the Company 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation in respect of the Group. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. The information published on the 
website has been prepared under United Kingdom company law 
and may not be in accordance with legal requirements of other 
countries from which the information can be accessed.
Going Concern
The Board considers it appropriate to prepare these consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements and parent company ﬁ nancial statements 
on a going concern basis because, having reviewed the Group’s 
cash ﬂ ow position and outlook, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future as 
a going concern.

Introduction
In preparing this Report, the Remuneration Committee (the Committee) has given due consideration to legal and best practice 
disclosure requirements, and has sought to present the Group’s remuneration policy in an easy to read style.
During the year there have been no material amendments to British Energy’s remuneration policy but there have been some 
practical difﬁ culties in implementing the policy this year.
Terms of Reference and Committee Membership
The Committee is responsible to the Board for determining the fees of the Chairman and the pay, beneﬁ ts and employment 
conditions, including pensions of the Executive Directors and the most senior staff in the Group (those reporting directly to the 
Chief Executive). It also reviews the pay and beneﬁ ts of other senior staff to ensure that fair and robust remuneration policies exist.
During the year the Committee reviewed and subsequently revised its Terms of Reference which were endorsed by the Board. The 
revised Terms of Reference continue to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, June 2006 and can be reviewed 
on our website. Copies may also be obtained from the Company Secretary.
The Committee is made up of the Non-Executive Directors identiﬁ ed on page 39. The other Non-Executive Directors have attended, 
by invitation, some of the meetings during the year. Details of attendance by members of the Committee are set out on page 39. 
The Committee continues to be chaired by Bob Davies. During the year the Committee met nine times.
Advisers to the Committee
Bill Coley continued to attend throughout the year to give advice as required by the Committee. In accordance with good practice 
he was not present when matters affecting his own terms and conditions were being discussed. It is the intention of the 
Committee that he will continue to attend at its invitation.
The Group’s Human Resources Director is Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee has appointed Hewitt New Bridge Street to give advice on general remuneration matters including market 
data comparisons. They have also been involved in giving advice concerning the issues relating to the implementation of the 
Performance Share Plan (see below) and the management of the other equity incentive plans (including the all-employee Share 
Incentive Plan). They have no other connections with the Group other than providing advice on executive pay.
Mercers Human Resources Consulting LLP has provided advice on pensions issues to the Group.
Clifford Chance LLP has provided legal advice to the Committee during the year.
Remuneration Policy
The Group’s remuneration policy aims to attract, retain and incentivise management with the appropriate professional, managerial 
and operational expertise necessary to achieve the Group’s objectives and deliver shareholder value.
The Committee’s aim is that the total package (including beneﬁ ts and incentives) is broadly competitive both in terms of the UK 
market and in terms of the international market for executives with nuclear experience.
The Committee’s policy is that base salaries are positioned broadly around the market median with incentive opportunities that 
reﬂ ect the Group’s overall strategy and the challenges it faces. The Committee believes that overall packages should be aligned 
to shareholder interests to create sustainable long-term shareholder value.
In particular it is the Committee’s policy that:
a signiﬁ cant proportion of the remuneration of the Chief Executive and the senior management team should be variable and • 
linked to the performance of the Group. Under normal circumstances, the variable element would include a share-based 
incentive; however current restrictions do not permit this (see section 3 below); 
the movement in base pay of the Executive Directors and the senior staff should be broadly in line with the increases awarded • 
to other staff recognising the need from time to time to adjust salaries to the external market;
in determining the link between base and variable pay the Group should be mindful of its safety and environmental priorities; • 
and
there should be a strong and clear link between reward and performance against agreed stretch targets both in the short and • 
long-term.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Elements of Remuneration
In determining the remuneration package of each Executive Director the Committee considers ﬁ ve main elements, each of which 
is benchmarked against the external market. The benchmarking process draws comparisons across a wide range of organisations, 
predominately major UK listed public companies, including utility companies. Benchmarking also involves consultation with the 
Committee’s external advisers and commercial providers of remuneration surveys.
1. Base Pay
Base pay and beneﬁ ts are reviewed annually. The Committee aims to maintain individual salaries at or about the market median, 
taking into account experience, level of responsibility and individual performance. The base pay of Executive Directors and senior 
staff was last reviewed as at 1 July 2007. The current annual base salary levels for the Executive Directors are as follows: Bill Coley 
£725,000 and Stephen Billingham £465,000.
2. Annual Bonus Plan
As discussed in last year’s report, on 1 April 2007 a new annual bonus plan was introduced for Executive Directors and other senior 
staff. Under this plan the maximum potential bonus opportunity was set at 150% for each Executive Director. The targets for 
2007/08 covered the key performance indicators of the business including Adjusted EBITDA, cash, unplanned losses, unit operating 
margin, revenue, cost control, plant life extension, project delivery and outage performance. All bonus targets were underpinned 
by safety and environmental conditions. Following an assessment of performance against targets, the Committee awarded 75% of 
salary to both Bill Coley and Stephen Billingham. 
It is the Committee’s intention that broadly the same structure will apply in 2008/09.
3. Share Options and Incentive Schemes
Performance Share Plan
Shareholders approved a new long-term incentive arrangement in the form of a Performance Share Plan at the AGM in 2007. 
The Committee was to adopt a policy that would initially restrict awards to the following levels:
Chief Executive: • 150% of salary.
Executive Director: • 125% of salary.
Other senior team members: • 100% of salary.
Awards were to be subject to a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition measuring the Group’s performance over 
a three year period relative to a comparator group of 23 companies involved in mining, oil extraction and electricity production, 
i.e. energy in its widest sense. It had been the intention of the Committee to make awards under the plan to the Executive Directors 
and those reporting directly to the Chief Executive shortly after approval by shareholders. However, in the light of the wide-ranging 
conﬁ dential strategic discussions that have been continuing for most of the past year, the Group took legal advice regarding the 
implementation of this scheme. It concluded that it would be inappropriate to implement any share-based incentive scheme for 
the senior team members and Executive Directors whilst these strategic discussions were continuing.
In view of this, an alternative cash-based long-term incentive plan, with reward being determined by the Group’s ﬁ nancial 
performance over a three year period, was introduced for senior team members. The Model Code on Directors Dealings in Securities 
(Model Code) rules have not allowed for an alternative incentive arrangement to be put in place for the Executive Directors Bill 
Coley and Stephen Billingham.
Chief Executive’s Previous Incentive Arrangements
As Bill Coley had historically not participated in the former Long-Term Deferred Bonus Plan he was subject to separate 
arrangements which included grants of share options.
Two grants of options have been made to him in December 2005 and November 2006. Both grants of options were subject to a 
performance condition related to nuclear output during the 2007/08 ﬁ nancial year. Subject to the achievement of the performance 
condition these options would vest in December 2008 and November 2009 respectively.
The targets set were:
A minimum nuclear output of • 53.6TWh at which 75% of options would vest.
A maximum nuclear output of • 59TWh at which 100% of options would vest.
Nuclear output for 2007/08 was 50.3TWh and as a result neither grant of options will vest and accordingly they have lapsed.

Share Incentive Plan
The Committee thinks that all British Energy employees should have the opportunity to become shareholders. It has therefore 
approved the use of two all-employee share plans: the Share Incentive Plan and the Sharesave Scheme.
Previously the Executive Directors declined their invitation to participate in the Group’s all-employee Share Incentive Plan (SIP). 
As disclosed last year, the Committee would not expect this to be the case for any award to be made under the SIP for 2007/08. 
The value of this award has been determined as £1,710 for each Executive Director.
Sharesave Scheme
Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the all-employee Sharesave Scheme, which is offered to all employees on the same 
terms in line with HMRC regulations, for which there are no performance conditions.
4. Retirement Beneﬁ ts
Stephen Billingham is a member of the British Energy Generation Group (BEGG) of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, which 
will provide part of his pension entitlement. He is also the recipient of other beneﬁ ts under an Unfunded Unapproved Retirement 
Beneﬁ t Scheme.
Bill Coley is not a member of any Group pension scheme nor was any payment made to him in lieu of any pension arrangement.
The details of Stephen Billingham’s accrued entitlement under the deﬁ ned beneﬁ ts schemes are as follows:
         Increase in
   Increase  Transfer  Transfer Transfer transfer
  Accrued in accrued  value Accrued value of value of value less

The information in the table above has been subject to audit as required by the Companies Act 1985.
The accrued entitlements shown are those which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year. The 
transfer value does not represent a sum due or paid to the individual and cannot meaningfully be added to annual remuneration.
The accrual rate for Stephen Billingham is 1/30 per annum subject to total pension from all sources not exceeding two-thirds of ﬁ nal 
salary. He is required to make contributions of 5% of base salary. This is achieved by sacriﬁ cing salary equivalent to the contribution. 
The salary shown in the Directors’ Emoluments table on page 46 is net of the salary sacriﬁ ce on earnings above the Permitted 
Maximum deﬁ ned in the rules of the scheme.
As indicated last year, Executive Directors and senior staff hired in the future will not be offered membership of BEGG nor any 
Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Beneﬁ t Scheme. Instead new appointments will be offered a supplement to salary to allow 
them to make their own pension arrangements with suitable cover for life insurance and permanent disability. 
5. Other Beneﬁ ts
Other beneﬁ ts are available to Executive Directors. These differ by individual but will comprise some or all of the following:
A company car (or allowance in lieu) and fuel. • 
Medical and additional life insurance. • 
Reimbursement of telephone rental, mobile phone and business call costs. • 
Subscriptions to professional bodies. • 
Eligibility to participate in the all-employee Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan. • 
Accommodation and relocation expenses. • 
Share Ownership Guidelines
Share ownership guidelines have been adopted that encourage Executive Directors and those reporting directly to the 
Chief Executive to build up the following levels of share ownership:
Chief Executive  • 150% of salary
Finance Director  • 100% of salary
Other direct reports • 50% salary

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The expectation is that these levels of ownership will be achieved through the retention of at least half of the after tax number 
of shares acquired through the Group’s share plans and would be met within ﬁ ve years from the introduction of the Performance 
Share Plan in April 2007. However, because of Model Code rules, the Executive Directors are currently unable to participate in the 
Group’s share-based Performance Share Plan
Service Contracts
The Committee’s policy is to set service contract notice periods at one year or less without any express provision in respect of 
termination. If it is ever necessary to offer longer notice or contract period to new Executive Directors who are externally recruited, 
it is the Committee’s position to reduce these as soon as possible after the initial contract has expired.
Stephen Billingham has a 12 month rolling contract and Bill Coley has a six month rolling contract. The same notice period applies 
if the Group or Executive Director serves notice.
The dates of the current service contracts are:
Bill Coley, 13 September 2005 and Stephen Billingham, 13 October 2004.
External Non-Executive Appointment
The Committee permits Executive Directors to accept external non-executive directorships provided they do not cause a conﬂ ict 
or inhibit the Director’s ability to work for the Group. It is recognised that those appointments increase the Director’s commercial 
knowledge and business expertise to the general beneﬁ t of the Group and the wider public interest. Each such appointment, 
including the details of emoluments is subject to Board approval. The Board has determined that any compensation receivable 
in respect of these appointments is paid directly to, and retained by, the Executive Director. 
During the year Bill Coley held Non-Executive Directorships with Peabody Energy Corporation, receiving fees of $143,106, 
CT Communications Inc, receiving fees of $172,438; and Jahna Management receiving fees of $15,000. All fees relate to the year 
ended 31 December 2007.
Stephen Billingham held no external appointments.
Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board without the participation of the Director concerned. 
Appointed for three years the Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, they are not eligible to participate in any 
of the Group’s share schemes and they do not receive any pension provision from the Group.
The expiry dates of the Chairman and the current Non-Executive Director appointments are:
Name         Expiry date
A Montague        30/11/2008
P Colombani        31/05/2009
J Delucca        31/01/2010

R Walmsley        31/07/2009
R Walvis     31/08/2010
The fee structure, which was effective from 1 September 2004, remained in place throughout the year and applied to all 
Non-Executive Directors except Sir Adrian Montague.
The fees shown for the Non-Executive Directors in the Directors’ Emoluments table include £13,000 for each director (with the 
exception of Robert Walvis) which was paid in Shares in the Company.
As a result of dealing restrictions since his appointment Robert Walvis has not received his initial £10,000 in Shares or £7,583 worth 
of Shares as part of his basic fee. 
Instead the amount was settled in cash with the expectation that he will, when circumstances permit, use the net proceeds to 
purchase Shares. These sums are included in the emoluments table on page 46.

The Committee reviewed fees payable to the Chairman during the year. With effect from 1 July 2007 the fees payable to Sir Adrian 
Montague as Chairman were increased to £275,000 per annum. Of this total £50,000 per annum is paid in the form of Shares in the 
Company.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT – 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Other Statutory Information
Non-adjusting Post Balance Sheet Events
Details of post balance sheet events are provided in note 38 to 
the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
Substantial Shareholdings
As at 28 May 2008 the Company had been notiﬁ ed of the 
following interests in 3% or more of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company:
Holder  %
Invesco Limited 14.97
Prudential Plc/M&G Investment Management Ltd 7.09
Franklin Resources, Inc 6.19
Capital Group Companies Inc 5.10
AllianceBernstein LP 4.79
Legal & General Investment Management 4.77
Barclays PLC 4.21
The Company has not been notiﬁ ed of any other interest in the 
issued ordinary share capital of the Company of 3% or more.
Policy on Payment of Suppliers
The Group’s policy is to settle the terms of payment with suppliers 
when agreeing the terms of each transaction, to ensure that 
suppliers are made aware of these terms and abide by the agreed 
terms. The Company had no trade payables at 31 March 2008 
(2007: £nil) and the Group had trade payables of £256m at
31 March 2008 (2007: £200m). During the year, suppliers to the 
Group were paid within an average of 60 days (2007: 57 days). For 
the purpose of this analysis supplier purchases exclude payments 
to BNFL, the Group’s principal supplier, which are generally made 
against an agreed contract proﬁ le.
 
Charitable and Political Contributions
The Group made charitable donations during the year of 
£197,499 (2007: £195,485), which included amounts to both 
registered charities and community groups. No political 
donations were made during the year (2007: £nil).
Employees
The Group is committed to involving employees in the business 
through a policy of communication and consultation. 
Arrangements have been established for the regular provision of 
information to all employees through brieﬁ ngs, staff conferences 
and well established formal consultation procedures.
The Group is committed to its equal opportunities policies, 
which include promoting training and career development for 
all employees. Full and fair consideration for all vacancies and 
opportunities will be given to men and women, people with 
disabilities and those from ethnic minorities, regardless of marital 
status, age, religion or sexual orientation. The policy is supported 
by a Code of Practice on harassment that recognises that all 
employees have the right to be treated with dignity and respect.
The Group operates a Share Incentive Plan, which is an 
all-employee performance related share scheme. More details 
of the Share Incentive Plan, and the Group’s other share 
schemes, are set out in note 33 to the consolidated ﬁ nancial 
statements.
Share Capital and Takeover Directive
Details of British Energy Group plc’s share capital are included 
in note 30.
The Company has two classes of shares, ordinary shares of 10p 
each and one special rights redeemable preference share of £1 
(the Special Share). 
The Special Share is redeemable at par at any time after 
30 September 2006 at the option of the Secretary of State, 
after consulting the Company. This share, which may only 
be held by and transferred to one or more of Her Majesty’s 
Secretaries of State, another Minister of the Crown, the Solicitor 
for the affairs of Her Majesty’s Treasury or any other person 
acting on behalf of the Crown, does not carry any rights to 
vote at general meetings, but entitles the holder to attend and 
speak at such meetings. The Special Share confers no rights to 
participate in the capital or proﬁ ts of the Company beyond its 
nominal value. The consent of the holder of the Special Share is 
required for certain matters including the alteration or removal 
of the provisions in the Company’s Articles of Association relating 
to the Special Share and to the limitations on shareholdings.
In addition, consent of the holder of the Special Share is 
required in relation to, amongst others, certain amendments 
to the Articles of Association of British Energy Bond Finance plc, 
British Energy Limited, British Energy Generation Limited or 
British Energy Generation (UK) Limited, or a disposal by the 
Company of its shares in these companies. However, the holder 
of the Special Share will only be entitled to withhold consent 
to such an amendment or disposal if, in the holder’s opinion, 
the matter in question would be contrary to the interests of 
national security. 
Where any person other than the Permitted Person as deﬁ ned 
in the Articles of Association has an interest of 15% or more in 
the Company’s Shares the Special Shareholder may require that 
person to dispose of all or part of the relevant shareholding if 
it believes that the ownership or control of the shares by that 
person would be contrary to the interests of national security.
As part of the arrangements made at the time of Restructuring, 
British Energy Group plc has an obligation to make annual Cash 
Sweep Payments to the NLF should certain criteria be met. 
The NLF has the right to convert some or all of its entitlement 
to receive Cash Sweep Payments into convertible shares and to 
hold or sell those shares. The Cash Sweep Payment percentage 
was 35.1% as at 31 March 2008. Had the NLF converted the 
remainder of the Cash Sweep Payment percentage at this date, 
the NLF would have held up to 35.1% of the enlarged equity 
share capital of British Energy Group plc. 
The Company knows of no agreements between holders 
of securities which would result in restrictions on transfer 
of securities or on voting rights.

The Group has investments in its own shares, held in relation 
to the Group’s share incentive schemes, through shareholdings 
held by British Energy Employee Share Trust and Abbey National 
AESOP Trust. At 31 March 2008 1,913,946 Shares were held in 
trust. The maximum number of own shares held during the 
year was 1,946,438. Any voting or other similar decisions relating 
to those shares would be taken by the trustees, who may take 
account of any recommendation of the Company. 
The rules governing the appointment and replacement of 
Board members and changes to the Articles of Association 
accord with normal Scottish company law provisions. The 
Board has power to purchase its own shares and is seeking 
renewal of that power at the forthcoming AGM within 
the limits set out in the notice of that meeting. 
Rights of termination upon a change of control exist in an 
IT support contract and in the documentation governing two 
of BEPET’s trading arrangements. Such right of termination 
is removed however in the case of BEPET if it chooses to 
collateralise its exposure prior to such change of control by 
way of cash (or in one of the arrangements, by way of a letter 
of credit, bank guarantee or similar instrument). Furthermore, 
the parent company guarantee agreements relating to certain 
contracts with BNFL for the supply of AGR fuel and spent fuel 
management services require to be transferred to any new 
ultimate parent company at the request of BNFL in the event 
of a change of control. The Company also has the beneﬁ t of 
certain bilateral letter of credit facilities which can be used 
to support calls for collateral in lieu of cash. These agreements 
contain provisions which give the lender a right to terminate 
the respective facility upon a change of control. Although 
a change of control is not an event of default under the 
Group’s Bonds, holders are entitled individually to require 
the redemption of their bonds at a make whole amount as a 
result of a change of control. There are no provisions in place to 
compensate directors or senior employees on change of control.
Auditors
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have indicated their 
willingness to continue in ofﬁ ce and a resolution that they be 
re-appointed will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting. 
Authority is delegated to the Audit Committee to approve the 
fees of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at the Murrayﬁ eld 
Stadium Conference Centre on 17 July 2008 at 11 am. A letter 
from the Chairman detailing the business to be considered at 
the meeting, together with a Notice of Meeting, accompanies 
this Annual Report.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the 
Members of the British Energy Group plc
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We have audited the Group ﬁ nancial statements of British 
Energy Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2008 which 
comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated 
statement of recognised income and expense, the consolidated 
balance sheet, the consolidated statement of cash ﬂ ows and 
the related notes. These Group ﬁ nancial statements have been 
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁ nancial 
statements of British Energy Group plc for the year ended 
31 March 2008 and on the information in the Remuneration 
Committee Report that is described as having been audited.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁ nancial statements 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This 
report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come 
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group 
ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulations. 
We also report to you whether, in our opinion, the information 
given in the Directors’ Report (comprising the Directors’ Report 
– Business Review, the Directors’ Report – Financial Review, 
the Directors’ Report – Corporate Social Responsibility, the 
Directors’ Report – Corporate Governance, the Directors’ Report 
– Board of Directors and the Directors’ Report – Other Statutory 
Information) is consistent with the Group ﬁ nancial statements. 
In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for 
our audit, or if information speciﬁ ed by law regarding Directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement 
reﬂ ects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions 
of the Combined Code (2006) speciﬁ ed for our review by the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if 
it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s 
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or 
form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate 
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group 
ﬁ nancial statements. The other information comprises only 
the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the Remuneration 
Committee Report and the Chairman’s Statement. We consider 
the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend 
to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements. It also includes an assessment 
of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgements made by the 
Directors in the preparation of the Group ﬁ nancial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all 
the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to 
give reasonable assurance that the Group ﬁ nancial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the Group ﬁ nancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, • 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, 
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2008 and 
of its proﬁ t and cash ﬂ ows for the year then ended;
the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared • 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent • 
with the Group ﬁ nancial statements.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Presentation of the Financial Statements
(i) Description of Business
British Energy Group plc is engaged in the generation and sale of electricity. References to the Company are to British Energy Group 
plc, the ultimate holding company of the Group. References to the Group are to the Company and its subsidiaries. The Group 
operates eight nuclear power stations and one coal-ﬁ red power station in the United Kingdom. British Energy Group plc is a public 
limited company, incorporated and domiciled in Great Britain. British Energy Group plc’s ordinary shares are traded on the London 
Stock Exchange.
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 28 May 2008.
(ii) Compliance with Applicable Law and IFRS
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union (EU), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and 
the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
(iii) Financial Period
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements cover the ﬁ nancial year from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008, with comparative ﬁ gures for the 
ﬁ nancial year from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007.
(iv) Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements consolidate the ﬁ nancial statements of British Energy Group plc and the entities it controls 
(its subsidiaries) drawn up to 31 March each year. The ﬁ nancial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year 
as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised 
proﬁ ts arising from intragroup transactions, have been eliminated in full.
A list of subsidiary undertakings which, in the opinion of the Directors, principally affected the amount of proﬁ t or the net assets 
of the Group is given in note 32 to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
 
(v) Composition of the Consolidated Financial Statements
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements consolidate the ﬁ nancial statements of British Energy Group plc and all of its subsidiary 
undertakings, and comprise the following:
consolidated income statement; • 
consolidated statement of recognised income and expense; • 
consolidated balance sheet; • 
consolidated statement of cash ﬂ ows; and • 
notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. • 
(vi) Accounting Convention
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, modiﬁ ed for certain items carried 
at fair value, as stated in the accounting policies.
(vii) New Accounting Policy
During the year the NLF converted part of its entitlement to receive Cash Sweep Payments (see note 30). In order to reﬂ ect this, the 
accounting policy 2 (xiii) was adopted which resulted in the recognition of a conversion asset of £2,340m, additional equity share 
capital of £45m and additional share premium of £2,295m representing the excess of the conversion share price of £5.20 over the 
nominal value of shares issued.
The application of this new accounting policy resulted in shareholders’ funds at 31 March 2008 being increased by £2,173m and the 
proﬁ t for the year ended 31 March 2008 being reduced by £167m (see note 15).
(viii) Change in Accounting Estimate
On 11 December 2007, British Energy Group plc extended the useful accounting lives of two of the Group’s nuclear power stations 
by ﬁ ve years. The change in accounting estimate has been accounted for prospectively and the effect from 11 December 2007 to 
31 March 2008 was to decrease nuclear liability revalorisation by £125m, reduce NLF receivable revalorisation by £125m, reduce the 
conversion asset amortisation by £13m and reduce property, plant and equipment depreciation by £6m.
As a result of these accounting life extensions for the year ending 31 March 2009, the Group expects that:
nuclear liability revalorisation will decrease by £ • 7m and NLF receivable revalorisation will decrease by £7m therefore having 
no income statement impact;
conversion asset amortisation will reduce by £ • 41m; and
property, plant and equipment depreciation will reduce by £ • 27m.

1. Presentation of the Financial Statements (continued)
(ix) Parent Company Financial Statements
British Energy Group plc, the Company, has not adopted IFRS and has therefore drawn up separate ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles (UK GAAP). These are presented in the Annual Report 
on pages 97 to 102.
2. Accounting Policies
(i) Signiﬁ cant Estimates and Judgements Used in Applying Accounting Policies
The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain critical accounting 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the ﬁ nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements are as set out below. The 
application of a number of these policies required the Group to use a variety of estimation techniques and apply judgement to best 
reﬂ ect the substance of underlying transactions.
Signiﬁ cant factors considered when using estimates to assess the carrying value of assets include future electricity prices, expected 
annual output, expected station operating costs, remaining station lives and discount rates. The Group has determined that a 
number of its accounting policies can be considered signiﬁ cant, in terms of the management judgement that has been required to 
determine the various assumptions underpinning their application in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements presented which, under 
different conditions, could lead to material differences in these statements. The policies where signiﬁ cant judgements have been 
made are the:
application of business combination accounting rules; • 
accounting for conversion asset; • 
accounting for property, plant and equipment; • 
accounting for goodwill; • 
accounting for coal inventory; • 
estimation of liabilities for spent nuclear fuel and decommissioning costs; • 
estimation of retirement beneﬁ t obligations; • 
estimation of fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and commodity contracts; and • 
accounting for deferred tax. • 
Actual results can differ from estimates.
(ii) Revenue 
Revenue is recognised by the Group when a sales arrangement exists, delivery of goods or services has occurred, the amount 
of revenue and costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and it is probable that the 
economic beneﬁ ts will ﬂ ow to the Group. 
Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration receivable for sales of electricity supplied during the period and sales of 
other related goods and services. It is shown net of value added tax, electricity purchases relating to short-term balancing and 
hedging activities, and climate change levy. Revenue is also shown after elimination of sales within the Group.
Wholesale generation and direct supply sales are recognised on an accruals basis with reference to meter readings of electricity 
supplied. Where required, a management estimate is included of the value of units supplied to customers between the date of their 
last meter reading and the accounting period end. Where an estimate of electricity supplied is required, the estimate is calculated 
using historical consumption patterns and is included in trade receivables.
Revenue includes miscellaneous income that comprises mainly services to Magnox in respect of shared sites and the income 
generated from the Group’s role in trading the electrical output of the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency’s Magnox nuclear power 
stations. 
(iii) Fuel Costs – Nuclear Front End
Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGR)
Front end fuel costs consist of the costs of procurement of uranium, conversion and enrichment services and fuel element 
fabrication. Fabrication costs comprise ﬁ xed and variable elements. All costs are capitalised into inventory and charged to the 
consolidated income statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR)
All front end fuel costs are variable and are capitalised into inventory and subsequently charged to the consolidated income 
statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Accounting Policies (continued)
(iv) Fuel Costs – Nuclear Back End
AGR
Spent fuel extracted from the reactors is sent for reprocessing and/or long-term storage and eventual disposal of resulting waste 
products. Back end fuel costs comprise:
(a) a cost per tonne of uranium in AGR fuel, in respect of amounts payable on loading of fuel into any one of the AGR reactors; and
(b) a rebate/surcharge against the cost mentioned in (a) above that is dependent on the out-turn market electricity price in the 
year and the amount of electricity generated in the year.
The loading related cost and the rebate/surcharge is capitalised into inventory and charged to the consolidated income statement 
in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
PWR
Back end fuel costs are based on wet storage in station ponds followed by dry storage and subsequent direct disposal of fuel. Back 
end fuel costs comprise the estimated cost of this process at current prices discounted back to current value. Back end fuel costs are 
capitalised into inventory on loading and charged to the consolidated income statement in proportion to the amount of fuel burnt.
(v) Unburnt Fuel at Shutdown
Due to the nature of the nuclear fuel process there will be some unburnt fuel in the reactors at station closure. The costs of this 
unburnt fuel (ﬁ nal core) are fully provided at the balance sheet date and any changes in the carrying value of nuclear fuel attributed 
to the ﬁ nal core are charged to the consolidated income statement in the accounting period.
(vi) Fuel Costs – Eggborough
Fuel costs for Eggborough are determined on a weighted average cost basis. Fuel costs for Eggborough also include costs of carbon 
allowances (see note 2 (xv)).
(vii) Research Expenditure
Expenditure on scientiﬁ c and engineering research, preliminary studies and the initiation of new technologies is categorised as 
research and charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred. 
(viii) Operating Leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and beneﬁ ts of ownership of the asset are classiﬁ ed as operating leases 
and rentals payable are charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
(ix) Foreign Currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the balance sheet. 
All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement.
(x) Share-based Payment 
The Group has ﬁ ve share compensation schemes, the Share Incentive Plan, the Deferred Incentive Plan, the Long-Term Deferred 
Bonus Plan, the Executive Share Option Plan 2004 and the Interim Bonus Plan. The Group accounts for its share compensation 
schemes in accordance with IFRS 2 – Share-based Payment (IFRS 2).
The fair value of the share compensation schemes is charged to the consolidated income statement over the period from the date 
the awards were granted to the date at which the compensation is expected to vest on the employees. The corresponding credit is 
included in total shareholders’ equity. The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees under the terms 
of the Group’s various employee share compensation schemes. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at 
the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line 
basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest. 
(xi) Exceptional Items
Exceptional items, by their nature, are not indicative of the underlying operating performance of the Group. Exceptional items are 
material to the results for the year and are of a non-recurring nature and are therefore presented separately.

2. Accounting Policies (continued)
(xii) Taxation 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in full, using the balance sheet liability method, on temporary differences identiﬁ ed at the balance 
sheet date using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Temporary 
differences are differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁ ts. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that 
it is considered probable that taxable proﬁ t will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged to the consolidated income statement except where it relates to items charged or credited to equity in 
which case the deferred tax is dealt with in equity.
(xiii) Conversion Asset
The conversion asset represents the asset which arose following partial exercise of the NLF’s conversion right (see note 2 (xviii)). 
The partial NLF conversion has been accounted for under IFRS 2. The issue of new shares by British Energy Group plc gave rise to the 
recording of ordinary share capital, together with a share premium representing the excess of the conversion share price over the 
nominal value of shares issued. The partial conversion also gave rise to a conversion asset which represents the fair value of the 
obligation which is removed as a result of the partial exercise of the conversion right. The conversion asset is allocated between 
current and non-current assets as appropriate on the consolidated balance sheet. 
The fair value of the conversion asset recorded as a result of the partial exercise of the conversion right has been deemed to be the 
fair value of the new equity issued at the conversion date. Following initial recognition, the conversion asset is measured at cost 
less amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The charge for amortisation is calculated so as to write the conversion asset off on a straight line basis over the estimated useful 
accounting lives of the nuclear power stations. 
(xiv) Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment comprises assets acquired or constructed by the Group. Property, plant and equipment (other than 
assets in the course of construction) are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation. The fair 
value of property, plant and equipment acquired as a result of the Restructuring was deemed to be the cost amount recognised at 
that date. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Accumulated depreciation includes 
additional charges made where necessary to reﬂ ect impairment in value.
Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost and not depreciated until commissioned.
The charge for depreciation of property, plant and equipment is based on the straight line method so as to write off the costs of 
assets, after taking into account provisions for diminution in value, over their estimated useful lives. The asset lives adopted are 
reviewed annually and for the year ended 31 March 2008 were:
AGR power stations     6 – 15 years
PWR power station     27 years
Eggborough power station     8 years
Other buildings     30 years
Other plant and equipment     18 months – 5 years
Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately, or to 
improve its operational performance is included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate 
when it is probable that future economic beneﬁ ts in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing 
asset will ﬂ ow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Expenditure to improve safety or in order to meet 
increased regulatory standards is also capitalised. Expenditure on major inspection and overhauls of production plant is capitalised, 
within other plant and equipment, when it meets the asset recognition criteria and is depreciated over the period until the next 
Outage. For AGR power stations, this depreciation period is two to three years, for the PWR power station it is 18 months and for 
Eggborough it is four years.
Major spare parts are classiﬁ ed as property, plant and equipment and assigned to individual stations when they are expected to 
be utilised over more than one period. They are depreciated using the applicable station lifetime estimate.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are included in operating proﬁ t.

(xv) Intangible Assets (excluding Goodwill)
The costs of acquired computer software are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring the speciﬁ c 
software in to use, and are amortised using the straight line method over their estimated operational lives for a maximum of ﬁ ve 
years. Costs directly associated with the development of computer software programmes that are expected to generate economic 
beneﬁ ts over a period in excess of one year are also capitalised and amortised over their estimated operational lives.
Purchased Renewable Obligation Certiﬁ cates (ROCs) and Levy Exemption Certiﬁ cates (LECs) are initially recognised at cost within 
intangible assets. A liability for ROCs is recognised based on the level of electricity supplied to customers, and is calculated in 
accordance with percentages set by the UK Government and the renewable obligation certiﬁ cate buyout price for that period. 
ROCs and LECs have sustainable values and can be used over an unrestricted period and therefore they are not amortised.
Under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), granted carbon allowances received in a period are initially recognised at nil 
value within intangible assets. Purchased carbon allowances are initially recognised at cost within intangible assets. Allowances 
granted are apportioned over the year in line with actual and forecast emissions for the relevant emissions year. A liability is 
recognised when actual emissions are greater than the granted allowances apportioned for the year. The liability is measured 
at the cost of purchased allowances up to the level of purchased allowances held, and then at the market price of allowances 
ruling at the balance sheet date, with movements in the liability recognised in operating proﬁ t. Forward contracts for the purchase 
or sale of carbon allowances are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in the 
consolidated income statement in the unrealised net gains or losses on derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and commodity contracts 
line. On delivery of forward contracts, carbon allowances are capitalised in intangible assets at cost, with any permanent reduction 
to bring the carrying value in line with market prices being presented within fuel costs. Carbon allowances have a sustainable value 
and can be used in settlement of the Group’s EU ETS obligation at any time within the corresponding EU ETS Phase. As a result, 
carbon allowances are not amortised.
(xvi) Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets (excluding Goodwill)
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews its tangible assets and intangible assets (excluding goodwill (see note 2 (xvii))) to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets may have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is assessed. If an asset is impaired, a provision is made to reduce the asset’s carrying amount 
to the estimated recoverable amount. 
(xvii) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration at acquisition compared to the fair 
value of the identiﬁ able net assets acquired. Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset on the consolidated balance sheet. 
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill balances are assessed 
for impairment at least annually and at other balance sheet dates if there is any indication of impairment.
(xviii) NLF Funding Arrangements
Under the arrangements with the Secretary of State the NLF will fund, subject to certain exceptions, the Group’s qualifying 
uncontracted nuclear liabilities and qualifying decommissioning costs. To the extent there is any surplus remaining in the NLF 
after all obligations have been discharged, this amount will be paid to the Secretary of State. The Group is responsible for funding 
certain excluded or disqualiﬁ ed liabilities and will, in certain circumstances, be required to compensate or indemnify the NLF and 
the Secretary of State in relation to such liabilities. The Group’s obligations under these arrangements with the Secretary of State 
are guaranteed by certain companies within the Group.
In consideration for the assumption of these liabilities by the Secretary of State and the NLF, British Energy Bond Finance plc 
(formerly British Energy Holdings plc) (a subsidiary of British Energy Group plc) issued £275m in Bonds to the NLF at RED. The Group 
will also make the following payments to the NLF: (i) an annual contribution (Cash Sweep Payment) initially equal to 65%, reduced 
to 36% following the partial conversion, of the Group’s adjusted net cash ﬂ ow, adjusted for certain corporate actions but never 
to exceed 65% (Cash Sweep percentage); (ii) ﬁ xed decommissioning contributions equal to £20m per annum (indexed to RPI but 
tapering off as the nuclear power stations were scheduled to close at RED); and (iii) £150,000 (indexed to RPI) for every tonne of 
uranium in PWR fuel loaded into the Sizewell B reactor after RED.
The NLF has the right from time to time to convert all or part of the Cash Sweep Payment into convertible shares of British Energy 
Group plc (the NLF conversion right). On a full conversion of its remaining interest, the NLF would hold up to approximately 35% of 
the thereby enlarged equity share capital of British Energy Group plc. However, the terms of the convertible shares include a limit 
on the voting rights of such shares equal to a maximum of 29.9% whilst held by the NLF. See note 30 for more details on the 
convertible shares.
The annual Cash Sweep Payment accrual can only be determined after the end of the ﬁ nancial year and is contingent based on 
cash generation in the year. Therefore, it is only recognised and provided for when it becomes determinable and not in any interim 
ﬁ nancial periods. It will be recorded as an operating cost of the applicable ﬁ nancial year. The annual Cash Sweep Payment accrual 
becomes payable 25 business days after publication of the Annual Report and Accounts.

2. Accounting Policies (continued)
The ﬁ xed decommissioning obligations of £20m per annum have been recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet at 
their discounted value and disclosed as the NLF liability. The NLF liability is reduced as payments are made to the NLF. Each year the 
ﬁ nancing charges in the consolidated income statement include the revalorisation of NLF liabilities required to discharge one year’s 
discount from the liability.
PWR fuel loaded after RED will increase the qualifying nuclear liability recognised for back end PWR fuel costs as set out above and 
will increase the NLF receivable by a corresponding amount. The difference between the payment of £150,000 (indexed to RPI) per 
tonne made to the NLF on the loading of PWR fuel and the increase in the liability recognised upon loading of this fuel is matched 
against back end fuel costs as the loaded tonnes are burned in the PWR reactor.
(xix) NLF and Nuclear Liabilities Receivables
The Government indemnity is provided to indemnify any future shortfall on NLF funding of qualifying uncontracted nuclear 
liabilities (including PWR back end fuel services) and qualifying nuclear decommissioning costs.
The NLF receivable asset recognised represents the aggregate value of the Nuclear Liabilities Fund and the Government indemnity 
such that the receivable equals the present value of the associated qualifying nuclear liabilities.
The Government indemnity is also provided to cover the cost of services for spent AGR fuel loaded pre-Restructuring. The nuclear 
liabilities receivable is recognised in respect of the indemnity such that the receivable equals the present value of the associated 
qualifying nuclear liabilities.
The NLF receivable and the nuclear liabilities receivable are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at current price levels, 
discounted at a long-term real rate of interest of 3% per annum to take account of the timing of payments. Each year the ﬁ nancing 
charges in the consolidated income statement include the revalorisation of these receivables required to match the revalorisation 
of the nuclear liabilities.
(xx) Nuclear Liabilities
Nuclear liabilities represent provision for the Group’s liabilities in respect of the costs of waste management of spent fuel and 
nuclear decommissioning. The provisions represent the Directors’ best estimates of the costs expected to be incurred. They are 
calculated based on the latest technical evaluation of the processes and methods likely to be used, and reﬂ ect current engineering 
knowledge. The provisions are based on such commercial agreements as are currently in place, and reﬂ ect the Directors’ 
understanding of the current Government policy and regulatory framework. Given that Government policy and the regulatory 
framework on which the Group’s assumptions have been based may be expected to develop and that the Directors’ plans will be 
inﬂ uenced by improvements in technology and experience gained from decommissioning activities, liabilities and the resulting 
provisions are likely to be adjusted.
In recognising the costs of generating electricity, accruals are made in respect of the following:
(a) Back End Fuel Costs
The treatment of back end fuel costs in the consolidated income statement has been dealt with under the accounting policies 
for fuel costs above. These nuclear liabilities cover the reprocessing and storage of spent nuclear fuel and the long-term storage, 
treatment and eventual disposal of nuclear waste. They are based, as appropriate, on contractual arrangements or the latest 
technical assessments of the processes and methods likely to be used to deal with these obligations under the current regulatory 
regime. Accruals are included within nuclear liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, which are based on contractual 
arrangements and long-term cost forecasts, and which are reviewed regularly and adjusted where necessary.
(b) Decommissioning of Nuclear Power Stations
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements include provision for the full cost of decommissioning the Group’s nuclear power stations. 
Provision is made on the basis of the latest technical assessments of the processes and methods likely to be used for 
decommissioning under the current regulatory regime.
The liabilities for back end fuel costs and decommissioning are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at current price levels, 
discounted at a long-term real rate of interest of 3% per annum to take account of the timing of payments. Each year the ﬁ nancing 
charges in the consolidated income statement include the revalorisation of liabilities required to discharge one year’s discount from 
provisions made in prior years and restate these provisions to current price levels.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Accounting Policies (continued)
(xxi) Financial Instruments 
Recognition, Classiﬁ cation and Subsequent Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities
IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39) requires that all ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities be initially 
recognised at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value reported through the consolidated income 
statement, or the hedge reserve to the extent that effective cash ﬂ ow hedges exist. Exceptions apply to assets classiﬁ ed as loans 
and receivables and held-to-maturity investments, which are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, and 
also to equity investments in instruments whose fair value can not be reliably measured, which are recognised and measured at 
cost. Financial liabilities are measured at fair value or at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group measures 
all debt instruments initially at fair value, and this is taken to be the fair value of the consideration received.
Where ﬁ nancial assets or ﬁ nancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, transaction costs (any such costs incremental to and 
directly attributable to the issue of the ﬁ nancial instruments) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, 
in effect, amortised through the consolidated income statement over the life of the instrument. Where ﬁ nancial assets or ﬁ nancial 
liabilities are measured at fair value, transaction costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
If there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of an invoice, 
an impairment loss on the respective trade receivable will be recognised. In such an instance, the carrying value of the receivable is 
reduced, with the amount of the loss recognised in the consolidated income statement. Impaired trade receivables are 
derecognised when they are assessed as irrecoverable.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to the cash ﬂ ow from the asset expires. Financial liabilities are 
derecognised when the obligation speciﬁ ed in the contract is extinguished or expires.
Accounting for Derivatives and Commodity Contracts
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to risks associated with electricity generation, the purchase of fuel for use in the 
generation process, the purchase of carbon allowances and the supply of electricity to end customers in both the wholesale and 
retail markets. The Group follows a trading strategy of selling forward a proportion of the Group’s output to reduce the Group’s 
exposure to potential falls in the market price of electricity. The use of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments occurs primarily within the 
Group’s electricity trading and coal and carbon allowance procurement activities.
The Board has endorsed the use of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments as hedging tools and the Group uses derivative and
non-derivative ﬁ nancial instruments to manage its exposures.
Physical and ﬁ nancially settled instruments are held by the Group to match offsetting physical positions and are not held for 
proprietary trading purposes.
Where commodity contracts, such as electricity and fuel, are entered into in accordance with the Group’s own purchase, sale or 
usage requirements (own use) they are excluded from the scope of IAS 39 and are accounted for on an accruals basis. Amounts 
payable or receivable in respect of these contracts are recorded within trade payables and trade receivables respectively.
Where a commodity contract is not entered in to or does not continue to be held to meet the Group’s own purchase, sale or usage 
requirements it is treated as a derivative ﬁ nancial instrument, and the recognition and measurement requirements of IAS 39 are 
applied. Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are presented in the derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and commodity contracts line of the 
consolidated balance sheet.
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments that are held for trading, as deﬁ ned by IAS 39, are initially recognised at fair value and all changes 
in fair value are subsequently accounted for through the unrealised net gains or losses on derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and 
commodity contracts line of the consolidated income statement. Held for trading assets and liabilities are classiﬁ ed as current 
in the consolidated balance sheet.
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments that are designated and are effective as hedges of future cash ﬂ ows are initially recognised at fair 
value and changes in the fair value are recognised directly in equity, in the cash ﬂ ow hedge reserve. The ineffective portion of the 
hedge is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Hedging instruments are classiﬁ ed as current or non-
current with reference to the period of delivery.
 
The Group designates derivatives as cash ﬂ ow hedging instruments when it is expected that there will be a high inverse correlation 
between the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument and the changes in the fair value of the cash ﬂ ows of the hedged item. 
This is measured primarily using the dollar offset method. Such correlation is required to be within the limits of 80% to 125% for 
hedge accounting to be permitted. Prospective and retrospective testing is carried out on a regular basis, at least on each reporting 
date, to establish whether the assumptions and application criteria for hedge accounting are supported. The Group discontinues 
hedge accounting where the hedging relationship correlation is outside the required parameters.

2. Accounting Policies (continued)
Derivative instruments are de-designated from a hedge relationship when:
the hedging instrument or item expires or is settled; • 
the forecast transaction is no longer considered to be highly probable; and • 
the hedging instrument no longer qualiﬁ es for hedge accounting under IAS • 39 rules.
Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity, in the cash ﬂ ow hedge reserve, 
until the forecast transaction is settled. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss 
recognised within equity is transferred to the consolidated income statement of the period.
Valuation of Commodity Contracts and Derivatives
The Group’s valuation policy for derivative and other ﬁ nancial instruments is to maximise the use of quoted prices from active 
trading markets. All contracts that fall within the scope of IAS 39 are valued using observable market prices. Certain long-term 
structured transactions have been classiﬁ ed as own use and therefore fall outside the scope of IAS 39. The Group considers that the 
UK electricity market is active for up to two years ahead, with reliable broker quotes and published prices available for this period.
Purchase contracts are valued against the quoted bid price and sales contracts are valued against the quoted offer prices, with 
no provisions made for liquidity. Valuation adjustments are made for the time value of money, which is applied to all contracts, 
and credit risk, which will be applied where applicable.
Principal values are undiscounted and are derived from the aggregate volumes and relevant contract prices of those sale and 
purchase contracts that are within the scope of IAS 39. The principal values provide an indication of the scope of the use of 
derivatives but do not reﬂ ect the risk the Group is exposed to from entering into derivatives.
Embedded Derivatives
The Group also evaluates contracts for embedded derivatives, and considers whether any embedded derivatives have to be 
separated from the underlying host contract and accounted for separately in accordance with IAS 39 requirements. Where 
embedded derivatives have terms that are not closely related to the terms of the host contract in which they are included, they 
are accounted for separately from the host contract as derivatives, with changes in the fair value recorded in the consolidated 
income statement on the unrealised net gains or losses on derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and commodity contracts line, to 
the extent that the hybrid instrument is not already accounted for at fair value.
If the fair value can not be determined reliably based on the terms and conditions of the embedded derivatives, the fair value of the 
embedded derivatives is calculated as the difference between the value of the hybrid instrument and the host contract (excluding 
the derivative element).
Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Liabilities
The Group offsets a ﬁ nancial asset and a ﬁ nancial liability and reports the net amount only when the Group has a legally 
enforceable right to set off the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.
Impact on Effective Tax Rate
Income tax for interim reporting periods is calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate to the interim result 
excluding IAS 39 adjustments, and by calculating tax at the standard rate for the IAS 39 adjustments arising within the period.
(xxii) Inventory – Stores
Inventory held in stores is recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Stores inventory is accounted for using the 
weighted average cost method.
(xxiii) Restricted Cash and Other Financial Assets and Cash and Cash Equivalents
Restricted cash primarily consists of cash pledged as collateral. Other ﬁ nancial assets principally comprise net cash provided to 
satisfy variation margin calls in relation to trading through exchanges.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand with banks and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less from 
the date of acquisition.
(xxiv) Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that 
an outﬂ ow of economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash ﬂ ows are 
discounted using a pre-tax rate that reﬂ ects, where appropriate, the risks speciﬁ c to the liability.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Accounting Policies (continued)
(xxv) Employee Beneﬁ ts – Post Retirement Beneﬁ t Obligations
The Group provides for pension costs in accordance with IAS 19 (2004) – Employee Beneﬁ ts (IAS 19). Contributions to the Group’s 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes are assessed by qualiﬁ ed actuaries. The Group operates two separate pension arrangements in 
the UK within the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, which is a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme. Pension scheme assets are measured using 
market values, which for securities is based on bid price values. Pension costs are assessed using the projected unit method so that 
the cost of providing pensions is charged to the consolidated income statement in a manner which spreads the service cost over 
the expected service lives of employees. The retirement beneﬁ t obligation is measured as the present value of the estimated future 
cash outﬂ ows, discounted using the yields on high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity. The expected return on the 
plan assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligations arising from the passage 
of time are included in other ﬁ nance expenses. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately within the consolidated 
statement of recognised income and expense.
The capital cost of ex-gratia and supplementary pensions is charged to the consolidated income statement, to the extent that 
the arrangements can not be covered by any surplus in schemes, in the accounting period in which they are granted.
Certain additional unfunded retirement beneﬁ ts are provided to eligible employees. The cost and actuarial gains and losses of 
providing such beneﬁ ts is charged to the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of recognised income and 
expense respectively.
(xxvi) New Accounting Standards
The following accounting standards have been adopted by the Group this year:
IFRS • 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7)
IAS • 1 – Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (IAS 1)
The impact of the adoption of these standards has been to expand the disclosures provided in relation to ﬁ nancial instruments and 
the management of capital. 
The following accounting interpretations have been adopted by the Group this year:
IFRIC • 7 – Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinﬂ ationary Economies (IFRIC 7) 
IFRIC • 8 – Scope of IFRS 2 (IFRIC 8)
IFRIC • 9 – Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives (IFRIC 9)
IFRIC • 10 – Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment (IFRIC 10)
The application of these interpretations has had no impact on the Group’s accounting policies.
The following accounting standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these ﬁ nancial statements have been 
issued but are not yet effective:
IFRS • 8 – Operating Segments (IFRS 8)
IAS • 23 (R) – IAS 23 (Revised) – Borrowing Costs (IAS 23 (R)) 
IFRIC • 11 – IFRS 2: Group and Treasury Share Transactions (IFRIC 11)
IFRIC • 12 – Service Concession Arrangements (IFRIC 12)
IFRIC • 13 – Customer Loyalty Programmes (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008) (IFRIC 13)
IFRIC • 14 – IAS 19 - The Limit on a Deﬁ ned Beneﬁ t Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction (IFRIC 14)
The adoption of these standards and interpretations is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s ﬁ nancial statements.
3. Segmental Information
The Group’s activities are in one business segment being the generation and sale of electricity and are in one geographic segment 
being the United Kingdom. There are no other signiﬁ cant classes of business or geographic areas.

7. Key Management Compensation
The remuneration of key management personnel during the year was as follows:
        Year ended Year ended
        31 March 31 March
        2008 2007
        £000 £000
Salaries and other short-term employee benefits    5,941 3,403

Post employment benefits    214 182
Share-based payments    13 91
Total of key management compensation    6,168 5,165
Key management personnel comprises Executive and Non-Executive members of the Board of Directors together with those 
members of senior management who report directly to the Chief Executive. On 17 November 2006 a senior management 
reorganisation took place which increased the number of individuals deﬁ ned as key management. As a result of this change, 
the 2007 deﬁ nition of key management was amended and the table above only includes their emoluments since this date.
Emoluments of key management personnel are borne by the following subsidiary companies: British Energy Limited, British Energy 
Power and Energy Trading Limited and British Energy Generation Limited. The amounts received by the Non-Executive Directors in 
respect of their services as Non-Executive Directors were £803,000 (2007: £758,000).
Full details of the remuneration and share interests of the Board of Directors for the year ended 31 March 2008 and 2007 are set out 
in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 42 to 48.
8. Cash Sweep Payment Credit
As part of the Contribution Agreement made at the time of Restructuring, the Group has an obligation to make annual Cash Sweep 
Payments to the Nuclear Liabilities Fund should certain criteria be met. Under the terms of the original Contribution Agreement, 
on a conversion by the NLF of part or all of its Cash Sweep Payment right, the NLF was entitled to both a Cash Sweep Payment on 
the part converted for the period up to conversion and any dividend in respect of the same period on the shares arising from the 
conversion. The Group obtained agreement from the NLF and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (now the Secretary of 
State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform) to an amendment to the Cash Sweep Payment right and Cash Sweep Payment 
percentage adjustment formula in relation to the partial conversion, which took place in the year, so as to ensure the principle of 
economic parity was maintained and to avoid an unintended dilution of British Energy Group plc’s equity shareholders’ interests. 
As a result, the £305m accrued in the 2007 Annual Report and Accounts for the Cash Sweep Payment due for the year ended 
31 March 2007 was reduced by £134m to £171m to reﬂ ect the NLF’s agreement to waive the proportion of the 2007 obligation 
due that was extinguished by the partial conversion in June 2007. The £134m reduction has been recognised as a credit in the 
consolidated income statement for this year; the remaining £171m obligation was paid in July 2007.
9. Cash Sweep Payment Accrual
Under the terms of the Restructuring, the Group has an obligation to make payments to the NLF should certain criteria be met. 
The basis of the Cash Sweep Payment accrual, which remains subject to review by the NLF, is as follows:

9. Cash Sweep Payment Accrual (continued)
An accrual for the Cash Sweep Payment of £102m (2007: £305m) is included in trade and other payables within current liabilities 
(see note 24). In July 2007 a reduced Cash Sweep Payment of £171m for the year ended 31 March 2007 was paid (see note 8).
Target Amount and Cash Required to be Retained to Meet Target Amount
The Target Amount is £490m plus the Incremental Collateral Amount, which is the amount by which cash applied to providing 
collateral for the generation, sale and purchase by the Group of electricity (i.e. for Agreed Collateral Purposes) exceeds £200m. 
Any increase or decrease in the Incremental Collateral Amount shall automatically increase or decrease the Target Amount by the 
same amount. The restricted cash for Agreed Collateral Purposes at 31 March 2008 is £267m (2007: £90m), therefore the Target 
Amount and cash required to be retained to meet the Target Amount at the balance sheet dates are as follows:

Target Amount at 31 March    (557) (490)
Cash required to be (retained)/released to meet Target Amount    (67) 1
Payments to NLF
Payments to NLF represent the aggregate of any payments made by or on behalf of the Group to the NLF during the year, 
excluding ﬁ xed decommissioning payments of £20m per annum (indexed to RPI but tapering off as the nuclear power stations 
were scheduled to close at RED) and £150,000 (indexed to RPI) for every tonne of uranium in PWR fuel loaded into Sizewell B reactor 
after RED.
Forecast Expenditure Reserve
The Group has increased the Forecast Expenditure Reserve by £55m (2007: £22m reduction) to £210m (2007: £155m). The Forecast 
Expenditure Reserve will be used to meet capital expenditure commitments and non-recurring maintenance and repair of a capital 
nature which is payable in the following ﬁ nancial year, as well as to fund capital expenditure, as deﬁ ned in the underlying 
agreements. 
Weighted Average Payment Percentage
The weighted average payment percentage has decreased from 64.4% at 31 March 2007 to 35.4% at 31 March 2008 principally 
as a result of the NLF’s partial conversion into equity of its Cash Sweep Payment right in June 2007. The remainder of the decrease 
relates to the exercise of 6,955,809 British Energy Group plc’s Warrants and the Cash Sweep Payment, offset by the impact of the 
dividend payment made during the year. At 31 March 2008 there were 6,764,057 unexercised Warrants remaining.
Payment Percentage
The NLF Cash Sweep percentage is 35.1% at 31 March 2008 (2007: 64.0%).

11. Taxation (continued)
Within the £45m net deferred tax liability (2007: £63m) there are deferred tax assets of £220m (2007: £240m) and deferred tax 
liabilities of £265m (2007: £303m). £5m (2007: £78m) of deferred tax asset is expected to be recovered within the next 12 months 
and £43m (2007: £12m) of deferred tax liability is expected to be settled within the next 12 months. At 31 March 2008, the Group 
has not recognised a deferred tax asset relating to tax losses of approximately £45m (2007: £32m) as the timing of utilisation of 
these losses is currently uncertain.

Basic Earnings Per Share
The basic earnings per share for the year has been calculated by dividing the net proﬁ t for the year attributable to shareholders 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted Earnings Per Share
The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the weighted average of 946,439,433 (2007: 570,769,647) ordinary shares in 
issue together with the dilutive weighted average of potential ordinary shares of 5,519,514 (2007: 11,378,881) in respect of Warrants.
Adjusted Earnings Per Share
The Directors consider that the adjusted earnings per share calculation is a more appropriate earnings measure because the Cash 
Sweep Payment accrual of £102m (2007: £305m) and the net proﬁ t for the year attributable to shareholders of £335m (2007: £465m) 
does not necessarily reﬂ ect the respective economic interests of the NLF and equity shareholders in the proﬁ ts of the Group. The 
calculation in any given year of the annual Cash Sweep Payment accrual is based on cash ﬂ ows and the retention of appropriate 
cash (Target Amount) and expenditure (Forecast Expenditure Reserve) reserves (see note 9).
The adjusted earnings per share has been calculated by excluding the following from the net proﬁ t for the year attributable 
to shareholders:
the Cash Sweep Payment credit relating to the year ended • 31 March 2007;
the Cash Sweep Payment accrual for the year; and • 
the amortisation of the conversion asset for the year. • 
The weighted average share capital is adjusted by the number of shares that would have been in issue if:
the NLF had fully converted their remaining interest at the balance sheet date; and • 
the partial conversion had taken place at the start of the year, rather than during the year. •

On 30 May 2007 the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (now the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory 
Reform) announced his intention to direct the NLF to convert and sell part of its interest in British Energy Group plc. On 1 June 2007 
British Energy Group plc received notice from the NLF intimating its intention to convert and sell approximately 400 million shares 
in the Company, with an over allotment option of a further 50 million shares in the Company. As a result on 6 June 2007 British 
Energy Group plc issued 450 million convertible shares of 10p each to the NLF, which were re-designated as 450 million ordinary 
shares of 10p each and admitted to the Ofﬁ cial List of the UKLA and to trading on the London Stock Exchange on the same day. 
Following the partial conversion and share issue the Cash Sweep Payment percentage was reduced to approximately 36% and 
resulted in the recognition of a conversion asset of £2,340m, additional equity share capital of £45m and additional share premium 
of £2,295m representing the excess of the conversion share price of £5.20 over the nominal value of shares issued. The conversion 
asset represents the fair value of the obligation which was removed as a result of the exercise of the conversion right. 
The conversion asset is amortised over the estimated useful accounting lives of the Group’s nuclear power stations. 
The amortisation of the conversion asset is recognised in the amortisation of conversion asset line in the consolidated 
income statement.

restricted in its use. This matches the uncontracted nuclear liabilities and decommissioning costs (see note 25), included in 
non-current liabilities.
The nuclear liabilities receivable represents amounts due under the historic BNFL contracts which will be reimbursed by the 
Government. This matches the contracted nuclear liabilities included in current and non-current liabilities (see note 25).

Goodwill
Goodwill of £345m arose on the completion of the acquisition at RED. Under the requirements of IFRS 3 – Business Combinations 
(IFRS 3), during the year ended 31 March 2006 £23m was charged to the consolidated income statement to reduce goodwill in 
relation to recognition of a deferred tax asset at 31 March 2006, which at RED did not satisfy the recognition criteria within IFRS 3 
due to uncertainty of recoverability. Additionally during that year £23m was credited within the tax charge in the consolidated 
income statement to reﬂ ect the recognition of the deferred tax asset.
For impairment testing purposes goodwill has been fully allocated to one cash generating unit being the total of the Group’s 
operating and generating assets. There were no intangible assets with indeﬁ nite useful lives allocated to the cash generating unit.
The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit at 31 March 2008 was determined using estimated fair value less costs to sell. 
The calculation of fair value less costs to sell was based on a discounted cash ﬂ ow valuation over the lives of the power stations, 
using available market information to reﬂ ect the amount that the Group estimates that it could have obtained, at the balance 
sheet date, from the disposal of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, after deducting 
the estimated costs of disposal. 
The calculation of fair value less costs to sell for the cash generating unit is most sensitive to the following key assumptions:
electricity prices; • 
projected output; • 
fuel costs; • 
other operating costs and investment; • 
Cash Sweep Payment obligation; and • 
value attributable to potential nuclear new build development. • 
The Group’s approach in determining the key assumptions was as follows:
Electricity prices were based on contracted and projected commodity prices for electricity. Projected market prices for electricity 
were based on an external market view of projected long-term electricity prices.
Projected output was based on expected levels of output over the expected operating lives of the power stations using the 
Group’s own engineering projections which considered historical performance, plant degradation, plant maintenance activity 
and investment, and allow for scheduled timings of outages and refuelling. Where possible these assumptions were 
validated externally.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
18. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (continued)
Fuel costs were based on contracted and projected commodity prices, for coal and nuclear fuel, and using the Group’s own 
engineering projections for consumption having considered historical consumption data and projected plant performance. 
Other operating costs and investment was estimated using the Group’s own engineering projections, where relevant, and having 
considered historical performance, plant degradation, plant maintenance activity and investment. The estimates of other operating 
costs and investment used in the discounted cash ﬂ ow projection were consistent with those used in the Group’s three year 
business plan. In subsequent periods the growth rate applied to other operating costs was based on the RPI and fully reﬂ ects the 
expected operating lives of the power stations.
The impairment calculations made allowance for projected levels of Cash Sweep Payment. The projection used the Cash Sweep 
percentage as at 31 March 2008 as a starting point, with adjustments in subsequent years to allow for retentions of undistributed 
cash following payment of dividends in line with the Group’s dividend policy as set out on pages 25 and 26 in the Financial Review. 
A pre-tax discount rate of 17% (2007: 23%) was used (equivalent to a post-tax discount rate of 9% (2007: 9%)).
The Group’s value attributable to potential nuclear new build development has been assessed by the Directors.
With regard to the assessment of value of the cash generating unit, the Group is of the opinion that, based on current knowledge, 
reasonably possible changes in any of the above key assumptions would not cause the carrying value to exceed the recoverable 
amount. 
Software
Software is amortised over its estimated operational life for a maximum of ﬁ ve years. The amortisation of software is recognised 
in the other amortisation line of the consolidated income statement.
ROCs and LECs
ROCs and LECs have a sustainable value and can be used in settlement of an obligation over an undeﬁ ned period and therefore, 
on this basis, ROCs and LECs are not amortised. Included within additions of £69m in the year (2007: £40m) are ROCs and LECs with 
a value of £9m (2007: £8m) which were produced internally.
Carbon Allowances
Carbon allowances are not amortised because they are held to settle the Group’s EU ETS obligation and therefore have a sustainable 
value. During the year the Group took delivery of Phase I carbon allowances, which had been purchased under forward contracts. 
In line with the Group’s accounting policy, these carbon allowances were recognised within intangible assets at cost. Subsequently, 
a write down of £58m (2007: £41m) was charged to the consolidated income statement to reﬂ ect a reduction in market prices of 
Phase I carbon allowances. During the year these allowances were used to settle the Group’s 2007 EU ETS obligation, therefore the 
write down has had no impact on the carrying value of carbon allowances at 31 March 2008.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
21. Restricted Cash and Other Financial Assets and Cash and Cash Equivalents (continued)
Other ﬁ nancial assets principally comprise net cash provided to satisfy variation margin calls in relation to trading through 
exchanges. These funds are non-interest bearing and availability of the cash pledged is restricted pending settlement of the 
related forward instrument.
Cash not immediately required for business purposes is invested in line with the Group’s treasury policy. At 31 March 2008 all cash 
investments not used to support collateral arrangements were due to mature within three months. The investments made during 
the year ended 31 March 2008 have a weighted average interest rate of 5.84% (2007: 4.92%). 
As at 31 March 2008 and 2007, all cash and cash equivalent deposits are with counterparties with investment grades of at least AAA 
for money market funds, or a short-term rating of A1, P1 or F1 for all other deposits, as per the Group’s treasury management policy.
For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash ﬂ ows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank of 
£1,028m (2007: £1,101m).
22. Financial Instruments and Derivatives 
Overview
The Group’s principal ﬁ nancial instruments include derivative commodity contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity, 
purchase of coal and carbon allowances, interest bearing debt, loans, investments in short-dated commercial paper, cash held 
in collateral accounts, cash and short-term deposits.
The main ﬁ nancial risks faced by the Group are trading risks in respect of the sale of electricity. Electricity trading risks include 
exposure to electricity price ﬂ uctuations, balancing of output volume with contractual commitments, commodity (coal, carbon 
allowances and uranics) price risk and counterparty credit risk. These are managed by the Group’s Trading and Sales division which 
operates within policies and procedures that are approved and monitored by the Board. The Trading and Sales division is not 
permitted to take speculative open positions.
Non-trading ﬁ nancial risks, including liquidity, interest rate and foreign exchange risks are managed by the Group’s central treasury 
department which also operates within policies and procedures that are approved and monitored by the Board. The treasury 
department is not permitted to take speculative open positions.
The foregoing discussion and the Financial Risk Management section of the Financial Review summarises how the Group manages 
its exposures to risks in respect of electricity prices, output balancing, commodity prices, counterparty credit risk, liquidity, interest 
rates and foreign exchange rates. Full details of the Group’s risks and the strategy for managing those exposures are set out in the 
Financial Review on pages 14 to 27. The Group also has an exposure to risks associated with ﬂ uctuations in the debt and equity 
markets through the pension schemes; further details of the pension schemes are provided in note 27.

At 31 March 2008 and 2007 all derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and commodity contracts ﬁ nancial assets were included in current 
assets in the consolidated balance sheet. At 31 March 2008, £142m (2007: £74m) of the derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and 
commodity contracts ﬁ nancial liabilities were classiﬁ ed as current liabilities with none classiﬁ ed as non-current liabilities 
(2007: £15m) in the consolidated balance sheet.
Of the derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and commodity contracts resting with a counterparty, 81% (2007: 95%) are of an investment 
grade quality of at least A– rated. The decrease in the percentage from the prior year is due to the increase in the volume of open 
contracts for the purchase of green energy, the majority of which rest with unrated counterparties.

Details of the categories of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities are set out below.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Commodity Contracts
All contracts for the sale of electricity through British Energy Direct, most long-term structured sales contracts and all coal 
procurement contracts are categorised as being held for the Group’s own purchase, sale or usage requirements and are therefore 
accounted for on an accruals basis because they are outside the scope of IAS 39.
GTMA and ISDA contracts are within the scope of IAS 39 as the Group follows the industry practice of net settling these contracts. 
As a result, all changes in fair value impact the consolidated income statement for those contracts which do not qualify for cash 
ﬂ ow hedge accounting. The movements in fair value in the year are presented within unrealised net losses on derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments and commodity contracts in the consolidated income statement.
Cash ﬂ ow hedge accounting has been utilised wherever possible to ensure that earnings continue to be recognised in line with the 
Group’s operational strategies by reﬂ ecting the earnings effects of derivative instruments in the same period as the hedged item 
affects earnings. The variability of cash ﬂ ows arising from a highly probable forecast sale of electricity under an existing variable 
priced own use sales contract has been designated as a hedged item for cash ﬂ ow hedge accounting purposes. Fair value changes 
of those GTMA and ISDA contracts which meet the requirements for cash ﬂ ow hedge accounting are deferred in equity, within the 
hedge reserve, until settlement of the hedging instrument or hedged item.
Options contracts are recognised at fair value, with movements in fair value being presented within unrealised net losses on 
derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and commodity contracts in the consolidated income statement.
Exposures have been expressed as net positions by counterparty wherever there is the intention and ability to legally set off assets 
and liabilities.
(i) Held for Trading
The Group classiﬁ es as ‘held for trading’ short-term contracts, contracts which are not designated as cash ﬂ ow hedges and 
contracts which have been de-designated from hedging relationships. Typically the term of these contracts does not exceed 
12 months with prices ﬁ xed at inception.
The fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and commodity contracts asset and liability positions are valued, where possible, 
using quoted market prices. More details on the method for determining fair value is set out in note 2 (xxi). The fair value of held 
for trading instruments equals the book value at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
22. Financial Instruments and Derivatives (continued)
At 31 March 2008 the Group had held for trading assets of £53m (2007: £82m) and liabilities of £43m (2007: £69m). The movement 
in the fair value in the year is presented within unrealised net losses on derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and commodity contracts 
in the consolidated income statement and totals a loss of £3m (2007: £2m) before tax.
The principal value of held for trading derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and commodity contracts at 31 March 2008 was £969m 
(2007: £903m). The £969m falls due within one year whilst at 31 March 2007 of the £903m, £856m fell due within one year and 
£47m fell due after more than one year but not more than three years. Included within the principal value of £969m (2007: £903m) 
is £792m (2007: £531m) relating to contracts where there will be a contractual outﬂ ow of cash from purchase contracts, all falling 
due within one year. As at 31 March 2007 of the £531m, £495m fell due within one year and £36m fell due after more than one year 
but not more than three years. 
 
(ii) Hedging Relationships
As at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007, cash ﬂ ow hedges were in place up to 31 March 2009 with the uncertain cash ﬂ ow values 
on certain variable priced sales contracts being hedged by ﬁ xed price GTMA and ISDA transactions. The fair value of hedging 
instruments equals the book value at 31 March 2008 and at 31 March 2007. At 31 March 2008 the Group had cash ﬂ ow hedging 
instrument liabilities of £99m (2007: £20m) and no cash ﬂ ow hedging instrument assets (2007: £23m). The movement in hedging 
relationships in the year was £102m (2007: £46m) and is presented as a debit (2007: credit) to the hedge reserve within equity.
There are no forecast transactions previously thought to be available for hedge accounting that are no longer expected to occur.
The principal value of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and commodity contracts which are hedging relationships at 31 March 2008 
was £91m (2007: £259m). The £91m falls due within one year whilst at 31 March 2007 of the £259m, £150m fell due within one year 
and £109m fell due after more than one year but not more than three years.
Other Financial Assets and Liabilities
The book value of the NLF and nuclear liabilities receivables is equal to the fair value, refer to note 17 for details of the valuation.
The carrying values of trade receivables, trade payables and accruals are equal to their fair values.
The fair values of restricted cash and other ﬁ nancial assets and cash and cash equivalents are equal to the book values due to 
short-term maturities. Details of the interest rate proﬁ le of these ﬁ nancial assets are included in note 21.
Borrowings consist of the Group’s Bonds and the fair value has been estimated using the quoted closing clean market price at 
the balance sheet date. Details of the interest rate and maturity proﬁ le of these ﬁ nancial liabilities are included in note 23.
The basis of valuation of back end fuel costs is included in note 25.
The book value of provisions and other charges is equal to the fair value.
The book value of the NLF liabilities is equal to the fair value, refer to note 28 for details of the valuation.
Foreign Exchange
The Group uses foreign exchange contracts and other derivative instruments as deemed necessary to economically hedge the 
primary market exposures associated with the Group’s underlying assets, liabilities and committed transactions. During the year 
ended 31 March 2008 the Group had three main sources of exposure to potential foreign currency risk. These exposures related 
to contracts for the purchase of coal and uranics, which are predominantly in US dollars, and the purchase of carbon allowances, 
which are in Euros.
The Group has a number of different contracts in place to purchase coal, some of which include pricing which is subject to dollar 
exchange rate movements. Refer to note 36 for details of the Group’s commitments to purchase coal.
The Group incurs pass through foreign currency costs relating to the supply, conversion and enrichment of uranium at the average 
exchange rate relevant to the fuel supplied. As at 31 March 2008, the Group had foreign currency commitments for nuclear fuel 
amounting to £70m (2007: £131m) out of a total fuel commitment of £1,440m (2007: £1,568m) (see note 36).
During the year the Group has been involved in the purchase of £58m (2007: £44m) of Phase I carbon allowances at the Euro foreign 
exchange rate ruling at the time of the transaction (see note 2 (ix)). Additionally the Group has £14m (2007: £81m) of commitments 
to purchase forward carbon allowances at 31 March 2008. At 31 March 2008, the Group had a net total of £9m (2007: £13m) of 
forward contracts in place to economically hedge its exposure to movements in prices of Phase II carbon allowances.
There are potential future foreign currency receivables in respect of amounts outstanding from the sale of Bruce Power. When 
these cash ﬂ ows become more certain in the future, the Group will evaluate currency hedging opportunities.

Back End Fuel Costs Contracted
Accruals for AGR spent fuel services relating to fuel loaded into reactors up to RED are based on the terms of the Historic Liability 
Funding Agreement (HLFA) with BNFL. The pattern of payments within the HLFA were ﬁ xed (subject to indexation by RPI) at RED 
and will be funded by the Government under the Government indemnity.
Back End Fuel Costs Uncontracted
Provisions for services relating to the disposal of associated nuclear waste of both PWR and AGR stations along with the storage 
and disposal of PWR spent fuel are based on cost estimates derived from the latest technical assessments.
Decommissioning
The costs of decommissioning the power stations have been estimated on the basis of on-going technical assessments of the 
processes and methods likely to be used for decommissioning under the current regulatory regime. The estimates are designed 
to reﬂ ect the costs of making the sites of the power stations available for alternative use in accordance with the Group’s 
decommissioning strategy.
Accounting Life Extension
During the year ended 31 March 2008 the discounted decommissioning liabilities reduced following the extension of the accounting 
lives of Hinkley Point B and Hunterston B power stations by ﬁ ve years to 2016. As a result of the accounting life extensions, the level 
of undiscounted estimated nuclear decommissioning liabilities remains unchanged, however, the decommissioning workstreams 
will occur later, therefore reducing the discounted nuclear decommissioning liabilities by £125m. The Government has indemniﬁ ed 
the Group for any future shortfall of NLF funding in respect of qualifying decommissioning costs and therefore the reduction in 
discounted nuclear decommissioning liabilities is fully offset by a corresponding decrease in the NLF receivable. As a result there 
is no net revalorisation impact for this change in the consolidated income statement.

Projected Payment Details
Based on current estimates of station lives and lifetime output projections, the following table shows, in current prices, the likely 
undiscounted payments, the equivalent sums discounted at 3% real per annum to the balance sheet date and the amounts accrued 
to date.

Accrued to date 2,168 363 2,981 5,512 5,469
The differences between the undiscounted and discounted amounts reﬂ ect the fact that the costs concerned will not fall due for 
payment for a number of years. The differences between the discounted amounts and those accrued to date will be charged to the 
consolidated income statement over the remaining station lives since they relate to future use of fuel.
Under the terms of the contracts with BNFL referred to above and in accordance with the projected pattern of payments for 
decommissioning and other liabilities, taking account of the decommissioning fund arrangements described in note 2 (xx), the 
undiscounted payments in current prices are expected to become payable as follows:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
26. Provisions for Other Liabilities and Charges (continued)
(i) Contracts Provision
The Group’s portfolio of commodity contracts was fair valued at RED as part of the application of acquisition accounting. The 
net contracts provision is being utilised over the lives of the contracts fair valued at RED and is expected to be fully utilised by 2011 
with the current portion of £17m expected to be utilised within the next 12 months. The provision utilisation of £2m (2007: £76m) is 
presented in the other operating income line of the consolidated income statement. Other operating income also includes an £8m 
(2007: £nil) realisation of a contingent asset relating to the Group’s disposal of its interest in Bruce Power LP. For the year ended 
31 March 2007 a release of £17m was also presented in the other operating income line of the consolidated income statement.
(ii) Other Provisions
Other provisions are made up of severance provisions, provisions for onerous leases, a provision for additional unfunded retirement 
beneﬁ ts (see note 27) and a provision for Eggborough site restoration costs. £2m (2007: £10m) of the other provisions is expected to 
be utilised within the next 12 months in relation to severance and onerous leases. Accordingly, this is classiﬁ ed as a current liability. 
The remainder of the other provisions are classiﬁ ed as non-current. 
27. Retirement Beneﬁ t Obligations
(i) Pension Schemes
The Group operates two separate deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension arrangements in the UK within the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme 
(ESPS), the British Energy Generation Group (BEGG) for the majority of employees and the British Energy Combined Group (BECG) 
for the employees at Eggborough power station. The ESPS is a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme, which is externally funded and subject to 
triennial actuarial valuation. Each pension group that participates in the ESPS is ﬁ nancially independent from the other groups.
The cash funding requirements of the pension schemes are determined by triennial actuarial valuations by the independent 
scheme actuaries. The most recent triennial valuations of the BEGG and BECG schemes were carried out at 31 March 2007 and 
have been agreed by the Trustees. Any deﬁ ciency disclosed in the BEGG or BECG schemes following a triennial actuarial valuation 
will be funded by the Group. The balance sheet valuations for accounting purposes under IAS 19 have been carried out by a separate 
independent actuary using the projected unit method.
(ii) Contributions
The Group contributed 22.4% (2007: 22.4%) to the BEGG pension scheme and 19.7% (2007: 19.7%) to the BECG pension scheme as 
employer’s normal contributions for the year ended 31 March 2008. Members who do not participate in the salary conversion 
arrangement and who are required to pay employee contributions contribute 5% (2007: 5%) and 6% (2007: 6%) to the BEGG and 
BECG schemes respectively. Members who participate in the salary conversion arrangements have their salaries reduced by 5% 
(2007: 5%) or 6% (2007: 6%) depending on whether they are members of the BEGG or BECG scheme, these monies being paid to 
the BEGG and BECG schemes as additional employer contributions. 
Additional agreed employer contributions were paid towards the BEGG scheme’s funding deﬁ cit of £20m for the year ended 
31 March 2008 (2007: £20m). For the year ended 31 March 2007, £40m of agreed accelerated contributions was also paid towards 
the BEGG scheme’s funding deﬁ cit. The Group made additional employer contributions of £1m (2007: £1m) to the BECG scheme 
in the year. 
The 31 March 2007 triennial actuarial valuation of the BEGG scheme has been agreed with a funding deﬁ cit of £174m at that date. 
From 1 April 2008 the rate of employer’s regular contributions for future service beneﬁ ts under the BEGG scheme increased from 
22.4% to 27.3%. Additional employer contributions will be paid towards the BEGG scheme’s funding deﬁ cit at a rate of £35m per 
annum paid monthly from 1 April 2008 until 31 December 2013. The requirement for additional contributions will be reviewed as 
part of the next triennial valuation as at 31 March 2010.
The 31 March 2007 triennial actuarial valuation of the BECG scheme has been agreed with a funding deﬁ cit of £3m at that date. 
From 1 April 2008 the rate of employer’s regular contributions for future service beneﬁ ts under the BECG scheme increased from 
19.7% to 22.2%. The Group will continue to make additional employer contributions towards the BECG scheme’s funding deﬁ cit, 
having regard to appropriate funding advice.
The Group expects to contribute a total of £119m, including additional employer contributions, to the schemes in the year ending 
31 March 2009.
At 31 March 2008 there was £7m (2007: £7m) of contributions owed to the pension schemes included in accruals.

The amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet under IAS 19 in respect of the Group’s funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension 
schemes are as follows:
        2008 2007
        £m £m
Fair value of plan assets    2,710 2,671
Present value of funded defined benefit obligations    (2,926) (2,736)
Retirement benefit obligations recognised in the consolidated balance sheet    (216) (65)
Certain additional retirement beneﬁ ts are provided to eligible employees. These obligations are unfunded and the liability recorded 
at 31 March 2008 was £6m (2007: £5m) and is included within other provisions (see note 26).
(iv) Plan Assets, Expected Rates of Return and Beneﬁ t Obligations
Changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows:
        2008 2007
        £m £m
Opening fair value of plan assets    2,671 2,455

Contributions by plan participants    8 7
Benefits paid    (91) (86)
Closing fair value of plan assets    2,710 2,671
The plan assets include investments in the Group’s equity, amounting to less than 1% (2007: less than 1%) of plan assets.
The major categories of plan assets and their expected rates of return are as follows:
      2008  2007
      Expected  Expected
      return 2008 return 2007
      % £m % £m
Equities  8.00 1,188 8.30 1,326
Bonds  5.20 1,054 4.80 865
Property  6.25 241 6.55 270
Hedge funds  6.50 107 6.80 103
Other  5.00 120 5.00 107
Total   2,710  2,671
The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption was developed with consideration to the current level of expected 
returns on risk free investments (primarily Government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other 
asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for 
each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets 
assumption for the portfolio.
The actual return on plan assets was £37m (2007: £170m), £145m less than (2007: £6m more than) the expected return on assets at 
the beginning of the year.
Changes in the present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligations are as follows:
        2008 2007
        £m £m
Opening defined benefit obligations    2,736 2,670
Current service cost    70 68
Past service cost    4 9
Interest cost (see note 10)    146 131
Contributions by plan participants    8 7
Actuarial losses/(gains)    53 (63)
Benefits paid    (91) (86)
Closing defined benefit obligations    2,926 2,736
For the year ended 31 March 2007, £9m and £1m were contributed to the pension schemes from the Group’s severance provisions 
established in previous years in relation to past service costs and current service costs respectively.

The current service cost charge for the year is included in staff costs in the consolidated income statement, and comprises £70m 
(2007: £67m) in respect of the funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes. Additionally for the year ended 31 March 2007 £1m was 
also recognised in respect of the unfunded pension scheme (see note 6). The interest cost and expected return on plan assets are 
included in ﬁ nance charges in the consolidated income statement. 
(vii) Amounts Recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense

As at 31 March     5 5
The deferred income recorded relates to consideration received for two options, an Asset Option and a Share Option, which were 
granted as part of the Restructuring. If exercised, subject to a number of conditions as summarised below, the options would 
enable the participants in the long-term “project ﬁ nance” loan to acquire the Eggborough power station assets (Asset Option) 
or to acquire the shares in Eggborough Power Limited (Share Option) which operates the coal-ﬁ red power station. In addition, the 
Group has a pre-emption right if the participants in the long-term “project ﬁ nance” loan sell or transfer their options to a third party.
The options may be exercised at any time prior to 31 August 2009 following which the participants in the long-term “project 
ﬁ nance” loan may acquire the shares in, or assets of, Eggborough Power Limited on 31 March 2010 in consideration of, 
approximately £104m subject to certain adjustments depending on the condition of the power station and cancellation of the 
outstanding debt (currently estimated to be £83m) or at any time prior to 31 August 2009 on the occurrence of an event of default 
in consideration for a fee (which varies depending on the type of event of default) and the cancellation of the outstanding debt 
at such time.
The options, if unexercised, expire on 31 March 2010.
The deferred income will be realised upon the exercise or expiry of the options as described above.

30. Called Up Share Capital (continued)
On 30 May 2007 the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (now the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory 
Reform) announced his intention to direct the NLF to convert and sell part of its interest in British Energy Group plc. On 1 June 2007 
British Energy Group plc received notice from the NLF intimating its intention to convert and sell approximately 400 million shares 
in the Company, with an over allotment option of a further 50 million shares in the Company. As a result on 6 June 2007 British 
Energy Group plc issued 450 million convertible shares of 10p each to the NLF, which were re-designated as 450 million ordinary 
shares of 10p each and admitted to the Ofﬁ cial List of the UKLA and to trading on the London Stock Exchange on the same 
day. Following the partial conversion and share issue the Cash Sweep Payment percentage was reduced to approximately 36% 
and resulted in the recognition of a conversion asset of £2,340m, additional equity share capital of £45m and additional share 
premium of £2,295m representing the excess of the partial conversion share price of £5.20 over the nominal value of shares issued. 
The conversion asset represents the fair value of the obligation which was removed as a result of the partial exercise of the 
conversion right. 
Ordinary Shares
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to be paid any proﬁ ts of British Energy Group plc available for distribution and 
determined to be distributed. On the winding up of British Energy Group plc, holders of ordinary shares will be entitled to receive 
the nominal capital paid up or credited as paid up on the shares together with any further amounts available to be paid which will 
be allocated proportionately to holders of ordinary shares. The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive notice of general 
meetings and to attend, speak and vote at such meetings.
Convertible Shares
The NLF has the right from time to time to convert all or part of its entitlement to the Cash Sweep Payment into convertible 
shares in British Energy Group plc (the NLF conversion right). On a full conversion of its remaining interest, the NLF would hold 
up to approximately 35% of the thereby enlarged equity share capital of British Energy Group plc. Subsequent to a conversion, the 
NLF may dispose of its convertible shares (which on disposal become ordinary shares) at any time subject to certain restrictions. 
Amongst other things, the NLF may not exercise the NLF conversion right or dispose of any convertible shares if such disposal would 
require British Energy Group plc to have produced listing particulars or a prospectus more than ﬁ ve times in a consecutive period of 
7.5 years. The convertible shares may only be held by Nuclear Liabilities Fund Limited or its successor in title, a Minister of the Crown, 
the Treasury, a department, non-departmental body or other agency of the Crown, any body corporate established by statute some 
or all of the members of which are appointed by a Minister of the Crown or other UK Government entity or any person directly or 
indirectly wholly-owned by, or held on trust for, the Secretary of State or other Minister of the Crown.
Save in respect of voting rights, the convertible shares have the same rights, are subject to the same restrictions and rank pari 
passu with the ordinary shares of British Energy Group plc in all respects. The number of votes that the holder of the convertible 
shares is entitled to exercise in respect of its holding of convertible shares is the lesser of: (i) 29.9% (and, for this purpose, taking 
into account the voting rights attributable to any other ordinary shares held or acquired by any person acting in concert with the 
holder); and (ii) the number of convertible shares which the holder would otherwise be entitled to vote if the convertible shares 
were ordinary shares. The convertible shares will convert into ordinary shares of British Energy Group plc automatically on transfer 
to a third party by the holder but are not convertible at the election of the holder prior to such a transfer. 
Special Rights Redeemable Preference Share of £1
The Special Share is redeemable at par at any time after 30 September 2006 at the option of the Secretary of State, after consulting 
British Energy Group plc. This share, which may only be held by and transferred to one or more of Her Majesty’s Secretaries of State, 
another Minister of the Crown, the Solicitor for the affairs of Her Majesty’s Treasury or any other person acting on behalf of the 
Crown, does not carry any rights to vote at general meetings, but entitles the holder to attend and speak at such meetings. The 
Special Share confers no rights to participate in the capital or proﬁ ts of British Energy Group plc beyond its nominal value. The 
consent of the holder of the Special Share is required for certain matters including the alteration or removal of the provisions in 
British Energy Group plc’s Articles of Association relating to the Special Share and to the limitations on shareholdings.
In addition, consent of the holder of the Special Share is required in relation to, amongst others, certain amendments to the Articles 
of Association of British Energy Bond Finance plc, British Energy Limited, British Energy Generation Limited or British Energy 
Generation (UK) Limited, or a disposal by British Energy Group plc of its shares in these companies. However, the holder of the 
Special Share will only be entitled to withhold consent to such an amendment or disposal if, in the holder’s opinion, the matter in 
question would be contrary to the interests of national security. The Articles of Association include full details of these restrictions.

30. Called Up Share Capital (continued)
Warrants
On Restructuring 29,298,286 Warrants of £0.98 were allotted. The Warrants are freely exercisable at the option of the Warrant 
holder. The subscription rights may be exercised at any time in respect of certiﬁ cated Warrants on lodging of a duly completed 
subscription notice and remittance of the subscription price or, in respect of Warrants held in uncertiﬁ cated form, if CREST Co. 
Limited receives a properly authenticated dematerialised instruction and payment through CREST in accordance with its rules. 
In the year ended 31 March 2008 6,955,809 (2007: 6,399,439) of these Warrants were exercised leaving 6,764,057 (2007: 13,719,866) 
unexercised. The Warrants entitle the holder to subscribe to acquire an equivalent number of ordinary shares at a subscription 
price of £0.98 per share within ﬁ ve years of Restructuring.
Own Shares
The Group has investments in its own shares, held in relation to the Group’s share incentive schemes, through shareholdings held 
by British Energy Employee Share Trust and Abbey National AESOP Trust. The value of these shares is presented within total equity. 
At 31 March 2008 1,913,946 (2007: 1,478,545) shares were held in trust. The maximum number of own shares held during the year

(i) Called Up Equity Share Capital
Called up equity share capital represents the nominal value of shares in issue (see note 30).
(ii) Share Premium
The share premium recorded at 31 March 2008 of £59m (2007: £40m) represents the excess of the fair value of Warrants exercised 
and Warrant proceeds received since Restructuring over the nominal value of the shares issued on exercise.
As a result of the partial conversion by the NLF on 6 June 2007 additional share premium of £2,295m was recognised during the year 
(see note 30). On 22 October 2007 the Court of Session in Edinburgh approved a £2,295m reduction of British Energy Group plc’s 
share premium account, thereby creating distributable reserves of this value. The reduction of the share premium reserve by 
£2,295m equates to the amount of new share premium created in relation to the NLF partial conversion.

31. Equity (continued)
(iii) Capital Reserve
The Restructuring involved bondholders and signiﬁ cant creditors compromising their claims against the Group in exchange for, 
amongst other things, the issue of Bonds (see note 23) by British Energy Bond Finance plc (a wholly-owned subsidiary of British 
Energy Group plc) and new ordinary shares of British Energy Group plc. The capital reserve was created on the issue of shares at 
RED and represents the excess of the fair value of the claims of the signiﬁ cant creditors and bondholders over the legal liability 
foregone. The capital reserve is not distributable.
(iv) Hedge Reserve
The £102m loss (2007: £46m gain) in the hedge reserve in the year reﬂ ects the fair value movement, before the deferred tax credit 
of £30m (2007: £14m charge), of the contracts that have been designated as cash ﬂ ow hedging instruments. This movement 
comprises an £84m net loss (2007: £3m gain) on hedging instruments recognised in the year, plus an £18m loss (2007: £43m gain) 
relating to amounts released from the hedge reserve as contracts are delivered and included in the consolidated income statement 
(see note 22).
Where hedge accounting is permitted, gains and losses on hedging instruments are recognised directly in equity until the contract 
is settled, at which point the gain or loss is transferred to the consolidated income statement. When trades are de-designated as 
hedging instruments, cumulative gains or losses are retained in equity until the forecast transaction is settled. If a hedged 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised within equity is transferred to the 
consolidated income statement of the period.
(v) Warrant Reserve
On Restructuring the shareholders in British Energy plc were entitled to receive Shares and Warrants in British Energy Group plc. 
The Warrants entitle the holder to subscribe for ordinary shares in British Energy Group plc within ﬁ ve years of the Restructuring. 
As the Warrants are exercised this reserve will be transferred to share capital and the share premium account. During the year, 
6,955,809 Warrants (2007: 6,399,439) were exercised resulting in an increase of 6,955,809 ordinary shares (2007: 6,399,439), an 
increase to share premium of £19m (2007: £16m) and a reduction in the warrant reserve of £12m (2007: £11m). The proceeds received 
in the year in relation to the exercise of the Warrants amounted to £7m (2007: £6m).
(vi) Retained Earnings 
Total income and expense in the year comprises the proﬁ t attributable to shareholders of £335m (2007: £465m), net actuarial gains 
and losses on retirement beneﬁ t obligations for the year of £199m loss (2007: £68m gain) and related deferred tax credit of £60m 
(2007: £21m charge).
An equity dividend of £140m (2007: £nil) was paid to ordinary shareholders from retained earnings during the year (see note 13).
As discussed above, £2,295m (2007: £nil) has been credited to retained earnings in relation to the approved capital reduction.
Under IFRS 2 £6m (2007: £2m) has been credited to retained earnings in relation to the Share Incentive Plan, the Deferred Incentive 
Plan and the Long-Term Deferred Bonus Plan (see note 33). 
During the year £2m (2007: £6m) of own shares were purchased from the market and held in trust in order to satisfy obligations in 
relation to the Group’s share incentive schemes.

33. Share-based Payments
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year ended 31 March 2008 
was £6m (2007: £2m) (see note 6) and related entirely to equity-settled share-based payment transactions. Details of each of the 
employee share plans are given below.
Share Incentive Plan
Under the Share Incentive Plan (SIP), employees, including the Executive Directors, who are resident in the UK and meet the service 
requirements, are eligible for awards under the SIP. Awards under the SIP are limited each year by relevant tax legislation and for 
the year ended 31 March 2008 will take the form of free shares. The value of the annual award is linked to performance conditions 
and in respect of the year ended 31 March 2008 these performance conditions related to cost control, unplanned losses and length 
of the ﬁ xed nuclear book. These are considered to be non-market conditions under IFRS 2 and dividends attach to the awards, 
therefore the shares are fair valued at the market value on the date of grant. The free shares are initially held in a trust and vest 
unconditionally for participating employees after being held within the trust for three years contingent upon participants being 
in continued employment by the Group. Any dividends paid on shares held within the trust are converted into additional shares. 
The following table illustrates the number of, and movements in, share awards under this scheme during the year:
        2008 2007
        Number Number
Outstanding at 1 April    748,933 –

Exercised    (4,110) –
Unvested at 31 March     1,191,997 748,933
The fair value of shares granted during the year was £5.43 per share (2007: £6.93). 
The shares exercised in the year related to individuals who left the Group’s employment and were permitted to exercise early their 
shares in accordance with the scheme rules. The weighted average share price of awards exercised during the year was £5.29. 
Deferred Incentive Plan
The Deferred Incentive Plan (DIP) is available to selected senior employees who are eligible to receive conditionally awarded options 
in shares in British Energy Group plc at nil cost. The value of the annual award is linked to performance conditions and in respect 
of the year ended 31 March 2008 these performance conditions related to cost control, unplanned losses and length of the ﬁ xed 
nuclear book. The share options vest over a period of between one and three years from the date of grant dependent on the 
percentage of performance targets achieved and the contractual life of each option granted is 10 years.
The following table illustrates the number of, and movements in, share options under this scheme during the year.

early their shares in accordance with the scheme rules. The weighted average share price of options exercised during the year 
was £5.72. 
The remaining contractual life of options outstanding at 31 March 2008 was 9.2 years.

British Energy Executive Share Option Plan 2004
The British Energy Executive Share Option Plan 2004 was available to certain full-time directors or qualifying employees. The 
options outstanding at 31 March 2007 related to two grants of awards and were subject to a performance condition related to

case of Executive Committee members). The awards were based on a proportion of salary and vest over a three year period, with 
one third of the award vesting immediately, one third after one year and the ﬁ nal third after two years. The contractual life of each 
option granted is 10 years.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
33. Share-based Payments (continued)
Share Option Schemes Granted by British Energy Limited
Share options were granted in previous years by British Energy Limited. Legal advice has been obtained to the effect that the 
changes in the corporate structure of the Group as a result of the Restructuring did not trigger the early exercise provisions under 
these options. The Remuneration Committee decided not to allow holders of the options in British Energy Limited to roll them over 
into options over shares in British Energy Group plc. The options granted by British Energy Limited are still capable of exercise, but 
immediately on exercise the shares will be converted into shares in British Energy Group plc in the ratio of 50:1. Accordingly the 
effective exercise price of the options is signiﬁ cantly higher than the current share price and it is unlikely the options will be 
exercised.
34. Contingent Assets 
The Group has certain contingent assets as a result of its disposal of its 82.4% interest in Bruce Power LP. During the year the Group 
received a payment of C$15m as additional consideration in respect of the restart of Bruce A Units 3 and 4. This has been recognised 
within the consolidated income statement in other operating income (see note 26).
The treatment of expenditure at the Bruce Power Station during the period of the Group’s part ownership is currently being 
considered by the Canadian tax authorities and could result in a rebate of a material amount of tax to the Group (see note 35).
35. Contingent Liabilities 
On 12 February 2004 British Energy Limited and British Energy International Holdings Limited received a notice of warranty claims 
from the consortium which purchased the Group’s 82.4% interest in Bruce Power LP alleging breach of certain warranties and 
representations relating to tax and to the condition of certain plant at the Bruce Power Station.
The principal tax claim relates to the treatment of expenditure at the Bruce Power Station during the period of the Group’s part 
ownership and is currently being considered by the Canadian tax authorities. The treatment proposed by the Group could result 
in a rebate of a material amount of tax to the Group that has not been recognised in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements; it 
is impracticable to provide an estimate of the potential amount of the tax rebate. The consortium claims that allowance of the 
expenditure for that period would cause it to lose future deductions. British Energy International Holdings Limited has rejected the 
tax claim and expects to defend it if it is pursued further. The Group is conﬁ dent that the amount of the claim should not, in any 
event, materially exceed the amount of the rebate, and that the tax claim should have no material cash ﬂ ow impact on the Group.
The claim relating to the condition of the plant is based upon alleged erosion of certain parts of the steam generators, including 
the support plates, through which boiler tubes pass, which it is alleged resulted in an extended outage of one unit at the plant 
to carry out repair works and loss of revenues and costs of approximately C$64.5m. The consortium also claims that the alleged 
erosion may reduce the operating life of the unit and/or result in further repairs involving further losses. On 10 February 2006, 
British Energy Limited and British Energy International Holdings Limited ﬁ led a Notice of Action against Ontario Power Generation 
(OPG) and Bruce Power LP with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice seeking a contribution and indemnity from OPG and Bruce 
Power LP with respect to any amounts for which British Energy Limited or British Energy International Holdings Limited may be 
found liable as a result of the steam generator claim brought on 12 February 2004 by the consortium which acquired British Energy 
Limited’s 82.4% interest in the Bruce Power plant.
On 7 December 2006, the consortium served a notice of arbitration on British Energy Limited and British Energy International 
Holdings Limited in relation to the purchase price payable by the consortium on the purchase of Bruce Power LP. Under the disposal 
arrangements, the parties agreed a post-completion adjustment to the purchase price to account for the value of the Bruce Power 
pension plan as determined by a mutually appointed actuarial adviser, Watson Wyatt. The consortium alleges that the valuation 
was incorrect, resulting in British Energy beneﬁ ting by C$23.1m which the consortium is now claiming together with interest 
and costs.
The consortium has also commenced legal proceedings against Watson Wyatt, David Proctor (an actuary and one of their 
employees) and Mebs Merali (an actuary and former employee) who were responsible for evaluating the Bruce Power pension 
plan and post-completion adjustment to the purchase price payable by the consortium. On 15 May 2007 Watson Wyatt and David 
Proctor served notice of a third party action on British Energy Limited and British Energy International Holdings Limited seeking 
an indemnity against any amounts for which they may be found liable. On 11 September 2007 Mebs Merali served a similar notice 
on British Energy Limited and British Energy International Holdings Limited. The Group expects to defend the claims. British Energy 
Limited and British Energy International Holdings Limited commenced a fourth party claim against Bruce Power LP and Bruce Power 
Inc in respect of the third party claim by Watson Wyatt and David Proctor and a separate third party claim by Mebs Merali on 
21 February 2008 and 20 February 2008 respectively, seeking a contribution, indemnity and relief from any damages/costs for 
which British Energy Limited and British Energy International Holdings Limited may be found liable or incur in the third party claims 
or the arbitration by the consortium. The arbitration proceedings in the claim by the consortium commenced on 10 March 2008.

35. Contingent Liabilities (continued) 
Under the agreement with the consortium C$20m is retained in trust to meet any representation and warranty claims, and this 
may be retained pending agreement or determination of the claims.
The Group has given certain indemnities and guarantees in respect of its subsidiary undertakings. No losses are anticipated to arise 
under these indemnities and guarantees, provided relevant subsidiary undertakings continue on a going concern basis.
The Group is involved in a number of other claims and disputes arising in the normal course of business which are not expected to 
have a material effect on the Group’s ﬁ nancial position.

Commitments to purchase in the year  190 181 123 121 108 717 1,440
At 31 March 2008, the estimated minimum commitment for the supply of coal was 1m tonnes (2007: 4m tonnes), which, at contract 
prices on 31 March 2008, equates to approximately £96m (2007: £139m), all of which falls due within one year. At 31 March 2007 3m 
tonnes with an approximate value of £116m fell due within one year and 1m tonnes with an approximate value of £23m fell due 
after more than one year but not more than three years.
In addition to the liabilities and provisions recognised and described in the notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements, the 
Group has provided certain guarantees and commitments in respect of the extent of capital expenditure by Eggborough Power 
Limited. The Group also enters into commitments to purchase and sell electricity in the normal course of business.
The Group has a commitment to make the Cash Sweep Payment as described in note 2 (xviii). The annual Cash Sweep Payment 
accrual can only be determined after the end of the ﬁ nancial year and is contingent based on cash generation in the year. Therefore, 
it is only recognised and provided for when it becomes determinable. At 31 March 2008, £102m has been accrued (2007: £305m).

37. Related Parties
British Energy Group plc is a public limited company owned by the Company’s shareholders and operates within an extensive 
contractual framework established as part of the Restructuring. The most signiﬁ cant contract, in terms of the limitations it 
places on the business, is the Contribution Agreement between the Secretary of State and British Energy Group plc. Within this 
contractual framework, British Energy Group plc is managed independently by the Board, which continues to direct the ﬁ nances 
and operating policies of the Group and is subject to the normal private sector disciplines, ﬁ duciary duties and Companies Act 
requirements. British Energy Group plc considers that no party is a controlling party under the terms of IAS 24 – Related Party 
Disclosures (IAS 24).
The following transactions were carried out with related parties:
(i) Entities with Signiﬁ cant Inﬂ uence over the Group
The Group considers Her Majesty’s Government (HMG) to be a related party due to the signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence exercised by HMG 
following the Group’s Restructuring. The following transactions took place during the year with HMG and sponsored bodies under 
its control:
HMG meets the Group’s historic contracted nuclear liabilities to BNFL, a Government controlled body. The nuclear liabilities • 
receivable is recognised on the consolidated balance sheet in relation to these liabilities and decreased from £2,223m at 
31 March 2007 to £2,168m at 31 March 2008.
The Group made payments to the NLF of £ • 24m (2007: £29m). The payments were in relation to ﬁ xed decommissioning funding 
contributions of £23m (2007: £22m) and £1m (2007: £1m) in respect of the Group’s share of the NLF’s administration costs. 
In the year ended 31 March 2007 a payment of £6m was made in respect of PWR fuel loaded into Sizewell B reactor, with no 
equivalent payment made in the year ended 31 March 2008.
The Group made payments to BNFL of £ • 289m (2007: £295m) during the year in respect of front and back end fuel costs. 
In addition, under the Government indemnity in respect of historic nuclear liabilities, consideration of £205m (2007: £197m) was 
passed to BNFL in the year. The balance outstanding due to BNFL at the end of the year was £16m (2007: £16m). Amounts due 
from the Group to BNFL at 31 March 2008 under the Historic Liability Funding Agreement amounted to £2,168m (2007: £2,223m).
The Group is required to make Cash Sweep Payments to the NLF depending on certain criteria being met. See note • 9 for 
further details.
The NLF, a Government controlled company, was issued with Bonds of £275m by British Energy Bond Finance plc as part of the 
Restructuring on 15 January 2005, however, as they are bearer bonds the Group is unable to conﬁ rm the total value held by the NLF 
at 31 March 2008. The outstanding amount of Bonds issued to the NLF is included within the £405m of sterling bonds outstanding 
at 31 March 2008, see note 23 for further details.
The Group has also entered into a number of material transactions in its normal course of business with other sponsored bodies 
and departments of HMG including HM Revenue and Customs.
(ii) Key Management Personnel
The compensation of key management personnel is set out in note 7.
38. Non-adjusting Post Balance Sheet Events
On 21 March 2007, the Government announced its intention to phase out industrial buildings allowances with effect from 
1 April 2008. The phasing out of industrial buildings allowances was not included in the 2007 Finance Act and so is not considered 
to be substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. An estimate of the ﬁ nancial effect of this change, calculated at 28%, is that 
it would increase the net deferred tax liability by £37m to £82m.

has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members 
as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 
1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, 
accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands 
it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company 
ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Committee Report to be audited have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. 
We also report to you whether, in our opinion, the information 
given in the Directors’ Report (comprising the Directors’ Report

not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information speciﬁ ed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration

Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the parent company ﬁ nancial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the 
Remuneration Committee Report to be audited. It also includes 
an assessment of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgements 
made by the Directors in the preparation of the parent company 
ﬁ nancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the parent company ﬁ nancial statements and 
the part of the Remuneration Committee Report to be audited 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of 
information in the parent company ﬁ nancial statements and 
the part of the Remuneration Committee Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the parent company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair • 
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as

the parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the • 
Remuneration Committee Report to be audited have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent •

Parent Company Financial Statements
Notes to the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2008
1. Accounting Policies
(i) Basis of Preparation
The ﬁ nancial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards. British Energy Group plc’s ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United Kingdom and are therefore being presented separately from the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of the 
British Energy Group, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union (EU) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations. 
References to the Company are to British Energy Group plc, the ultimate holding company of the British Energy Group. References 
to the Group are to the Company and its subsidiaries. These ﬁ nancial statements cover the ﬁ nancial year from 
1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008, with comparative ﬁ gures for the ﬁ nancial year from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007.
In preparing the ﬁ nancial statements for the current year, British Energy Group plc has adopted FRS 29 – Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures (FRS 29). British Energy Group plc is exempt from the requirements of FRS 29 because the Company is included in British 
Energy Group plc’s publicly available consolidated ﬁ nancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2008, which include disclosures 
that comply with IFRS 7 – Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7), the equivalent International Financial Reporting Standard.
The preparation of ﬁ nancial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the ﬁ nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual results can differ from those estimates.
In accordance with FRS 18 – Accounting Policies, the Directors have reviewed British Energy Group plc’s accounting policies and 
conﬁ rm that they are the most appropriate. A number of the policies require British Energy Group plc to use a variety of estimation 
techniques. Signiﬁ cant factors considered when assessing the carrying value of assets include future electricity prices, expected 
annual output, expected station operating costs, remaining station lives and discount rates. 
British Energy Group plc has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting a 
proﬁ t and loss account, statement of total recognised gains and losses and cash ﬂ ow statement. Accordingly neither a proﬁ t and 
loss account, statement of total recognised gains and losses, nor a cash ﬂ ow statement is presented in these ﬁ nancial statements.
(ii) Fixed Asset Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are initially recorded at the cost of shares allotted. Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less 
provisions for diminution in value. The carrying value of all ﬁ xed asset investments is regularly assessed for permanent impairment 
and provision made, if appropriate.
(iii) Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date. Timing 
differences are differences between taxable proﬁ ts and those stated in the ﬁ nancial statements. Deferred tax is measured, on 
an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets 
are only recognised to the extent that it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁ ts from 
which the future reversal of the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
Deferred tax is recognised in the proﬁ t and loss account except to the extent that it is attributable to a gain or loss that is or has 
been recognised directly in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in which case the deferred tax is recognised directly 
in that statement.
(iv) Share-based Payment 
British Energy Group plc has ﬁ ve share compensation schemes, the Share Incentive Plan, the Deferred Incentive Plan, the Long-Term 
Deferred Bonus Plan, the Executive Share Option Plan 2004 and the Interim Bonus Plan. British Energy Group plc accounts for its 
share compensation schemes in accordance with FRS 20 – Share-based Payment.
British Energy Group plc issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees of its subsidiaries under the terms of 
the Company’s various employee share compensation schemes. The fair value of the share compensation schemes is recognised 
in investments with the corresponding credit included in shareholders’ equity.

2. Proﬁ ts and Dividends of British Energy Group plc
(i) Proﬁ ts

British Energy Group plc has distributable reserves of £3,344m (2007: £1,162m).
(i) Called Up Equity Share Capital
Called up equity share capital represents the nominal value of shares in issue (see note 7).
On 30 May 2007 the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (now the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory 
Reform) announced his intention to direct the NLF to convert and sell part of its interest in British Energy Group plc. On 1 June 2007 
British Energy Group plc received notice from the NLF intimating its intention to convert and sell approximately 400 million shares 
in the Company, with an over allotment option of a further 50 million shares in the Company. As a result on 6 June 2007 British 
Energy Group plc issued 450 million convertible shares of 10p each to the NLF, which were re-designated as 450 million ordinary 
shares of 10p each and admitted to the Ofﬁ cial List of the UKLA and to trading on the London Stock Exchange on the same day. 
Following the partial conversion and share issue the Cash Sweep Payment percentage was reduced to approximately 36% and 
resulted in the recognition of an investment in British Energy Bond Finance plc (formerly British Energy Holdings plc) of £2,340m, 
additional equity share capital of £45m and additional share premium of £2,295m representing the excess of the conversion share 
price of £5.20 over the nominal value of shares issued. The investment in British Energy Bond Finance plc relates to the conversion 
asset recognised in British Energy Generation Limited and represents the fair value of British Energy Group plc’s obligation, which 
was removed as a result of the exercise of the conversion right. It should be noted that whilst British Energy Group plc has the 
commitment to make the Cash Sweep Payment as described in the Contribution Agreement, the Company has agreed with British 
Energy Generation Limited that British Energy Generation Limited will make the required contribution on behalf of the Company.

8. Reconciliation of Movement in Shareholders’ Funds and Movement in Reserves (continued) 
(ii) Share Premium
The share premium recorded at 31 March 2008 of £59m (2007: £40m) represents the excess of the fair value of Warrants exercised 
and Warrant proceeds received since Restructuring over the nominal value of the shares issued on exercise.
As a result of the partial conversion by the NLF on 6 June 2007 additional share premium of £2,295m was recognised during the 
year. On 22 October 2007 the Court of Session in Edinburgh approved a £2,295m reduction of British Energy Group plc’s share 
premium account, thereby creating distributable reserves of this value. The reduction of the share premium reserve by £2,295m 
equates to the amount of new share premium created in relation to the NLF partial conversion.
(iii) Warrant Reserve
On Restructuring the shareholders in British Energy plc were entitled to receive Shares and Warrants in British Energy Group plc. 
The Warrants entitle the holder to subscribe for ordinary shares in British Energy Group plc within ﬁ ve years of the Restructuring. 
As the Warrants are exercised this reserve will be transferred to share capital and the share premium account. During the year, 
6,955,809 Warrants (2007: 6,399,439) were exercised resulting in an increase of 6,955,809 ordinary shares (2007: 6,399,439), an 
increase to share premium of £19m (2007: £16m) and a reduction in the warrant reserve of £12m (2007: £11m). At 31 March 2008 
there were 6,764,057 (2007: 13,719,866) of unexercised Warrants. The proceeds received in the year in relation to the exercise of 
the Warrants amounted to £7m (2007: £6m).
 
9. Contingent Liabilities
British Energy Group plc has given certain indemnities and guarantees in respect of its subsidiary undertakings. No losses are 
anticipated to arise under these indemnities and guarantees, provided relevant subsidiary undertakings continue on a going 
concern basis.
British Energy Group plc has given a guarantee and indemnity to the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory 
Reform and the Nuclear Liabilities Fund along with a number of other group companies in respect of the Nuclear Liabilities Funding 
Agreement.
British Energy Group plc has provided a debenture comprising ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating charges to the Secretary of State for Business, 
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Nuclear Liabilities Fund along with a number of other group companies in respect of 
any decommissioning default payment.
British Energy Group plc has provided a debenture comprising ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating charges to Barclays Bank along with a number 
of other group companies in respect of all sums due under the Eggborough Finance Credit Agreement, the Capacity and Tolling 
Agreement and the Second Intercompany Loan Agreement.
British Energy Group plc has given a guarantee in relation to the obligations of British Energy Bond Finance plc under a Trust Deed 
creating guaranteed bonds.
10. Financial Commitments
(i) Capital Commitments
British Energy Group plc has no capital commitments at 31 March 2008 (2007: £nil).
(ii) Other Contractual Commitments
British Energy Group plc has a commitment to make the Cash Sweep Payment as described in the Contribution Agreement. 
As permitted by this Agreement, British Energy Group plc has agreed with British Energy Generation Limited that British Energy 
Generation Limited will make the required contribution on behalf of the Company.

Glossary
kW (Kilowatt): kWh (Kilowatt-hour) 
A kilowatt is a unit of power, representing the rate at which 
energy is used or produced: one kilowatt-hour is a unit of 
energy and represents one hour of electricity consumption 
at a constant rate of 1 kW. 
Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD)

and abatement technologies to introduce revised limits for 
releases of SO
2
, NOx and dust. Under UK implementation of the 
Directive, operators are permitted to elect either the Emission 
Limits Value (ELV) approach or the National Emissions Reduction 
Plan (NERP) approach. 
Levy Exemption Certiﬁ cates (LECs) 
The climate change levy is a tax on the use of energy in industry, 
commerce and the public sector. The purpose of the levy is 
to encourage the efﬁ cient use of energy, therefore a range 
of measures are in place to assist energy users to improve 
energy efﬁ ciency, one of which is the exemption for the use 
of renewable power. LECs are provided as proof that this 
exemption is valid. 1 LEC equals 1MWh of renewable energy. 
LLW, ILW, HLW (Low, Intermediate, High Level Waste) 
Radioactive waste is classiﬁ ed as low, intermediate or high 
level waste according to its heat generating capacity and 
radioactivity. LLW comprises slightly radioactive materials, such 
as discarded protective clothing and used wrapped materials. 
ILW comprises more radioactive materials, including sludges 
and resins from the cleaning of fuel storage pond water, fuel 
cladding and other materials arising from the reprocessing 
of spent fuel, and some radioactive components arising from 
the decommissioning of plant. HLW comprises nuclear waste 
products separated out from uranium and plutonium during 
the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.
Load Factor
The electricity produced by a power station expressed as a 
percentage of the electricity it could have produced if operating 
at its reference energy generation over a ﬁ xed time period, 
usually one year. 
Lost Time Accident (LTA) 
An incident which causes one or more days off work 
(consecutive or not) after, but not including, the day of an 
occupational injury or illness. 
Market Price 
The price for annual forward baseload contracts. 
Materiel Condition 
A term used by nuclear operators, particularly in the United 
States, in relation to nuclear power stations, and used to 
describe the physical condition of plant and equipment and 
the condition of operating procedures, engineering drawings, 
speciﬁ cations and manuals (taking safety, maintenance and 
plant reliability into consideration). 
MW (Megawatt): MWh (Megawatt-hour) 
One megawatt equals 1,000 kW: one megawatt-hour 
represents one hour of electricity consumption at a constant 
rate of 1 MW. 
National Emissions Reduction Plan (NERP) 
Emission limits imposed under the Large Combustion Plant 
Directive, requiring operators to maintain emissions within 
an annual ‘bubble’ limit. 
NDA

Installations Inspectorate in compliance with British Energy’s 
nuclear site licences.
Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) 
A part of the Nuclear Safety Division Directorate of the Health 
and Safety Executive, which administer nuclear site licences. 
Outage (Planned and Unplanned) 
A period during which a reactor is shut down. The periodic 
shutdown of a reactor including for maintenance, inspection 
and testing or, in some cases, for refuelling is known as a 
planned outage. In the UK, some planned outages are known 
as statutory outages and are required by the conditions 
attached to the nuclear site licence needed to operate the 
station. Unscheduled shutdown of a reactor for a period is 
known as an unplanned outage.

PWR (Pressurised Water Reactor) 
The most recent type of nuclear reactor to be constructed in 
the UK which uses pressurised water as both the coolant and 
the moderator. 
Quinquennial Review 
The ﬁ ve-yearly review of the assumptions underlying the 
Group’s provision for certain nuclear liabilities. 
Realised Price 
Calculated by dividing revenue from generated electricity 
by total output for the period. 
Renewables Obligation Certiﬁ cates (ROCs) 
Eligible renewable generators receive ROCs for each MWh 
of electricity generated. These certiﬁ cates can then be sold 
to suppliers, in order to fulﬁ l their renewables obligation. 
Renewables Obligation Scheme 
Scheme introduced by Utilities Act 2000 requiring electricity 
suppliers to ensure a proportion of sales are derived from 
renewable sources. 
Restructuring 
The restructuring of the Group completed on 14 January 2005. 
RED 
The Restructuring Effective Date, 14 January 2005. 
Revalorisation 
Revalorisation arises because nuclear liabilities are stated in 
the balance sheet at current price levels, discounted at 3% per 
annum from the eventual payment dates. The revalorisation 
charge is the adjustment that results from restating these 
liabilities to take into account the effect of inﬂ ation in the year 
and to remove the effect of one year’s discount as the eventual 
dates of payment become one year closer. Revalorisation 
charges arise in respect of the ﬁ xed decommissioning obligation 
to reﬂ ect the unwinding of the discount for the period. 
A revalorisation credit arises in respect of movements in the 
value of nuclear liabilities and the NLF receivable to take 
account of the underlying movement in nuclear liabilities.

Shares 
Ordinary shares in British Energy Group plc. 
Statutory Outage 
The planned shutdown of nuclear reactors for regulatory 
inspection and maintenance. 
TNUoS 
Transmission Use of System. 
TW (Terawatt): TWh (Terawatt-hour) 
One terawatt equals 1,000GW: one terawatt-hour represents 
one hour of electricity consumption at a constant rate of 1TW. 
Unit Capability Factor 
The percentage of maximum energy generation that a plant 
is capable of supplying to the electrical grid, limited only by 
factors within the control of plant management. 
Unit Operating Costs 
Calculated by dividing the operating costs of generated 
electricity plus depreciation and software amortisation by 
total output for the period. 
Unplanned Capability Loss Factor (UCLF) 
Unplanned capability loss factor is deﬁ ned as the ratio of the 
unplanned energy losses during a given period of time, to the 
reference energy generation, expressed as a percentage. 
Unplanned Energy Loss 
In the context of Unplanned Capability Loss Factor, unplanned 
energy loss is energy that was not produced during the period 
because of unplanned shutdowns, outage extensions, or 
unplanned load reductions due to causes under plant 
management control. Causes of energy losses are considered 
to be unplanned if they are not scheduled at least four weeks 
in advance.

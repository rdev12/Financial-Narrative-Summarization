OVERVIEW
2016 was a year of notable political and economic dislocation 
which has affected the London property market. London remains 
a very attractive investment market, a desirable retail destination 
and residential location. Looking through short-term market 
movements Capco’s long-term strategy for its two unique estates 
remains unchanged. During 2016, Capco achieved good progress 
at both Covent Garden and Earls Court and, although it was a 
challenging year in the residential market, I am confident that 
Capco will deliver value creation for our shareholders over the 
coming years.
PERFORMANCE
Despite strong rental growth at Covent Garden and significant 
progress on site at Earls Court, Capco’s total shareholder return 
for the year, which comprises share price performance plus the 
dividends paid during the year, was -32.3 per cent. Total return  
for the year was -5.5 per cent, which represents the change in net 
assets plus the dividends paid during the year. The total value of 
Capco’s property portfolio fell by 4.4 per cent on a like-for-like 
basis to £3.7 billion.
Covent Garden delivered ERV growth of 7.9 per cent during the 
year resulting in a valuation increase of 6.4 per cent on a like-for-
like basis. The excellent performance of Covent Garden was not 
sufficient to offset the decline in land values at Earls Court which 
fell by 20.4 per cent like-for-like due to adverse conditions in the 
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 6  London residential market following stamp duty changes and the 
outcome of the EU Referendum.
The Covent Garden team continues to focus on achieving rental 
growth through creative asset management, strategic investment 
and place-making. Covent Garden is an internationally renowned 
destination successfully attracting global brands and visitors. 
Following a record year of leasing activity, new Zone A rental levels 
were achieved across the estate and management has released a 
new ERV target of £125 million to be achieved by December 2020. 
Work on the Floral Court development continues on schedule and 
will create high quality retail, restaurant and residential space on 
the estate.
It has been another year of progress on the ground at Earls Court. 
The demolition to ground level of the former Exhibition Centres 
was completed during the year and land enablement works are 
now underway preparing the site for future development. The first 
residential completions at Lillie Square took place at the end of 
2016 with the first units being handed over in time for Christmas. 
The strategy remains focused on value creation by exploring 
opportunities to evolve and enhance the Earls Court Masterplan.
The Venues business continues to strengthen with a reliable and 
growing income stream reflecting its excellent prospects as a 
central London venue.
The Board and I would like to thank Capco’s employees for their 
work during the year and the achievements made in delivering 
Capco’s business plans at Covent Garden, Earls Court and Venues.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND DIVIDENDS
Capco’s financial position is strong with low leverage, high 
liquidity and modest capital commitments. Responsible 
management of capital and prudent financing from a variety  
of sources is a key feature of Capco’s strategy to ensure the 
Company maintains a strong balance sheet. During the year, 
Capco’s liquidity was significantly strengthened by the completion 
of a £100 million financing of the Olympia business, a US Private 
Placement totalling £175 million and the £150 million (£95 million 
Capco share) HCA facility at Earls Court to fund infrastructure 
works on site. The business is well positioned to support its  
future activities and withstand periods of uncertainty.
The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 1.0 pence per share, 
which brings the total dividend for 2016 to 1.5 pence per share.
DIRECTORS
There were a number of changes to the Board in 2016. In March we 
welcomed Anthony Steains as a new independent Non-executive 
Director. He brings a diverse perspective to the Board, being 
resident in Asia and experienced in corporate finance activity. 
Following the retirement of Ian Henderson at the AGM, Gerry 
Murphy became Chairman of the Remuneration Committee  
and Henry Staunton became Senior Independent Director.
Situl Jobanputra was appointed as Chief Financial Officer with 
effect from 1 January 2017, following Soumen Das’ departure at  
the end of the year. Soumen had been with the Company since its 
listing in 2010 and we are grateful for his substantial contribution. 
Situl’s appointment reflects Capco’s commitment to developing 
the talent of our employees and promoting from within the 
Company where possible. I am delighted to welcome him to 
the Board.
The Board is committed to encouraging diversity and the 
development of our people across the business.
You can read more on the Board’s succession planning in the Nomination Committee 
report on page 68.
During the year Gerry Murphy has led a review of our 
remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors and the 
Remuneration Committee is proposing a revised remuneration 
package that will simplify our existing arrangements whilst 
seeking to incentivise management and align their interests  
with those of our shareholders. The proposals will be put to 
shareholders for approval at our forthcoming AGM.
You can read more about the proposals in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
page 70.
BOARD OVERSIGHT
The Board and individual Directors regularly take opportunities 
to visit Capco’s assets and see for ourselves the transformations 
that are taking place. This and the regular briefings we receive 
from operational management help us gain a real understanding 
of the business challenges and opportunities.
In taking its decisions the Board assesses and balances the 
interests of the different stakeholders who have involvement with 
Capco, its properties and the surrounding communities. As well as 
our shareholders, this includes our employees, partners, tenants, 
lenders, government and the communities where we operate. In 
developing and delivering our plans we undertake significant 
stakeholder engagement and the Board is kept fully informed  
of feedback received.
The delivery of Capco’s strategy is underpinned by comprehensive 
policies designed to ensure that the business plan is delivered in 
line with the Board’s expectations. These policies are promoted 
across the Company to create a culture of accountability and 
responsibility and to ensure that all of our employees understand 
their role within the business and the standards to which they 
must operate. Reflecting this, I am pleased to report that the 
Group’s revised risk management structure which was implemented 
in 2016 is operating effectively and efficiently and the Board is 
pleased with the health and safety record achieved at the Group’s 
project sites.
LOOKING AHEAD
Despite macro-economic uncertainty and challenging market 
conditions, Capco’s strategy remains clear and focused. London  
is an outstanding global city and we have two of its best estates. 
Capco’s strong balance sheet and unique assets are well-placed for 
management to create and deliver long-term value for shareholders.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report Chief Executive’s review
A year of operational progress across Capco
2016 has been a challenging year but despite macro-economic  
and political upheaval, Covent Garden has continued to deliver 
excellent growth and is now established as one of the best retail 
estates in the world. The success of our investment strategy at 
Covent Garden was not sufficient to offset the decline in land value 
at Earls Court, which was affected negatively by the correction in 
the London residential market as a result of stamp duty increases 
and the outcome of the EU Referendum. As a result, EPRA net 
asset value fell by 5.9 per cent over the year to 340 pence per share 
with 4.7 per cent of this occurring in the first six months of 2016.
Covent Garden continues to deliver excellent rental and value 
growth. Demand for the estate from retailers, restaurateurs and 
consumers is very strong as reflected in a record amount of leasing 
activity in 2016 resulting in an increase in value of 6.4 per cent 
like-for like.
The London residential market has been affected negatively by  
the EU Referendum and the substantial increase in stamp duty 
taxation. These factors were the major contributors to the decline 
in our Earls Court interests which decreased by 20.4 per cent 
(like-for-like) of which 14 per cent (like-for-like) was in the  
first six months of the year.
Our disciplined approach to capital allocation has meant Capco  
is in a robust financial position with a low loan to value of 23 per 
cent. The balance sheet has been further strengthened by the 
financing activities across the Group this year resulting in high 
liquidity of £556 million, an extension of our loan maturities  
to 5.9 years and a lower average cost of debt of 2.7 per cent.
Our strategy remains clear and focused on driving long-term  
value creation from our two unique central London estates. 
London is a growing and global city and underpinned by a clear 
strategy; Capco’s two estates are well-placed for long-term success.
Capco regularly considers opportunities where its core skills  
of place-making and masterplanning can be utilised and in  
2015 acquired a 50 per cent interest in the Solum Developments 
joint venture with Network Rail which is exploring potential 
opportunities for future redevelopments at significant railway 
station sites across London.

Ian Hawksworth, Chief Executive
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 8  Valuations
The total property value of the Group declined 4.4 per cent 
(like-for-like) in the year to 31 December 2016 to £3.7 billion. The 
December 2016 valuations incorporate the 1 per cent increase in 
Stamp Duty Land Tax (“SDLT”) that was enacted earlier this year, 
which was applicable to most of our portfolio and had an impact  
of £32.4 million (0.9 per cent of property value).
The valuation of Covent Garden has risen by 6.4 per cent (like-for-
like) to £2.3 billion, driven by ERV growth of 7.9 per cent achieved 
over the year. The equivalent yield is 3.5 per cent, reflecting the 
valuers’ current view of the strength of demand for central London 
retail investments.
The valuation of Earls Court Properties is £1.1 billion, a decrease  
of 20.4 per cent (like-for-like) principally driven by a greater risk 
premium through a higher developer’s margin for consented 
development land, trimming of sales values, as well as some  
cost inflation. This reflects the valuer’s assessment of weakened 
sentiment and a correction in the central London residential market.
The Group has a 63 per cent controlling interest in Earls Court 
Partnership Limited (“ECPL”), the investment vehicle with 
Transport for London (“TfL”) which owns the land formerly 
occupied by the Earls Court Exhibition Centres (“EC1 & EC2”). As a 
result, it is fully consolidated in the financial statements and TfL’s 
interest is represented as a non-controlling interest. See page 40 of 
the Financial Review for further information.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report Covent Garden – a leading global destination  
for brands and visitors
Covent Garden has been transformed into one of the leading 
destinations for global ‘street retail’ and its success has continued 
throughout 2016. The uncompromising asset management 
strategy has driven strong leasing momentum, attracting global 
premium brands, many of which choose Covent Garden as their 
first or only London store, resulting in solid rental performance 
across the estate. Our creative approach to managing Covent 
Garden continues to create value for our retailers through 
attracting high quality footfall and positive sales growth.
We achieved a record level of leasing activity in 2016 with 95  
new lettings and renewals agreed, securing £13.3 million of rent  
at 9.3 per cent above December 2015 ERV. The ERV of the estate  
is £96 million, up 7.9 per cent on a like-for-like basis. A new ERV 
target of £125 million to be achieved by December 2020 has been 
set, reflecting the positive growth prospects of the estate.
Following positive leasing progress across the estate, new Zone A 
levels have been achieved reflecting the strong demand for space  
in this iconic setting. Tom Ford, Giorgio Armani Beauty’s Armani 
Box London (“Armani Box London”) and Hotel Chocolat are  
the latest signings to the Market Building while the strategy to 
reposition the Royal Opera House Arcade with a luxury accessories 
focus has seen the introduction of The Watch Gallery, Mulberry 
and N.Peal.
The dining offering at Covent Garden has further strengthened 
this year. We are delighted to welcome Michelin-starred chef Ollie 
Dabbous to the estate through the restaurant at the Henrietta 
Hotel on Henrietta Street, while SushiSamba, RedFarm and  
VyTA add to the depth of variety and quality on the estate.
The Floral Court development (formerly Kings Court) is on track 
for completion towards the end of 2017 and will transform the 
pedestrian flows on the northern side of the estate. Petersham 
Nurseries, the renowned lifestyle brand, will open later in 2017 
following a pre-lease for 60 per cent of the commercial space 
reflecting the strong appeal of the Floral Court development.
We have continued to expand our presence on the estate through 
strategic acquisitions, investing £85 million in properties located 
at key access points to the estate and will continue to seek 
opportunities to further enhance our footprint on the area. The 
estate now comprises over 1.1 million square feet of lettable space, 
establishing itself as one of the largest managed retail-led estates 
in London.
Earls Court Masterplan – over 70 acres of consented land in 
central London
At Earls Court, the complex demolition of the former Earls Court 
Exhibition Centres to ground level completed on schedule after 
almost two years of intensive work on the site. Demolition to 
basement level has commenced which further de-risks the site  
and enables the land for its future development.
The Earls Court Masterplan is a unique opportunity to create  
the next great estate in London. The Masterplan is one of the 
Greater London Authority’s (“GLA”) designated Opportunity 
Areas making it a strategic scheme for London. Representations 
have been submitted by Capco to the GLA’s London Plan signalling 
Earls Court’s potential to deliver an additional 2,500 homes above 
the current consented scheme, bringing the total number of new 
homes to 10,000.
Further to Capco’s ambitions for Earls Court, during 2016  
ECPL engaged in public consultations on proposals to redevelop 
Empress Place. These are strategic assets located on or around  
the Lillie Road which ECPL has acquired in recent years. These 
consultations relate to a scheme comprising 400 new homes and 
retail space, covering circa 500,000 square feet (GEA), creating one 
of the key access points to the Earls Court Masterplan and Lillie 
Square. Plans are progressing to submit a detailed planning

application in spring 2017, signalling the start of the 
enhancements to the Earls Court Masterplan.
At Lillie Square, construction of Phase 1 is progressing well and  
the scheme recently welcomed its first residents. Sales of Phase 2 
have continued with 59 apartments now reserved or exchanged 
and levels of enquiries remain positive. Preparations are being 
made for the next release of apartments in the coming months. 
The residential sales market remains challenging as a result of 
stamp duty increases and the EU Referendum result which has 
impacted buyers’ decision making. Nevertheless, reflecting the 
strong location and transport connectivity of the scheme, sales 
prices achieved in Phase 2 have been at a modest premium to 
comparable units in Phase 1. 
Venues – operational excellence
The Venues business continues to strengthen with EBITDA of 
£19 million up 29 per cent compared to 2015 reflecting its excellent 
prospects as a central London venue.
Olympia London has re-established itself as London’s venue of 
choice for premium exhibitions attracting 1.5 million visitors to 
the historic venue in 2016. Olympia London played host to the UK’s 
largest exhibition, the Ideal Home Show, and continues to attract 
new business welcoming 5G World for the first time this year.
Outlook
Capco is very well positioned with two significant prime estates  
in central London. London remains a very attractive investment 
market and whilst we expect market challenges to continue into 
2017, Capco has a clear strategy to deliver long-term value creation 
from its two estates in Covent Garden and Earls Court.
Covent Garden has been transformed into one of the leading 
destinations for global ‘street retail’. Following the strong demand 
in 2016 from excellent brands and dining concepts, 2017 will be 
one of our most active years for retail and dining openings across 
the estate, further underpinning the estate’s reputation as a 
premier global retail and dining destination. We remain focused 
on our ambitious strategy to introduce the best brands for our 
visitors, invest in strategically expanding the portfolio and 
manage the estate to create value for our retailers to underpin 
rental growth. The estate remains well-placed for continued 
success and accordingly we will be focused on achieving a  
new ERV target of £125 million by December 2020.
The Earls Court Masterplan is the only central London GLA 
Opportunity Area of scale and is a strategic scheme for the Capital. 
With its excellent existing transport infrastructure, it has the 
potential to deliver much-needed homes across various tenures 
and places for Londoners to enjoy. Our strategy remains focused 
on maximising the potential of this strategically important 
mixed-use scheme and de-risking the site through land 
enablement, preparing it for future development.
Capco’s financial position has been strengthened by the financing 
activities undertaken during the year. With low leverage, high 
liquidity and modest capital commitments, the Group is well 
positioned to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. We 
enter a new year focused on our strategy to deliver long-term value 
creation for our shareholders from our two exceptional central 
London estates.

ESTATE STRATEGIES
GROUP STRATEGY
To create, grow and deliver value in its assets and estates,  
through a combination of active asset management, strategic investments and maximising development opportunities
Allocation of capital based on assessment of risk-adjusted returns
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 12  Key performance indicators
MEASURING 
PERFORMANCE
The Group’s Key Performance Indicators are 
selected to ensure clear alignment between  
its strategy, shareholder interests and 
remuneration of its employees
TOTAL PROPERTY RETURN
-2.3%
TOTAL RETURN
-5.5%
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN
-32.3%
1. Based on consensus estimates at 16 February 2017 for comparator group where results unavailable.
The three-year total property return is calculated assuming annual reinvestment. Annualised three-year total return and total shareholder return are calculated on a basis 
consistent with the Group’s long-term incentive plans. A number of other indicators of performance are considered by the Board either at a Group level (including underlying 
earnings per share) or specifically relevant to each estate, for example ERV at Covent Garden and EBITDA at Venues. These are discussed further in the asset-specific operating 
reviews in the Strategic Report.
All three key performance indicators are directly linked to Executive Directors’ remuneration. These three indicators are carefully aligned with the Group’s strategy of creating 
and growing value and delivering market-leading total returns over the longer term. Total property return, underlying earnings per share and net asset value are linked to 
annual bonuses available to certain of the Group’s employees.

Total property return is calculated  
as capital growth including gains and 
losses on disposal plus rents received less 
associated costs, including ground rent
This metric allows comparability with  
the IPD Total Return All Property Index
Total return is the growth in EPRA NAV 
per share plus dividends per share during 
the year
Outperformance over a three-year period, 
versus the median of a comparator group  
of the nine largest constituents of the FTSE 
350 Real Estate Index, is identified as a key 
measure of the success of Capco’s strategy
Total shareholder return is the increase  
in the price of an ordinary share plus 
dividends during the year
The Group’s total shareholder return is 
benchmarked against the median total 
shareholder return of a comparator group 
of the nine largest constituents of the  
FTSE 350 Real Estate Index
As a key metric for the long-term equity-
based compensation for the Group’s 
employees, total shareholder return aligns 
incentives with shareholder interest

Governance Financial statements Strategic report Principal risks and uncertainties
Risk Management
The Board has overall responsibility for 
Group risk management. It determines  
its risk appetite and reviews principal risks 
and uncertainties regularly, together with 
the actions taken to mitigate them. The 
Board has delegated responsibility for the 
review of the adequacy and effectiveness  
of the Group’s internal control framework 
to the Audit Committee.
Following a comprehensive review of risk 
management undertaken in 2015, risk is a 
standing agenda item at all management 
meetings. This gives rise to a more risk 
aware culture and consistency in decision 
making across the organisation in line 
with the corporate strategy and risk 
appetite. All corporate decision making 
takes risk into account, in a measured 
way, while continuing to drive an 
entrepreneurial culture.
The Executive Directors are responsible  
for the day to day operational and 
commercial activity across the Group  
and are therefore responsible for the 
management of business risk. The 
Executive Risk Committee, comprising  
the Executive Directors, the General 
Counsel and the Financial Controller, is 
the executive level management forum for 
the review and discussion of risks, controls 
and mitigation measures. The corporate 
and business division risks are reviewed  
on a quarterly basis by the Executive Risk 
Committee so that trends and emerging 
risks can be identified and reported to  
the Board.
Senior management from every division 
and corporate function of the business 
identify and manage the risks for their 
division or function and complete and 
maintain a risk register. The severity of 
each risk is assessed through a combination 
of each risk’s likelihood of an adverse 
outcome and its impact. In assessing 
impact, consideration is given to financial, 
reputational and regulatory factors and 
risk mitigation plans established. A full

GROUP STRATEGY
All of the principal risks and uncertainties have been mapped to the most relevant strategic priority
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, which are set out on 
the following pages, are reflective of where the Board has invested 
time during the year. These principal risks are not exhaustive.  
The Group monitors a number of additional risks and adjusts 
those considered ‘principal’ as the risk profile of the business 
changes. See also the risks inherent in the compilation of financial 
information, as disclosed within note 1 ‘Principal Accounting 
Policies’ to the consolidated financial statements, ‘Critical 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation  
and uncertainty’.
The EU Referendum has resulted in economic and political 
uncertainty during 2016 and this is expected to continue into the 
foreseeable future. To date there has been no adverse impact on 
occupier demand, footfall or the trading results of our tenants at 
the Covent Garden estate, which has seen strong rental growth, 
although the valuation of residential-led development land has 
been impacted by the overall economic and political backdrop. 
London, as a highly desirable global city, continues to attract 
businesses and people and we would expect this leading position 
to be maintained over time. Uncertainty remains, however, 
around the exit mechanism and longer term implications of 
Brexit, and this will continue to have a direct or indirect impact  
on a number of the principal risks set out on the following pages.

Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 16  VIABILITY STATEMENT
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three-year period to December 2019, the period covered by the latest 
business plan, taking account of the Group’s current position, individual asset performance forecasts and the potential impact of 
the principal risks disclosed on pages 15-17. Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
and Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to December 2019. In 
making this statement the Directors have considered the resilience of the Group, taking account of its current position, the risk 
appetite, the principal risks facing the business in severe but reasonable scenarios, and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions.
The business plan considers the Group’s cash flow, capital commitments, financial resources, debt covenants and other key 
financial risks. A sensitivity analysis was carried out which involved flexing a number of the main assumptions to consider 
alternative macro-economic conditions, both positive and negative. This analysis was carried out to evaluate the potential impact 
of the Group’s principal risks actually occurring. The Directors believe that the Group is well-placed to manage its principal risks 
successfully. The Group also considered the impact of significant economic downturn leading to asset value and rental income 
decline, as well as rising interest rates. This assessment has considered the potential impacts of these risks on the business model, 
future performance, solvency and liquidity over the period.
The Directors have determined that the three-year period to December 2019 is an appropriate period over which to provide its 
viability statement. In making their assessment, the Directors have taken account of the Group’s robust and flexible balance sheet 
position with a debt to asset ratio well below the 40 per cent limit set, substantial cash and available facilities, the Group’s ability 
to raise new finance and the flexibility of future development expenditure.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A leading global retail, dining and cultural destination  
in the heart of central London
Covent Garden has established itself as a leading global retail and 
dining address in the heart of London’s West End. Visitors are 
drawn to its unique retail, dining and cultural experience within  
a historic setting. Capco’s distinct approach to creative asset 
management and place-making continues to attract the best retail 
and dining brands.
Overview
Providing over 1.1 million square feet of lettable space in the heart 
of London’s West End, the Covent Garden estate represents 61 per 
cent of Capco’s portfolio by value. At Covent Garden, Capco drives 
value creation through asset management, strategic investment 
and creativity, underpinned by a vision to establish the estate as  
a global destination for brands and visitors.
2016 was another year of significant progress for Covent Garden as 
the business continued to implement its leasing and investment 
strategy. The value of the estate increased by 6.4 per cent on a 
like-for-like basis to £2.3 billion. ERV is £96 million, a like-for-like 
increase of 7.9 per cent. 2016 was a record year of leasing which 
reflects the success of the innovative repositioning strategy through 
asset management and strategic investment. A new ERV target of 
£125 million has been set, reflecting the positive growth prospects 
of the estate.
Reflecting the demand for space in this iconic setting, 95 leasing 
transactions including new leases and renewals representing 
£13.3 million of rental income per annum were transacted at  
9.3 per cent above 31 December 2015 ERV. Net rental income is 
£41.5 million, up 5.3 per cent (like-for-like) compared to 2015. 
Occupancy on the estate remains high at 97 per cent.
As the owner of the Covent Garden estate, Capco regularly  
hosts events on the Piazza attracting footfall to the estate.  
This year ‘Reflect London’ has been created to offer striking new 
perspectives of the Market Building while concealing renovation 
building works which will house an iconic new restaurant from 
SushiSamba with stunning views overlooking the Piazza.
Capco continues to work closely with the community stakeholders 
including Westminster City Council (“WCC”) and Covent Garden 
Area Trust (“CGAT”) to maintain and celebrate the attributes 
which make the area unique. This year was marked by the opening 
of a pedestrianised King Street, improving the pedestrian flow on 
the estate.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report Retail
Capco has successfully transformed the Royal  
Opera House Arcade through its strategy of a luxury 
accessories and gifting focus. The Watch Gallery, the 
UK’s leading independent luxury watch retailer, and 
British lifestyle brand, Mulberry, have opened stores 
this year. The latest signings to complement this 
offering are luxury British cashmere brand N.Peal  
and British eyewear brand, Tom Davies, which are  
due to open later in 2017.
The iconic Market Building has seen strong demand 
over the year and a new Zone A rental level of £675 per 
square foot has been achieved. Hotel Chocolat opened  
in November, offering Covent Garden inspired recipes 
and bespoke gift collections which reference the  
historic Market Building. There have been a number of 
premium beauty brand lettings in the Market Building, 
including the luxury beauty boutique Tom Ford, 
fragrance brand Atelier Cologne, the first Armani  
Box London store and the beauty company Deciem.
Covent Garden has now become the premier Beauty 
Quarter for London, with more stand-alone beauty 
boutiques in one square mile than anywhere else in  
the Capital. New signings in the Market Building add  
to the existing strong line-up of Chanel, Dior, NARS  
and Charlotte Tilbury.
Henrietta Street continues to strengthen its retail  
offer, following an array of new signings including 
luxury men’s shoe brand, Cheaney, award-winning 
British hair stylist, Kevin Luchmun and Parisian 
outerwear clothing concept K-Way. These signings 
continue the successful transformation of Henrietta 
Street following the implementation of a menswear  
and complementary dining strategy. 
Dining
Covent Garden has strengthened its reputation as  
a global dining destination with a number of new 
concepts signed this year.
The Market Building’s dining offering has evolved  
and enhanced following a new letting to acclaimed  
US fast casual restaurant Buns & Buns. The Miami 
based ‘breadery’ and grill will be another London first 
for Covent Garden and will offer an all-day casual foodie 
destination. This builds upon restaurant signings  
in the Market Building earlier in the year including 
Italian-style boulangerie VyTA Santa Margherita, 
French delicatessen Aubaine and renowned fusion 
dining restaurant SushiSamba which will open on  
the iconic Opera Terrace, one of the most prominent 
dining locations in London.
Acclaimed New York restaurant, RedFarm, has taken 
space alongside Balthazar on Russell Street. The new 
restaurant, the group’s first outside of New York, will 
bring RedFarm’s famed menu of modern and inventive 
Chinese food to London’s West End and is due to open 
later in 2017.
ROYAL OPERA HOUSE ARCADE REPOSITIONED

Covent Garden
A new letting to Experimental Group will see the 
opening of their latest concept in London on Henrietta 
Street. Plans from the team behind The Experimental 
Cocktail Club include a new restaurant and bar as well 
as an 18 bedroom hotel. The Experimental Group is 
partnering with Michelin-starred chef Ollie Dabbous  
to create a French seasonal menu. Adding to the leisure 
offering is Z Hotels which has taken space on Bedford 
Street and will provide luxurious yet compact rooms  
for visitors. In addition, Capco together with Robert  
De Niro and BD Hotels, were granted planning approval 
by Westminster City Council to create The Wellington,  
a visionary new 83-room luxury boutique hotel on 
Wellington Street.
The arrival of the much-celebrated Frenchie and Flat Iron has 
elevated the dining mix on Henrietta Street, with a new restaurant 
by Ollie Dabbous to open at Henrietta Hotel in 2017
The Royal Opera House Arcade has transformed with a new focus 
on luxury accessories and gifting, evidenced by brands such as The 
Watch Gallery, Mulberry, Lulu Guinness and Tom Davies opening 
stores in the Arcade
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 26  Developments
Floral Court will provide over 85,000 square feet (NIA) 
of space with eight retail and two restaurant units as 
well as 45 premium apartments above the development. 
The Floral Court development continues to make 
positive progress and is on track for completion towards 
the end of 2017 at an expected total cost of £105 million. 
At Carriage Hall, the refurbishment of 15,000 square 
feet (NIA) nears completion.
The schemes will transform pedestrian flow, creating  
a new connecting passage between Long Acre and King 
Street providing the opportunity to unlock Floral 
Street’s place-making potential.
Highlighting the strong appeal of the scheme, world-
renowned lifestyle brand Petersham Nurseries have 
pre-leased approximately 60 per cent of the commercial 
space at Floral Court. Petersham Nurseries will occupy 
over 16,000 square feet (NIA), creating new bespoke 
retail and dining concepts across four units.
The redevelopment of 11-12 Floral Street, the building 
formerly occupied by The Sanctuary, is well underway 
and will include the creation of two new retail units 
with flagship potential.
Acquisitions
Capco has continued to expand its footprint on the 
estate, most notably through the strategic acquisition of 
Tower House, on Southampton Street, a key access point 
of the estate, for £67.5 million before purchaser’s costs.
The property is a substantial corner building well 
located at the junction of Southampton Street and 
Tavistock Street with views towards the Piazza. The 
property offers prime retail frontage with repositioning 
opportunities and further enhances Capco’s presence 
on Southampton Street, a key access point to the Piazza.
Residential
Capco continues to restore the estate’s residential 
heritage. The lettings market has been very active  
with strong demand for Capco’s brand of premium 
residential product across the estate with average rents 
between £70 and £85 per square foot setting new rental 
tones for the area.
This year saw the sale of three apartments, including 
two penthouses, at The Beecham, a luxury development 
overlooking the Piazza. The average price achieved for 
the scheme is in excess of £2,800 per square foot, with 
one of the penthouse apartments achieving over £3,000 
per square foot.
The most recent conversion is at 26-27 Southampton 
Street, a premium residential development, which is due 
to complete shortly and will offer 10 apartments to let.
DEVELOPMENT PROGRESSES AT FLORAL COURT
FUTURE PRIORITIES
The strategy for Covent Garden remains focused on 
driving value through its creative asset management 
and investment strategy. The focus will be on continuing 
to attract excellent brands and dining concepts to the 
estate as well as continued investment through strategic 
acquisitions to expand the footprint of the estate. 
Completing the repositioning strategy for the Royal 
Opera House Arcade, as well as adding further retail 
and dining depth to Henrietta Street are key areas 
of priority.
Further to this, the Floral Court and Carriage Hall 
developments will complete in 2017 which will 
transform pedestrian flow in the area and will provide 
the opportunity to extend Capco’s place-making 
approach to Floral Street, realising the unlocked 
potential in this part of the estate. Reflecting the 
positive growth prospects of the estate, a new ERV 
target of £125 million to be achieved by December 2020, 
has been set.
Following a record year of leasing activity, 2017  
will see a large number of retail and dining openings 
across the estate with brands such as SushiSamba, 
Petersham Nurseries, Henrietta Hotel, Tom Ford and 
Armani Box London providing additional animation 
and quality to the portfolio, further underpinning  
the estate’s reputation as a premier global retail  
and dining destination.
Work continued to progress at Floral Court throughout 2016. The 
new mixed-use development will open up a public courtyard with 
new high quality residential, retail and restaurant space, anchored 
by dining and retail concepts from Petersham Nurseries

Opportunity to create London’s next great estate
Covering over 70 acres of prime, strategic land in Chelsea and 
Fulham, the consented Earls Court Masterplan is the largest 
redevelopment opportunity in central London. The site is located 
in an established London neighbourhood and provides excellent 
transport infrastructure. Underpinned by Capco’s distinct 
approach to place-making, the Earls Court Masterplan represents 
an opportunity to create the next great estate of London.
The mixed-use scheme is a GLA ‘Opportunity Area’, making it  
a key strategic scheme for the Capital and is currently consented  
to provide 7,500 new homes, creating 10,000 jobs and will deliver 
over £450 million in community benefits. The scheme is the only 
central London Opportunity Area of scale with the potential to 
deliver substantially more housing. Accordingly, representations 
have been made by Capco to the GLA’s London Plan to deliver 
10,000 new homes, an additional 2,500 homes above the current 
consented scheme. 
Against the backdrop of London’s growing housing needs, 
maximising Opportunity Areas is seen as vital in order to meet 
London’s demands. The current GLA London Plan estimates that 
London’s population will grow by two million by 2036 and the 
provision of housing a key priority with the Capital requiring  
over 40,000 new homes per annum.
Earls Court Properties represents Capco’s interests in Earls Court, 
which principally comprise:
 ◦ 63 per cent interest in ECPL: the investment vehicle with TfL  
in respect of EC1 & EC2, and including certain assets on and 
around Lillie Road
 ◦ 100 per cent of the Empress State Building
 ◦ 50 per cent interest in the Lillie Square joint venture
In addition, in 2013, Capco exercised its option under the 
Conditional Land Sale Agreement (“CLSA”), a binding agreement 
in relation to the West Kensington and Gibbs Green Estates.
The valuation of Earls Court Properties is £1.1 billion, a decrease  
of 20.4 per cent (like-for-like) principally driven by a greater risk 
premium through a higher developer’s margin for consented 
development land, trimming of sales values, as well as some  
cost inflation. This reflects the valuer’s assessment of weakened 
sentiment and a correction in the central London residential market.
The Masterplan is located in two London Boroughs, the Royal 
Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the London Borough of 
Hammersmith & Fulham. Capco remains committed to working 
positively and constructively with all its stakeholders.
Earls Court Properties saw continued operational progress and 
achieved a number of milestones throughout 2016.

ENABLING THE LAND FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 32  Planning
As a designated GLA Opportunity Area, The Earls Court 
Masterplan is a strategic scheme for the Capital with outline 
planning consent for 10.7 million square feet (including The 
Empress State Building). In preparation for the next revision of  
the London Plan, which is expected next year, representations have 
been submitted by Capco to the GLA outlining The Earls Court 
Masterplan’s ability to deliver a minimum of 10,000 new homes, 
well in excess of the 7,500 currently consented, demonstrating  
the site’s potential to deliver more housing and maximise this 
important London scheme. The additional density will deliver 
much needed homes for all Londoners including additional 
affordable housing and a diversity of residential tenures.
ECPL has consolidated its ownership in the Masterplan area in 
recent years, acquiring a number of smaller assets on and around 
Empress Place. During 2016, ECPL engaged in public consultations 
on proposals for 400 new homes and retail space, covering circa 
500,000 square feet (GEA), creating one of the key access points  
to the Earls Court Masterplan and Lillie Square. Preparations  
are being made for the submission of the planning application by 
ECPL for the Empress Place scheme. The application is expected  
to be submitted in spring 2017 and could add an additional circa 
200,000 square feet (GEA) of space to the Masterplan area, 
aligning with Earls Court’s ability to deliver greater density.
In October 2016, a detailed planning application was submitted  
to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea for Exhibition 
Square which is located at the entrance of the Earls Court estate 
adjacent to Earls Court Underground station. Detailed planning 
consent was granted in January 2017. The consent which covers  
1.8 acres will create an important gateway to the Earls Court 
scheme and its new high street, including a public square and 
gardens, a signature hotel, offices and an entrance to Earl’s Court 
Underground station.
Due to the scale of the Earls Court Masterplan, there will remain  
a risk of protests and legal challenges (ranging from complaints 
about noise through to judicial reviews or applications for listing) 
against specific aspects of the scheme as it is progressed. It should 
be noted that all such challenges to date have been successfully 
defended however future challenges of this nature cannot 
be discounted.
Land assembly and enablement
ECPL, the venture with TfL in respect of EC1 & EC2 owns 999 year 
leases over the EC1 & EC2 land together with certain adjacent 
properties primarily located on or around Lillie Road. Capco  
owns 63 per cent share and is leading the venture in its role as 
business and development manager.
ECPL has made significant progress in the enablement of  
land interests at Earls Court. The first phase of the complex 
demolition of the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres to ground 
level completed this year at a cost of £60 million. Demolition to 
basement level will further de-risk the site and prepares the land 
for future development. This final phase of demolition is expected 
to take 12 months at a cost of circa £40 million.
In 2013, Capco exercised its option under the CLSA, a binding 
agreement in relation to the West Kensington and Gibbs Green 
Estates. To date, Capco has paid £60 million of the £105 million 
cash consideration payable to LBHF including two of the five 
annual instalments of £15 million. Enabling works have 
commenced on Block D of Lillie Square foundations to  
facilitate the first phase of replacement housing for the  
West Kensington and Gibbs Green estates residents.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
The Lillie Square development is a one million square 
feet (GEA) residential scheme located adjacent to the 
Earls Court Masterplan. The development will deliver 
608 private and 200 affordable homes across three phases.
The valuation of Capco’s 50 per cent interest in Lillie 
Square, which is held in a joint venture with the Kwok 
Family Interests (“KFI”), decreased to £223 million,  
a like-for-like decrease of 17.0 per cent over the year.
Phase 1 launched in 2014 and is substantially  
pre-sold. The average price per square foot of Phase 1  
is approximately £1,500 with the range of pricing 
achieved at £1,200 – £2,800 per square foot including  
a penthouse pre-sold for £6.3 million. Construction of 
Phase 1 nears completion and the scheme welcomed its 
first residents in December 2016. Over £125 million  
of sales proceeds (Capco’s share) are expected in the 
coming year on completion of handovers of Phase 1.
Sales of Phase 2 have continued with 59 apartments now 
reserved or exchanged. Sales prices achieved in Phase 2 
have remained positive with prices at a modest premium 
to comparable units in Phase 1. Preparations are being 
made to enable the next release in the coming months 
while plans are progressing to enable construction  
of Phase 2.
Construction costs in relation to the private element of 
the Lillie Square scheme are currently expected to be in 
the order of £420 million, reflecting market conditions 
in the construction industry.
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 36  FUTURE PRIORITIES
Capco’s strategy at Earls Court is to drive long-term 
value creation through planning, land assembly, land 
enablement and selective development activities.
At Earls Court, the focus of activities will be the 
completion of the complex demolition of the former 
Earls Court Exhibition Centres to below ground level, 
preparing the land for its future development potential. 
At Empress Place, the priority is to obtain approval for 
the planning application which could increase the 
potential consented Masterplan area by circa 200,000 
square feet (GEA).
The Earls Court Masterplan is currently consented to 
deliver 7,500 new homes and is the only designated GLA 
Opportunity Area of scale in central London making  
it a strategic scheme for the Capital. Representations 
recently made by Capco to the GLA’s London Plan 
outline the ability of The Earls Court Masterplan to 
deliver a minimum of 10,000 new homes, well in excess 
of the currently consented scheme. Capco remains 
focused on maximising the potential of this important 
London scheme.
At Lillie Square, the focus will be to complete and 
deliver Phase 1, continue sales of Phase 2 through the 
next release of units later in 2017 and progress plans  
to enable the construction of Phase 2.

1. Group share
During 2016 political and economic uncertainties have had a negative impact on the property sector, in particular London residential 
property, which is reflected in the fall in valuations.
EPRA net asset value per share fell by 5.9 per cent during the year, decreasing from 361 pence at 31 December 2015 to 340 pence. This 
21 pence decrease together with the 1.5 pence dividend paid during the year represents a total return of -5.5 per cent.
At Covent Garden rental growth achieved during the year was the main driver of the increase in value of the estate by 6.0 per cent  
(6.4 per cent like-for-like).
The market value of Earls Court Properties, which comprises the Group’s interests at Earls Court, has decreased by 20.4 per cent, 
reflecting the valuers’ assessment of the weakened sentiment in the central London residential market.
Basis of preparation
In line with the requirements of IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’, the Group is required to present its joint ventures under the equity 
method in the consolidated financial statements. Under the equity method, the Group’s interest in joint ventures is disclosed as a  
single line item in both the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement rather than proportionally consolidating  
the Group’s share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis.
Internally, the Board focuses on and reviews information and reports prepared on a Group share basis, which includes the Group’s  
share of joint ventures but excludes the non-controlling interest share of our subsidiaries. Therefore, to align with the way the Group  
is managed, this financial review presents the financial position, performance and cash flow analysis on a Group share basis. In previous 
years the Board focused on and reviewed information on a proportionally consolidated basis therefore the comparative summary income 
statement and summary cash flow statements have been re-presented.

At 31 December 2016 the Group’s EPRA net asset value was £2.9 billion (31 December 2015: £3.1 billion) representing 340 pence per share 
(31 December 2015: 361 pence).
The Group presents EPRA net asset value in addition to the net assets attributable to owners of the Parent. The EPRA alternative 
performance measures are widely used by public real estate companies in Europe and therefore assist with comparability.

Investment, development and trading property
The revaluation deficit on the Group’s property portfolio was £170.4 million for the year, representing a 4.4 per cent decrease in value  
on a like-for-like basis compared with the IPD Capital Return for the equivalent period of a 2.8 per cent loss. Revaluation gains at Covent 
Garden of £129.4 million were not sufficient to offset revaluation loss at Earls Court of £292.7 million. On an IFRS basis, which includes 
ECPL at 100 per cent and Lillie Square at 50 per cent, revaluation loss and sale of investment property was £235.0 million.
Total property return for the year was a deficit of 2.3 per cent. The IPD Total Return index recorded a 2.6 per cent gain for the 
corresponding period. The 2016 valuations incorporate the increased SDLT levels that were enacted earlier this year which had an impact 
of £32.4 million (0.9 per cent of property value).
Trading property is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost and market value, therefore valuation surpluses  
on trading property are not recorded. Any unrecognised surplus is however reflected within the EPRA net asset value measure. At 
31 December 2016, the unrecognised surplus on trading property was £48.1 million (31 December 2015: £99.9 million). This arises 
primarily on trading property at Lillie Square.
Debt and gearing
During the year the Group increased its share of available facilities by £425 million, with five new agreements.
 ◦ In January, the Group replaced the £665 million Covent Garden debt facility with a £705 million five year Covent Garden debt facility 
which increased available facilities by £40 million. £640 million of the facility matures in 2021 with the remaining £65 million 
maturing in 2020 with an option to extend to 2021. There is a further option to extend the facility to 2022.
 ◦ In March, a £150 million (£95 million Group share) 10 year secured credit agreement was signed by Earls Court Partnership Limited  
to fund infrastructure-related costs on land interests at Earls Court.
 ◦ In June, the Group entered into an agreement to extend the existing construction facility which funds the Lillie Square development 
by £30 million (£15 million Group share) for a one year period.
 ◦ In September, the Group signed an agreement with five institutional investors for a private placement of £175 million 10 and 12 year 
senior unsecured notes which enhance the unsecured debt platform at Covent Garden. Closing occurred in November and proceeds 
were used to repay bank debt.
 ◦ In December, a £100 million four year secured credit agreement was signed by Olympia Exhibitions Holdings Limited.
The Group’s cash and undrawn committed facilities at 31 December 2016 were £556.3 million (31 December 2015: £412.1 million).

Net debt increased by £268.4 million to £847.3 million, principally as a result of further investment in and the acquisition of property.  
As set out in the summary adjusted balance sheet net debt on an IFRS basis was £815.4 million.
The gearing measure most widely used in the industry is loan to value (“LTV”). LTV is calculated on the basis of net debt divided by the 
carrying value of the Group’s property portfolio. The Group focuses most on an LTV measure that includes the notional share of joint 
venture interests but excludes the share of the non-controlling interest. The LTV of 23.4 per cent remains comfortably within the 
Group’s limit of no more than 40 per cent.

Gross debt with interest rate protection 86% 91%
The Group’s policy is to substantially eliminate the medium and long-term risk arising from interest rate volatility. The Group’s 
banking facilities are arranged on a floating rate basis but are generally swapped to fixed rate or capped using derivative contracts.  
At 31 December 2016 the proportion of gross debt with interest rate protection was 86 per cent (31 December 2015: 91 per cent).
Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 42  The Group remains compliant with all of its debt covenants and has substantial levels of headroom against its covenants across all its 
debt facilities. Details of the covenants are included on page 143.
At 31 December 2016 the Group had capital commitments of £156.6 million compared to £206.5 million at 31 December 2015, of which 
Covent Garden represents £74.2 million, Earls Court Properties £64.2 million (including the £45.0 million of CLSA instalments) and 
Lillie Square £18.2 million. The pipeline has been significantly de-risked, for example at Floral Court where approximately 60 per cent of 
the commercial space has been pre-let to Petersham Nurseries, and through over £300 million (£150 million Group share) of pre-sales at 
Lillie Square. On a pro forma basis, not taking into account any property valuation movements or any receipts, expenditure on capital 
commitments would increase the LTV from 23.4 per cent to 27.7 per cent.

Conditional Land Sale Agreement (“CLSA”)
In November 2013 the Group exercised its option under the CLSA, which it entered into with the London Borough of Hammersmith & 
Fulham (“LBHF”), for the purchase of the West Kensington and Gibbs Green housing estates (the “Estates”). The overall consideration 
payable is expected to be £105 million cash plus the planning requirement to provide up to 760 replacement homes.
The CLSA remains unrecognised in the consolidated financial statements of the Group as its main underlying asset (the land relating  
to the Estates) does not currently meet the recognition criteria under IFRS required for investment and development property. Annual 
payments of £15 million commenced in December 2015 and will run through to December 2019. Where amounts are paid prior to the 
transfer of property, they will be carried on the Group’s balance sheet as prepayments against future land draw down. Of the £60 million 
paid to date, £15 million relates to the acquisition of two properties and £45 million is held as a prepayment. The remaining future 
payments totalling £45 million are disclosed as a capital commitment. A transfer from prepayment to investment and development 
property will occur once the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the Group. Once this occurs, in line with the Group’s 
accounting policy, the land will become subject to bi-annual valuation with any changes reflected in the Group’s reported net 
asset measure.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report Financial review continued
Operating cash outflows of £30.6 million, of which £15.0 million relates to the CLSA annual payment, have increased from £22.6 million 
for the year to 31 December 2015 as a result of changes to net working capital requirements.
During the year, £164.0 million was invested at Covent Garden for the purchase of two properties and subsequent expenditure for the 
development of property predominantly at Floral Court. At Earls Court £75.0 million was spent on subsequent expenditure for the 
construction of Lillie Square Phase 1 and the demolition of the Earls Court Exhibition Centres.
Net sales proceeds from property and investments comprise the disposal of three residential units at The Beecham, Covent Garden and 
five residential units at Lillie Square, net of sales and marketing fees. Marketing fees include costs for units that have not yet completed.
Net borrowings drawn during the year were £239.7 million. Refinancing activities and purchase of derivatives resulted in a cash outflow 
of £9.6 million.
Dividends paid of £7.5 million reflect the final dividend payment made in respect of the 2015 financial year and the 2016 interim dividend 
paid in September. This was lower than the previous year due to a higher take up of the scrip dividend alternative, 41 per cent versus 
38 per cent in 2015.

statement was presented on a proportionate consolidation basis.

3. Non-controlling interest represents Tf L’s 37 per cent share of ECPL.
Income
Net rental income has increased by £6.6 million (7.8 per cent like-for-like) during the year as a result of strong performances at Covent 
Garden and Olympia London.
(Loss)/gain on revaluation and sale of investment and development property
The loss on revaluation and sale of the Group’s investment and development property was £124.8 million. Covent Garden recorded a gain 
on revaluation of £126.1 million as a result of rental growth. The loss on revaluation at Earls Court of £247.2 million reflects the valuers’ 
assessment of the weakened sentiment and corrections in the central London residential market with the major contributors being 
market uncertainty following the result of the EU Referendum and the increase in SDLT.
Administration expenses
Administration expenses have decreased by £2.0 million due to a reduction in performance related employment costs, which have been 
partly offset by an increase in establishment costs. It is expected that there will be further reduction in administration expenses as 
efficiency initiatives are pursued.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs have decreased by 3.0 per cent to £19.5 million, with a lower weighted average cost of debt offsetting an increased level 
of net debt.
Taxation
The total tax credit is made up of both underlying tax and non-underlying tax and for the year is £10.9 million. This credit predominantly 
arises from the loss on revaluation of the Group’s investment and development property at Earls Court.
Tax on underlying profits of the Group was £2.4 million, which reflects a rate in line with the current rate of UK corporation tax being 
20 per cent. Following the enactment of Finance (No. 2) Act 2015 and Finance Act 2016 the corporation tax rate will reduce to 19 per cent 
from April 2017 and 17 per cent from April 2020.

Taxation continued
Contingent tax, the amount of tax that would become payable on a theoretical disposal of all investment property held by the Group, 
was £nil (31 December 2015: £17.6 million). A disposal of the Group’s trading property at market value would result in a corporation tax 
charge to the Group of £9.6 million (20 per cent of £48.1 million).
The provisions of IAS 12 provide for the recognition of a deferred tax asset where it is probable there will be future taxable profit against 
which a deductible temporary difference can be utilised. As a result of the application of this provision, the Group has not recognised the 
deferred tax asset on decreases to the carrying value of investment property and certain losses carried forward.
The Group’s tax policy, which has been approved by the Board and has been disclosed to HM Revenue & Customs, is aligned with the 
business strategy. The Group seeks to protect shareholder value by structuring operations in a tax efficient manner, with external advice 
as appropriate, which complies with all relevant tax law and regulations and does not adversely impact our reputation as a responsible 
taxpayer. As a Group, we are committed to acting in an open and transparent manner.
Consistent with the Group’s policy of complying with relevant tax obligations and its goal in respect of its stakeholders, the Group 
maintains a constructive and open working relationship with HM Revenue & Customs which regularly includes obtaining advance 
clearance on key transactions where the tax treatment may be uncertain.
Dividends
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 1.0 pence per share to be paid on 31 May 2017 to shareholders on the register at 21 April 2017. 
Subject to SARB approval, a scrip dividend alternative will be offered. Together with the interim dividend paid in September this brings 
the total dividend for the year to 1.5 pence per share.
Going concern
At 31 December 2016 the Group’s cash and undrawn committed facilities were £556.3 million and its capital commitments were 
£156.6 million. With weighted average debt maturity of nearly six years, LTV of 23.4 per cent and sufficient headroom against all 
financial covenants, there continues to be a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group will have adequate resources to  
meet both ongoing and future commitments over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
Accordingly, the Directors have prepared the 2016 Annual Report & Accounts on a going concern basis.

KEY FACTS
The Company’s Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) strategy remains at the heart of what we do and 
our programme of activities ensures that Capco is making a positive social and environmental 
impact in the Capital.
Our programme of community outreach reflects our desire to improve key social problems in 
London, namely youth employment, homelessness and the support of ex-military personnel.  
As responsible stewards of leading London estates, enhancement of the environment is an 
important priority across the Group.
We are committed to providing the highest standards of health and safety at our assets and for  
our employees and expect our suppliers to support us in achieving this commitment. 
CR activity across the business is driven by the operational committees that focus on 
environmental and community strategy and report to the CR Executive Committee.
Our talented people are at the core of our success and we continue to develop people by building 
individual careers in order to further embed our entrepreneurial culture.
We report on performance against our key targets for 2016 in this report and further information 
can be found on our website.

TALENT
Our aim is to manage talent effectively and ensure that we have 
sufficient capability to realise our ambitious strategy . We regularly 
undertake succession planning exercises to review the talent 
pipeline and progress individuals according to capability .
We recruit top graduates each year who pursue an internal 
programme of training and mentoring, which will ensure they  
are well prepared for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors 
(“RICS”) Assessment of Professional Competence (“APC”).  
Each graduate is assigned an experienced Capco counsellor  
and supervisor who guides them through the APC process.
New opportunities that arise in the business are advertised 
internally and we aim to promote internal candidates in order  
to enhance career development and encourage mobility across the 
company . We have extended our approach to induction to include 
transition coaching to those in new roles.
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
Capco training and development programmes are designed  
to augment the bench strength of our teams and challenge  
aspiring leaders.
Individual training and development needs are identified and 
discussed at performance review meetings with line managers. 
During 2016, our employees spent 462 hours on training activity .
Through our sponsorship of individuals undertaking further 
professional qualifications, we encourage continuous learning, 
reflecting our intention to create a knowledgeable environment.
In order to promote knowledge transfer across the Company ,  
we run a series of ‘lunch and learn’ sessions, where business  
leaders showcase their strategy to other employees, in order  
to enhance understanding of wider business objectives.
We recognise that coaching and mentoring can have significant 
impact on behaviours and key staff continue to benefit from 
bespoke coaching programmes.
PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
Annual performance objectives for individuals are agreed at 
performance review meetings which take place at the beginning  
of the calendar year. Performance is measured against objectives  
set for the previous year and individual performance ratings 
underpin discretionary bonus awards which are paid in April  
of each year.
We regard the giving of regular and direct feedback as a core 
competency of effective leadership and encourage line managers  
to appraise performance regularly during the year.
PEOPLE
People are the key to our success and we are proud 
of our team ethos and results oriented approach.
We aim to develop careers by promoting talented 
individuals to positions of leadership.
Benefits
We engaged a new pension provider, giving staff access  
to enhanced tools for their pension arrangements.

component of business success, we ran a series of manager 
toolkit sessions which received positive feedback across  
the business.
Graduate intake
We continue to hand pick top graduates to join our 
development programme and enjoy the challenge of  
early responsibility .
2016 ACHIEVEMENTS

graduates and the on-going extension of the graduate 
development programme to preserve our talent pipeline.
Leadership capability
We will further enhance the capability of the leadership team 
through mentoring and a series of internally delivered 
bespoke workshops.
OUR COMMITMENTS IN 2017
CULTURE
The high performance culture at Capco is reflective of our 
ambitious and innovative business strategy . Typically , Capco people 
are results-driven and brave in their approach to new ideas. Many of 
our people are in new roles and have assumed increased levels of 
responsibility since joining Capco.
We have a good track record of supporting staff development and 
promoting from within the business. We aim to fill vacancies from 
our existing people where possible.
We support new parents returning to the workplace and encourage 
our people to adopt a healthy attitude to work-life balance.
DIVERSITY
We believe that every person in the Company has a part to play in 
generating value and we understand fully the benefits of a diverse 
workforce. Diversity is considered when making appointments  
at all levels. As a sign of our commitment to diversity in the work 
place we have signed up to the RICS Inclusive Employer Quality 
Mark and we work with peer companies to promote diversity and 
equal opportunities within the property sector.
We are keen to develop female talent across the business and 
provide mentoring to management. We are proud that 50 per cent 
of the senior management team are female. A summary of gender 
diversity across the Company is set out on page 50.

BENEFITS
In addition to core elements, we reward people with an attractive 
package of additional benefits.
Our competitive package of benefits includes private medical 
insurance and also covers dental treatment. The Company 
contributes up to 10 per cent of salary into the MyCapco  
pension scheme.
Our policy is to enable employees to take their full annual leave 
entitlement of 28 days per annum, rising to 30 days after four  
years’ service.
LIFESTYLE PROGRAMME
The lifestyle programme continued during 2016 with sessions  
on the importance of balanced nutrition and further information 
on financial matters such as mortgages and financial planning.
REWARD
The aim of our reward strategy is to compensate people for  
high performance and to incentivise them to strive to improve.
Core compensation packages at Capco comprise three elements  
of base salary , discretionary performance bonus and discretionary 
share awards.
We regularly benchmark our approach to reward to ensure that  
we remain competitive in the market and we aim to remain within 
the upper quartile range of our sector.
Awards are made in April of each year and take account of 
performance ratings discussed at performance review meetings  
in January .
All Capco employees are eligible to receive share awards  
so that everyone can participate in the success of the Company . 
These awards have a three-year performance period and are  
subject to corporate performance conditions.
HUMAN RIGHTS
This report does not contain specific information on human rights 
issues as this is not considered necessary for an understanding of 
the development, performance or position of the Company’s 
business. However, Capco has adopted a CR policy and a supply 
chain policy which reflect a responsible approach to human rights.
MODERN SLAVERY
In accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Board has 
approved a Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement 
which has been published on our website. The statement details  
the steps we take to avoid slavery and human trafficking in our  
own operations and in our supply chain. We believe that our own 
operations present minimal risk, but recognise that a higher level 
of risk is posed by the suppliers we engage with to provide goods 
and services. In 2016 we undertook to review our suppliers in order 
to establish any areas of risk. In the year ahead we plan to update 
relevant policies to include specific reference to modern slavery  
and we will continue to raise awareness by engaging with our 
supply chain and our employees.

SUPPORTING LOCAL ECONOMIES
Workplace Coordinators recruitment breakfast
In January 2016, Capco sponsored a breakfast for local businesses, 
jointly hosted by Councillor Astaire from Westminster City 
Council, promoting both the Recruit London initiative and  
an apprenticeship scheme run by FM Conway , Westminster’s 
maintenance supplier. Capco has supported Westminster City 
Council in the employment of a Workplace Coordinator under the 
Recruit London scheme who has successfully placed 32 candidates, 
including 11 long-term unemployed, all of whom live in Westminster.
District stewardship
The Covent Garden team took part in the cleaning of the district  
in August. Each team member spent two hours with a member  
of the cleaning team picking up litter, emptying bins, cleaning 
pavements or removing chewing gum. The Lord Mayor of 
Westminster joined Andy Hicks, Estate Director, to clean King 
Street and help launch the new heritage style cleaners’ uniform. 
Our cleaning teams continue to supplement Westminster City 
Council’s street cleaning activities throughout the district.
COMMUNITY
During 2016, Capco continued to work to benefit 
the communities in which we operate and  
to support our chosen charities. Capco staff 
committed a total of 882 hours to CR related 
activity (against a target of 450 hours) and 
volunteered to help with CR projects.
Benefiting the communities in which our assets  
are located is the cornerstone of the stewardship  
of our estates.
Local initiatives
We have delivered a range of local community and education  
projects on our estates that have benefited people of all ages.
Charitable donations
This year we have developed close ties with our chosen 
charities which align with our overarching CR strategy , and 
have provided £156,000 of support to charitable causes.
Staff CR engagement
Capco staff remain committed to participating in CR related 
activities and undertook 882 hours of CR related activity 
during the year.
2016 ACHIEVEMENTS
Capco continues to fund additional security teams patrolling the 
estate following an increase in the national security threat level. 
This includes 24 hour monitoring of CCTV and extensive  
patrolling of the estate throughout the day and night.
Working with Westminster City Council, Capco initiated the 
pedestrianisation of King Street in Covent Garden. Businesses have 
seen an increase in trade and we hope that by removing vehicles 
during trading hours there will be an improvement in air quality 
and the environment for residents and visitors.
Apple Market Challenge
A total of 10 primary schools took part in this year’s challenge  
to design a product that could be sold in the Apple Market in the 
Covent Garden Market Building. The finalists visited the Apple 
Market to meet traders and then present their ideas to a panel of 
judges. This year’s winner was St Clement Danes School with their 
multi-function designer glasses incorporating tourist information. 
Santa made a surprise visit to hand out the prizes.
Apprenticeships
We will continue to identify opportunities for apprenticeships 
for local young people across our assets and encourage our 
contractors to support this initiative.
Education programme
We will extend the number of schools that participate in the 
Capco Education Programme, building further on our success 
with school children of all ages.
Charitable work
We will promote a volunteering programme with Bishop 
Creighton House, an active community-based charity in  
Earls Court, working with disadvantaged people of all ages.
We will encourage employees to engage in CR initiatives  
and contribute 500 employee hours to supporting CR  
related projects.

EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMES
The Fulham Primary School project explored how the Earls Court 
development would impact children in the future. The children 
explored the history of the Earls Court development and visited  
the Lillie Square marketing suite and show apartments, discussing 
the details of the project with a Capco representative. Their work 
was presented at Hammersmith and Fulham Town Hall.
During the Fulham Boys School project, the students were able  
to become familiar with real life case studies of changing urban 
landscapes and visited the Lillie Square construction site.
In the summer of 2016, we worked with Year 4 at Sir John Lillie 
Primary School and Year 5 at Bousfield Primary School. At Sir John 
Lillie Primary School, the pupils learned about the history of 
Normand Park and the Clem Attlee Estate, and the Bousfield 
Primary School project focused on learning about the plans  
for Earls Court. The children visited Earls Court and carried  
out shop and traffic surveys.
The Little Architect project continued in 2016, working with  
St Joseph’s Primary School, Covent Garden and Queens Manor 
Primary School, Fulham. The aim of the project was to foster 
enjoyment in the built environment at an early age.
Capco once again co-hosted the Sir Simon Milton

Enabling Enterprise for Year 5 pupils from Wendell Park Primary 
School in Hammersmith. The students researched and created 
plans for the renovation of a fictitious town within budgetary 
constraints and Capco volunteers assisted with the facilitation  
of the session.
We collaborated with the Urban Land Institute on their Urban  
Plan Project which introduced students to the various market and 
non-market forces involved in the built environment industry . 
Working in teams, students formed a property development 
company and responded to a brief to redevelop a blighted site.  
The first project was based at Fulham College. www.capitalandcounties.com 53

ENVIRONMENT
Capco aims to minimise the impact of our 
operations on the environment. We apply  
a responsible and forward-looking approach  
to environmental issues and the principles  
of sustainability .
ENERGY & CARBON
We met our target to reduce energy use by 3 per cent on a like- 
for-like basis compared to 2015. Implementing energy efficiency 
measures has contributed towards meeting our target, including 
installing new efficient lighting at a number of assets in Covent 
Garden and recommissioning energy controls at Olympia London.
To minimise our carbon impact, we have taken steps to  
purchase electricity through green energy tariffs where possible.  
At Covent Garden, we have in place our first green gas tariff,  
where biogas is sourced through our supplier from processes  
such as anaerobic digestion. 
We monitor assets with an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) 
lower than an E rating. Although many of our assets are listed  
and exempt from the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards,  
we are regularly reviewing opportunities to improve energy 
efficiency and to lower tenant energy bills.
WASTE & WATER MANAGEMENT
Across our estates, we have continued to drive improvements in 
recycling and achieved zero operational non-hazardous waste to 
landfill at Olympia London, the Covent Garden estate and our 
15 Grosvenor Street office.
A key focus in 2016 has been developing a waste consolidation 
strategy for the Covent Garden estate. By engaging with tenants 
and employees, we have made a strong start by lowering waste 
vehicle collections, improving street cleanliness and recycling  
rates. We will continue our consolidation activities in 2017 .
We continue to monitor water consumption across our estates  
and are committed to installing water efficient equipment during 
refurbishment works and in new assets. We recognise that our  
main opportunity to influence water efficiency in the longer term  
is by designing for water efficiency . 
Reduced energy use by 3 per cent compared to 2015 on a

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, Capco continues to monitor and 
report on the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its operations. We have used DEFRA Environmental Reporting Guidelines and  
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to calculate emissions. We have adopted the operational 
control consolidation method, as this reflects where we have the ability to influence energy use, and we have set a materiality threshold  
of 5 per cent for greenhouse gas reporting purposes.
Capco has engaged with Carbon Credentials Energy Services Limited to provide independent verification of the 2016 greenhouse gas 
emissions assertion in accordance with industry recognised standard ISO14064-3.

RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT
Capco is committed to integrating responsible and sustainable 
practices into the delivery of our projects and development. In  
2016 we launched our Sustainability Framework that sets out our 
approach to embedding sustainability principles into the design 
and construction of our developments. Notable achievements  
this year include attaining BREEAM Very Good certification for  
the refurbishment of a Grade II listed retail unit 38 King Street, 
installing our first solar panels at 26-27 Southampton Street and 
installing our first rainwater harvesting system at Lillie Square.  
At Floral Court and Lillie Square, we continue to work towards 
achieving a minimum of BREEAM Very Good and Code for 
Sustainable Homes Level 4 certification.
On-site projects are participants in the Considerate Constructors 
Scheme and in 2016 Lillie Square scored an exemplary 45 out of  
50, which puts the site in the top 1 per cent of all participating 
construction sites in the country . We continue to meet our target  
to divert at least 85 per cent of waste from landfill and at the Earls 
Court demolition site we have achieved 99 per cent diversion rate  
to date.
Capco remains an active member of the UK Green Building Council, 
participating in the creation of the Council’s new guidance on 
embodied carbon in development.
SUSTAINABILITY INDICES
We monitor and report our performance in line with industry 
sustainability benchmarks. In 2016 we remained a participant in  
the FTSE4Good Index and responded to the CDP Climate Change 
Programme, achieving a B rating. To further our reporting, we 
participated in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark 
and achieved a Green Star rating. We are also reporting in line with 
EPRA Sustainability Best Practice Recommendations. For more

OUR COMMITMENTS IN 2017
MILESTONES
2016 saw a number of key project milestones safely accomplished  
in partnership with our contractors, including the completion  
of the main demolition works at Earls Court and significant works 
carried out at Floral Court, Covent Garden. The completion of  
the first phase of residential units at Lillie Square accomplished  
the significant milestone of achieving two million man hours 
worked without a RIDDOR reportable incident.
Three of our development projects won Bronze awards at the 
Considerate Constructors Scheme 2016 National Awards ceremony 
in London. The winning projects were Lillie Square Phase 1 at  
Earls Court, and Floral Court and 23/24 Henrietta Street at Covent 
Garden. In May 2016 Olympia London undertook the British Safety 
Council 5* Audit programme and was awarded all five stars with  
an overall compliance score of 92 per cent.
GOVERNANCE
At a Group level the reinvigorated governance and reporting 
framework was fully implemented during 2016 with Sector Safety 
Leadership Teams (“SSLT”s) established for each asset, overseen by 
the Group Safety Leadership Team (“GSLT”), which is chaired by 
our General Counsel and championed by the Managing Director 
and Chief Investment Officer.
The GSLT continued to regularly review the health and safety 
performance across the Group during the year and facilitated  
the sharing of lessons learnt and best practice across the 
management team.
The Board continues to take a keen interest in health and  
safety risks and achievements across the Group, receiving  
regular formal reports on health and safety , summarising  
health and safety performance.
As well as updating our governance and reporting framework,  
the overarching Occupational Health and Safety Management 
System has also been reviewed and updated to create better 
alignment to OHSAS 18001.
Our resilience to respond to incidents was enhanced during 2016 
with specific health and safety incident response plans being 
integrated into the Group-wide business continuity and major 
incident response planning processes. Scenario based desk top 
exercises were held at each asset to familiarise the major incident 
response teams with the enhanced plans.
Reporting
No work related fatalities were recorded in 2016. There was  
a total of 11 RIDDOR reportable injuries reported across the Group 
during 2016. Five RIDDOR incidents on the Covent Garden estate 
were reported, all caused by slips and trips involving members of 
the public. At Olympia London there were three RIDDOR incidents 
reported, two involving event contractor employees and one 
involving an event exhibitor employee.
There were three RIDDOR reportable injuries recorded involving 
contractor employees on Capco development projects. The Accident 
Frequency Rate (AFR) for Capco development projects at the end  
of 2016 stood at 0.13 and the Lost Time Incident Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR) for 2016 was 0.35.
Training
Members of operational management have attended the Institution 
of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) Directing Safely course 
and delivery of the IOSH Managing Safely course to the property 
and project management teams commenced in 2016.

Corporate governance report
OUR GOVERNANCE 
FRAMEWORK
“ A governance framework that supports the 
achievement of Capco’ s strategic objectives.”
Ian Durant, Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2016 Corporate  
Governance Report.
The geopolitical climate of 2016 resulted in a challenging  
year for Capco, and the economic environment continues to  
be uncertain. Against this backdrop the importance of a robust 
governance framework comes to the fore, and I am pleased to 
confirm that Capco’s system of controls and reporting, which  
is overseen by the Board, continues to ensure the Company 
operates effectively .
In this report, and the Committee reports that follow, we 
explain the operation of Capco’s Board and its Committees, and 
how the Company applied the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code during the year. We also provide information 
on some of the management committees that strengthen the 
controls and reporting framework across the Group. During the 
year, with increased construction and demolition activity across 
the business, the Board paid particular attention to health and 
safety . There was also a continued focus on risk management  
to ensure that the alignment of risk and strategy remains 
appropriate in the changing market environment.
In anticipation of the introduction of the new Market Abuse 
Regulations, a Disclosure Committee was established to oversee 
the Company’s compliance with the new regulations.
The main matter considered by the Nomination Committee 
during 2016 was the appointment of a new Chief Financial 
Officer following Soumen Das’ departure from the Company  
at the end of the year. Descriptions of the recruitment process 
followed when appointing Situl Jobanputra and the tailored 
inductions that we provide to new Directors are included in  
the Nomination Committee report from page 67 .
The Board regularly reviews its composition to ensure  
the Directors continue to have an appropriate mix of skills  
and experience to deliver Capco’s strategic goals, and a clear 
succession plan is being prepared. During 2016 Ian Henderson 
retired from the Board, and we welcomed Anthony Steains as a 
new independent Non-executive Director. Anthony’s corporate 
finance career in Asia brings a diverse perspective to the Board’s 
discussions. As I reported last year, the Board would like to 
appoint an additional Non-executive Director with a property 
background, and we will seek to make an appointment when  
an opportunity arises.
As in previous years, all of the Directors will be seeking  
election or re-election at our AGM. This year, Andrew Strang, 
Henry Staunton and Graeme Gordon will each have served  
on the Board for more than six years. Accordingly , before 
recommending that they be reappointed, the Nomination 
Committee gave particular consideration to the continued 
contribution of each Director and the balance of independence 
of the Board.
Gerry Murphy became Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee during the year, and has led the Committee in  
a review of executive remuneration. Details of the proposed 
simplified remuneration policy which is aligned with 
shareholder interests, and includes a new single performance 
share plan, are included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
from page 70.
As we move into 2017 , the economic and political conditions 
remain uncertain, however I am confident that Capco’s Board 
and governance structures provide a sound base for Capco to 
respond to the challenges and opportunities ahead.
Ian Durant
Chairman

STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE  
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The Company has applied the principles and complied with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
during 2016. www.capitalandcounties.com 59 
Financial statements Strategic report Governance
THE BOARD
The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success  
of the Company , and for its leadership, strategy , values, standards, 
control and management. Day-to-day management of the Group  
is delegated to the Executive Directors, subject to formal delegated 
authority limits; however, certain matters have been reserved for 
Board approval. These matters are reviewed annually and include 
Board and Committee composition, strategy , significant funding 
decisions and corporate transactions, delegated authority limits 
and dividend policy .
Board composition
As at 31 December 2016, the Board comprised the Chairman, three 
Executive Directors and six Non-executive Directors. The table on 
page 60 summarises the membership of the Board and Committees.
Biographies of each of the Directors, which include information  
on their skills and experience, can be found on pages 56 and 57 .
Board independence
The Code requires that, excluding the Chairman, at least half of  
the Board should comprise Non-executive Directors determined  
to be independent.
The Board has considered the independence of the Non-executive 
Directors, including potential conflicts of interest, and the table  
on page 60 sets out those Directors considered to be independent  
in character and judgement. Each of these Directors has also 
confirmed that there is no reason why they should not continue  
to be considered independent.
In considering Director independence, the Board concluded that 
Directors’ tenure should be counted from the date of their first 
election by shareholders to the Capco Board.
The key responsibilities of Board members are set out in the table on page 61.
THE BOARD IN 2016
The Board met formally throughout the year with main meetings 
timed around the financial calendar, and additional meetings 
convened to consider specific matters as required. Attendance  
at Board and Committee meetings held during 2016 is shown  
on page 60.
The annual Board calendar includes a two-day strategy meeting.  
At this meeting the Board receives detailed updates from external 
advisers and the business units, and is able to consider strategic 
issues in depth, and spend time with members of senior 
management in a less formal environment.
Board papers are circulated a week in advance of meetings to ensure 
that Directors have sufficient time to consider their content prior  
to the meeting. If matters require approval at short notice, written 
approval is sought from the Directors.
The Chairman meets regularly with the Non-executive Directors 
without the Executive Directors being present and maintains 
regular contact with both the Chief Executive and members  
of senior management.
As matters that require the Board’s decision are often large, 
complex and evolve over a period of time, informal update 
meetings are held between Board meetings to allow Board 
members adequate time to explore, understand and challenge 
matters under consideration. These are often combined with site 
visits and provide an opportunity for the Non-executive Directors 
to meet senior management. Four such updates were held during 
2016, including a presentation on health and safety matters.
During 2016, the Board received regular asset, financial and 
performance updates from the Executive Directors and reports 
from the Company Secretary , General Counsel, Director of  
HR & CR and Committee Chairmen. The table below shows  
the key areas considered by the Board during the year.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees to enable the Board to operate effectively and ensure  
a strong governance framework for decision making.
Each Committee has written terms of reference which were 
reviewed during the year. The terms of reference can be viewed  
on the Company’s website www.capitalandcounties.com. Minutes 
of all Committee meetings are made available to all Directors.  
The Committee Chairmen attend the AGM to answer any  
questions on the Committees’ activities. 
A number of management committees support the business  
in delivering its strategy .
A summary of the role of each Committee is shown on page 60, and the activity  
of each Committee during 2016 is described on pages 64 to 88.

covered the safety culture at Capco, the role of the Board, 
Directors’ duties in respect of health and safety , relevant 
legislation, governance and reporting.
The Directors found the refresher training beneficial,  
and hearing the details of Capco’s highlights for 2016 and 
priorities for the coming year brought to life the matters 
covered in the regular health and safety updates included  
in the Board papers.
You can read more about Health & Safety at Capco in the Corporate

ENSURING AN EFFECTIVE BOARD
Recognising that Capco’s Board must be effective, the Board 
conducts an annual evaluation of its own performance and that of 
its Committees and Directors. In 2016 the evaluation was externally 
facilitated by NJMD Corporate Services Limited (“NJMD”), which 
provides no other services to the Group. The Directors and Company 
Secretary were each asked to complete a questionnaire covering all 
matters relating to the performance of the Board, its Committees 
and its Directors, following which each participant was interviewed 
by NJMD with comments being noted on a confidential basis.  
A report was prepared by NJMD which concluded that the Board  
is effectively run and administered and the Board appears to have an 
open and honest culture reflecting the values held by the Company .
The report made a number of recommendations, although no  
areas of major concern were found. The outcomes of the evaluation 
were considered by the Board and a Board action plan for 2017  
was agreed.
In addition, the Senior Independent Director conducted an 
appraisal of the Chairman’s performance which confirmed the 
Board’s continued confidence in the Chairman and outlined  
areas for future focus. The Chairman also undertook appraisals  
of the other Directors’ performance.
COMMUNICATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS
Our policy
The Board is keen to ensure that our shareholders and potential 
investors have a good understanding of Capco’s business  
and performance, and that Directors are aware of any issues  
and concerns which shareholders may have. The Company 
communicates with stakeholders in a number of ways:
Corporate website
Our corporate website www.capitalandcounties.com allows  
visitors to access Company information, annual reports, results 
presentations and webcasts. The site also includes links to our 
business unit websites and contact details for shareholder queries.
Annual General Meeting
Our AGM allows the Board to update our shareholders on Capco’s 
progress, and provides an opportunity for shareholders to pose 
questions to the Directors, and meet senior executives.
Shareholders are encouraged to vote on the resolutions put to  
the meeting, either in person, online or by submitting a proxy card.  
We publish the results of the votes on all resolutions on our website 
following the meeting.
Our 2017 AGM will be held on Friday 5 May 2017 . The notice of 
Annual General Meeting will be issued to shareholders at least  
20 working days before the meeting. Separate resolutions will  
be proposed on each issue and, in accordance with the Code,  
each Director will offer themselves for election or re-election.
The Chairman, Chairmen of the Board Committees and other 
Directors will be available at the AGM to meet shareholders  
and answer any questions.
Should shareholders have any concerns that they are unable to 
successfully resolve following communication with the Chairman, 
Chief Executive or Chief Financial Officer, they may raise them 
through the Senior Independent Director.
ACTIONS FOR 2017
 ◦ Ensure Board agendas allow effective 
strategic discussion
 ◦ Document approach to succession and 
continue to consider Board diversity
 ◦ Periodically review past Board decisions
The Chairman and Company Secretary considered the approach to be taken for the 2016 Board Evaluation

Communications with shareholders and other stakeholders
Communication with the Company’s investors is a priority for  
the Board. The Company runs an extensive investor relations 
programme, and the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and 
Director of Investor Relations hold meetings with institutional 
investors throughout the year, including results presentations, 
webcasts, road shows, one-to-one meetings and investor tours.
The Company’s major shareholders are encouraged to meet with 
the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director to discuss  
any matters they may wish to raise. During 2016, the Chairman  
and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee held a number  
of meetings with shareholders, in connection with the review  
of executive remuneration.
The Directors receive regular updates on the Company’s major 
shareholders, and receive reports on shareholder feedback at  
each Board meeting. The Non-executive Directors are invited  
to attend the Company’s results presentations.
Private shareholders may raise questions through the  
Company Secretary’s office either by telephone or by email 
(feedback@capitalandcounties.com).
The Company maintains active relations with community 
stakeholders.
Please see pages 51 and 52 in the CR Report for more details of Capco’s  
stakeholder engagement.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND  
TIME COMMITMENTS
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to 
authorise potential conflicts of interest that may arise. The Board 
has adopted a procedure under which Directors must notify the 
Chairman of any potential conflicts. The Chairman then decides 
whether a conflict exists and recommends its authorisation by  
the Board where appropriate. In cases where there is a potential 
conflict of interest, an appropriate protocol to be followed where  
a conflict of interest may arise is agreed. In addition, a Director who 
had a conflict of interest would not be counted in the quorum or 
entitled to vote when the Board considered the matter in which the 
Director had an interest. The interests of new Directors are reviewed 
during the recruitment process and, if appropriate, authorised by  
the Board on appointment.
On appointment, and each subsequent year, Non-executive Directors 
are required to confirm in writing that they have sufficient time to 
devote to the Company’s affairs. In addition, they are required to seek 
prior approval from the Chairman before taking on any additional 
external commitments which may affect their time available to 
devote to the Company , and the Board is advised of any changes.
The Chairman is also Chairman of Greggs plc. The Board is satisfied 
that the Chairman’s additional commitments allow him to devote 
sufficient time to perform his duties as Chairman of Capco.
The Board is satisfied that all Non-executive Directors are 
contributing effectively to the operation of the Board. 
DTR DISCLOSURE
The disclosures required under DTR 7 .2 of the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules are contained in this report, and the Audit 
Committee and Nomination Committee Reports, except for 
information required under DTR 7 .2.6 which is contained in  
the Directors’ Report on pages 89 and 90. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 64 
Audit Committee report
The Audit Committee, reporting to the Board, oversees the financial 
reporting process, monitors the effectiveness of internal control, 
internal audit, risk management and the statutory audit and 
monitors the independence of the statutory auditors and the 
provision of non-audit services. As at 31 December 2016 and the  
date of this report, the Committee comprises three independent 
Non-executive Directors and is chaired by Henry Staunton who  
is considered to have significant, recent and relevant financial 
experience. The Board believes that the Committee as a whole  
has competence in real estate matters.
The Committee’s meetings were also attended by the Company’s 
Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, General 
Counsel, Company Secretary and Financial Controller together 
with senior representatives of the external and internal auditors.
The valuers and members of senior management, including the 
Director of Finance, attended by invitation to present reports 
required for the Committee to discharge its responsibilities.
The Audit Committee met three times during 2016. Attendance  
at these meetings is shown in the table on page 63. The Committee 
also met privately during the year with both the external and 
internal auditors.
The Committee follows an annual programme, which is  
agreed with the Committee Chair, management and external 
auditors prior to each financial year, and ensures it gives thorough 
consideration to matters of particular importance to the Company , 
and additional matters are considered when appropriate. The 
Committee’s 2016 agenda is shown in the table on the next page, 
and the significant matters considered by the Committee during 
the year are also explained on the next page.
During the year, as part of the Financial Reporting Council’s 
(“FRC”) normal cycle of reviews, the Group received a letter from 
the FRC arising from their review of the Group’s 2015 annual report 
and accounts. No significant issues were identified and the enquiry 
was concluded by the inclusion of enhanced disclosure in this year’s 
Annual Report and Accounts.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
taken as a whole, the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy . 
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2016 Audit Committee 
Report. The Committee plays a key oversight role for the Board, 
monitoring and reviewing all aspects of the Group’s financial 
reporting, internal controls and risk management procedures.
This report provides an overview of the work undertaken  
by the Committee in the past year. During 2016, the most 
significant topics considered by the Committee included the 
Group’s property valuations, taxation and the accounting 
treatment of various significant corporate transactions.  
The Committee also reviewed the updated risk disclosures  
and the viability statement disclosure before they were 
recommended to the Board.
Finally , following consideration of the matters reviewed during 
the year and the Group’s significant risks, the Committee 
concluded, and made a recommendation to the Board that,

EXTERNAL AUDITORS
Committee Responsibilities
The Committee oversees the relationship with 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), the external auditors,  
and is responsible for developing, implementing and monitoring  
the Company’s policy on external audit, and for monitoring the 
auditors’ independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical, 
professional and regulatory requirements. The external auditors 
are not permitted to perform any work that they may subsequently 
need to audit or which might either create a conflict of interest  
or affect the auditors’ objectivity and independence.
Access to Committee
The external auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee 
Chairman should they wish to raise any concerns outside formal 
Committee meetings.
Effectiveness of Auditors
The Committee monitored PwC’s effectiveness and performance 
during 2016, and considered a paper prepared by the Financial 
Controller which confirmed that in management’s view PwC  
were providing a good-quality audit service and continued  
to deliver against all facilities considered at their appointment.
The Committee is satisfied that the external auditors remain 
independent and objective and that the Group is receiving a robust 
and challenging objective audit and has therefore recommended  
to the Board that PwC be reappointed in 2017 .
Tendering of External Audit Contract
Capco tendered its external audit contract in 2010, and PwC  
were appointed as Group auditors on an annual rolling contract. 
The Directors plan to complete an audit tender by 2020, the date  
by which the external audit contract must be tendered to comply 
with regulatory requirements, unless issues are identified which 
require a tender to be undertaken earlier. This is in the best interest 
of the Company’s members because it will ensure continuity of 
service from the external auditors.
The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 –  
statement of compliance
The Company confirms that it complied with the provisions of the 
Competition and Markets Authority’s Order for the financial year 
under review.
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CONSIDERED BY THE COMMITTEE IN 2016
Matter considered What the Committee did
Valuations As in previous years, the independent external valuers presented the year end and half year valuations to the Committee  
at the February and July meetings respectively. The Committee reviewed the valuation process and component parts  
of the valuations, discussed the valuations with the external auditors and challenged the valuers on the assumptions used. 
The Committee also advised the Board on the independence of the valuers and obtained confirmation that management 
had provided all requested information. The Committee was satisfied that the approach taken by the valuers was 
appropriate. Further information can be found in note 14 on pages 115 to 118 of the notes to the accounts.
Tax The Director of Finance presented a report to the Committee at the February and July meetings, explained the basis of  
the Group’s tax position, identified key taxation risks to the Group and updated the Committee on the ongoing relationship 
with HMRC. The Committee challenged the assumptions made in arriving at the tax position and discussed with the external 
auditors the assumptions and judgements made in arriving at the deferred tax position. The Committee was satisfied that  
the policy was appropriate for the Group. Further information can be found in note 26 on page 129 of the notes  
to the accounts.
Significant  
and complex 
transactions
As in previous years, the Committee received updates from the Financial Controller on significant and complex transactions 
at each meeting. With regard to each transaction, such as the CLSA, the Solum joint venture and the Olympia strategic 
review, the Committee discussed the accounting treatments with management and the external auditors and is satisfied  
that the appropriate approach has been taken. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 66 
Non-Audit Services
Non-audit services are normally limited to assignments that are 
closely related to the annual audit or where the work is of such  
a nature that a detailed understanding of the Group is necessary .
The Company has adopted a policy to ensure that the provision  
of non-audit services by the external auditor does not compromise 
its independence or objectivity . The policy requires the Audit 
Committee Chairman to pre-approve any non-audit work with  
a cost exceeding the lower of £50,000 or 15 per cent of the estimated 
annual level of the auditor’s fees at that time. Services below this 
limit are pre-approved by the Audit Committee under the policy , 
subject to consideration and approval by an Executive Director. 
Approval is only given following a full and thorough assessment  
of the value case for using the auditor and the skills and experience 
the auditor would bring. Additionally , consideration must be given 
to the preservation of auditor independence; and the external 
auditors are required to confirm that they are acting independently 
and are not:
 ◦ auditing their own work;
 ◦ making management decisions for the Company;
 ◦ creating a mutuality of interest;
 ◦ developing close personal relationships with the Company’s 
personnel; or
 ◦ acting in the role of advocate for the Company .
The Committee is satisfied that the policy remains effective.
The total fees paid and payable to PwC in 2016 were £464,000,  
of which £14,000 related to non-audit work. These fees primarily 
relate to corporate transactions and verification of performance 
against share scheme performance conditions. The total fees paid 
and payable to PwC in 2016 and 2015 are set out in the table below.
2016 2015
Total fees paid to PwC £464,000 £454,000
Non-audit fees £14,000 £14,000
Ratio of non-audit fees 3.0% 3.1%
INTERNAL AUDITOR
Internal Audit Plan
BDO LLP (“BDO”) has been appointed to act as Capco’s internal 
auditor. During 2016, BDO’s audit plan included reviews of:
 ◦ IT security;
 ◦ Covent Garden residential leasing;
 ◦ training and talent management;
 ◦ health & safety (in relation to development projects);
 ◦ accounts payable and expenses;
 ◦ insurance; and
 ◦ VAT compliance.
During 2017 , it is expected that the audit plan will include reviews  
of payroll, employee benefits, health & safety , procurement, Bribery Act 
policies and procedures, Lillie Square completions and management, 
financial management and budgetary control, and IT controls. 
Committee Responsibilities
The Committee reviews the work of the Internal Auditor, the  
audit plan, any matters identified as a result of internal audits  
and whether recommendations are addressed by management  
in a timely and appropriate way . The Committee is satisfied that  
the internal auditor was independent and its services effective.
Access to the Committee
The internal audit partner has direct access to the Audit Committee 
Chairman should they wish to raise any concerns outside formal 
Committee meetings. The Committee meets with the internal 
auditors at least once per year without management being present.
INTERNAL CONTROL & RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk Management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management framework and system of internal control and the 
ongoing review of their effectiveness; it also determines the risk 
appetite of the Group and regularly reviews principal risks and 
uncertainties. The framework is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risk, and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board has 
delegated responsibility for the review of the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls relating to risk  
to the Committee and the Committee reviews the controls  
relating to risks and the proposed principal risk disclosures.
A description of the Group risk management framework and the review undertaken 
during the year is set out on page 14.
Viability Statement
As part of its work in reviewing the Group’s financial statements, 
the Committee reviewed the methodology for the preparation of 
the viability statement including the principal risks, supporting 
analysis, qualifications and assumptions to be disclosed.
The viability statement can be found on page 17 . 
Internal Controls
The Audit Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of  
the Group’s internal controls and reports regularly to the Board  
on its work and conclusions. In reviewing the effectiveness of  
the Group’s internal controls, the Committee considers reports 
provided by the Financial Controller, external auditor and internal 
auditor. No significant failings or weaknesses were identified  
in the review process.
Details of the Group’s internal controls are set out below:
Day-to-day procedures and internal control framework
 ◦ Schedule of matters reserved for the Board
 ◦ Remit and terms of reference of Board Committees
 ◦ Delegated authority limits
 ◦ Documentation of significant transactions
 ◦ The Executive Directors are closely involved in the day-to-day 
operations of the business and hold regular meetings with senior 
management to review aspects of the business, including risks 
and controls
 ◦ Regular Board updates on strategy and project developments
 ◦ A whistleblowing procedure under which staff may raise matters 
of concern confidentially . No calls were received during the year.
Specific controls relating to financial reporting  
and consolidation process
 ◦ Appropriately staffed management structure, with clear lines  
of responsibility and accountability
 ◦ A comprehensive budgeting and review system. Board and  
Audit Committee updates from the Chief Financial Officer  
which include forecasts, performance against budget and 
financial covenants
 ◦ Led by the Chief Executive, the Group Finance team participates 
in the control self-assessment and policy compliance elements  
of the risk management framework and sets formal requirements 
with business unit finance functions which specify the reports 
and approvals required
 ◦ BDO conducts regular audits of the Group’s financial control 
procedures and reports its findings to the Audit Committee
The Committee is satisfied that the Group’s internal controls are 
operating effectively and that systems are in accordance with  
FRC guidance.

Nomination Committee report
NOMINATION 
COMMITTEE REPORT
Andrew Strang, Henry Staunton and Graeme Gordon, who 
have each served on the Board for more than six years, will be 
seeking re-election at the forthcoming AGM. In recommending 
that each of these Directors be reappointed, the Nomination 
Committee carefully considered the continued contribution 
that each Director makes to the Board, as well as the balance  
of independence and overall Board composition.
Finally , the Committee has reviewed the Board’s diversity 
policy and disclosures. The Committee was satisfied that the 
policy did not need to be updated, however, we have included 
more information on the Company’s approach to diversity  
both in this report and the CR Report.
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2016 Nomination  
Committee Report.
During 2016 the Committee’s main task was to oversee the 
recruitment of a new Chief Financial Officer to succeed Soumen 
Das. In line with the Committee’s policy on Board succession  
a rigorous selection process was followed, with a number of 
internal and external candidates being considered for the 
position. I am pleased that Situl Jobanputra’s appointment 
reflects Capco’s commitment to developing the talent of  
our employees and promoting from within the Company  
where possible.
In addition to Situl, in March 2016 we welcomed Anthony 
Steains to the Board. The Committee ensured that appropriate 
Board inductions were provided to each new Director.
The Committee also continued to consider Board  
composition to ensure that the Board has the right mix of  
skills and experience to deliver Capco’s strategy . As I have 
previously reported, we are seeking to appoint an additional 
Non-executive Director with property expertise. However, a 
suitable candidate who is free to take up an appointment has 
not yet been found. The Committee is satisfied that there is 
currently no urgency in making the appointment and so will 
continue the search. A recommendation will be made to the 
Board as and when an appropriate candidate is found.

 ◦ Appointment of new CFO
 ◦ Non-executive Director recruitment
 ◦ Succession planning
 ◦ Board evaluation
 ◦ Directors’ skills, experience and independence 
 ◦ Directors’ time commitments

Nomination Committee report continued
Non-executive Directors:
As reported in previous years, following a full review of the skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of Board members,  
the Committee had agreed to seek two new Non-executive 
Directors, of whom at least one should have specific property 
expertise. As a result of this review Anthony Steains joined the 
Board in 2016. During the year the Committee continued to 
consider potential candidates, however at this time it has been 
unable to identify an appropriately qualified candidate who is free 
of conflicts of interest. The Committee is satisfied that the Board 
currently has sufficient property expertise, and will therefore 
continue to consider potential candidates, and recommend an 
appointment, when an opportunity arises.
Director induction
An induction programme is provided for each new Director,  
which is tailored depending on the Director’s experience and 
expected role on the Board. A typical induction programme for  
a Capco Non-executive Director will include individual meetings 
with the Chairman, Executive Directors, General Counsel, 
Company Secretary and members of senior management, site  
visits to Capco’s estates, and an introduction by the Chairman to  
the Company’s brokers, advisers and lawyers. The Director is also 
provided with copies of past Board and Committee papers and 
minutes, and individual briefings are arranged on topics such  
as Directors’ duties and responsibilities and the property market.  
A tailored Board induction was provided to Situl Jobanputra  
on his promotion to the Board.
Director development
The Chairman and the Committee together ensure that Directors 
keep their skills and knowledge up to date to allow them to fulfil 
their roles on the Board and Board Committees. The General 
Counsel and Company Secretary regularly update the Board  
on legal and corporate governance matters, and information on 
training opportunities and seminars is circulated to Directors.  
The Company also arranges periodic briefings from external 
advisers, and Directors receive regular business updates from the 
Executive Directors. Directors may also take independent advice  
at the Company’s expense where they feel this is appropriate.
The Nomination Committee has responsibility for making 
recommendations on Board appointments and succession to  
the Board.
The members of the Committee as at 31 December 2016 and  
the date of this report are listed in the box on the previous page. 
The Nomination Committee met five times during the year, and 
attendance at these meetings is shown in the table on page 63.
Board composition and succession
The Committee regularly considers Board composition and 
succession planning for both Executive and Non-executive 
Directors. In considering Executive Director succession, the Board’s 
strategy is to consider both internal and external candidates, whilst 
aiming to develop a choice of internal potential successors. The 
focus of Non-executive Director succession planning is to ensure 
that the Board and its Committees continue to have the right mix 
of skills and experience to deliver Capco’s strategy . A summary of 
Directors’ core areas of experience as at the date of this report is 
shown in the figure to the right. Board succession and composition 
will continue to be considered at Committee meetings during 2017 , 
and the Committee will make recommendations to the Board 
where appropriate.
Director recruitment
Capco operates a rigorous and transparent recruitment process for 
new Directors which is summarised above. Information about the 
Committee’s activities in this area during the year is given below.
Chief Financial Officer:
Following Soumen Das’ decision to leave Capco, a rigorous internal 
and external search was undertaken to identify appropriate 
candidates to succeed him. The Zygos Partnership, which provides 
no other services to the Group, was engaged to assist with the 
external search. To ensure that the long-list of candidates reflected 
diversity of both gender and skills, a broad brief was provided to 
the Zygos Partnership. Following an interview process led by the 
Chairman and Chief Executive with the assistance of the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee, it was recommended to the Committee 
that Situl Jobanputra be appointed as Chief Financial Officer of  
the Company . After thorough consideration, the Committee made  
a formal recommendation of the appointment to the Board.
Nomination Committee considers Board composition and determines desired skills and experience
A shortlist of executive search firms is prepared and a selection process followed
A person specification is prepared
All Directors, the General Counsel and the Company Secretary are given the opportunity to meet the preferred candidate

Diversity
Diversity is important to Capco and the Board recognises the 
business benefits that the experience of a diverse Board and 
workforce can bring.
The Committee regularly reviews the Board Diversity Policy  
to ensure it aligns with the Committee’s aim of ensuring that  
the Board has the right mix of skills and experience to deliver 
Capco’s strategy .
Capco currently has one female Director which does not meet the 
Hampton-Alexander Review target for women on boards or reflect 
the diversity within the Company . However, the Board remains 
committed to encouraging diversity , and although the Board  
does not feel that it would be appropriate to set targets on gender 
diversity as all appointments must be made on merit, diversity  
will continue to be considered in a broad context when evaluating 
the skills, knowledge and experience desirable to fill each  
Board vacancy .
The Company supports a number of initiatives to promote diversity 
within the property industry , including the RICS Inclusive Employer 
Quality Mark and working with peer companies to promote diversity 
and equal opportunities. We are keen to develop female talent 
across the business, and provide mentoring to management. We  
are proud that the ratio of women to men within Capco’s senior 
management team is 1:1.
Please refer to pages 49 and 50 of the Corporate Responsibility Report for more information on 
Capco’ s people practices, and on our Community initiatives which promote diversity .

Directors’ remuneration report
DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION REPORT
The new policy has been designed to address shareholders’ 
concerns regarding the Matching Share Plan (“MSP”) and  
the complexity of the current remuneration arrangements,  
and also to provide variable remuneration which can continue 
to incentivise our executive team to deliver market-leading 
levels of performance.
In summary , the new policy:
 ◦ Radically simplifies our long-term incentives by removing 
the exceptional award facility and combining the three 
long-term incentive and matching schemes into a single 
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”);
 ◦ Reduces the maximum level of long-term incentive award 
(including exceptional awards) which could be granted in 
any one year from 450 per cent to 350 per cent of salary;
 ◦ Provides a similar level of long-term incentive opportunity  
as the actual historical average;
 ◦ Introduces a two-year post-vesting holding period and 
clawback for all long-term incentive awards; and
 ◦ Brings pension contributions for future Executive Directors 
in line with the levels available for other employees at  
Capco Head Office (including Earls Court Properties)  
and Covent Garden.
No changes have been made to the policy regarding base salary , 
benefits or annual bonus. Fifty per cent of any bonus earned 
will continue to be deferred into shares for three years.
The key feature of this new policy is the change to the long-
term incentive arrangements. The current long-term incentives 
comprise three schemes: the 2010 Performance Share Plan 
(“Existing PSP”), the MSP and the Co-Investment Plan (“CIP”). 
The Committee has taken account of shareholder feedback and 
believes that these arrangements are too complex. Therefore, 
under the new policy , these three schemes will be replaced  
with a single annual award under a new PSP . Shareholders will 
be asked to approve the PSP at Capco’s 2017 AGM and a full 
description of the plan will be included in the notice of meeting.
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder,
Having succeeded Ian Henderson as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee at the 2016 AGM, I am pleased to 
present both the Annual Report on Remuneration for 2016 and 
the new Directors’ remuneration policy .
The Committee’s key objectives, as in previous years, are  
to ensure that Capco’s executive team is appropriately 
incentivised by remuneration arrangements that are fully 
aligned with the Company’s strategy of providing long-term 
market-leading returns to shareholders. Management 
incentives are linked to the Key Performance Indicators 
(“KPIs”) which the Company uses to measure the creation  
and growth of value for shareholders. These KPIs are  
described in full on page 13.
Performance in 2016 and variable remuneration outcomes
Since its establishment in 2010, Capco has delivered TSR 
performance which ranks in the top quartile when compared to 
its listed peers. However, in 2016 external market circumstances 
have impacted Capco’s financial performance and therefore the 
variable remuneration outcomes for our executive team. The 
financial elements of the bonus paid out at 6.67 per cent of 
maximum, reflecting achievement of the EPS target but NAV 
and TPR results which were below threshold. In addition, the 
long-term incentive awards which would have vested in 2017 
based on TSR and TR performance up to the end of 2016 are 
expected to lapse as neither the TSR or TR targets are expected 
to be met. These outcomes demonstrate that the performance 
measures are effective in aligning executive remuneration  
with shareholder returns.
Approval of the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Following the review of remuneration conducted in 2015  
and 2016, and extensive shareholder consultation covering  
over 80 per cent of the share register, the Remuneration 
Committee has developed a new remuneration policy which 
will be submitted for shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM.  
I would like to thank those shareholders who provided 
feedback on the Committee’s proposals.

Chairman of Remuneration Committee, 21 February 2017

Averaged over three years, the current policy allowed the 
Committee to grant an annual long-term incentive award of up to 
450 per cent of base salary , but in practice the actual historical level 
of annual award for the Chief Executive was just under 350 per cent 
of base salary . These historical awards have been a key factor in 
incentivising our executive team to deliver a market-leading level 
of TSR, and the Committee believes it is important that any new 
long-term incentive plan continues to provide a similar level of 
incentive opportunity in order to continue to drive exceptional 
performance for our shareholders. As a result, under the new PSP , 
the maximum annual award will be 350 per cent of base salary , 
which is broadly in line with the average award level received by 
Executive Directors since Capco’s establishment in 2010. The 
Committee believes that this level of PSP award is appropriate 
because it does not increase quantum above historical levels, 
provides a reduction in the level of long-term incentive award that 
can be made in any one year, removes the exceptional award facility 
and replaces the matching schemes all with a single annual award.
Awards made under the PSP will continue to be subject to a relative 
TSR performance measure and a relative TR performance measure. 
The Committee did consider introducing absolute measures of 
performance, but believes that relative measures remain most 
appropriate as they ensure that management are rewarded for 
outperformance against other property companies rather than for 
changes in market conditions.
The new policy also incorporates a number of areas of best practice 
in corporate governance and strengthens alignment between our 
executives and shareholders. All awards made under the new PSP 
will be subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period, and will 
be subject to clawback as well as malus. Pension contributions for 
new Executive Directors appointed after the 2017 AGM will be 
reduced from 24 per cent to 10 per cent of base salary , which is in 
line with the contribution level available for employees at Capco 
Head Office (including Earls Court Properties) and Covent Garden.
As part of the review, the Committee also considered the base salary 
positioning of the Chief Executive. On Capco’s establishment in 
2010, the Chief Executive’s base salary was initially set at the bottom 
of the market because the management team was untested. His  
base salary was then frozen for three years and market positioning 
worsened. Thereafter, whilst above market salary increases were 
made, these have been insufficient to bring the base salary to the 
Committee’s desired market positioning and appropriately reflect 
the contribution and performance of the Chief Executive. As  
a result, the positioning of the Chief Executive’s base salary 
continues to be below the level that the Committee believes to  
be appropriate. However, in light of current market conditions  
and the need to keep fixed costs under control, the Committee  
has concluded that it would not be justifiable to make a significant 
increase to the Chief Executive’s base salary at present. Accordingly 
the Committee will only increase his base salary by 2.9 per cent,  
in line with increases awarded to the rest of the workforce.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the proposed 
remuneration policy will continue to motivate Capco’s exceptional 
executive team to drive the future success of the Company , whilst 
achieving the aims of the review to simplify remuneration, reduce 
complexity , and remove the exceptional award opportunities. It 
also introduces elements of best practice such as holding periods, 
clawback and reduced pension contributions, which will sit 
alongside our 300 per cent of base salary shareholding guideline for 
the Chief Executive, and 200 per cent of base salary shareholding 
guideline for our executive team. The Committee believes that 
these proposals do not represent an increase to remuneration when 
compared to historical grant levels, and can continue to provide a 
strong incentive for our executives over the next three-year period.
Implementation of the Remuneration Policy in 2017
The Committee intends to operate the new remuneration policy  
in 2017 , subject to the new remuneration policy being approved  
at the 2017 AGM. Base salary increases for Executive Directors will 
be in line with those for the general workforce, and there will be no 
change to the operation of benefits, pension and annual bonus when 
compared to prior years. In anticipation of the introduction of the 
new remuneration policy , no long-term incentive awards will be 
made until after the AGM.
In 2017 , following shareholder approval, we intend to make the  
first grant under the new PSP of 350 per cent of base salary . Half of 
this award will be subject to a relative TSR performance condition, 
whilst the remainder will be subject to a relative TR performance 
measure. Threshold and maximum targets will be set for both the 
TSR and TR performance measures and are explained below.
As part of the remuneration review, the Committee considered  
the appropriate level of challenge for the TSR and TR targets. The 
Committee determined that the current threshold performance 
target for both the TSR and TR performance measures, under which 
33 per cent of an award will vest for median performance, and the 
current maximum TSR target of median +4 per cent per annum 
remained appropriately challenging, and these will continue to be  
the threshold TR and TSR targets and maximum TSR targets for 
awards under the new PSP .
In reviewing the TR maximum target, the Committee noted  
that the current target of median + 2.5 per cent per annum was 
above normal market practice at other companies which use similar 
relative metrics. In addition, current broker forecasts for Capco and 
the comparator group suggest that the difficulty in achieving the 
current target of median +2.5 per cent will increase substantially 
over the next two years as a result of the changing outlook for  
the property sector. Accordingly , for awards granted in 2017 , the 
Committee intends to set the maximum TR target at median  
+2 per cent per annum. This target remains above market practice 
for relative outperformance targets at other property companies, 
and the Committee believes that it maintains an equivalent level  
of challenge to previous years. However, the Committee will keep 
this target under review and the remuneration policy provides 
flexibility for the Committee to increase this target for future 
awards if market conditions change.
Appointment of new Chief Financial Officer
Situl Jobanputra was appointed as Chief Financial Officer of the 
Company on 1 January 2017 at a base salary of £325,000. Situl’s  
base salary has been initially positioned at below market rate for 
equivalent roles, and it will be brought to market levels over time 
subject to his performance and development in the role. As a result, 
his base salary will be subject to review by up to 15 per cent in 2019, 
to recognise the experience gained.
Conclusion
Capco’s current remuneration policy was approved by shareholders 
at the 2014 AGM held on 2 May 2014. This year, we are asking 
shareholders to vote for the resolution regarding the Annual Report 
on Remuneration and this Annual Statement, and also to vote for 
the resolution regarding the new Directors’ remuneration policy , 
and the resolution to approve the new PSP . The Committee believes 
that this new remuneration policy achieves our aims to simplify 
remuneration whilst providing an appropriate level of incentive  
to drive future performance. We look forward to receiving your 
support at the forthcoming AGM to be held on 5 May 2017 . Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 72

1.2 Executive Director Policy Table
The table below summarises each of the components of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors:
To provide an appropriately 
competitive base salary , whilst placing 
emphasis on the performance related 
elements of remuneration.
The Committee believes base salary  
for high-performing experienced 
Executive Directors should be at  
least median.
Purpose and link to strategy Operation
To be appropriately competitive with 
those offered at comparator companies.
To be appropriately competitive with 
that offered by comparator companies.
To incentivise and reward performance.
The Committee selects performance 
measures and targets each year to 
reinforce the strategic business 
priorities for the year.
The deferral of half of the bonus  
into shares is designed to further align 
executives with shareholders’ interests.
To incentivise and reward long-term 
outperformance, and help retain 
Executive Directors over the  
longer term.
Base salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis, with any increase 
normally taking effect from 1 April.
The Committee reviews base salaries with reference to:
• other property companies (including the constituents of the long-term 
incentive plan’s comparator group)
• UK companies of a similar size
• each Executive Director’s performance and contribution during the year
• scope of each Executive Director’s responsibilities
• changes to the remuneration and overall conditions of other employees
When reviewing base salaries, the Committee is mindful of the gearing 
effect that increases in base salary will have on the potential total 
remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Benefits will be in line with those offered to some or all employees  
and may include private dental and healthcare, life insurance, personal 
accident cover, travel insurance, income protection and a car allowance, 
currently paid in cash.
Other benefits may be introduced from time to time to ensure the  
benefits package is appropriately competitive and reflects individual 
circumstances. For example, Directors may be offered relocation and/or 
expatriate benefits should a Director be required to relocate as a result  
of emerging business requirements.
Capco offers a defined contribution pension scheme.
Executive Directors may elect to be paid some or all of their entitlement  
in cash.
The Company does not currently operate any All Employee Share Schemes, 
however if such a scheme were introduced the Executive Directors would be 
able to participate on the same terms as other employees.
The annual bonus arrangements are reviewed at the start of each  
financial year to ensure performance measures and weightings are  
appropriate and support the business strategy .
The Committee reviews performance against the annual bonus targets but has  
the ability to take into account broader factors and, subject to the 150 per cent of 
salary maximum, may exercise two-way discretion to ensure that the annual bonus 
awarded properly reflects the performance of the Company and each Director.
Adjudication of bonuses will be explained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
50 per cent of any bonus earned is deferred in Capco shares or nil cost  
options for three years under the Performance Share Plan without  
further performance conditions but subject to risk of forfeiture should  
an Executive Director leave the Company in certain circumstances. Directors  
may be entitled to be paid dividend equivalents on deferred bonus.
Deferred bonus is subject to malus as described in the notes to this table.
Executive Directors are eligible to receive awards of shares under the  
PSP , which may be made as awards of shares or nil cost options, at the 
discretion of the Committee. In assessing the outcome of the performance 
conditions, the Committee must satisfy itself that the figures are a genuine 
reflection of underlying financial performance, and may exercise downwards 
discretion when determining the proportion of an award that will vest.
Dividend equivalents may be paid.
The Committee has the discretion in certain circumstances to grant and/or 
settle an award in cash. In practice this will only be used in exceptional 
circumstances for Executive Directors.
PSP awards are subject to malus and clawback as described in the notes to 
this table.

1. POLICY REPORT
This section of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report sets out 
Capco’s new remuneration policy 
which will take effect from the 
2017 AGM, subject to shareholder 
approval. Details of actual 
remuneration paid, share awards 
made, and the approach to 
remuneration for 2017 are set  
out within the Annual Report  
on Remuneration which starts  
on page 78.
1.1 Remuneration policy
The key objectives of the 
Company’s remuneration  
policy are to:
 ◦ strongly align executive  
and shareholder interests;
 ◦ underpin an effective 
pay-for-performance culture;
 ◦ support the retention, 
motivation and recruitment  
of talented people who are 
commercially astute; and
 ◦ encourage executives to 
acquire and retain significant 
holdings of Capco shares.
The Committee aims to  
achieve an appropriate balance 
between fixed and variable 
remuneration, and between 
variable remuneration based  
on short-term and longer- 
term performance. Fixed 
remuneration includes base 
salary , benefits and pension. 
Variable remuneration includes 
an annual bonus, half of which  
is deferred in shares, and awards 
under the Performance Share 
Plan (“PSP”).
The remuneration policy is 
aligned to the strategy and  
nature of the Company , and 
reflects the importance of total 
return and the long-term nature 
of Capco’s business, rewarding 
the Executive Directors for 
delivering strong performance 
against the Company’s Key 
Performance Indicators (“KPIs”).
Details of each element of 
remuneration, their operation, 
purpose, link to strategy and 
performance metrics are set  
out in this section. www.capitalandcounties.com 73 
Financial statements Strategic report Governance
Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary increases will be applied in line with the outcome of the 
annual review and will normally be in line with increases awarded 
to other employees. However, the Committee may make additional 
adjustments in certain circumstances to reflect, for example, an 
increase in scope or responsibility , development in role, to address 
an increase in size or complexity of the business, to address a gap in 
market positioning and/or to reward the long-term performance of 
an individual. For the purposes of stating a maximum as required 
by the remuneration regulations, no increase will be applied to an 
Executive Director’s base salary if the resulting base salary would 
be above the upper quartile base salary for CEOs at companies in 
the FTSE 350.
Set at a level which the Committee considers appropriate in light of 
relevant market practice for the role and individual circumstances. 
The cost of all benefits will not normally exceed 10 per cent of base 
salary , with the exception of any future expatriate and/or relocation 
benefits, which would be disclosed in the annual report on 
remuneration. Any reasonable business related expenses (including 
tax thereon) can be reimbursed if determined to be a taxable benefit.
The maximum contribution is 10 per cent of base salary for any 
Executive Director appointed on or after the 2017 AGM, in line 
with the level available for other head office and Covent Garden 
employees. Executive Directors appointed before the 2017 AGM 
receive 24 per cent of base salary as a defined contribution.
In line with HMRC approved limits.
The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors is  
150 per cent of annual salary with a bonus of 75 per cent of salary 
payable for achieving target levels of performance. No bonus  
is payable for below threshold performance. The payment for 
threshold performance will not exceed 10 per cent of maximum. 
Awards are made on a straight-line basis for performance between 
threshold and target, and on a separate straight-line basis for 
performance between target and maximum.
Each year participants may be granted up to 350 per cent of salary 
in awards or nil cost options.
33 per cent of an award vests for threshold performance, with  
full vesting taking place for equalling or exceeding maximum 
performance conditions and straight-line vesting between 
threshold and maximum.
The Committee considers individual and Company performance when setting base 
salary , as well as the general increase awarded to other employees.

Executives’ performance is measured relative to challenging one-year targets in  
key financial, operational and strategic measures. The measures selected and their 
weightings vary each year according to the strategic priorities.
At least 75 per cent of the bonus will be measured against financial performance.
Measures and respective weightings used for the annual bonus for 2016 and 
proposed for next year’s annual bonus are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on pages 80 and 81, and 84.
An explanation of how the performance measures were chosen and how the 
performance targets are set is given on page 74.
PSP awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, and are subject to  
a two-year post-vesting holding period.
The vesting of awards is subject to continued employment and the Company’s 
performance over a three-year performance period based:
• 50 per cent on relative Total Return (Net Asset Value growth plus dividends); and
• 50 per cent on relative Total Shareholder Return
For both measures, performance is measured relative to a comparator group 
comprising the largest FTSE350 property companies.
The performance measures and weightings which apply to the PSP are reviewed  
by the Committee annually , and, subject to consultation with shareholders, the 
Committee has discretion to make changes to the measures, the weightings and/or 
comparator group for future awards to ensure that they remain relevant to the 
Company strategy and are suitably stretching.
Details of the performance conditions for previous years’ awards, and those 
proposed for 2017 awards, are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration  
on page 82.
An explanation of how the performance measures were chosen and how the 
performance targets are set is given on page 74. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 74 
1.3 Notes to the Policy Table
Changes to previous Remuneration 
Policy
A full explanation of the changes made 
from the previous remuneration policy is 
set out in the letter from the Chairman on 
pages 70 and 71. The changes made, which 
are intended to simplify Capco’s executive 
remuneration arrangements, are:
 ◦ The replacement of the Existing PSP , 
MSP and CIP with a new PSP with a 
maximum annual award of 350 per cent 
of salary;
 ◦ The introduction of a two-year post-
vesting holding period and clawback 
under the PSP; and
 ◦ The reduction of pension contribution 
rates for future Executive Directors to  
be in line with the levels available for 
other employees at Capco Head Office 
(including Earls Court Properties) and 
Covent Garden.
Performance measurement selection
Annual Bonus Scheme
Executive Directors may earn bonuses 
depending on the Company’s financial 
performance and performance against 
individual performance targets designed  
to deliver strategic goals. The current 
structure of the annual bonus performance 
conditions is illustrated within the Annual 
Report on Remuneration on page 81. The 
financial performance measures and the 
importance of each are set out in the table 
below. The Remuneration Committee  
has discretion to change the performance 
conditions in the annual bonus, but within 
the bounds set out in the Remuneration 
Policy Table.
The annual financial performance targets 
are set by the Committee in the first quarter 
of each year following an analysis of external 
and internal expectations compiled by the 
Committee’s independent adviser. The 
Committee sets targets it believes to be 
appropriately stretching, but achievable.
Long-term incentives
As mentioned above, the performance 
conditions for the PSP currently comprise 
two measures:
 ◦ Three-year relative Total Return  
(TR, growth in NAV per share plus 
dividends); and
 ◦ Three-year relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR, increase in price of an 
ordinary share plus dividends).
The Committee believes that these two 
measures are currently the most appropriate 
measures of long-term success for Capco as 
long-term relative performance provides  
an appropriately objective and relevant 
measure of Capco’s success which is strongly 
aligned with shareholders’ interests.
The Committee believes that NAV growth  
is the most important internal measure of 
success for Capco at this time. Accordingly , 
the Committee considered it appropriate to 
reward NAV performance in both the short 
and long-term incentive arrangements, 
with one-year absolute NAV growth being 
used in respect of the annual bonus 
arrangements and three-year relative  
NAV (as the main component of three-year 
Total Return) being used in respect of the 
long-term incentives. NAV is used as a 
performance measure by over half of 
FTSE350 property companies in their 
long-term incentive arrangements. The 
Company’s NAV is based on independent 
external valuations carried out in 
accordance with RICS Valuation 
Professional Standards.
Relative TSR helps align the interests of 
Executive Directors with shareholders by 
incentivising share price growth and, in  
the Committee’s view, provides an objective 
measure of the Company’s long-term success.
The current long-term incentive 
performance conditions are summarised 
within the Annual Report on Remuneration 
on page 82. Performance is measured 
relative to a comparator group comprising 
the largest FTSE350 property companies 
and Capco. The members of the comparator 
group are shown in Figure 4 on page 82.
In order for any awards to vest, the 
Committee must also satisfy itself that  
the TR and TSR figures are a genuine 
reflection of underlying financial 
performance. In assessing the extent to 
which the performance conditions have 
been met, the Committee consults with its 
independent remuneration adviser. The 
calculation of the returns is also reviewed 
by the Company’s auditors as appropriate. 
The performance targets are set by the 
Committee following an analysis of internal 
and external expectations, and are believed 
to be appropriately stretching.
For future awards, the Remuneration 
Committee has discretion to change the 
performance measures and weightings. 
However, any such changes would only be 
made after consulting with shareholders.
Discretions
Under the Annual Bonus Scheme and  
the PSP the Company has the standard 
discretions to take appropriate action in  
the event of unforeseen events which affect 
the schemes such as a variation in share 
capital as well as terminations and on a 
change in control as described in the policy . 
The Committee does not intend to make 
adjustments to the methods by which it 
measures the performance conditions, 
however, it reserves the discretion to  
make adjustments in very exceptional 
circumstances. Shareholders would be 
given details of any exercise of discretion.
Why are the current annual bonus performance measures appropriate for Capco?
Measure Reason
Growth in Net Asset Value  
per share
Considered by the Committee to be the most important driver of value creation for Capco at the present time.
Relative Total Property Return 
 
Rewards the additional portfolio value created by management over and above any changes in value from 
tracking the property market as a whole, as measured by the IPD Total Return All Property Index, an external 
benchmark widely used in the property industry .
Underlying Earnings Per Share Rewards value growth in net rental income as well as the management of financing and other costs. However, 
given the current stage of the Company’s development, the Committee considers EPS to be less relevant as an 
indicator of value creation than growth in Net Asset Value per share.

Payments resulting from existing 
arrangements
The Committee may make any 
remuneration payments and payments  
for loss of office (including exercising any 
discretions it has relating to such payments) 
even though they are not in line with the 
policy set out in this report. This will apply 
where the entitlement to the payment 
arose: (i) before the 2014 AGM; (ii) at a  
time when the relevant individual was  
not a Director of the Company and, in the 
opinion of the Committee, the payment  
was not in consideration for the individual 
becoming a Director of the Company; or  
(iii) under a remuneration policy previously 
approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
For these purposes entitlements arising 
under the Company’s current remuneration 
policy (as approved by shareholders at the 
2014 AGM) will be incorporated into this 
policy , ‘payments’ includes the Committee 
satisfying awards of variable remuneration, 
and an entitlement under an award over 
shares arises at the time the award is granted.
Malus and clawback
Awards granted under the long-term 
incentive arrangements are subject to malus 
and clawback until the end of the respective 
holding periods. Deferred bonus awards are 
subject to malus prior to vesting. Reasons 
for malus and clawback include: in the 
event of gross misconduct of a Director,  
in the event of a material misstatement in 
the audited accounts of the Company for  
a period that was wholly or partly before  
the end of the financial year by reference  
to which any performance condition was 
assessed, or in the event that the assessment 
of the satisfaction of any performance 
condition was based on error or inaccurate 
or misleading information. In the latter two 
scenarios, to the extent an overpayment 
resulted. The application of any malus  
or clawback is at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration of employees below  
the Board
No element of remuneration is operated 
solely for Executive Directors. Capco head 
office (including Earls Court Properties) and 
Covent Garden employees below the Board 
receive base salary , benefits, annual bonus, 
and participate in the PSP . The pension 
contribution for new Executive Directors 
has been set at the same level as available to 
employees at Capco head office (including 
Earls Court Properties) and Covent Garden. 
However, there are some differences in 
operation as set out below:
 ◦ In exceptional circumstances, such as 
recruitment, long-term incentive awards 
may be granted without performance 
conditions to participants below  
the Board;
 ◦ Employees below the Board are not 
subject to any minimum shareholding 
requirement; and
 ◦ Incentive awards granted to employees 
below the Board may not be subject to 
holding periods, clawback or malus.
The Venues business has separate 
remuneration arrangements appropriate 
for that business. These comprise salary , 
separate pension arrangements and 
discretionary bonuses.
Shareholding guidelines
The Chief Executive is required to achieve  
a shareholding in the Company equivalent 
to 300 per cent of salary and the other 
Executive Directors are required to achieve 
a shareholding in the Company equivalent 
to 200 per cent of base salary , to be achieved 
by retaining at least 50 per cent of any 
vested share awards (net of tax) or within 
three years. The current shareholdings  
of the Executive Directors are set out  
on page 86. The current Chairman is 
required to maintain a shareholding in  
the Company equivalent to 100 per cent  
of his base fee, but this would be reviewed 
on any new appointment.
1.4 Performance scenario charts
The potential reward opportunities 
illustrated in Figure 1 are based on the 
policy which will apply in 2017 , applied  
to the base salary at the salary review date,  
1 April 2017 , and provide estimates of the 
potential future reward opportunity for 
each Executive Director, and the potential 
split between the different elements  
of remuneration under three different 
performance scenarios: ‘Below Threshold’ , 
‘Target’ and ‘Maximum’ .
The Below Threshold scenario includes base 
salary , pension and benefits (fixed pay). No 
annual bonus or PSP elements are included 
(variable pay). The Target scenario includes 
fixed pay , on target bonus and threshold 
vesting of PSP awards. The Maximum 
scenario includes fixed pay , maximum 
bonus and full vesting of PSP awards. For 
variable pay , the amounts illustrated are  
the normal maximum opportunities.
It should be noted that the PSP awards 
granted in a year do not normally vest until 
the third anniversary of the date of grant 
and are subject to a two-year post-vesting 
holding period. The projected values of 
long-term incentives shown here exclude 
the impact of share price movement and 
dividends.

1.5 Approach to recruitment remuneration
When hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing components of remuneration,  
as follows:
Element of remuneration Policy on recruitment Maximum opportunity
Salary Based on scope and nature of responsibilities of the proposed role; the 
candidate’s experience; implications for total remuneration positioning vs. 
market pay levels for comparable roles; internal relativities; and the candidate’s 
current salary .
A new Director may be appointed at a salary which is less than the prevailing 
market rate but increased over a period to the desired positioning subject to 
satisfactory performance.
N/A
Pension A contribution of up to 10 per cent of salary may be offered, consistent  
with policy .
Benefits Appropriate benefits will be provided, which may include the continuation  
of benefits received in a previous role.
Annual Bonus Executive Directors will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme  
on the same basis as existing Executive Directors, pro-rated for proportion of 
year served.
Depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee may deem it 
appropriate to set different annual bonus performance conditions to the current 
Executive Directors in the first performance year of appointment.
The maximum opportunity  
will be 150 per cent of salary , 
consistent with policy .
In exceptional circumstances, 
normal policy table limits may 
be exceeded on recruitment.  
The maximum additional bonus 
opportunity will be limited to  
50 per cent of salary .
Performance Share Plan New Executive Directors will be eligible to participate in the long-term incentive 
scheme set out in the remuneration policy table.
A PSP award can be made shortly following an appointment (assuming the 
Company is not in a prohibited period).
The opportunity levels will be 
consistent with those disclosed

Other In determining appropriate remuneration for new Executive Directors, the 
Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors (including quantum, 
the nature of remuneration and where the candidate was recruited from) to 
ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of Capco and its shareholders.
Remuneration may include:
• An award made in respect of a new appointment to “buy out” existing incentive 
awards forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In such cases the compensatory 
award would typically be a like-for-like award with similar time-to-vesting, 
performance conditions and likelihood of those conditions being met. The fair 
value of the compensatory award would not be greater than the awards being 
replaced. To facilitate such a buyout, the Committee may use an award under  
a different structure or an additional award under the PSP;
• A relocation package, should this be required;
• For an overseas appointment, the Committee will have discretion to offer 
cost-effective benefits and pension provisions which reflect local market practice 
and relevant legislation; and
• In the event that an employee is promoted to the Board, the Company would 
honour any existing contractual arrangements.
1.6 Service contracts and exit payment policy
The service contracts of Executive Directors are approved by the Remuneration Committee and are one-year rolling contracts. The 
commencement dates of the current contracts are shown below. The service contracts may be terminated by either party giving one year’s 
notice to the other. It is the Company’s policy that termination payments should not exceed the Director’s current salary and benefits for 
the notice period. The service contracts may be viewed at the Company’s registered office.
Where a Director may be entitled to pursue a claim against the Company in respect of his/her statutory employment rights or any other 
claim arising from the employment or its termination, the Committee will be entitled to enter into a settlement agreement with the 
Director. The Company may pay a Director’s legal fees in relation to any settlement agreement.
The Committee may pay reasonable outplacement fees where considered appropriate.
When considering exit payments, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders  
and participants. The payment of any annual bonus is subject to the discretion of the Committee, and both the cash and deferred share 
elements of an annual bonus would normally be payable at the normal payment date. Any deferred share element could be paid in cash. 
Any outstanding deferred bonus may be released or paid in cash, subject to clawback for a period of three years from the date of grant.

An individual would generally be considered a ‘good leaver’ if they left the Group’s employment for reasons including injury , ill-health, 
disability approved by the Committee, redundancy or retirement with the agreement of the employing company . The table below 
summarises how PSP awards are typically treated in specific leaver circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the 
Committee’s discretion, for example an individual may be considered a ‘good leaver’ for any other reason at the absolute discretion  
of the Committee, and the vesting of awards may be reduced for ‘good leavers’.
Reason for leaving Timing of vesting Treatment of awards
Good leaver Normal vesting date, although 
the Committee has discretion to 
accelerate. 
Payments are normally pro-rated for time and remain subject to outstanding performance 
conditions. Where vesting is accelerated, payments are further pro-rated to reflect the 
extent to which the performance conditions had been satisfied at the date of leaving.  
The holding period would continue to apply .
Change of control Immediately Vesting will be pro-rated for time and remain subject to performance conditions. 
However, the Committee has discretion to allow awards to vest in full in such 
circumstances if it deems this to be fair and reasonable. The holding period would  
cease to apply .
Any other reason Awards lapse
There are no obligations on the Company contained within the existing Directors’ service contracts which would give rise to payments not 
disclosed in this report.
The service contracts of any future-appointed Directors will provide for mitigation in the event of termination.
1.7 Non-executive Director Policy Table
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment. The letters of appointment of the 
Non-executive Directors are reviewed by the Board annually and contain a one-month notice period. The Chairman’s letter of appointment 
contains a 12-month notice period. The letters of appointment may be viewed at the Company’s registered office.

The table below summarises each of the components of the remuneration package for the Non-executive Directors. The Non-executive 
Directors do not receive any pension, bonus or long-term incentive benefits from the Company .
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Performance 
metrics
Fee
To recruit and retain 
appropriately qualified 
Non-executive Directors.
The Chairman and Non-executive Director fees are reviewed  
on an annual basis, with any increase taking effect from 1 May .
The Board and Committee review fees with reference to:
• other property companies;
• UK companies of a similar size; and
• the time that Non-executive Directors are required to devote  
to the role.
In exceptional circumstances, if there is a temporary yet material 
increase in the time commitments for Non-Executive Directors, 
the Board may pay extra fees on a pro-rata basis to recognise the 
additional workload.
Non-executive Director fees may 
include a basic fee and Committee/
SID fees as disclosed in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration. These  
are set at a level that is considered 
appropriately competitive in light 
of market practice, and will not 
exceed the aggregate fees permitted 
by the Company’s Articles  
of Association.
N/A
Benefits
To be appropriately  
competitive with those offered  
at comparator companies.
The Chairman’s benefits include private healthcare and personal 
accident and travel insurance.
Other Non-executive Directors will be covered by the Company’s 
travel insurance policy should they be required to travel on 
Company business.
Any reasonable business related expenses can be reimbursed 
(including tax thereon if determined to be a taxable benefit).
The maximum value of the  
benefits provided to Non-executive 
Directors will be the cost of 
purchasing them in the market.
N/A Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 78 
Directors’ remuneration report continued
1.8 External Directorships
The Company’s policy is to encourage each 
Executive Director to take up one or more 
Non-executive Directorships, subject to 
Board approval. Fees received for serving  
as a Non-executive Director of a company 
outside the Capco Group are retained by  
the Executive Director.
1.9 Consideration of conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
When setting Executive Director pay the 
Committee considers the remuneration  
and overall conditions of all employees. As 
Capco has a relatively small workforce, the 
Committee does not consult with employees 
when deciding remuneration policy , but  
it receives regular updates from the HR 
Director on salary increases, bonus and share 
awards made to Group employees and is 
aware of how the remuneration of Directors 
compares to that of other employees; for 
example, salary increases are generally in 
line with increases awarded to other 
employees, which are set with reference  
to market data.
1.10 Consideration of shareholder views
It is the Committee’s policy to consult with 
major shareholders as appropriate, for 
example, prior to finalising any major 
changes to its executive remuneration policy .
2. ANNUAL REPORT ON 
REMUNERATION
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report explains how Capco’s current 
remuneration policy has been implemented 
during the year.
2.1 Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for determining and 
recommending to the Board the policy  
for the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, setting targets for the Company’s 
incentive schemes and determining the 
total individual remuneration package for 
each Executive Director. Membership of the 
Committee as at 31 December 2016 and the 
date of this report is set out on page 71. In 
addition, the Company Chairman, Chief 
Executive, Company Secretary and the 
Director of HR & CR are invited to attend 
Committee meetings and contribute,  
except on matters relating to their own 
remuneration. Attendance at the seven 
meetings held during the year is shown  
in the table on page 63 and a summary of 
the matters considered by the Committee 
during the year is set out in the adjacent 
shaded box in column 3.
2.2 Remuneration Committee and  
its advisers
The Committee appointed Aon Hewitt 
(formerly New Bridge Street) as its 
independent remuneration adviser in 2014 
following a competitive process. During  
the year, the Committee received advice on 
matters including remuneration structure, 
incentive design and target setting from 
Aon Hewitt. Aon Hewitt is a member of  
the Remuneration Consultants Group  
and adheres to its code of conduct. The 
Committee has received confirmation  
of independence from Aon Hewitt, and  
is satisfied that the advice received was 
objective and independent. In addition  
to advice provided to the Committee, Aon 
Hewitt also provided share award valuation 
services to the Company . During 2016, the 
Company was charged a total of £124,345  
by Aon Hewitt in respect of advice to the 
Committee. Fees were charged on a  
time basis.
2.3 Statement of shareholder voting

1. Comprises Executive Director car allowance of £18,000, medical insurance and Non‑ executive Directors’ travel expenses relating to Board meeting attendance where these are 
taxable or would be if the Director were resident in the UK for tax purposes. Where applicable the Company pays the tax payable on Non‑ executive Director travel expenses as they 
are incurred in the fulfilment of Directors’ duties.
2. The 2016 disclosure comprises the expected value on maturity of the 2014 Existing PSP and MSP awards which have a performance period that ran from 2014 to 2016, and  
were expected to vest in early 2017 . These awards have been included in the 2016 single figure as the performance conditions relating to these awards had been substantially  
(but not fully) completed during 2016. The disclosure has been calculated assuming that zero per cent of the Existing PSP awards and MSP awards will vest. As required under the 
remuneration regulations, the 2015 multi‑ year variable comparators (which were previously disclosed on the basis described above assuming vesting of 60 per cent for the Existing 
PSP awards and, depending on the award, 40 or 80 per cent for the MSP awards and using a price of £4.333, being the average share price for the last three months of 2015) have been 
restated with values calculated using the actual vesting outcome of 54.1 per cent of the Existing PSP awards and, depending on the award, 36 or 72 per cent of the MSP awards and 
the actual share prices on the date that the awards vested, which were £3.349 and £2.837 respectively. The previously disclosed 2015 multi‑ year variable figures were:  
Ian Hawksworth £1,807 ,394, Soumen Das £1,341,206, Gary Yardley £1,577 ,463.

2.5 Annual bonus outcomes for 2016
Opportunity
Executive Directors can earn bonuses of up to 150 per cent of salary . 
50 per cent of bonus earned is deferred in Capco shares or nil cost 
options for three years, subject to forfeiture should the Executive 
Director leave the Company .
Performance measures and targets
Awards made in respect of the year ended 31 December 2016 were 
based 75 per cent on financial performance, and 25 per cent on 
individual performance.
Financial measures: The financial performance element for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 was based on growth in absolute NAV  
per share (“NAV”), Total Property Return relative to the IPD Total 
Return All Property Index (“TPR”), and underlying EPS (“EPS”).  
In determining the annual targets for these measures in 2016, the 
Committee recognised the long-term nature of some aspects of the 
Company’s strategy , and the extent to which this would be reflected 
in these measures on a 12-month horizon. The performance 
measures, weightings and targets that applied in respect of  
the 2016 annual bonus are summarised in the table on page 81.
The Committee has previously committed to publish the financial 
performance targets once they cease to be commercially sensitive. 
The financial performance targets that applied in respect of the  
year ended 31 December 2014 are no longer commercially sensitive; 
accordingly , the targets and the Company’s performance against 
these targets are set out on the following page, together with the 
2016 measures and outcomes.
Personal measures: The Committee assessed individual performance 
against a set of KPIs which align with the Company’s objectives 
outlined on page 13 of the Annual Report. These KPIs include:
 ◦ Corporate objectives: enhancing Capco’s position and reputation 
in the market; identifying, monitoring and controlling risk 
including health and safety , progress towards meeting  
medium-term corporate objectives;
 ◦ Financial objectives: optimising liquidity and financing; effective 
cost and capital expenditure management; other budgeted KPIs;
 ◦ Investment objectives: strategic investment initiatives; 
establishment and operation of JVs; implementation of business 
plans; achievement of planning targets; and
 ◦ CR/HR objectives: optimisation of organisational structure; 
nurturing of future leaders; promotion and support of  
CR initiatives.
Outcome of 2016 annual bonus performance measures (Audited)
Outcome of financial objectives: In respect of the year ended  
31 December 2016, the Company’s performance did not meet  
the threshold performance targets for NAV or TPR, however  
the underlying EPS target was exceeded. Accordingly awards  
of 5.63 per cent of salary were made to Ian Hawksworth and  
Gary Yardley in respect of the financial performance measures.
Outcome of personal objectives: The Executive Directors were 
considered to have delivered good performance in 2016, including 
the achievement of targeted returns and expansion opportunities 
at Covent Garden, operation of joint ventures with TfL and 
Network Rail, optimisation of corporate liquidity , consideration  
of new business opportunities and control of costs and capital 
expenditure. Accordingly , awards of 26.25 per cent of salary  
were made to Ian Hawksworth and Gary Yardley in respect of  
the individual performance measures.
A summary of the overall outcomes of 2016 annual bonus 
performance measures is shown in Figure 3 on page 81.
As Soumen Das left the business, any annual bonus for the year  
was forfeited.

2.6 Long-term incentive outcomes  
for 2016
Existing PSP Opportunity
In 2014 awards of 150 per cent of salary  
were made to Executive Directors under  
the Existing PSP .
MSP Opportunity
Match of deferred 2013 bonus: In 2014, shares 
awarded in respect of Executive Directors’ 
deferred 2013 bonus were matched under 
the MSP on a 2:1 basis.
Co‑ investment invitation: In 2013 the 
Committee offered Executive Directors  
an opportunity to invest up to 150 per cent 
of 2013 salary between 2013 and 2015 
(subsequently extended to early 2016) when 
permitted by scheme headroom with an 
exceptional matching opportunity of 2:1.
Performance measures and outcomes for 
2014 awards under the Existing PSP  
and MSP
Performance measures and targets: The 
performance conditions for the Existing 
PSP and MSP comprised two equally 
weighted measures:
Three-year relative Total Return (TR, 
growth in NAV per share plus dividends)
Three-year relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR, increase in price of an 
ordinary share plus dividends)
Where an exceptional award was made, the 
additional matching opportunity could 
only be earned for performance above the 
normal stretch targets. The performance 
targets are set out in Figure 4 below.
Performance outcome: In early 2017 , the 
Committee determined that Capco’s TR  
was not expected to equal the median of the 
comparator group (vs. an outperformance 
target of 2.5 per cent per annum or 3 per 
cent for exceptional awards), and that 
Capco’s TSR was not expected to equal  
the median of the comparator group  
(vs. an outperformance target of 4 per cent 
per annum or 5 per cent for exceptional 
awards), and as such the performance 
conditions relating to the 2014 Existing  
PSP and MSP awards had not been met. 
Accordingly , the 2014 Existing PSP and 
MSP awards are expected to lapse and no 
value has been included in the single figure 
disclosures in respect of these awards.

2.10 Statement of implementation of policy for 2017
Salary
The Executive Directors’ salaries are reviewed annually . In April 
2017 the salary of the Chief Executive and Managing Director  
and Chief Investment Officer will be increased by 2.9 per cent  
to £595,000 and £533,000 respectively , which is in line with the 
increase expected to be applied to Group employees. As explained 
in the Committee Chairman’s letter on page 70, the salary of the 
Chief Financial Officer will be reviewed in April 2019 by up to  
15 per cent.
The proposed revised salaries for the Executive Directors are set out 
in the table below:
Executive Director Salaries – 2016 and 2017
2017 2016 % Increase
Ian Hawksworth £595,000 £578,000 2.9%
Soumen Das N/A £450,000 N/A
Gary Yardley £533,000 £518,000 2.9%
Situl Jobanputra £325,000 N/A N/A
Pension and benefits
As described in the policy table on pages 72 and 73.
Annual bonus
Opportunity
The annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged for 2017 .
Performance conditions
The financial performance targets for the year ended 31 December 
2016 were based on growth in absolute NAV per share, Total 
Property Return relative to the IPD Total Return All Property 
Index, and underlying EPS. The Committee has decided that, 
whilst NAV and TPR continue to be of greatest importance to 
Capco’s strategy , in 2017 the weighting of EPS as a performance 
measure will be increased to 10 per cent of the financial performance 
measures, in line with years prior to 2016, in order to maintain 
appropriate focus on the Group’s cost structure. The rebalancing  
of weightings of the financial performance measures for 2017 is 
shown in the table below. The relative weighting of financial and 
individual performance measures will remain unchanged. The 
Committee will consider the appropriate weighting of the EPS 
measure on an annual basis.
Performance targets
The TPR target is included in the Company’s KPIs on page 13.  
The KPIs are in part dependent upon the occurrence of certain 
discrete events. Therefore, whilst the outperformance targets  
that apply to the long-term incentives are disclosed, the Board  
has decided that as the Group operates in three specific locations 
within the competitive central London property market, 
prospective disclosure of specific short-term NAV and EPS targets 
would provide a level of information to counterparties that could 
prejudice the Company’s commercial interests. The Committee 
expects to publish the performance targets retrospectively once 
they have ceased to be commercially sensitive. Further information 
on the Company’s KPIs can be found on page 13.
2017 financial performance measures
Absolute Net Asset Value per share 55%
Relative Total Property Return 35%
Underlying Earnings per Share 10%
Matching Share Plan
No further MSP awards will be made.
Performance Share Plan
If the new remuneration policy is approved at the 2017 AGM, PSP 
awards of 350 per cent of salary will be made in May 2017 as awards 
or nil cost options. The applicable performance conditions are set 
out in the table below:
Threshold Maximum 
TR Median Median + 2%
TSR Median Median + 4%
Chairman and Non-executive Director remuneration
The Chairman has been appointed for a three-year term, subject to 
annual re-election by shareholders, which will expire at the 2019 
AGM. The Chairman’s annual base fee for 2016 was £257 ,000. The 
remuneration of the Chairman is reviewed annually . Following  
the 2016 review it was agreed that the Chairman’s annual base  
fee would be increased to £265,000 with effect from 1 May 2017 .
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is considered  
by the Chairman and the Chief Executive, with regard to market 
comparatives, and recommended to the Board as a whole. The 
Non-executive Director fees are reviewed annually . Following  
the 2016 review it was agreed that the Non-executive Director fees 
would be increased as set out in the table below with effect from  
1 May 2017 .

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
& Accounts, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to: 
(a)  select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
(b)  make judgements and accounting estimates that are  
reasonable and prudent; 
(c)  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union (EU) have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial  
statements; and  
(d)  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time,  
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Governance section, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
– the Group financial statements, which have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true  
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position  
and loss of the Group; 
– the Directors’ report contained includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces; and 
– having taken all matters considered by the Board and brought  
to the attention of the Board during the year into account, the 
Directors consider that the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as 
a whole are fair, balanced and understandable. The Directors 
believe that the disclosures set out in the Annual Report & 
Accounts provide the information necessary for shareholders  
to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model 
and strategy. 
The financial statements on pages 97 to 139 were approved by the 
Board of Directors on 21 February 2017 and signed on its behalf by

REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Our opinion 
In our opinion: 
– Capital & Counties Properties PLC’s Group financial statements and Parent Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) 
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2016 and of the Group’s loss 
and the Group’s and the Parent Company’s cash flows for the year then ended; 
– the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
as adopted by the European Union; 
– the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
– the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
What we have audited 
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise: 
– the Group and Company Balance sheets as at 31 December 2016; 
– the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended; 
– the Group and Company Statements of cash flows for the year then ended; 
– the Consolidated and Company Statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and 
– the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. 
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006, and applicable law. 
Our audit approach 
Context 
Our 2016 audit was planned and executed having regard to the fact that Capital & Counties Properties PLC’s operations were largely 
unchanged in nature from the previous year; and that there have been no significant changes to the valuation methodology and 
accounting standards relevant to the Group. In light of this, our approach to the audit in terms of scoping and areas of focus was  
largely unchanged. 
Overview 
Materiality – Overall group materiality: £41 million (2015: £42 million) which represents 1% of total assets. 
– For income statement line items that are deemed to be of particular relevance, we applied a lower materiality. 
Audit scope – We audited the complete financial information of each of the Group’s four business lines of which Covent Garden,  
Earls Court and Venues are financially significant. 
Areas of focus – Valuation of investment and development properties. 
– Taxation. 
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). 
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that 
involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk 
of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a 
risk of material misstatement due to fraud.  
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to 
provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in 
this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.    www.capitalandcounties.com 93 
Financial statements Strategic report Governance
 
  www.capitalandcounties.com 93 
Area of focus   How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Valuation of investment and development properties
Refer to pages 64 to 66 (Audit Committee Report), pages 103 to 107 
(Principal Accounting Policies) and pages 103 to 139 (notes to the 
financial statements). 
The valuation of the Group’s investment and development properties is 
the key component of the net asset value and underpins the Group’s 
result for the year. The result of the revaluation this year was a loss  
of £235m (2015: gain of £454m), which is accounted for within 
‘(Loss)/Gain on revaluation and sale of investment and development 
property’ and is a significant component of the result for the year.  
The Group’s property portfolios, which comprise investment property 
(including retail, food and beverage, commercial, residential and 
exhibition space) as well as development property located in central 
London are not uniform in nature. Therefore, there are a number of 
different assumptions made by the Group’s third party valuers, Jones 
Lang LaSalle and CB Richard Ellis (the “Valuers”), in determining  
fair value: 
– Investment properties – The valuation of investment properties 
(predominantly Covent Garden) is inherently subjective, due 
principally to the individual nature of each property, which greatly 
influences the future rental it is expected to generate. The assumptions 
on which the property values are based are influenced by tenure and 
tenancy details for each property, prevailing market yields and the 
estimated rental value of each property. 
– Development properties – The valuation of development property 
(predominantly Earls Court) is also inherently subjective. Development 
properties are valued using the residual appraisal method (i.e. by 
estimating the fair value of the completed project using either a sales 
comparison or income capitalisation method less estimated costs to 
completion and market based profit margin providing a return on 
development risk). Macro-economic factors and uncertain market 
conditions have had an adverse impact on the valuation of 
development property. 
The fact that only a small percentage difference in individual property 
valuations, when aggregated, could result in a material misstatement, 
warrants specific audit focus on this area. 
The Valuers were engaged by the Directors, in accordance with the 
RICS Valuation – Professional Standards (“RICS”). 
 
Experience of Valuers and relevance of their work 
We read the Valuers’ reports from CB Richard Ellis and Jones Lang 
LaSalle. We confirmed that the approaches used were consistent  
with the RICS guidelines and the requirements of IFRSs as adopted  
by the European Union. We assessed the Valuers’ competence and 
capabilities and read their terms of engagement with the Group, 
determining that there were no matters that affected their independence 
and objectivity or imposed scope limitations upon them. 
Data provided to the Valuers 
For investment and development properties, we sample tested  
data provided to the Valuers by management and found that it was 
consistent with the information we audited. This data included tenancy 
schedules, capital expenditure details, cost schedules and square 
footage details which we agreed back to appropriate supporting 
documentation. For development properties, we agreed that the 
planned schemes being valued were consistent with the actual  
planned developments and, where appropriate, had achieved  
planning consents. 
Assumptions and estimates used by the Valuers 
We met with the Valuers independently of management and gained  
an understanding of the valuation methods and assumptions used. We 
compared the movement in capital values over the period with market 
sector benchmarks to help identify significant changes in assumptions. 
The nature of assumptions used varied across the portfolio, depending 
on the nature of each property but they included estimated capital 
values, investment yields, estimated rental values, construction costs  
and developers’ margins. In each of these areas, and on a sample 
basis, we compared the estimates and assumptions used by the Valuers 
against our own expectations, using evidence of comparable market 
transactions. Where we identified estimates and assumptions that were 
outside the typical ranges used, we discussed these with the Valuers to 
understand the rationale and then assessed, based on all the available 
evidence and our experience in this sector, whether the use of the 
estimate or assumption was justified. 
Our testing which involved the use of our internal real estate valuation 
specialists, qualified chartered surveyors with deep market knowledge, 
indicated that the estimates and assumptions used were appropriate in 
the context of the Group’s property portfolio and reflected the 
circumstances of the market in the year. 
Taxation 
Refer to pages 64 to 66 (Audit Committee Report), pages 103 to 107 
(Principal Accounting Policies) and pages 103 to 139 (notes to the 
financial statements). 
Tax is a specific risk for the Group due to the degree of judgement 
involved in some of the ongoing activities of the Group and the wider 
Group restructuring. This gives rise to material tax considerations on the 
calculation, recognition, and classification of current and deferred tax 
balances from both a tax compliance and accounting perspective. 
Judgements are made by management to arrive at the current and 
deferred tax position. These judgements include the impact of the 
transfer of investment properties and the Group holding structure. 
 
We assessed the principal assumptions and judgements made in 
arriving at the current and deferred tax position by using our experience 
of similar matters in the industry. 
We used our tax specialists to evaluate tax provisions and  
potential exposures as at 31 December 2016, challenging the  
Group’s assumptions and judgements through our knowledge of the  
tax circumstances and by reading relevant correspondence between  
the Group and Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs and the Group’s 
external tax advisors. 
We did not identify any matters that the Directors have not adequately 
reflected in their calculation of the necessary current and deferred  
tax provisions. 
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as  
a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
Group operates.  
The Group is structured along four business lines, Covent Garden, Earls Court Properties (including the Lillie Square development joint 
venture), Venues and Other. 
The Group engagement team audited all business lines except Venues (a significant component), where the audit procedures were 
performed by a component PwC engagement team. The Group team issued the Venues audit team with detailed instructions that 
explained the work that the Venues audit team needed to perform and highlighted, in particular, the areas of focus insofar as they were 
relevant to the Venues business line. Throughout the audit, the Group team communicated with the Venues team, and attended relevant 
meetings and reviewed the component team’s electronic audit working papers, to ensure that we obtained sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence to form a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.  Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 94

94 Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and on the financial statements as a whole.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
Overall Group materiality  £41 million (2015: £42 million). 
How we determined it  1% of total assets. 
Rationale for benchmark 
applied  
The key measure of the Group’s performance is the valuation of investment and development properties and 
the balance sheet as a whole. Given this, consistent with the prior year, we set an overall Group materiality 
level based on total assets. 
In addition to overall Group materiality, a specific materiality was also applied to certain areas of the income statement. In 2016, we  
refined our approach to specific materiality to align with the metrics in the income statement that we believe are of particular interest to 
the members and determined those metrics to be Net rental income, Loss on revaluation and sale of investment and development property 
and Net finance costs. In order to reflect their specific characteristics, we applied materiality levels of 10% of the respective amounts of these 
line items. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £2 million  
(2015: £2 million) on balance sheet items as well as misstatements below that amount based on a proportionate value of the relevant 
materiality figures for income statement line items and other matters that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Going concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ Statement, set out on page 90, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.  
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing  
the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Company have adequate resources to remain in operation, 
and that the Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we 
have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING 
Consistency of other information 
Companies Act 2006 opinions 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
– the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
– the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
– information in the Annual Report is: 
– materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
– apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of  
the Group and Company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
– otherwise misleading. 
 
We have no exceptions to report. 
– the statement given by the Directors on page 91, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole 
to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to 
assess the Group’s and Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Parent Company acquired in the 
course of performing our audit. 
 
We have no exceptions to report. 
– the section of the Annual Report on page 65, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee. 
 
We have no exceptions to report. 
 
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of 
the Group 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to: 
– the Directors’ confirmation on page 14 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 
of the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. 
 
We have nothing material to add or  
to draw attention to. 
– the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated. 
 
We have nothing material to add or  
to draw attention to. 
– the Directors’ explanation on page 17 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
 
We have nothing material to add or  
to draw attention to. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks  
facing the Group and the Directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than 
an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are 
in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in 
the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
– we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or 
– adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or 
– the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Directors’ remuneration report – Companies Act 2006 opinion 
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.  
Corporate governance statement 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, a corporate governance statement has not been prepared 
by the Parent Company. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further provisions of the 
Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review.

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT 
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 91, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs  
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance  
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
What an audit of financial statements involves 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
– whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
– the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
– the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures 
or a combination of both.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.

IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ (amendment) 
IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ (amendment) 
Amendments to IFRS (Annual improvements cycle 2012-2014) 
These pronouncements had no significant impact on the 
consolidated financial statements and resulted in no changes to 
presentation and disclosure.  
At the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements  
the following standards and interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not effective, 
and in some cases have not been adopted for use in the European 
Union are: 
IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ (amendment)  
IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’ (amendment)  
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ and IAS 28 
‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ (amendment) 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 
IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ (amendment)  
IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ (amendment) 
The Group has assessed the impact of these new standards and 
interpretations and do not anticipate any material impact on the 
financial statements.  
In relation to IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, 
the Group’s material revenue stream relates to property rental 
income. On the adoption of the standard this revenue stream  
will not be materially impacted due to property rental income 
continuing to be within the scope of IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and therefore  
is out of scope. As the Group is predominately a lessor, IFRS 16 
‘Leases’, will not have a material impact on adoption. Where the 
Group is currently a lessee, this relates to immaterial contracts.  
A summary of the Group’s principal accounting policies, which 
have been applied consistently across the Group is set out below. 
Going Concern 
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 
months from the date of approval of the financial statements 
and for this reason the consolidated financial statements have  
been prepared on a going concern basis. 
Basis of consolidation  
These consolidated financial statements include the consolidation 
of the following limited partnerships: Capital & Counties CGP, 
Capco CGP 2012 LP, CG Investments 2016 LP, EC Properties LP, 
Solum Group Holdings LP and The Empress State Limited 
Partnership. The members of these qualifying partnerships have 
taken advantage of exemptions available in Statutory Instrument 
2008/569 and therefore will not produce consolidated accounts at 
the partnership level. 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in British 
pounds sterling, which is also determined to be the functional 
currency of the Parent. 
Subsidiaries  
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the 
Group has control; it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over an entity. Subsidiaries cease  
to be consolidated from the date this control is lost. 
Non-controlling interests are recognised on the basis of their 
proportionate share in the recognised amounts of a subsidiary’s 
identifiable net assets. On the balance sheet non-controlling 
interests are presented separately from the equity of the owners of 
the Parent. Profit or loss and total comprehensive income for the 
period attributable to non-controlling interests are presented 
separately in the income statement and the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
and uncertainty 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in  
accordance with IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses from sources not 
readily apparent. Although these estimates and assumptions are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, historical 
experiences and other factors, actual results ultimately may differ 
from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate  
is revised if the revision affects only that period. 
Significant area of estimation and uncertainty is: 
Property valuation: The most significant area of estimation and 
uncertainty in the consolidated financial statements is in respect  
of the valuation of the property portfolio and investments, where 
external valuations are obtained. The valuation of the Group’s 
property portfolio is inherently subjective due to the assumptions 
as outlined within note 14 ‘Property Portfolio’. As a result, the 
valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to 
a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions 
which may not prove to be accurate and could therefore have a 
material effect on the Group’s financial performance and position. 
The key areas of accounting judgement are: 
Property classification: Judgement is required in the classification 
of property between investment, development, trading and  
owner occupied. Management considers each property separately 
and reviews factors including the long term intention for the 
property, in determining if trading, and the level of ancillary 
income, in determining if owner occupied, to ensure the 
appropriate classification.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
and uncertainty continued 
Revenue recognition: In making its judgement over revenue 
recognition for property transactions, management considered  
the detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue set out in IAS 18 
‘Revenue’ and, in particular, whether the Group had transferred  
to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the 
assets being disposed. Management also consider the appropriate 
accounting treatment of tenant lease incentives.  
Other less significant judgements and sources of estimation and 
uncertainty relate to provisions, share-based payment, contingent 
liabilities and pensions. 
Operating segments 
Management has determined the operating segments with 
reference to reports on divisional financial performance and 
position that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive,  
who is deemed to be the chief operating decision maker. 
Revenue recognition 
Rent receivable consists of gross income calculated on an accruals 
basis, together with services where the Group acts as principal in 
the ordinary course of business, excluding sales of property. Rental 
income is spread evenly over the period from lease commencement 
to lease expiry.  
Tenant lease incentive payments, including surrender premiums 
paid which can be directly linked to enhanced rental income, are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Upon receipt 
of a surrender premium for the early termination of a lease, the 
profit and non-recoverable outgoings relating to the lease 
concerned are immediately reflected in net rental income. 
Contingent rents, being those lease payments that are not fixed  
at the inception of a lease, for example increases arising on rent 
reviews, are recorded as income in the periods in which they  
are earned.  
Rent reviews are recognised as income, based on management 
estimates, when it is reasonable to assume they will be received. 
Estimates are derived from knowledge of market rents for 
comparable properties determined on an individual property  
basis and updated for progress of negotiations. 
Where revenue is obtained by the sale of property, it is recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to  
the buyer. This will normally take place on exchange of contracts 
unless there are conditions that suggest insufficient probability  
of future economic benefits flowing to the Group. For conditional 
exchanges, sales are recognised when these conditions are satisfied. 
Revenue arising from the sale of property under construction is 
generally recognised when both contracts have been exchanged  
and the building work is physically complete.  
Other income includes management fees charged to joint ventures 
for services associated with the management of properties and 
other general expenses as defined by management agreements. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and the effective interest rate. 
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to 
receive payment has been established. 
Non-underlying items 
Non-underlying items are those items that in the Directors’  
view are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size  
or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial 
performance. Items deemed as non-underlying are impairment 
charges, net valuation gain/losses (including profits/losses on 
disposal), net refinancing charges, costs of termination of derivative 
financial instruments and non-recurring costs and income. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional 
currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
transaction date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting  
from settlement of these transactions and from retranslation of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are recognised in the income statement except for differences 
arising on the retranslation of available-for-sale investments  
which are recognised in other comprehensive income.  
Income taxes 
Current tax is the amount payable on the taxable income for the 
year and any adjustment in respect of prior years. It is calculated 
using rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by  
the balance sheet date.  
In accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’, deferred tax is  
provided for using the balance sheet liability method on temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of those assets 
and liabilities. However, temporary differences are not recognised 
to the extent that they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss; or are associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where  
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be 
controlled by the parent, venture or investor, respectively, and  
it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in  
the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected 
to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the 
deferred tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
management believes it is probable that future taxable profit will 
be available against which the deferred tax assets can be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities 
and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income 
taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the same taxable 
group or different taxable entities where there is an intention to 
settle balances on a net basis.  
Tax is included in the income statement except when it relates  
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly  
in equity, in which case the related tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.  
For tax purposes, an investment property accounted for at fair 
value will normally be recovered through sale rather than use.  
Discontinued operation 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business 
that represents a separate major line of the business that has been 
disposed of or meets the criteria for classification as held for sale. 
Discontinued operations are presented separately from continuing 
operations in both the income statement and statement of  
cash flows. 
Share-based payment 
The cost of granting share options and other share-based 
remuneration to employees and Directors is recognised through 
the income statement with reference to the fair value of the 
instrument at the date of grant. 
The income statement is charged over the vesting period of the 
options with a corresponding increase in equity. An option pricing 
model is used applying assumptions around expected yields, 
forfeiture rates, exercise price and volatility.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Share-based payment continued 
Upon eventual exercise, a reserves transfer occurs with no further 
charge reflected in the income statement. 
Own shares held in connection with employee share plans and 
other share-based payment arrangements are treated as treasury 
shares and deducted from equity.  
Investment and development property 
Investment and development property are owned or leased  
by the Group and held for long-term rental income and  
capital appreciation. 
The Group has chosen to use the fair value model. Property and  
any related obligations are initially recognised when the significant 
risks and rewards attached to the property have transferred to the 
Group. Payments made in respect of the future acquisition of 
investment and development property, as is the case for the CLSA, 
are initially recognised as prepayments until the recognition 
criteria outlined above have been met. Investment and 
development property are recorded at cost and subsequently 
revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined  
by professionally qualified external valuers on the basis of  
market value after allowing for future transaction costs. 
The fair value of property is arrived at by adjusting the market 
value as above for directly attributable tenant lease incentives  
and fixed head leases. 
Property held under leases is stated gross of the recognised finance 
lease liability. 
The valuation is based upon assumptions as outlined within the 
property portfolio note. These assumptions conform with the  
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation 
Professional Standards. The cost of development properties 
includes capitalised interest and other directly attributable 
outgoings, with the exception of properties and land where  
no development is imminent in which case no interest is  
included. Interest is capitalised (before tax relief) on the basis  
of the weighted average cost of debt outstanding until the  
date of practical completion. 
When the Group redevelops a property for continued future use, 
that property is classified as investment and development property 
during the redevelopment period and continues to be measured  
at fair value. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment 
and development property are recognised in the income statement 
in the period in which they arise. Depreciation is not provided in 
respect of investment property including plant and equipment 
integral to such investment property. Investment and development 
properties cease to be recognised as investment and development 
property when they have been disposed of or when they cease  
to be held for the purpose of generating rental income or for  
capital appreciation. 
Disposals are recognised on completion. Gains or losses arising  
are recognised in the income statement. The gain on disposal is 
determined as the difference between the net sales proceeds and  
the carrying amount of the asset at the commencement of the 
accounting period plus capital expenditure in the period.  
A property ceases to be recognised as investment and development 
property and is transferred at its fair value to trading property 
when in the Directors’ judgement, development commences with 
the intention of sale. Criteria considered in this assessment include 
the Board’s stated intention, contractual commitments and 
physical, legal and financial viability. 
When the use of a property changes from trading property to 
investment and development property, the property is transferred at 
fair value with any resulting gain recognised in the income statement. 
Trading property 
Trading property comprises those properties that in the  
Directors’ view are not held for long-term rental income or capital 
appreciation and are expected to be disposed of within one year of 
the balance sheet date or to be developed with the intention to sell.  
Such property is constructed, acquired, or if transferred from 
investment and development property, transferred at fair value 
which is deemed to represent cost. Subsequently trading property 
is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable 
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling costs. 
This approximates market value as determined by professionally 
qualified external valuers at the balance sheet date.  
The amount of any write down of trading property to market  
value is recognised as an expense in the period the write down 
occurs. Should a valuation uplift occur in a subsequent period,  
the amount of any reversal shall be recognised as a reduction in  
the previous write down in the period in which the uplift occurs. 
This may not exceed the property’s cost.  
The sale of trading property is recognised as income when the 
significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer. 
Total costs incurred in respect of trading property are recognised 
simultaneously as an expense.  
Leases 
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction. 
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease. All other 
leases are normally classified as operating leases.  
Group as a lessee: 
In accordance with IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’, property  
held under finance and operating leases may be accounted for  
as investment property. Finance leases are recognised as both an 
asset and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments. 
The investment property asset is included in the balance sheet at 
the lower of fair value and the present value of minimum lease 
payments, gross of the recognised finance lease liability. Lease 
payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges  
so as to achieve a constant financing rate. 
Other finance leased assets are capitalised at the lower of the fair 
value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term 
and the useful life of the asset.  
Rental expenses under operating leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Plant and equipment 
Plant and equipment consist of fixtures, fittings and other  
office equipment. Plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment  
losses. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset  
plus any attributable cost in bringing the asset to its working 
condition for its intended use. Depreciation is charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over an asset’s  
estimated useful life to a maximum of five years. 
Investment in Group companies  
Investment in Group companies, which eliminate on consolidation, 
is stated in the Company’s separate financial statements at cost less 
impairment losses, if any. Impairment losses are determined with 
reference to the investment’s fair value less estimated selling costs. 
Fair value is derived from the subsidiary’s, and their subsidiaries’, 
net assets at the balance sheet date. On disposal, the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and its carrying amount is 
included in the income statement.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Investment in joint ventures 
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has 
joint control, established by contractual agreement. Investments in 
joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. On initial 
recognition the investment is recognised at cost, and the carrying 
amount is subsequently increased or decreased to recognise the 
Group’s share of the profit or loss of the joint venture after the date 
of acquisition. Goodwill, if any, on acquisition is included in the 
carrying amount of the investment.  
The Group’s investment in joint ventures is presented separately  
on the balance sheet and the Group’s share of the joint venture’s 
post-tax profit or loss for the period is also presented separately  
in the income statement.  
Where there is an indication that the Group’s investment in joint 
ventures may be impaired the Group evaluates the recoverable 
amount of its investment, being the higher of the joint venture’s 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the recoverable 
amount is lower than the carrying value an impairment loss  
is recognised in the income statement.  
If the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds  
its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise 
further losses, unless it has legal or constructive obligations to 
make payments on behalf of the joint venture. 
Available-for-sale investments 
Available-for-sale investments, being investments intended  
to be held for an indefinite period, are initially recognised and 
subsequently measured at fair value.  
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of  
available-for-sale investments are included in other comprehensive 
income, except to the extent that losses are determined to be 
attributable to impairment, in which case they are recognised in the 
income statement and may not be reversed in subsequent periods. 
Disposals are recorded upon distribution, at which time 
accumulated fair value adjustments are recycled from reserves  
to the income statement. 
Derivative financial instruments  
The Group uses non-trading derivative financial instruments  
to manage exposure to interest rate risk. They are initially 
recognised on the trade date at fair value and subsequently 
remeasured at fair value based on market price. The method of 
recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the 
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the 
nature of the item being hedged.  
Instruments that have not been designated as qualifying for  
hedge accounting are classified as held for trading. Changes in  
fair value of these instruments are recognised directly in the  
income statement.  
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a highly 
probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge). For hedging 
instruments, the Group documents at the inception of the 
transaction the relationship between hedging instruments  
and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives  
and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions. The Group  
also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on  
an on-going basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes  
in cash flows of hedged items. 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives  
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised  
in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit 
or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.  
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge  
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is 
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised 
in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in 
equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.  
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value  
and subsequently measured at amortised cost. The Directors 
exercise judgement as to the collectability of the Group’s trade  
and other receivables and determine when it is appropriate to 
impair these assets. 
Impairment of financial assets 
An annual review is conducted for financial assets to determine 
whether there is any evidence of a loss event as described by IAS 39 
‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. Factors 
such as days past due, credit status of the counterparty, historical 
evidence of collection and probability of deriving future economic 
benefit are considered to assess whether there is objective evidence 
of impairment. The amount of any potential loss is calculated by 
estimating future cash flows or by using fair value where this is 
available through observable market prices. If, in a subsequent 
period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the 
decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the 
original impairment was recognised, the impairment reversal is 
recognised in the income statement on a basis consistent with  
the original charge. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at fair value. Cash and 
cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits with banks and 
other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade payables are obligations for goods or services acquired  
in the ordinary course of business. Trade and other payables are 
recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost until settled. 
Deposits 
Property deposits and on account receipts are held within trade and 
other payables. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to shareholders are recognised as a liability 
once approved by shareholders. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a current obligation 
arising from a past event and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are ordinarily recognised initially at their net proceeds 
as an approximation of fair value. 
If the transaction price is not an approximation of fair value  
at initial recognition, the Group determines the fair value as 
evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical 
instrument or based on a valuation technique that uses data from 
observable markets. Where equity holders of the Group are party  
to the transaction the difference between the net proceeds and  
fair value is recognised within equity.

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED  
Borrowings continued 
Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any 
transaction costs, premiums or discounts are capitalised and 
recognised over the contractual life of the loan using the effective 
interest rate method; or on a straight line basis where it is 
impractical to do so. 
In the event of early repayment, transaction costs, premiums or 
discounts paid or unamortised costs are recognised immediately  
in the income statement.  
Pensions 
The costs of the defined contribution scheme and the Group’s 
personal pension plans are charged against profits in the year in 
which they fall due.  
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and 
changes in actuarial assumptions of the defined benefit scheme are 
recognised immediately as a charge in other comprehensive income 
for the period in which they arise with a corresponding increase in 
the pension surplus or deficit. 
These re-measurements are not reclassified to the income 
statement in subsequent periods. Past service costs, current  
service costs, curtailment or settlement gains or losses and net 
interest income or expense are recognised immediately in the 
income statement. Net interest is calculated by applying the 
discount rate to the opening plan assets and scheme obligation.  
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method  
and applying assumptions which are agreed between the Group 
and its actuaries. 
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments 
Contingent liabilities are disclosed where there are present or 
possible obligations arising from past events, but the economic 
impact is uncertain in timing, occurrence or amount. A description 
of the nature and, where possible, an estimate of the financial effect 
of contingent liabilities are disclosed. 
Capital commitments are disclosed when the Group has a 
contractual future obligation which has not been provided for  
at the balance sheet date. Amounts are only provided for where 
such obligations are onerous. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a 
deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.  
Where the Group’s own shares are re-purchased, the consideration 
paid is classified as treasury shares and deducted from equity. 
Where such shares are subsequently sold or re-issued, any 
consideration received is included in equity. 
2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING 
Management has determined the operating segments based  
on reports reviewed by the Chief Executive, who is deemed to  
be the chief operating decision maker. The principal performance 
measures have been identified as net rental income and net  
asset value.  
For management and reporting purposes the Group  
is organised into four divisions: 
– Covent Garden; 
– Earls Court Properties represents the Group’s interests in the 
Earls Court area, comprising properties held in ECPL, Lillie 
Square, the Empress State Building and a number of smaller 
properties in the Earls Court area; 
– Venues comprises the Olympia London property assets and 
Maclise Road; and 
– Other comprises Solum, the discontinued activity of The Great 
Capital Partnership, the Group’s residual China investments, 
other head office companies and investments, including the 
payment of internal rent. 
Management information, previously reported on a proportionally 
consolidated basis until 2015, is now reported to the chief operating 
decision maker on a Group share basis. Consequentially the 
comparative period has been re-presented in line with reporting 
requirements. Outlined below is the Group share by segment: 
Segment Group Share
Covent Garden 100%
Earls Court Properties 
ECPL  63%
Lillie Square 50%
Empress State 100%
Other 100%
 
Venues 100%
Other 
Solum 50%
GCP 50%
Other 100%
Segmental reporting has been presented in line with management 
information and therefore consolidation adjustments are presented 
to reconcile segmental performance and position to the IFRS total.  
The Group’s operating segments derive their revenue primarily 
from rental income from lessees, with the exception of Venues 
which derives revenue from licence fees from the letting of space.  
Unallocated expenses consist primarily of costs incurred centrally 
which are neither directly nor meaningfully attributable to 
individual segments.

Following an impairment review of amounts receivable from joint ventures by the Group, an impairment of £14.8 million has been

14 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONTINUED 
At 31 December 2016, the Group was contractually committed to £149.2 million (2015: £162.5 million) of future expenditure for the 
purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property. Refer to note 28 ‘Capital 
Commitments’ for further information on capital commitments.  
The fair value of the Group’s investment, development and trading property at 31 December 2016 was determined by independent, 
appropriately qualified external valuers, Jones Lang LaSalle for Earls Court Properties (excluding the Empress State Building) and  
Venues; and CB Richard Ellis for the remainder of the Group’s property portfolio. The valuations conform to the Royal Institution  
of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation Professional Standards. Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts. 
Each year the Executive Directors, on behalf of the Board, appoint the external valuers. The valuers are selected based upon their 
knowledge, independence and reputation for valuing assets such as those held by the Group. 
Valuations are performed bi-annually and are performed consistently across all properties in the Group’s portfolio. At each reporting  
date appropriately qualified employees of the Group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs. Valuers submit  
and present summary reports to the Group’s Audit Committee, with the Executive Directors reporting to the Board on the outcome  
of each valuation round. 
Valuations take into account tenure, lease terms and structural condition. The inputs underlying the valuations include market rent  
or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, forecast growth rates, yields, EBITDA, discount rates, construction costs 
including any site specific costs (for example Section 106), professional fees, planning fees, developer’s profit including contingencies, 
planning and construction timelines, lease re-gear costs, planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar 
properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development. 
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use. When considering the highest and best use a valuer will 
consider, on a property by property basis, its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable. Where the 
highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing  
this change in arriving at its valuation.  
A number of the Group’s properties have been valued on the basis of their development potential which differs from their existing  
use. In respect of development valuations, the valuer ordinarily considers the gross development value of the completed scheme based 
upon assumptions of capital values, rental values and yields of the properties which would be created through the implementation of the 
development. Deductions are then made for anticipated costs, including an allowance for developer’s profit before arriving at a valuation.  
Most notably, within Earls Court Properties, the Empress State Building has been valued on the basis of its development potential as a 
residential led scheme. The property is currently used as an office space, generating an income stream for the Group, while the process to 
achieve the change in use is being implemented. Within the Covent Garden segment, where appropriate, a number of properties have also 
been valued on the basis of their development potential, principally for the conversion to residential use or for improving the 
configuration of retail units.  
There are often restrictions on both freehold and leasehold property which could have a material impact on the realisation of these assets. 
The most significant of these occur when planning permission is required or when a credit facility is in place. These restrictions are 
factored into the property’s valuation by the external valuer. Refer to disclosures surrounding property risks on page 17.  
Non-financial assets carried at fair value, as is the case for investment and development property held by the Group, are required to be 
analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ (“IFRS 13”). Trading property is 
exempted from IFRS 13 disclosure requirements. The different valuation levels are defined as: 
Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets; 
Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either  
directly or from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices; and 
Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data. Valuations at this level are more subjective and 
therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models. Such testing has not indicated that any 
material difference would arise due to a change in input variables. 
When the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes, consideration is given as to whether a transfer between  
fair value levels is deemed to have occurred. Unobservable data becoming observable market data would determine a transfer from  
Level 3 to Level 2. All investment and development property held by the Group are classified as Level 3.

At 31 December  3,861.1 3,887.2  
For properties valued under the income capitalisation method, if all other factors remained equal, an increase in estimated rental value of 
five per cent would result in an increased asset valuation of £111.8 million (2015: £103.2 million). A decrease in the estimated rental value of 
five per cent would result in a decreased asset value of £108.7 million (2015: £100.8 million). Conversely, an increased equivalent yield of  
25 basis points would result in a decreased asset valuation of £159.8 million (2015: £149.3 million). A decreased equivalent yield of 25 basis 
points would result in an increased asset valuation of £182.9 million (2015: £172.8 million). These inputs are interdependent, partially 
determined by market conditions. The impact on the valuation could be mitigated by the interrelationship between the two inputs.  
An increase in estimated rental value occurring in conjunction with an increase in equivalent yield could result in no net impact to  
the valuation. 
An increase in the estimated construction costs included in a residual development valuation of 10 per cent would result in a decrease in the 
asset valuation of £238.1 million (2015: £235.9 million). A decrease in the estimated construction costs included in a residual development 
valuation of 10 per cent would result in an increase in the asset valuation of £239.4 million (2015: £239.4 million). 
An increase in the discount rate included in a discount cash flow valuation of 10 per cent would result in a decrease in the asset valuation of 
£22.4 million (2015: £28.7 million). A decrease in the discount rate included in a discount cash flow valuation of 10 per cent would result in 
an increase in the asset valuation of £38.4 million (2015: £35.7 million).

During the year, unsecured, non-interest bearing loan notes were issued by ECPL to TTL Earls Court Properties Limited. As the transaction 
price of the loan notes was not an approximation of their fair value, the Group determined the fair value by using data from observable 
inputs. As a result, the initial fair value of the loan notes was valued at less than £0.1 million (2015: less than £0.1 million) and therefore 
£402.6 million (2015: £398.3 million) has been classified as equity.

In January 2016, the Group replaced the £665 million Covent Garden debt facility with a £705 million five year Covent Garden debt  
facility which increased available facilities by £40 million. £640 million of the facility matures in 2021 with the remaining £65 million 
maturing in 2020 with an option to extend to 2021. Both portions have an additional option to extend to 2022. The Group has incurred  
a charge of approximately £2.7 million relating to fees on the new facility and has written off £5.2 million relating to unamortised fees  
on the existing facility. 
On 24 March 2016, The Group entered into a £150 million 10 year secured credit agreement signed by ECPL to fund infrastructure-related 
costs on land interests at Earls Court. The Group has capitalised charges of £1.0 million relating to fees on the new facility. 
On 14 November 2016, the Group issued a US Private Placement of £125 million 10 year and a £50 million 12 year senior unsecured notes. 
The Group incurred and capitalised charges of £0.8 million as a result of the placement. 
On 19 December 2016, the Group entered into a £100 million four year facility agreement secured over the Olympia Exhibition Centre. The 
Group incurred and capitalised charges of £1.1 million relating to fees on the new facility. 
The market value of investment and development property secured as collateral against borrowings at 31 December 2016 was £1,545.6 
million (2015: £286.0 million).  
Cash and undrawn committed facilities attributable to the Group at 31 December 2016 were £563.6 million (2015: £366.9 million). 
The fair values of the Group’s borrowings have been estimated using the market value for floating rate borrowings, which approximates 
nominal value, and discounted cash flow approach for fixed rate borrowings, representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by 
IFRS 13. The different valuation levels are defined in note 14 ‘Property Portfolio’.

Finance lease liabilities are in respect of leasehold interests in investment and development property. Certain leases provide for payment  
of contingent rent, usually a proportion of net rental income, in addition to the minimum lease payments above. No contingent rent has 
been paid in the year (2015: £nil).  
A 999 year leasehold interest is held for the air rights above the West London Line as detailed in note 29 ‘Contingent Liabilities’. Any 
further payments payable at the time of development or disposal of each phase of the Earls Court Masterplan will be accounted for as 
contingent rent when incurred. 
Finance lease liabilities are effectively secured obligations, as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default.

24 OPERATING LEASES 
The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment property to tenants under operating leases. 
In the United Kingdom standard commercial leases vary considerably between markets and locations but typically are for a term of five  
to fifteen years at market rent with provisions to review every five years. 
The future minimum lease amounts receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

25 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group’s financial risk management strategy seeks to set financial limits for treasury activity to ensure they are in line with the risk 
appetite of the Group. The Group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the Group’s operations: market risk (principally interest rate 
risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. 
The following tables set out each class of financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015.

The majority of the Group’s financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board  
of Directors. The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are 
summarised below. 
Market risk 
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a 
financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial 
instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas 
borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using fixed interest rate derivatives. Interest rate swaps have 
the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates. Interest rate caps protect the Group by capping the maximum 
interest rate payable at the caps ceiling. Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate payable at the collar’s 
ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor.

1 Excludes current loan notes of £6.0 million to which the Group has no interest rate exposure under the terms of the borrowing . 
Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection on Group external debt is greater than 25 per cent. 
The weighted average rate of interest rate swaps currently effective at 31 December 2016 was 2.2 per cent (2015: 2.2 per cent). 
In 2016, the Group entered into a forward starting interest rate swap to hedge the variability in specified hedged interest cash flows arising 
on £60 million of outstanding debt from 2016 to 2026. The loss recognised in other comprehensive income in the year was £1.2 million. 
This loss will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement over the term of the designated debt. 
The fair value of the designated hedging instrument at 31 December 2016 is £nil. The hedge was 100 per cent effective; therefore no charge 
for an ineffective portion has been taken to the consolidated income statement. 
The sensitivity analysis below illustrates the impact of a 50 basis point (“bps”) shift, upwards and downwards, in the level of interest rates 
on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments.

The sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve  
that may actually occur and represents management’s assessment of possible changes in interest rates. The fixed rate derivative financial 
instruments are matched by floating rate debt, therefore such a movement would have a very limited effect on Group cash flow overall. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.  
The Group’s policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing 
risk. The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest cost. 
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Group’s operational requirements and investment commi tments.  
The Group’s policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed and undrawn facilities. 
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entity’s ability to meet the relevant facility’s 
financial covenants. The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.  
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through the 
regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates. Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the contracted 
maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk. This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time of the desired 
refinancing. This was the strategy employed in the refinancing of existing borrowings in 2016.  
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to 
make payments of interest and to repay principal. Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate, the rates used are  
those implied by the par yield curve.

Contractual maturities reflect the expected maturities of financial instruments. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are trade and other receivables, amounts receivable from joint ventures, loan notes and cash and  
cash equivalents. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. Credit risk 
arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Group’s undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such  
as cash deposits and loans with financial counterparties. The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements 
represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking into account the value of any deposits or guarantees obtained. 
Trade and other receivables:  
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed; tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously  
monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default. Trade receivables are less 
than 1 per cent of total assets at 31 December 2016 (2015: less than 1 per cent) and no one tenant accounts for more than 10 per cent of rental income. 
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, by obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial 
information. As a result, deposits or guarantees may be obtained. The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2016 was  
£7.8 million (2015: £7.3 million). 
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is Group policy to calculate any impairment specifically  
on each contract. 
In relation to the Group’s revenue from licencing fees, receivables greater than 90 days are provided for in full. Additionally, specific 
provisions are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability concerns. The amounts of 
trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.  
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: 
 
Group  
2016  
£m 
Group 
2015 
£m
Up to 90 days 7.3 6.6
Over 90 days 0.6 – 
Trade receivables 7.9 6.6
In 2016 there was an impairment write down on trade receivables of £0.6 million (2015: £0.1 million).  
As the Group operates predominantly in central London, it is subject to some geographical risk. However, this is mitigated by the 
extensive range of tenants from varying business sectors and the credit review process as noted above. 
Amounts receivable from joint ventures: 
Included within receivables is £7.0 million (2015: £10.0 million) of amounts advanced to LSJV. The carrying value of the investment in  
LSJV is £nil (2015: £nil) as the Group’s share of losses exceeds the cost of its investment. Total funding advanced to LSJV, excluding the 
deep discount bonds, of £53.2 million (2015: £41.5 million) has been impaired by the cumulative losses attributable to the joint venture  
by £46.3 million (2015: £31.5 million).   Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 128 
Notes to the accounts continued 
 
128 Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2016 
25 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
LSJV is in a net liability position due to carrying trading property at the lower of cost and market value. However based on a market 
valuation undertaken by the Group’s valuers Jones Lang LaSalle, there is an unrecognised surplus of £46.6 million (Group share) as at  
31 December 2016. This surplus will only be evidenced on sale of trading property when significant risks and rewards have transferred  
to the buyer. Therefore, while Lillie Square demonstrates positive pricing evidence commercially and funding provided is not deemed  
to be at risk of default, for reporting purposes the Group is required to impair amounts advanced to LSJV until the unrecognised surplus 
on trading property is realised through sale. 
Cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments:  
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury. Relationships  
are maintained with a number of Tier 1 institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group cash investment policy relating  
to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties. The maximum exposure to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments as at  
31 December 2016 amounted to £31.1 million (2015: £67.7 million). 
Capital structure 
The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and  
by managing the capital structure. The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and other financial instruments and aims to access both debt  
and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.  
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and the interest cover ratio. The Group aims 
not to exceed an underlying debt to asset ratio of more than 40 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent. These ratios are 
disclosed on a Group share basis in line with the reporting of this information internally to management. These metrics are discussed in 
the Financial Review on pages 40 to 46.

25 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
All of the Group’s Level 3 financial instruments are unlisted equity investments. The valuation of the available-for-sale investment is based 
on expected cash distributions to be received from China Harvest Fund 1 with reference to the market value of the underlying assets held. 
During the year the final proceeds were received by the Group. The China Harvest Fund 1 is expected to be liquidated in 2017. 
The fair values of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents, other financial assets and other financial liabilities are not materially different 
from those at which they are carried in the financial statements. 
The table below presents a reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements for the year.

26 DEFERRED TAX  
The decrease in corporation tax rate referred to in note 11 ‘Taxation’ has been enacted for the purposes of IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ (“IAS 12”) 
and therefore has been reflected in these consolidated financial statements based on the expected timing of the realisation of deferred tax.  
Deferred tax on investment and development property is calculated under IAS 12 provisions on a disposals basis by reference to the 
properties’ original tax base cost. Elements factored into the calculation include indexation relief and the Group’s holding structure.  
The Group’s recognised deferred tax liability on investment and development property as calculated under IAS 12 is £nil at 31 December 
2016 (2015: £15.6 million). The Group’s contingent tax liability on investment properties, calculated on the same tax base cost as above but 
based on a deemed market value disposal at year end, is £nil (2015: £17.6 million).  
A disposal of the Group’s trading properties including Lillie Square at their market value as per note 14 ‘Property Portfolio’ would result in 
a corporation tax charge to the Group of £9.6 million (20.0 per cent of £48.1 million).

At 21 February 2017, the Company had an unexpired authority to repurchase shares up to a maximum of 84,198,894 shares with  
a nominal value of £21.0 million, and the Directors had an unexpired authority to allot up to a maximum of 559,185,325 shares with  
a nominal value of £139.8 million of which 280,382,318 with a nominal value of £70.0 million can only be allotted pursuant to a fully  
pre-emptive rights issue. 
28 CAPITAL COMMITMENTS 
At 31 December 2016, the Group was contractually committed to £149.2 million (2015: £162.5 million) of future expenditure for the 
purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property. Of the £149.2 million 
committed, £114.7 million is committed 2017 expenditure.  
In November 2013, the Group exercised its option under the CLSA which it entered into with LBHF in January 2013 in relation to LBHF’s 
land interest within the Earls Court Masterplan. Under the terms of the CLSA, the Group can draw down land in phases but no land can be 
transferred unless replacement homes for the residents of the relevant phase have been provided and vacant possession is given. The Group 
has already paid £60.0 million of the £105.0 million cash consideration payable under the CLSA. The residual £45.0 million will be settled 
in three annual instalments of £15.0 million with the next payment due on 31 December 2017. 
The Group’s share of joint venture capital commitments arising on LSJV amounts to £18.2 million (2015: £48.6 million).  
29 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of legal claims, guarantees and warranties arising from the ordinary course of business. 
Contingent liabilities that may result in material liabilities are described below.  
Under the terms of the CLSA the Group has certain compensation obligations relating to achieving vacant possession, which are subject  
to an overall cap of £55.0 million. Should any payments be made in respect of these obligations, they will be deducted from the total 
consideration payable to LBHF (refer to note 28 ‘Capital Commitments’). 
In March 2013, an agreement with Network Rail was signed to acquire a 999 year leasehold interest in the air rights above the West London 
Line where it runs within the Earls Court and West Kensington Opportunity Area. Within the terms of the agreement, the Group can 
exercise options during the next 50 years for further 999 year leases over the remainder of the West London Line to allow for development 
within the Earls Court Masterplan. Network Rail is entitled to further payments of 5.55 per cent of the residual land value which will be 
payable at the time of development or disposal of each phase of the Earls Court Masterplan. Any further payments to Network Rail will be 
treated as contingent rent as per note 23 ‘Finance Lease Obligations’.  
Within the terms of the agreement of the acquisition of the Northern Access Road land, the vendor’s successor in title is entitled to further 
payments until 2027 if certain conditions are met. Further payments become due following the grant of a planning permission for change 
of use or on disposal. In the event such planning permission is implemented, the payment is calculated at 50 per cent of the uplift in land 
value following the grant of the permission. In the event of a disposal, the payment is calculated as 50 per cent of the difference between 
the sale value against the land value without the relevant permission.

32 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes relating to employee benefits and incentives. Approval of a new 
remuneration policy and Performance Share Plan will be sought at the 2017 AGM. All disclosures in this note refer to the previous  
long-term incentive arrangement. All schemes are equity settled with the increase in equity measured by reference to the fair value of  
the Group’s equity instruments at the grant date of the share awards. The corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-line basis  
over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest. The total expense recognised in  
the consolidated income statement in respect of share-based payments for 2016 was £1.1 million (2015: £4.6 million). 
Reconciliations of movements in share incentive schemes are given in the tables on pages 133 to 134. 
1. Performance share plan 
Market value and nil cost options to subscribe for ordinary shares and conditional awards of free shares may be awarded under the  
Group Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). 
Exercise at the vesting date is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee 
(“the Committee”) at the time of grant.  
All awards are subject to performance conditions relating to: 
– the Group’s Total Return (“TR”) over three consecutive financial years (“the TR Performance Period”) relative to the median of the TRs 
over the equivalent period of the Group, Intu Properties plc, Land Securities Group PLC, British Land Company plc, Hammerson plc, 
Segro plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Shaftesbury plc (“the Comparator Group”); and  
– the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) over a period of three years (“the TSR Performance Period”) relative to the median  
of the TSRs over the same period of the Comparator Group. 
One half of each award will be subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.  
TR is the growth in the adjusted, diluted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends per ordinary share paid during the  
TR Performance Period. In calculating TR for a company which is not a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”), any provision for 
contingent capital gains tax will be added back.  
TSR is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus the value of any dividends paid during the TSR Performance Period re-invested  
in ordinary shares.  
Full details of the performance criteria and vesting outcomes are set out on pages 72, 73, 81 and 82. 
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that TR and TSR performance figures are a genuine reflection  
of underlying financial performance and may exercise discretion when determining the proportion of an award that will vest.

Financial statements Strategic report Governance
 
  www.capitalandcounties.com 133 
32 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED 
During any performance period, the Committee may, at its discretion, remove from the Comparator Group a company which has  
ceased to be quoted or to exist or the relevance of which as a comparator has, in the opinion of the Committee, significantly diminished.  
The Committee may also, at its discretion, add to the Comparator Group (whether to replace a removed member or otherwise) if it  
believes that such addition will enhance the relevance of the Comparator Group. 
The options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of 10 years. In general, options are forfeited if the 
employee leaves the Group before the options vest. 
In 2011 a schedule to the PSP was approved by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) as a Company Share Option Plan (“CSOP”) 
scheme; therefore the Company may make a proportion of awards as approved options. 
Share options outstanding at 31 December 2016 were exercisable between nil pence and 388.0 pence and have a weighted average 
remaining contractual life of eight years and are exercisable between 2017 and 2026.

satisfaction of performance conditions. 
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of shares and share options awarded under the PSP was  
£0.6 million (2015: £2.7 million). 
2. Matching share plan 
Under the Group Matching Share Plan (“MSP”), deferred shares may be awarded as part of any bonus. These awards may also be made  
as nil cost options.  
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that 
participants remain employed by the Group for a specified time, typically three years, from the date of the award. Awards of nil cost 
options were made in both the current and comparative periods. The fair value of share awards is determined by the market price  
of the shares at the grant date.

Under the MSP, awards, which may be awarded as nil cost options, may also be made in respect of certain shares purchased by Directors  
or in respect of awards of the deferred shares or nil cost options described above made under the Company’s annual bonus scheme.  
The matching share award comprises the same number of shares as are purchased or deferred. In exceptional circumstances the  
matching awards may comprise or be increased to 200 per cent of the number of shares purchased or deferred. 
Vesting of matching shares and matching nil cost options is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions. Vesting  
of matching shares will occur on the later of the third anniversary of grant and the date on which the performance outcome is finally 
determined. The matching nil cost options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years. Full details  
of the performance criteria and vesting outcomes are set out on pages 72, 73, 81 and 82. 
Matching nil cost options and share awards generally lapse if the Director leaves the Company or sells any of the related purchased  
or deferred shares. 
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of shares and share options awarded under the MSP was  
£0.5 million (2015: £1.9 million).

As stated above, one half of each award granted is subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance 
condition. The fair value of share awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the half that is subject to the  
TR performance condition and using the stochastic pricing model for the half that is subject to the TSR performance condition. Inputs  
to the models for share awards during the year are as follows:

33 PENSIONS 
1. Current pension arrangements 
The Venues business has a hybrid pension scheme comprising a money purchase section that was closed on 28 February 2014 and a final 
salary section which closed to new members in 2006, and closed to future benefit accrual on 31 December 2011. The final salary section is a 
funded defined benefit scheme (“the Scheme”) which is contracted out of State Second Pension. On closure of the money purchase section 
of the Venues’ pension scheme, a defined contribution group personal pension plan was offered to eligible Venues employees.  
The Scheme is subject to the Statutory Funding Objective under the Pensions Act 2004. A valuation of the Scheme is carried out at least 
once every three years to determine whether the Statutory Funding Objective is met. As part of the process the Company must agree with 
the Trustee of the Scheme the contributions to be paid to address any shortfall against the Statutory Funding Objective.  
The Scheme is managed by a board of Trustees (the “Trustee”) appointed in part by the Company and part from elections by members of 
the Scheme. The Trustee has responsibility for obtaining valuations of the Scheme, administering benefit payments and investing the 
Scheme’s assets. The Trustee delegates some of these functions to professional advisers where appropriate. 
The Group’s current policy is largely to provide future retirement benefits through defined contribution arrangements. 
The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks: 
– Investment risk – the Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these 
assets are expected to provide positive real returns over the long-term, the short-term volatility can cause additional funding to be 
required if deficit emerges. 
– Interest rate risk – the Scheme’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.  
As the Scheme holds assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way. 
– Inflation risk – a significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation. Although the Scheme’s assets are 
expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long-term, movements over the short-term could lead to deficits emerging. 
– Mortality risk – in the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Scheme. 
– Member options – Certain benefit options may be exercised by members without requiring the consent of the Trustee or the Company, 
for example exchanging pension for cash at retirement.

Equities are developed based on the selection of an appropriate risk premium above the risk free rate which is measured in accordance with 
the yield on government bonds. Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to 
the Scheme’s holdings of these instruments. The assets do not include any investment in shares of the Group.

Increases to deferred pensions before payment 2.7 2.2
Post retirement mortality assumption (2016: S2 PXA CMI; 2015: S1 PXA CMI) 1.3 1.5
The discount rate is determined on the yield available on a high quality long dated corporate bond of appropriate term and currency.  
As a result, a discount rate of 2.8 per cent has been applied as at 31 December 2016 (2015: 3.7 per cent). This is lower than the rate used in  
the prior year, reflecting the significant drop in the yields on bonds of the appropriate term over this period.  
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables provided by the Institute of Actuaries using insurance company data updated  
from time to time to reflect current trends. The standard table used by the Scheme in the current period is S2 PXA CMI (1.25%)  
(2015: S1 PXA CMI (1.50%), and Year of Birth. The table below makes allowance for future improvements in longevity based on  
the year of birth of each member. 
2016  2015
The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were:  
Life expectancy at age 65 (current age 45): Male 89.0 90.1
 Female 91.2 92.6
Life expectancy at age 65 (current age 65): Male 87.2 87.8

South African shareholders should note that, in accordance with 
the requirements of Strate, the last day to trade cum-dividend will 
be 18 April 2017 and that no dematerialisation of shares will be 
possible from 19 April 2017 to 21 April 2017 inclusive. No transfers 
between the UK and South Africa registers may take place from  
7 April 2017 to 21 April 2017 inclusive. 
Subject to SARB approval, the Board intends to offer an optional 
scrip dividend alternative in respect of the 2016 final dividend.  
The above dates are proposed and subject to change. 
Important Information for South African Shareholders: 
The final cash dividend declared by the Company will constitute a 
dividend for Dividends Tax purposes. Dividends Tax will therefore 
be withheld from the amount of the final cash dividend which is 
paid at a rate of 15 per cent, unless a shareholder qualifies for an 
exemption and the prescribed requirements for effecting the 
exemption, as set out in the rules of the Scrip Dividend Scheme,  
are in place. 
It is the Company’s understanding that the issue and receipt of 
shares pursuant to the scrip dividend alternative will not have any 
Dividends Tax nor income tax implications. The new shares which 
are acquired under the scrip dividend alternative will be treated  
as having been acquired for nil consideration. 
This information is included only as a general guide to taxation  
for shareholders resident in South Africa based on Capco’s 
understanding of the law and the practice currently in force.  
Any shareholder who is in any doubt as to their tax position  
should seek independent professional advice.

The smarter way to broadband   PlusNet plc  Annual report and accounts, year ended 31 December 2004 About PlusNet
PlusNet is an industry leading Internet Service Provider (“ISP”)
offering quality services to residential and business customers.
PlusNet provides award winning Broadband connectivity together
with a host of related products and services and Narrowband
connectivity; a choice of offerings that few, if any, ISPs can match.
PlusNet is well-known within the UK’s web community for offering
exceptional customer service and value-for-money - combining
service reliability and outstanding support with some of the UK’s
lowest Broadband prices.
PlusNet has a unique low-cost operating model, based on a ﬂexible
and scalable self-developed operating system, which allows it to
record high proﬁtability, whilst delivering competitively priced, high
quality products. PlusNet utilises its own Carrier class network
platform to aggregate purchased national network, principally from
BT. This network strategy minimises capital expenditure and leaves
the business ﬂexible to purchase network from any national provider,
whether ﬁxed line or wireless.
PlusNet aims to be at the centre of its customers’ Broadband world;
their ﬁrst choice for Broadband-enabled services, such as security,
VoIP and content.

*Before exceptional cost of flotation Introduction
My first report as Chairman and PlusNet’s first report to
shareholders as an AIM listed Company marks the end of an
extremely important and successful year in PlusNet’s history.
PlusNet has reported record operating profit before exceptional
item of £2.9m for the financial year, and ended the year with
89,825 Broadband customers. The popularity of our Broadband
products bears testament to their high quality and exceptional
value – our Broadband growth has been achieved entirely
through referrals and our reputation. Our financial success is a
clear endorsement of the strength of our low-cost and efficient
operating model.
Corporate developments
The key event of the year was the successful flotation on AIM 
on 14 July 2004. The placing of the Company’s shares raised
£0.5m of new money for the Company net of expenses and
reduced the shareholding of Insight Enterprises Inc. to 45%. 
In December we announced a further placing of the remainder 
of Insight’s holding in PlusNet. Insight has been able to meet its
objective of exiting its 95% holding in PlusNet in less than six
months following IPO – far more quickly than it had expected.
We were particularly pleased with the market’s reaction to 
the placing in December, with a significant appetite from a 
range of investors. We now have an excellent spread of
institutional shareholders and a clear mandate to pursue our
business strategy.
2004 has seen PlusNet established as a truly independent
business.
BT Relationship
On 13 December 2004, PlusNet entered into a memorandum of
understanding with BT Retail, which confirms the strong existing
working relationship between BT and PlusNet. The strategic
insight afforded by the BT Retail relationship has already
benefited PlusNet, and the working relationship is no better
Chairman’ s Statement 2
PlusNet plc
Annual report and accounts, year ended 31 December 2004
Kevin Adams
Chairman
“PlusNet has reported record
operating profit before
exceptional item of £2.9m
for the financial year, and
ended the year with 89,825
Broadband customers” exemplified than with the successful Teleworker product, 
which was jointly developed by BT Retail and PlusNet. Under our
strategic relationship we plan to develop a number of Broadband
solutions and customer offerings with BT Retail. Closely aligning
PlusNet with BT Retail will help PlusNet remain at the forefront of
developments in the Broadband market in the UK.
Team
The PlusNet management team working with Lee Strafford 
has applied extraordinary efforts in 2004 to deliver the IPO, a
successful separation from Insight as well as an excellent trading
result. However, PlusNet’s success in the Broadband market is
dependent upon the efforts and dedication of all of our
employees. A fundamental tenet of our success is maximising
automation through the continual development of our hardware
and software platforms in line with the rapidly developing
Broadband market. This demands excellent teamwork, focus,
technical expertise and execution. PlusNet has long recognised
the importance of its employees in driving the long-term success
of the business and I am delighted that the IPO has allowed us to
introduce new share option schemes which will properly reward
their efforts over the years. Options have been granted widely
across the business to reward the hard work demanded from 
our entire team.
Corporate Governance
At flotation, Michael Sherwin and I joined Bob Moya on the
PlusNet Board as Non-executive Directors, with one of our key
objectives being the formal introduction of appropriate corporate
governance practices. PlusNet’s experience as a separate
reporting segment of a NASDAQ listed business was good
preparation for AIM, as many important disciplines had already
been adopted. It is the Board’s intention to comply with the
Combined Code, where practicable, and where full compliance 
is not appropriate, due to the size of PlusNet, we will follow
guidance issued by the Quoted Companies Alliance. On flotation
we established an audit committee, a remuneration committee
and a nomination committee, more details of which are set out
later in this report.
Outlook
The Broadband market is continuing to grow rapidly. Whilst our
growth in 2004 has been driven by new customers demanding
basic Broadband connectivity, new opportunities lie in the
extension of our connectivity products and the delivery of new
Broadband enabled products and services. PlusNet is well
positioned to meet the evolving demands of its residential and
business customers as they seek to fully utilise the power of
Broadband. We have a comprehensive roadmap of emerging
Broadband products and services. We expect our commitment 
to choice, quality and value to position us as the one-stop-shop
for all of our customers’ Broadband services.

“Our financial success 
is a clear endorsement of
the strength of our low-cost
and efficient operating
model” Operational overview
I am delighted with the progress PlusNet has made in 2004. 
The clearest measures of our progress are displayed in customer
numbers and operating profit before exceptional item where we
have enjoyed record growth. However, less apparent but more
important progress has been made in the further development of
PlusNet to take advantage of the future opportunities and meet
the challenges presented by the Broadband market. The next few
years will see the emergence of new Broadband enabled
products and services, with appeal, availability and pricing to
drive significant demand in the residential and business markets.
PlusNet intends to be a leader in delivering a broad choice of
these new products and services to market. I will focus my review
on the development of our business strategy to win in the rapidly
changing Broadband world.
Narrowband and Broadband Connectivity
Developments in 2004
2004 has seen huge growth in the number of Broadband
connections in the UK surpassing most analysts’ original
estimates of take-up by a significant margin.
PlusNet’s Broadband customer numbers increased to 89,825 at
31 December 2004, an increase of 44,461 in the year compared
to an increase of 30,847 in the year ended 31 December 2003.
Approximately 70% of our new broadband customers were new
PlusNet customers.
Broadband connectivity and services now make up 76% of our
turnover at £21.2m up from £9.9m in 2003.
In line with our expectations Narrowband revenues have declined
from £6.7m in 2003 to £5.6m in 2004, despite an increase in
Narrowband customer numbers from 108,132 to 113,213. This
reflects a reduction in average revenue per Narrowband user, as
heavier Narrowband users move more quickly to Broadband.
Chief Executive’ s Strategic Review 4
“Important progress has
been made in the further
development of PlusNet
to take advantage of the
future opportunities and
meet the challenges
presented by the
Broadband market”
PlusNet plc
Annual report and accounts, year ended 31 December 2004
Lee Strafford
Chief Executive While market commentators have commonly referred to 
our market in negative terms as being subject to significant
‘downward pricing pressure’, we have improved our Broadband
margins from 19% in 2003 to 23% in 2004 and maintained very
competitive pricing. We have achieved this principally by
leveraging our highly automated and customer responsive
operating model. In addition, we have passed on a proportion of
savings from each change in network wholesale costs over the
years to fuel competitive pricing, whilst retaining some of the
benefit to strengthen our business platform and maintain our
efficient, high quality customer service.
PlusNet’s Broadband connectivity products
We have continued to develop our Broadband connectivity
product range to offer our customers a broad choice of high
quality products and services at highly competitive prices.
PlusNet’s product range includes Broadband connectivity with
speed and usage options, as well as differentiated products for
residential and business users. We currently offer Fixed cost 
and Pay as you go connectivity products which cater for the
requirements of different segments of our customer base.
Fixed cost
PlusNet’s fixed cost products allow business and residential
customers to pay a fixed subscription for Broadband
connectivity with no further variable payments for usage.
These products are targeted at customers who demand a
high quality service and want the certainty of a fixed cost
regardless of their usage.
Pay as you go
Pay as you go products allow business and residential
customers to select and pay for their Broadband 
connectivity according to the amount of information
downloaded each month. These products offer customers 
the lowest subscription entry point to Broadband
connectivity, and appeal particularly to first-time, light
Broadband users. 
New Broadband connections have continued to dominate
sign-ups in 2004 and, consequently, our Pay as you go
products have been hugely popular, accounting for
approximately half of total Broadband sign-ups since their
launch in June. PlusNet’s revenues from Pay as you go
Broadband products vary directly with capacity utilisation,
thus driving a direct relationship between cost of sales and
income, which allows PlusNet to optimise network utilisation
and, hence, profitability.
We will continually review our range of product offerings 
for business and residential customers and will introduce new
connectivity options as and when network developments at the
wholesale level create opportunities and if we believe they would
have appeal to the prospective PlusNet customer and are
commercially viable.
Monthly subscription levels across all of our product ranges 
are highly competitive compared with other significant ISPs.
Moreover, our efficient operating model and optimal network
utilisation allow PlusNet to drive attractive gross profits across 
the whole product range.
Migrations
While the majority of new Broadband customers in 2004 are
experiencing Broadband for the first time, increasing levels of
migrations of Broadband customers from other ISPs have been 
an important new feature. As the population of experienced
internet users expands, more users become discerning and seek
value and quality in their internet connection service. Our
strategy of offering high quality service and low subscription
prices makes PlusNet an attractive proposition for Broadband
users dissatisfied with their current ISP , or simply seeking a better
deal. Changes in the migration process and associated costs by
BT in June 2004 have been catalysts for growth in migrations. 
The process is now automated and the cost was reduced from
£50 ex VAT to £11 ex VAT per user. Since June 2004 PlusNet has
not charged new customers for inbound migrations. Migrations
in 2004 have increased more than seven-fold from 2003.

“Our strategy of offering high quality service
and low subscription prices makes PlusNet an
attractive proposition for Broadband users
dissatisfied with their current ISP , or simply
seeking a better deal” Broadband connectivity growth in 2005
The outlook for growth in Broadband connectivity revenues 
is very positive. I expect continued growth in new Broadband
connections in 2005. I also expect existing Broadband users to
increasingly demand improvements in their services, as they
experience the benefits of faster speeds and seek better value.
Our philosophy of offering a broad choice of products at highly
competitive prices will drive further migrations to PlusNet.
Supplying Broadband connectivity is just the first leg of our
customer journey. Broadband is the gateway to a whole range of
new products and services, which will become available to our
residential and business customers; these new services will form
the next leg of our customer journey and the next phase in
PlusNet’s development.
Broadband market developments
Two trends in the Broadband world point the way for the next
phase in PlusNet’s development: communications convergence
and the emergence of new Broadband enabled products and
services.
Communications convergence
True communications convergence will occur when a user is 
able to access diverse Broadband enabled services whether at
home, at work or on the move. After many years of hype,
technical advances and increased co-operation between
communications businesses will mean true convergence will
become reality for Broadband users in the next few years.

Content A number of developments highlight the inexorable move
towards converged communications in the UK.
Advances in Broadband networks Delivery of multiple services
through a Broadband gateway will require increases in
Broadband speeds, improved network capabilities and 
co-operation between fixed line and mobile networks. 
These improvements will start to be delivered during 2005.
4MB and 8MB services will become more widely 
available in the UK in 2005. On our current 2MB 
service simultaneous access to browsing email and 
VoIP is feasible. At 4MB, video streaming will become 
practicable simultaneously with these other services.
BT announced in May 2004 that it was joining forces with
Vodafone to offer the first fully converged fixed-mobile
communications service in the world.
BT set out specific proposals for its 21st Century Network
last year, which is expected to facilitate innovative new
services offering greater control and personalisation, ease
of migration between services as well as continuity for
existing PSTN services.
New devices We have already seen the introduction of new
devices which begin to offer converged services, such as the
Blackberry 7100 series handset, Creative’s Zen portable media
player and Motorola’s iTunes enabled mobile phone. We expect
more new devices to be introduced which will offer mobile or
fixed network access. BT’s Bluephone, due to be launched in the
UK in 2005, promises ordinary mobile phone functionality when
away from the home or office. When in range of the user's fixed
terminal, calls can be made and received via a Broadband link.
Communications convergence will enable a whole range of new
services to be delivered via a user’s Broadband connection.
Emergence of Broadband enabled products and services
It is now possible to use a Broadband connection not only to
access the internet but also to transfer data, access software
applications, receive television and radio stations, buy and
download songs and videos, or make voice calls. However, 
few of these new products and services are offered through
mainstream retail channels, leaving them inaccessible to all but
the highly technical user or those who can afford to purchase a
bespoke solution.
The environment for the commercial launch of new Broadband
services through mainstream retail channels is rapidly becoming
more favourable. Communications convergence, network
improvements and increased Broadband speeds will enable
delivery of high quality new services, and the mass take-up of
Broadband in the UK will fuel demand and the economies of
scale to enable affordable pricing.
Seizing new product and service opportunities
I expect the Broadband ISP with the ability to aggregate a broad
range of services to play a central role in the new converged
communications world. We believe the true Broadband services
business must be able to offer its chosen market a single source
relationship for all Broadband enabled products and services.
PlusNet plans to be a true Broadband services business offering 
its residential and business customers a wide choice of fixed and
mobile Broadband connectivity options, value added services,
applications and content.
I believe PlusNet is well positioned to succeed in the new
converged communications world.
Our web-based sales and customer support methodology
provides the most effective mechanism of delivering maximum
choice of new products and services;
Our web-based customer support system puts the customer 
in control, driving an excellent customer service experience;
Our low-cost operating system will allow us to offer new
products and services at highly competitive prices, whilst
maintaining profitability;
Our relationship with BT gives us insight into market
developments and access to new products;
Our customer base of more experienced internet users and 
our reputation for excellent customer service and quality in 
the Broadband community gives us access to a ready market 
for new products and services; and
Aggregation of third party networks will give us flexibility in a
converging communications world, and minimise capital
expenditure requirements.

PlusNet plc
Annual report and accounts, year ended 31 December 2004 PlusNet plans to be its customers’ first choice for Broadband-
enabled products and services. Consistent with our business
strategy, our new Broadband connectivity and associated products
and services will aim to deliver high quality at very competitive prices.
We will continually evaluate new and complementary Broadband
enabled products and services, which we will launch as soon as
they meet our customers’ requirements and are commercially
viable. We are currently evaluating VoIP , WiFi, Mobile and content
services which we plan to launch in 2005 as long as they meet
these criteria.
BT relationship
BT Retail and PlusNet have enjoyed a strong working relationship
in recent years, which has already produced the Teleworker
product. The relationship is based upon our businesses’
complementary markets and technological capabilities. BT Retail
recognises our unique ability to automate customer service,
which forms the back-bone of the Teleworker product, and our
access to more experienced internet users, who are likely to be
early-adopters of new products and services. We recognise the
huge influence BT will have in the development of the Broadband
market, including Project Bluephone and the 21st Century
network discussed above.
BT Retail and PlusNet have agreed to work together and share
technical knowledge on the development and marketing of each
other’s proposed new Broadband products and services including
fixed access, wireless access, mobile services and VoIP . By working
with BT Retail on proposed new Broadband products and
services, PlusNet is well positioned to become the preferred
reseller for early launch of relevant new products and services.
PlusNet is BT Retail’s preferred partner for projects demanding
automated customer relationship management, which is
fundamental to Teleworker. Teleworker is a Broadband access
solution for organisations to enable their employees to work
remotely and allow the organisation to maintain the
management of their employees' internet connection. The
Teleworker product, which was launched by BT in August 2003,
has been adopted by over 30 of BT’s blue-chip corporate
customers. BT intends to accelerate growth in the number of
Teleworker end-users in 2005.
Our relationship with BT underlines PlusNet’s technical expertise
and positions PlusNet as an integral part of BT Retail’s strategy
going forward. I expect the strategic relationship with BT Retail 
to bring new product and service opportunities to PlusNet as well
as valuable insight into infrastructure developments. 
Chief Executive’ s Strategic Review
8
“I expect the strategic relationship 
with BT Retail to bring future product 
and service opportunities to PlusNet”
PlusNet plc
Annual report and accounts, year ended 31 December 2004 Outlook for 2005
2004 was an exciting year for PlusNet and the Broadband market
as a whole. Subscription prices were reduced to levels that made
Broadband connectivity affordable across residential and business
markets. Broadband internet connectivity achieved huge market
penetration, extending the user base to levels which will facilitate
the launch of new products – applications which to date have
been surrounded by hype rather than practical features.
We plan to launch new connectivity products in 2005, which 
will drive continued rapid growth in our Broadband customer
numbers.
Users will start to enjoy the fuller capabilities of Broadband, 
as new products and services are brought to market. We will
launch new products and services in 2005 complementing our
connectivity services, which will extend PlusNet’s reputation as a
quality Broadband services provider. We do not expect significant
financial return from new services in 2005; our financial growth
will be driven by continued expansion in Broadband customer
numbers. Our investment in new services will be rewarded by
financial return in future years.
We will continue to explore acquisitions that would add
significant value to the PlusNet business in 2005. A combination
of an increased customer base and PlusNet’s low cost model, will
allow us to derive substantial benefits from an acquired business.
However, we will only pursue an acquisition if it brings a brand
and customer base that will generate long term growth. As we
intend to continue to utilise any acquired brand, it is critical that
the brand is strong enough to sustain growth. We will also only
pursue an acquisition if we are confident that it will enhance
shareholder value and not dilute PlusNet’s profitability. We will 
be selective.
I am looking forward to the challenges of the next year, 
which will present us with huge opportunities as Broadband
technologies become more and more central to the lives of 
our customers.

Financial Overview
2004 has been a year in which PlusNet became totally
independent and at the same time was able to achieve
outstanding results in revenue, gross profit, pre-exceptional
operating profit and cash.
Revenue
Revenue for the year was £27.8m, a 60% increase from £17.4m
in 2003, primarily due to the growth in Broadband customer
numbers. Revenue from Broadband connectivity and other
services represented approximately 76% of this total, compared
to 57% for the comparable period in 2003. Average revenue per
user across our customer base increased from £113 to £137,
again reflecting the increasing share of Broadband subscriptions
in turnover. This is despite pricing reductions in Broadband services.
Gross Profit
There has been a continued shift in product mix from
Narrowband towards Broadband over the year. Most of our
Narrowband revenues are generated as a share of the call
charges from the telecoms carrier, which bears the majority of 
the cost of sale. Our Narrowband percentage margins are
therefore higher than our Broadband margins. PlusNet’s gross
margin percentages have decreased between 2003 (36%) and
2004 (32%) as a result. However, because the absolute gross
profit from Broadband is higher than that of Narrowband,
PlusNet’s gross profits have shown a healthy increase from 
£6.2m to £9.0m over the same period. The financial strength 
of our Broadband offering is evidenced by the increase in gross
profit per user from £40 in 2003 to £44 in 2004.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses excluding the exceptional item were
£6.1m, an increase of 41% over 2003. This resulted partly from
building depth in our management team in late 2003 and early
2004 to allow us to take advantage of the organic and acquisitive
growth opportunities open to us. In the second half of 2004 our
administrative expenses increased as a result of the additional
costs of being a listed company and also additional costs 
from establishing arms length costs on certain services and
facilities supplied by Insight Enterprises Inc.
Profitability
The strength of PlusNet’s low-cost operating model is no better
demonstrated than in our growth in operating profit before
exceptional item from £1.8m to £2.9m. Operating profit after the
exceptional cost of flotation was £1.7m. Despite the increase in
administrative expenses referred to above, our business model
continues to generate economies of scale evidenced by growth in
financial performance per employee:

Exceptional costs
Total costs of flotation of £1.7m were incurred, of which 
£1.2m was charged to the profit and loss account as an
exceptional item, representing professional fees in respect of
obtaining a listing on AIM, and the remaining £0.5m, relating to
the cost of issuing new shares, was charged to the share
premium account.
Taxation
PlusNet’s tax charge was £1.0m in 2004, compared to £0.5m 
in 2003. This represents an effective tax rate of 54% in 2004
compared to 28% in 2003. After deducting prior year items of
£0.1m charged in 2004 and disallowable expenses the effective
rate of tax for the year was 32%.
Earnings per share
Basic EPS is 3.23p compared to 5.26p in 2003. This is based 
on 26.5m shares in 2004 compared to 25m shares in 2003 (as
restated upon share consolidation at flotation). Taking out the
exceptional costs of obtaining a listing the adjusted EPS is 7.63p
(2003: 5.26p).
Capital Expenditure
PlusNet has continued to invest in the development of both 
its physical and software infrastructure. The PlusNet strategy of
utilising third party wholesale networks, principally from BT, has
limited exposure to significant capital expenditure requirements,
although we continue to invest in our own Carrier class hardware
and our Workplace platform to maintain operating performance
and quality of service.
PlusNet has adopted a policy of capitalising software
development costs relating to the continued automation of
existing business functionality and extensions to facilitate new
Broadband connectivity products and services.
T otal capital expenditure was £2.5m, compared to £1.8m in 2003
including capitalised development costs of £0.7m (2003: £1.3m).
Cashflow
Cash increased by £4.3m during the year (2003: £1.0m). 
PlusNet benefits from a favourable working capital cycle in which
customers pay in advance and suppliers are paid in arrears. The
cash balance at 31 December 2004 was £6.8m (2003: £2.5m).
Strong cashflow and increased cash holdings have boosted
interest receivable to £0.2m in 2004 (2003: £0.02m).
PlusNet will apply its cash resource to fund capital expenditure,
tax obligations and corporate acquisitions, when appropriate
opportunities arise. No dividends have been recommended.
Share based payments
As part of the flotation new share option schemes were
introduced. The expense that would be recognised in respect 
of these share based payments when FRS20/IFRS2 becomes
effective has not been accounted for in the year ended 
31 December 2004. FRS20 will become mandatory for 
PlusNet from 1 January 2006.
Transition to International Accounting Standards
As an AIM listed company we will adopt IAS for our financial
statements for the year ending 31 December 2007. Our IAS
evaluation is ongoing. As mentioned above, accounting for 
share based payments will be taken into consideration.

S9 2BU Compliance statement
The Group is not required to comply with the provisions of the June 1998 Combined Code on Corporate Governance (“the Combined
Code”) and the ‘Revised code’ for reporting periods commencing on or after 1 November 2003. The Board of Directors recognise the
importance of, and is committed to, ensuring that effective corporate governance procedures relevant to smaller listed Groups are in
place. The Group has therefore complied with the Revised Code, except in respect of internal controls. Details of the Group’s approach
to internal controls are detailed below. This statement considers how the relevant principles of the Revised Code have been applied to
the Group throughout the year to 31 December 2004.
Internal control and risk management process
Following flotation in July 2004, the Board is in the process of identifying, evaluating and managing the risks faced by the Group. As a
result, the processes required to comply with the Revised Code in this area have not been in operation for the whole of the year under
review, and in this respect, the Group has not complied with the Revised Code. The Board of Directors intends to instigate a review of
internal controls during the year to 31 December 2005.
The Board of Directors has reviewed the need for an internal audit function and has concluded that given the size and risk profile of
the Group such a function would not be appropriate.
The external auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the accounts. The auditors test and review the systems of internal financial
controls and information presented in the accounts to the extent required to be able to express their audit opinion.
The Board 
Details of the changes in Directors in the year are provided in the ‘Directors’ Report’ shown on page 14. At 31 December 2004 the
Board comprised 3 executive Directors, 2 Non-executive Directors and 1 Non-executive Chairman. All the non-executive members of
the Board are considered by the Board to be independent of the Company and the Group. Each non-executive possesses considerable
outside expertise, and is able to exercise detached judgement in dealing with matters before the Board. The Board considers that the
current composition provides a reasonable level of independence.
The Board, which met 5 times between flotation in July 2004 and the 31 December 2004, is responsible for the overall strategy and
financial performance of the Group and has a formal schedule of matters required for approval. Each Board meeting is preceded by a
clear agenda and any relevant information is provided to Directors in advance of the meeting.
The statement of the Directors’ responsibilities in preparing the accounts is set out on page 18 and the statement from the auditor on
its reporting responsibilities is set out on page 24. The statement on going concern can be found in the ‘Directors’ report’ on page 15
and on relations with shareholders in this section on page 17.
All Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at an Annual General Meeting if they were not elected or re-elected at
either of the two preceding Annual General Meetings. Therefore Directors appointed during the period are required to seek re-election
at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment.
Board performance
As the current Board was established at the recent flotation, the measurement of Board performance is under review and
communication to shareholders will be made at the appropriate time.
Auditor independence
In order to safeguard the objectivity and independence of the Company’s external auditors, the Audit Committee Chairman must
expressly authorise any engagement of those auditors on non-audit work that would entail them being paid fees in excess of 20% 
of the audit fee in any year. Careful consideration is given on each occasion as to potential conflicts and the possibility of actual or
perceived threats to the independence of the external auditors before instructing them in connection with non-audit work. 
Instructions are only given when the Company considers it to be in its best interests to use the external auditors other than in
connection with pure audit services.
Corporate Governance 16
PlusNet plc
Annual report and accounts, year ended 31 December 2004 Principal Board committees
The Board has established the following committees:
Remuneration Committee. The Committee currently comprises M Sherwin, PR Moya and is chaired by K Adams. The Remuneration
Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending all the elements of policy on the Board’s and senior executives’
remuneration and for approving all matters relating to the remuneration of executive Directors. It meets at least 3 times per year. 
The Remuneration Committee Report on pages 19 to 23 contains a detailed description of remuneration and applicable policies.
Nominations Committee. The Committee consists of M Sherwin and PR Moya and is chaired by K Adams. The Committee’s
responsibilities are to identify, evaluate and select candidates for Board positions, and to review annually the composition and size of
the Board.
Audit Committee. The committee comprises K Adams, PR Moya and is chaired by M Sherwin. The Committee meets at least 3 times
annually. The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, primarily in reviewing and reporting
financial and non-financial information communicated to shareholders, systems of internal control and risk management and the
audit process. It has the power to call for information from management and to consult directly with the auditors or their advisors as
considered appropriate. The Committee operates under written terms of reference and is scheduled to meet at least twice a year
with the Group’s auditors. The Committee is responsible for the independent monitoring of the effectiveness of the system of
internal control, compliance, accounting policies and published financial statements on behalf of the Board. This is achieved
primarily through a review of the annual financial statements and a review of the nature and scope of the external audit. Any
significant findings or identified risks are examined so that appropriate action may be taken. The Committee is also responsible for
keeping under review the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, including a review of non-audit services provided to
the group, consideration of any relationships with the Group that could affect independence and seeking written confirmation from 
the auditors that, in their professional judgement, they are independent.
The formal terms of reference of each of the committees can be found on www.plus.net/investors
Relations with shareholders
The Group encourages the participation of both institutional and private investors. Communication with private individuals is
maintained through the Annual General Meeting, annual and interim reports, quarterly updates and press releases. In addition further
details on the strategy and performance of the Company can be found at its website (www.plus.net).
The Chief Executive will be available to answer questions at the Annual General Meeting.

PlusNet plc
Annual report and accounts, year ended 31 December 2004 Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial
statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in
the financial statements;
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in
business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and
detect fraud and other irregularities.

PlusNet plc
Annual report and accounts, year ended 31 December 2004 * Audited information
** The discretionary bonuses to the Directors reflect the extraordinary efforts made to transform PlusNet from a subsidiary 
of a NASDAQ listed Company to a successful Group listed on the AIM market. In particular, the Directors’ involvement was
instrumental in separating the day to day operations of the Company from its former parent, the success of the IPO, in
establishing and maintaining clear communication with the investment community, in delivering successive quarterly
performance above budgeted expectations and in facilitating the successful placing of the Insight shareholding and thus
establishing the Group as an independent PLC.
*** Insight Enterprises UK Limited agreed to reward to the executive Directors with ordinary shares and/or cash to be invested in
ordinary shares equivalent to 12.5% per cent of the gain it made from the disposal of its shareholding in PlusNet. No costs
relating to the incentive scheme have been borne by PlusNet plc.The scheme was contractually agreed prior to flotation and has
not been subject to the approval of the Remuneration Committee.
**** The remuneration is for the period from appointment on 7 July 2004 to 31 December 2004.

Report of the independent auditors to the members of PlusNet plc
We have audited the financial statements on pages 25 to 38. We have also audited the information in the Remuneration Committee
Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts. As described on page 18, this includes the responsibility for
preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. Our responsibilities,
as independent auditors, are established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices Board and by our profession’s ethical
guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements
and the part of the Remuneration Committee Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination,
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order 
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at 31 December 2004
and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended; and
The financial statements and the part of the Remuneration Committee Report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

PlusNet plc
Annual report and accounts, year ended 31 December 2004 1 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to 
the financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost
accounting rules.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertaking made up to 
31 December 2004. As permitted by Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to
present its own profit and loss account.
Intangible assets and amortisation
Expenditure on research is written off against profits in the year in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure on software applications is capitalised to the extent that its recovery is reasonably assured. These costs are
amortised over the period to which revenue is expected to be derived from the application, subject to a maximum period of 5 years.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value
of tangible fixed assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Computer equipment 5 years
Internal software development costs 5 years
Network development costs 5 years
Fixtures & fittings 2 - 15 years
Internal software development costs and network development costs include capitalised employee costs directly attributable to either
bringing computer equipment into working condition for its intended use within the business or developing and enhancing business
operating systems.
Pensions
The Company contributes to a defined contribution group personal pension scheme on behalf of employees. The assets of the scheme
are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund. The amount charged against profits represents
the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Taxation
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation
and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS19.
Turnover
Service subscription income is recognised over the period to which it relates. Call revenue is recognised on the accruals basis. 
Turnover excludes value added tax. All turnover has arisen from activities within the UK.
Deferred income
Deferred income represents that portion of subscription fees paid by customers but relating to a future period.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

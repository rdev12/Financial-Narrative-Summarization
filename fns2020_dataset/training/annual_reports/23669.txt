Chairman’s Statement
2002 was a year of
extraordinary development and
growth for the Group
Evolution Beeson Gregory
is now a fully functional
independent investment bank
Following my appointment as Chairman of The Evolution
Group Plc (“Evolution Group” or the “Group”) on 30
January 2003, I am delighted to be reporting the
progress that has been made by the Group. 2002 was a
year of extraordinary development and growth for the
Group. The scale and scope of the business at 31
December 2002 is very different from that of a year
earlier.
Alex Snow, the Group’s Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, is
responsible for all aspects of the Group’s operating
businesses and he provides, in his report which follows,
a full review of the year’s results. Two things are clear
from these results. Firstly, there have been signiﬁcant
items that are non-recurring in nature – provisions
against ﬁxed asset investments, redundancy and
restructuring costs, and the impairment of goodwill –
accounting for over £21 million of the overall loss.
Secondly, the performance of our operating businesses
was signiﬁcantly stronger in the second half than the ﬁrst,
as a result of the merger with the Beeson Gregory Group
in July 2002 and recognition of the related synergies.
Therefore as we entered 2003, the Group’s operating
businesses were all structured appropriately with their
costs aligned to the achievement of proﬁtability going
forward.
The Group’s merger totally changed our investment
banking platform. Evolution Beeson Gregory was created
and, following a signiﬁcant restructuring effort, is now a
fully functional independent investment bank servicing
the small and mid-cap sector. Christows continues its
strategy for growth and has returned to proﬁtability in
2002 following signiﬁcant restructuring in 2001. IP2IPO,
the Group’s Intellectual Property commercialisation
company, has made enormous progress in 2002 with the
signing of its second major University partnership with
the University of Southampton and the successful spin-
out of further companies. I would like to thank my
predecessor, Andrew Beeson, on behalf of the Board, for
helping to ensure the integration of the two groups went
smoothly and wish him well in his future endeavours. The Evolution Group Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2002 | 5
Outlook
2002 was a watershed year for the small and mid-cap
sector. The current trend has been for the large
integrated investment banks to withdraw from this end
of the market. This in turn has created signiﬁcant
opportunities for small, independent, well capitalised
companies, such as Evolution Beeson Gregory, who focus
exclusively on this area. We constantly strive to maintain
and improve our customer service and company
coverage to maximise the opportunities going forward. A
salary cap, along with a new equity participation scheme
for employees, ensures that management’s, employees’
and shareholders’ interests are aligned in creating capital
growth in the future. Christows has a similar opportunity
in its sector with its focus on client service and innovative
product offerings. Finally, IP2IPO looks forward to this
year as one in which it gains value from its unique and
totally leading edge access to the commercialisation
opportunities through its University partnership
agreements.
The Board recognises that all of the businesses in which
we operate are people businesses, where our primary
assets are our people. The last year has been one where
our staff have demonstrated real commitment in what
have been circumstances of internal restructuring against
a background of external market turmoil. I should like to
take this opportunity to thank everyone for these efforts
that move us toward the achievement of our goals. The
Group has a very clear and achievable strategy - revenue
maximisation, strict cost management and asset
realisation achieved in a timely and proactive fashion. 
The Group has traded proﬁtably in the ﬁrst quarter of
2003 on a consolidated operating basis. The Board looks
forward to the future with conﬁdence and conviction.

Review of the year
Investment banking
At the start of 2002, we had just commenced trading as
Evolution Capital, a newly established and regulated
company with nascent equity sales, trading and research
functions. The brand was quickly established and
revenues developed over the ﬁrst few months of the year
as we set about providing our institutional clients with
the service they wanted. It was clear as we announced
last year’s results that the sector offering investment
banking services to small and mid cap companies was
one where change and consolidation were inevitable.
We established our strategy to set about leading this
development and identiﬁed the established business of
Beeson Gregory Group as one where opportunities as a
business combination were maximised. The offer by the
Group to acquire the entire share capital of Beeson
Gregory became unconditional on 11 July 2002 and from
that point forward we set about achieving our goals of
integrating the two companies to form Evolution Beeson
Gregory, rationalising the cost base and growing the
revenue line.
The integration process was largely completed by the
year end with annualised ongoing costs reduced from a
combined level of £15m at completion to £10m
currently. A major part of this saving was achieved by
reducing the combined headcount from 128 at
completion to 84 at 31 December 2002 and introducing
caps to salaries, which signiﬁcantly reduced the average
salary levels across the company. At the same time we
have reviewed the equity participation available to our
key staff and implemented at the beginning of 2003 the
Key Performers’ Share Incentive Plan. Revenue growth
has also been achieved and the combined business
produced revenue in the second half of 2002 of £7.5m,
which was in excess of our budgets against a background
of extraordinarily difﬁcult market conditions. 
Evolution Beeson Gregory has continued to grow its
portfolio of retained corporate broking and advisory
clients over the course of the second half of 2002. In
total, 16 new retained corporate clients were added.
Evolution Beeson Gregory had 104 retained corporate
clients at the end of the year. The retainer income
derived from these corporate clients totals over 25% of
the projected overall investment banking annual cost
base. As the wholesale withdrawal from the small and
mid-cap marketplace continues by the global investment
banks, it is expected that the rate of growth of new
corporate clients will be maintained. 
A key area of synergy arising from the merger resulted
from Evolution Capital’s secondary market expertise. The
combined secondary market sales commission revenue
has grown sharply during a period when transaction
volumes and transaction value in the small and mid-cap
market have reduced sharply. Indeed, ofﬁcial market
share data conﬁrms that Evolution Beeson Gregory’s
market share has risen signiﬁcantly in the FTSE Fledgling,
FTSE small-cap and FTSE 250.
Private client stockbroking and fund
management
Christows’ overall performance during 2002 was
impressive when compared with a year earlier and,
against the background market conditions, this is
particularly encouraging. The overall result was a
retained proﬁt of £0.2m compared with a loss of £2.0m
for 2001, a turnaround of £2.2m. Within this overall
performance the revenue from all classes of transaction
based commissions and management fees have clearly
been under pressure as the conditions in the underlying
equity markets took their effect. However, we were able
to maintain the revenue against the previous year’s level
by the introduction of new clients bringing signiﬁcant
new discretionary funds under management. 
These came principally via our continued drive of sales
through the intermediary market of independent
ﬁnancial advisers with new funds of £54m being
introduced compared with £44m in 2001 from this
source. Sales to this market comprise the very successful
Private Portfolio Account and also, since its introduction
in November 2002, the Multi-Manager Portfolio Service.
We have continued through the year to focus extremely
Chief Executive’s Report The Evolution Group Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2002 | 7
hard on cost management. We have worked with our
outsourced service providers to reduce the costs of our
business at current volume levels and to provide for
reduced marginal costs as transaction volumes grow.
Christows continues to attract new discretionary funds
under management and the launch of our Multi-Manager
Portfolio Service widens our product offering. The
concentration of effort continues to offer a traditional
private client service, whilst striving to offer new
innovative products to our growing client base.
IP2IPO
At the end of 2002, the Group had a majority stake
totalling 84% in IP2IPO Group Limited (“IP2IPO”), an
Intellectual Property commercialisation company. 
IP2IPO has continued through the second half of 2002 to
make enormous progress in the creation and
development of spin out ventures from its two university
partnerships with Oxford University’s chemistry
department and The University of Southampton.
The three spin-outs completed in the second half of
2002; Glycoform, Capsant Neurotechnologies and
Southampton Polypeptides, added to those previously
established give IP2IPO signiﬁcant equity stakes in a total
of seven companies at the end of the year, derived from
its two partnerships. There is no doubt that IP2IPO offers
the Group a strong pipeline of assets spun-out of
universities for a signiﬁcant period of time and these
provide both capital appreciation and corporate advisory
revenue opportunities to the Group.
IP2IPO has many unique features. The exclusive
ownership of long term intellectual property assets from
Oxford University’s chemistry department and The
University of Southampton has enormous, as yet
unrealised, value. The embedded value of the existing
intellectual property in these two institutions is
substantial. In addition, the ongoing spend by third
parties develops even more leading edge intellectual
property, creating further commercial opportunities.
We are very conﬁdent that IP2IPO will deliver substantial
value for shareholders.
Non-recurring costs
Within 2002 there were signiﬁcant exceptional costs that
the Board does not expect to be repeated. The most
signiﬁcant of these is the impairment charge of £10.9m
against the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the
Beeson Gregory Group. As we detailed in the circular at
the time of the Group’s share capital reduction process
in November 2002, this revaluation principally resulted
from the extreme downward movements in investment
banking shares that occurred after the transaction was
completed, together with a reduction in the valuations
ascribed to certain private equity assets within Beeson
Gregory’s portfolio. 
The restructuring costs within the Group totalled £1.3m,
consisting of a redundancy programme, professional fees
associated with streamlining the Group’s legal entities
following the merger and costs of arranging the share
capital reduction process.
Investment Provisions
The Board outlined at the half year results and in
November’s circular that the valuations of the Group’s
legacy investments in private equity ventures had been
signiﬁcantly reduced. In total for the full year we have
made further provisions during 2002 of £4.5m and at the
year end the portfolio has a value of £1.5m. As we have
stated, the Group is now no longer actively involved in
principal private equity investment and will simply seek
to extract some value from exits from this portfolio.
Events subsequent to the year end have shown that the
value of the Group’s investment in Inter-Alliance Group
Plc has been reduced and the Board has decided it is
prudent to recognise a write off of £4.5m as at the
balance sheet date.
Balance sheet strength
The Group continues to maintain its focus on the
strength of its balance sheet. As at 31 December 2002,
the Group had a cash balance of £32m, had taken all
steps to ensure ﬁxed asset investments were fully
provided for where appropriate and performed an
impairment review of its goodwill balances. 
Alex Snow
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer

Outline of Activities
Evolution Beeson Gregory (“EVBG”) aims to be the
“leading investment bank to small and mid cap
companies”. This is based upon the belief that it has the
strategy and capabilities to achieve this goal, coupled
with the fact that the market opportunity exists for this
strategy to be a successful and proﬁtable one.
The company’s capabilities are strong across the primary
and secondary equity market and central to this is the
presence of a leading corporate retained client base in
the small and mid cap sector. We service these clients by
providing the full range of corporate ﬁnance, research,
market making and sales activities and delivering all of
these with a strong client service culture.
Our corporate ﬁnance track record in the small and mid
cap sector is renowned and undoubtedly a specialism of
which we are proud. We get to know our clients’ needs
and have been able to arrange ﬂotations and secondary
share issues, acquisitions, disposals, private fundraisings
and public company takeovers and mergers. Operating in
parallel with this, our corporate broking and investor
relations’ capabilities ensure that the regular
communication with the market, regulators and
shareholders, both existing and potential, is optimised. 
The company’s sales team services its institutional
customer base and is both the medium by which deals
originated within corporate ﬁnance are brought to the
market and is a formidable presence in secondary market
trading for our corporate and other stocks. Within this
team there is a blend of experienced and dynamic
individuals who ensure they understand their
institutional clients current positions and future views
and match these with those of other institutions or
arrange for transactions to be facilitated by the sales
traders or market makers.
EVBG’s market making operates under the EVO
mnemonic and in April 2003 has been signiﬁcantly
increased in scale. We make markets in over 400 small
and mid cap stocks, including all of the company’s
corporate client stocks. Market making ensures the
operation of an orderly and liquid market and brings the
retail stockbrokers to the market to transact in the stocks
of our small and mid cap specialism.
Research is the ﬁnal cornerstone of EVBG’s product
offering and we have assembled a team of analysts
dedicated to the understanding and interpretation of
industry trends who are tasked with the responsibility of
translating that into valuable insights for institutional
clients on secondary markets and helping to provide
corporate support across a wide range of sectors in
primary markets. We aim to be proactive, disciplined, act
with integrity, produce top quality research and to be
honest in our appraisal of companies. 
Operating across the company is a sector focus to ensure
that we can maximise the impact of our offering to every
corporate client and institutional customer. The sector
specialisms include, consumer, electronics, life sciences,
resources, services and industrials. These cross discipline
groups enable knowledge transfer, the generation of
innovative solutions and complete the specialist feel that
is important to our clients. 
Overall we are conﬁdent that the investment banking
franchise has a solid foundation from which to achieve its
strategic goals, and we recognise the need to continue to
strive for strong client service to maintain and develop
our client base.
The Evolution Group Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2002 | 9 Christows is a leading independent ﬁrm of stockbrokers
and portfolio managers which, from its foundation in
1991 in Exeter, has always set out to provide a traditional
stockbroking service whilst developing an innovative
product offering. Christows now also operates from
London and Bournemouth and has 55 staff across
account executive, research, sales and administration
staff.
Christows’ core bespoke discretionary portfolio
management services are delivered by its team of highly
qualiﬁed account executives. We formulate with each
client their investment objectives and then provide a
tailor-made solution which aims to meet these. We
believe in offering a client direct access to the account
executive and encourage regular face to face meetings.
These allow us to provide an update on performance,
market conditions and keep abreast of the clients
circumstances and ongoing objectives. The research
department supports the account executives’ portfolio
decisions by providing rigorous research and strategy
output providing economic analysis, sector weighting,
individual stock analysis and trade ideas. The company’s
regular monthly, quarterly and annual summaries of
market performance are also available to clients.
Christows’ sales team are responsible for introducing a
signiﬁcant proportion of the new client leads to the
account executives. The sales team are focused on the
intermediary market that is typically Independent
Financial Advisors and ﬁrms of lawyers and accountants
whose clients require the services of a specialist
stockbroker. The principal products developed for this
market are the Private Portfolio Account and the Multi-
Manager Portfolio Service. These allow the intermediary
to introduce clients who typically have between £25,000
and £2.5m to invest in Christows discretionary
management services whilst participating in future fee
income. 
The backbone to the business is the intranet system
which facilitates the dissemination of all centralised
model portfolios, research recommendations,
compliance data and new client account documentation.
The intranet system operates alongside the front and
back ofﬁce systems provided by Pershing Securities
Limited which offer a proven outsourced solution for the
processing of all client transactions. This allows
Christows to both concentrate on its core activity of
discretionary portfolio management and to accommodate
future growth on an easily scaleable basis.
Christows also operates a unitised range of fund
products via an Open Ended Investment Company
structure, currently through Christows Investments Plc,
which is listed in Dublin.
As at 31 December 2002, Christows had a total of £326m
client funds under management, on over three quarters
of which it receives a recurring fee based commission.
Christows’ strategy for 2003 is one of controlled growth
of the funds under management by organic means
through the sales and account executive teams and by
the recruitment of like minded account executives who
can attract new clients to the company.
IP2IPO’s business is the commercialisation of intellectual
property (“IP”) through the formation of long term
university partnerships. The company has developed a
unique business model allowing it to enter into long-
dated agreements with universities under which it
acquires a signiﬁcant interest in the IP that they create,
and to work with its university partners to commercialise
this IP .
IP2IPO’s ﬁrst university partnership is with the University
of Oxford. The partnership has a 15 year term and
entitles IP2IPO to 50% of the University of Oxford’s
interest in IP developed by the university’s chemistry
department, one of the world’s largest chemistry
departments. 
In March 2002, IP2IPO entered into partnership with the
University of Southampton. This partnership has an
10 | The Evolution Group Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Outline of Activities (continued) initial term of 25 years and covers the entire university,
which has an excellent reputation for research with
particular strengths in electronics and computer sciences,
opto-electronics, engineering, medicine and biological
sciences. Under the partnership, IP2IPO will invest £5m
in University of Southampton spin out companies over a
4 year period; and has received a 20% interest in
Southampton Asset Management Limited, a company
which was formed to hold the University of
Southampton’s equity stakes in spin out companies
created since the start of the partnership.
IP2IPO has external shareholders holding the 15.6%
interest not owned by the Group. These shareholders
have principally subscribed for these shares through two
share placings. The most recent placing occurred in
March 2002 when IP2IPO raised £3m, valuing it at £40m
immediately after the placing.
By the end of 2002, 7 spin out companies had been
formed, and since the year end a further 3 have followed.
The current spin out companies are as follows:
Inhibox Limited – a drug discovery company that
harnesses the idle time computing power of over 
2 million PCs world wide. 
Pharminox Limited – a drug development company that
focuses on platinum based cancer therapies.

Finance, operations, technology,
compliance and resources
Throughout the Group’s operating businesses there is a
common thread supporting our business activities. All of
the Group’s products are supported by a team of ﬁnance,
operations, technology, compliance, HR and
administrative professionals. They are dedicated to
enabling, verifying, conﬁrming and reporting our
business to ensure we meet the very highest standards of
control, regulatory compliance and ﬁnancial reporting.
This team operates across the group ensuring efﬁciency
and economies of scale and providing the management
team with appropriate and timely management
information. We see these areas as fundamental to the
development of a successful business that is proﬁtable
over the long term and, once again in this area, we
recognise that quality client service whether inward
facing or to the Group’s external contacts, is paramount.

group, on 11 July 2002. Following this acquisition the
Group now provides investment banking services,

Share capital reduction
On 18 December 2002 the Company’s application to
reduce its share capital and apply its accumulated loss
reserves to the Company’s share premium account was
accepted by the High Court and became effective
following the registration of the Court Order at
Companies House on 19 December 2002. The effect of
this was to reduce issued share capital by £6,971,000 and
the share premium account by £42,013,000 and reduce
the Company’s accumulated losses by £48,984,000.
These proposals were accepted by shareholders at the
Extraordinary General Meeting of 3 December 2002.
Purchase of own shares
The Group currently operates two share trusts. The
Evolution Group Employees’ Share Trust administers The
Evolution Group Plc share schemes and is managed by
the Sanne Trust, whereas the Share Incentive Trust
administers the legacy Beeson Gregory Group share
schemes managed under The Bank of Butterﬁeld.
Under the Share Incentive Trust shares which have been
purchased but not unconditionally allocated to an
employee are included within the balance sheet of the
Group at cost. The value of such shares at 31 December
2002 is £484,000 (2001: £Nil). The nominal value of such
shares at 31 December 2002 is £8,000 which represents
0.33% of the called up share capital of the Company
(2001: £Nil; Nil%).
The directors have decided to transfer all share schemes
to The Evolution Group Employees’ Share Trust in 2003.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The following statement, which should be read in
conjunction with the independent auditors’ report set
out on page 17, is made with a view to distinguishing for
shareholders the respective responsibilities of the
directors and of the independent auditors in relation to
the ﬁnancial statements.
The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to
prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and the Group as at the end of the ﬁnancial
year and of the proﬁt or loss for the ﬁnancial year.
The directors consider that in preparing the ﬁnancial
statements on pages 18 to 57 that:
l the Company and the Group have used appropriate
accounting policies, consistently applied and
supported by reasonable and prudent judgements
and estimates, and 
l all the accounting standards which they consider to
be applicable have been followed, and
l the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a
going concern basis.
The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the
Company and the Group keep accounting records which
disclose with reasonable accuracy the ﬁnancial position
of the Company and the Group and which enable them
to ensure the ﬁnancial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985.
The directors have general responsibility for taking such
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the
assets of the Company and the Group and to prevent
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Auditors
Following the conversion of our auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers to a limited liability partnership
(LLP), effective from 1 January 2003,
PricewaterhouseCoopers resigned as auditors and the
Board appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to ﬁll the
casual vacancy created by the resignation.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their
willingness to continue in ofﬁce, and pursuant to section
388 (3) (b) of the Companies Act 1985, an ordinary
resolution, with special notice, re-appointing them as
auditors and authorising the directors to determine their
remuneration will be proposed at the 2003 Annual
General Meeting. The Audit Committee reviews and
approves the appointment of the external auditors.
BY ORDER OF THE BOARD
N.R. Gordon

22 April 2003
16 | The Evolution Group Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Directors’ Report (continued) We have audited the ﬁnancial statements on pages 18 to
57 which comprise the proﬁt and loss account, the
balance sheet, the cash ﬂow statement and the related
notes which have been prepared under the historical cost
convention as modiﬁed by the revaluation of certain assets
and the accounting policies set out on pages 22 to 25.
Respective responsibilities of directors and
auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual
report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with
applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards are set out in the statement of directors’
responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. This report,
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no
other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any
other person to whom this report is shown or into
whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed
by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’
Report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if
the Company and the Group have not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual
report and consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the ﬁnancial statements. The other
information comprises the Chairman’s Statement, the
Chief Executive’s Report and the Management Team and
Outline of Activities.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing
standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial
statements. It also includes an assessment of the
signiﬁcant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements,
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
to the Company’s and Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all
the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence
to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the ﬁnancial statements give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the
Group at 31 December 2002 and of the loss and cash
ﬂows of the Group for the year then ended and have
been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modiﬁed by the revaluation of
certain assets held for trading purposes, the accounting policies set out below and in accordance with the applicable
accounting standards of the UK Accounting Standards Board and the pronouncements of its Urgent Issues Task Force
(UITF).
Basis of Consolidation
The Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements comprise the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings made up to 31 December 2002. An undertaking is regarded as a subsidiary undertaking if the Group has
control over its operating and ﬁnancial policies.
Turnover
Turnover, comprising commission and brokerage income derived from stockbroking and fund management services,
institutional equity sales commissions and fees and commissions from listed and private equity fundraising,
underwriting, issue management and corporate ﬁnance advisory services, is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account
when the related services are performed and when considered recoverable. Proprietary trading and market making
positions are valued on a mark to market basis and the resulting income is included in turnover. All turnover is
generated within the United Kingdom and Eire is principally in sterling and is stated exclusive of value added tax.
Depreciation
Tangible ﬁxed assets are stated at historical cost less provision for any impairment in their values and are written down
to their estimated residual values over their expected useful economic lives as follows:
Leasehold improvements Over 5 years
Computers, software and similar equipment Over 3 to 5 years
Fixtures and ﬁttings and other equipment Over 3 to 5 years
Goodwill
Goodwill arises under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and represents the excess of
cost over fair value of the Group’s share of net assets acquired. In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 10,
goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful economic life. The useful economic life of
the goodwill is determined at the time of the acquisition giving rise to it by considering the nature of the acquired
business, the economic environment in which it operates and the period of time over which the value of the business
is expected to exceed the value of the identiﬁable net assets.
For acquisitions, goodwill is generally expected to have a useful economic life of twenty years and is subject to regular
impairment reviews.
Impairment of tangible ﬁxed assets and goodwill
Tangible ﬁxed assets and goodwill are subject to an impairment review in accordance with Financial Reporting
Standard 11 if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of the ﬁxed asset or
goodwill may not be fully recoverable. The impairment review comprises a comparison of the carrying amount of the
ﬁxed asset or goodwill with its recoverable amount, which is the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
22 | The Evolution Group Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2002
Notes to the 
ﬁnancial statements
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002 The carrying values of ﬁxed assets and goodwill are written down by the amount of any impairment and this loss is
recognised in the proﬁt and loss account in the period in which it occurs.
Fixed asset investments
The directors consider that in general the Group’s ﬁxed asset investments do not come within the Companies Act 1985
deﬁnition of associated undertakings, since The Evolution Group Plc does not exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the
operating and ﬁnancial policies of investees. The Companies Act 1985 requires investments where there is signiﬁcant
inﬂuence to be treated as associated undertakings and to be accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The directors consider that as these investments are held as part of the Group’s portfolio with a view to the ultimate
realisation of capital gains, equity accounting would not give a true and fair view of the Group’s interest in these
investments. The treatment adopted is in accordance with the accounting for venture capital and investment trusts as
set out in Financial Reporting Standard 9 – Associates and Joint Ventures.
The effect of this departure on the ﬁnancial statements is disclosed in note 15.
Fixed asset investments represent equity investments. Listed and unlisted investments are stated at historical cost less
provision for impairment in value, and are held for long-term investment purposes.
Fixed asset investment impairment provisions
Provisions for ﬁxed asset investments have been calculated in accordance with British Venture Capital Association
Guidelines (“BVCA”). Early stage investments are valued at cost less any provision considered necessary due to
performance signiﬁcantly below the expectation on which the investment was based. These provisions are made as a
percentage of cost in 25% bands. Later stage investments continue to be valued at cost less provision until a third party
valuation or earnings multiple basis becomes more applicable. Quoted investments are valued at the bid price but may
be discounted further where the holding is signiﬁcant in relation to the issued share capital.
Equity shares held as current assets
Equity shares held as current trading assets comprise “long” and “short” market making and proprietary trading book
positions, which are stated at market value and proﬁts or losses arising from this valuation are taken to the proﬁt and
loss account. This is not in accordance with Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985, which requires that such assets be
stated at the lower of cost and net realiseable value, or that if revalued any revaluation difference be taken to the
revaluation reserve.
The directors consider that these requirements would fail to give a true and fair view of the proﬁt or loss for the year of
the Group since the marketability of the equity shares enable decisions to be taken continually about whether to hold
or sell them and hence the economic measure of proﬁt in any period is properly made by reference to market values.
The difference between the cost of market making positions and the market value is not disclosed as its determination
is not practicable.
Current asset investments
Current asset investments are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Own shares
Shares in the Company held by the Share Incentive Trust which are not allocated to speciﬁc employees are held as
ﬁxed assets at cost less a provision for impairment in value if appropriate, in accordance with Abstract 13 issued by the

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2002
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Urgent Issues Task Force of the Accounting Standards Board.
Cash balances held with the Share Incentive Trust to purchase shares in the Company are held at the value advanced.
Accounting for share options
Share options issued under employee share schemes by the Group are accounted for in accordance with UITF Abstract
17, “Employee Share Schemes”. The intrinsic value of the options at the date an award is granted is charged to the
proﬁt and loss account between the date of grant and the options vesting date.
Pension commitments
The Group makes deﬁned contributions to employees’ approved personal pension plans, and the costs of these are
expensed when they are incurred.
Market and client balances
In accordance with market practice, unsettled bought and sold security transactions with clients, stock exchange
member ﬁrms and settlement ofﬁces are included gross in debtors and creditors respectively.
Operating leases
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all the beneﬁts and risk of ownership remain with the lessor
are charged to the proﬁt and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at historical cost less a provision for any impairment in their value.
Details of the principal subsidiary undertakings are given in note 39.
Non credit risk provisions
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a
transfer of economic beneﬁt will be necessary to settle the obligation and it can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be conﬁrmed only by uncertain future events or
present obligation where the transfer of economic beneﬁt is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent
liabilities are not recognised, however, they are disclosed unless remote.
Client money
Money held on behalf of clients (other than that required to settle outstanding bargains) by the Group, in accordance
with the Client Money Rules of The Financial Services Authority, and the corresponding liabilities are not shown on the
face of the balance sheet as the Group is not beneﬁcially entitled thereto.
Foreign currency balances
Foreign currency balances are translated at month end with the resulting gain or loss taken to the proﬁt and loss
account.
Derivatives
During the year the Group traded in Contracts For Differences (“CFDs”). These positions are marked to market based
on the underlying equity price. The Group no longer trades in CFDs nor did it hold any positions in CFDs at the end
of the year. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge future currency exposures once they are
certain to crystalise. Deferred tax
During the year the Group adopted Financial Reporting Standard 19 ‘Deferred Tax’ (FRS 19). This standard addresses
the recognition, on a full provision basis, of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences between
the recognition of gains and losses in the ﬁnancial statements and their recognition in the tax computations.
Deferred tax, provided at anticipated tax rates and on a non-discounted basis, is recognised in respect of all timing
differences, arising from transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to
pay less tax in the future, which have occurred at the balance sheet date. Assets are recognised on this basis only to the
extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will crystallise in the future.
Change in accounting policy
A change in accounting policy has arisen from the adoption in 2002 of FRS 19 ‘Deferred Tax’. As explained in the
accounting policy note above, deferred tax is now provided on a full provision basis in respect of timing differences
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
The change in accounting policy has not resulted in a prior year adjustment as no change in the opening balance is
required to be recognised under FRS 19.

differences arising on capital allowances, provisions against investments and trading losses carried forward. This asset
has not been recognised in the accounts due to current uncertainties as to how the Group will utilise the reversal of
the underlying timing differences.
The deferred tax asset would be recovered if there were future taxable proﬁts from which the reversal of the
underlying timing differences could be deducted.
9. LOSS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company’s proﬁt and loss account has not been included
in these ﬁnancial statements. The Company’s loss for the ﬁnancial year was £24,512,000 (2001: £6,587,000).

valuation attached to investment banking and intellectual property company shares. The Directors consider that the goodwill has a
useful economic life of 20 years.

The Group has the right to 50% of The University of Oxford’s founding shareholdings in companies spun out of its
chemistry department for 15 years up to December 2015, at a price equivalent to that subscribed by external investors.
It also has the right to 50% of the royalties due to the University under licences of intellectual property generated by
the chemistry department, entered into during the same period. This agreement was signed in December 2000 and the
invested amount is only repayable out of the proceeds of the sales of shares in spin-out companies to the Group. The
acquisition costs comprising payments to the University and related costs to secure these rights are disclosed
separately, and are amortised over the life of the agreement. In accordance with the agreement any amounts
outstanding at December 2015 will be waived.
In March 2002, the Group, added a second partnership with the University of Southampton alongside its existing
partnership with the University of Oxford. The partnership with the University of Southampton, which has a term of 25
years and which covers the entire University, commits the Group to (i) invest £5 million in seed capital in University of
Southampton spin out companies over a 4 year period in return for equity stakes in those companies and (ii) to
provide technology commercialisation advice and expertise to the University. As part of the partnership, the Group
received a 20% non participating interest in Southampton Asset Management Limited, a company which was set up to 
The Evolution Group Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2002 | 33 15. FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS (continued)
hold the University of Southampton’s equity stakes in spin out companies formed since the commencement of the
partnership until 2027. This interest results in the Group receiving a directly owned 20% stake in those companies in
which the University of Southampton has invested.
Other university spin outs relate to those investments not included within the original partnerships between the
Universities of Oxford and Southampton. They were investments originally made by Beeson Gregory Technology
Investments Limited and subsequently transferred to IP2IPO Limited in July 2001.

The authorised share capital of the Company at 31 December 2001 has been restated to reﬂect the correct split
between ordinary shares of 1p each and deferred shares of 9p each following the share capital reorganisation that took
place in March 2001.
Share Capital Reorganisation
On 18 December 2002 the Company’s application to reduce its share capital and apply its accumulated loss reserves to
the Company’s share premium account was accepted by the High Court and became effective following the registration
of the Court Order at Companies House on 19 December 2002. The effect of this was to reduce the issued share
capital by £6,971,000 and the share premium account by £42,013,000 and reduce the Company’s accumulated losses
by £48,984,000. These proposals were accepted by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 
3 December 2002.
As a result of the reorganisation 447,913,478 authorised but un-issued ordinary shares were cancelled thus reducing
the Company’s authorised share capital to £4,000,000 divided into 400,000,000 ordinary shares of 1p. On the same
date 77,454,058 authorised and issued deferred shares of 9p each were cancelled and extinguished.

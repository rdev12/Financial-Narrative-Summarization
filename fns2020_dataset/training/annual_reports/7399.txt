Annual Report and Accounts 2008

The Group is now of a different scale and 
composition to what it was five years ago 
with 35% of revenues and 50% of profits 
coming from our international operations. 
David Grove 
Chairman
concentration on our core business areas. We have a strong  
track record based on continued product development and the 
redevelopment of the Group through targeted acquisitions and 
disposal of non-core businesses. In 2009 we will continue the 
strategy of selectively investing resources to further improve both 
our market position and geographic spread, and in product 
innovation to deliver value added solutions to our customers.
The Group is led by an experienced and entrepreneurial 
management team that has extensive knowledge of our chosen 
markets. The team’s entrepreneurial focus and enthusiasm has 
been, and will continue to be, an important element of our strategy 
as it drives the individual businesses to innovate and respond quickly 
to opportunities they identify.
Finance
Cash generated from operations was strong at £54.2m  
(2007: £26.9m) reflecting in part the Group’s increased focus  
on day to day cash management. The Group invested £22.5m 
(2007: £19.6m) in capital expenditure in furtherance of its organic 
growth objectives and we are confident that this investment will 
contribute to growth in the coming years. 
Group net debt at 31 December 2008 was £146.2m (2007: £117.8m). 
The Group’s net debt is principally denominated in Euros and US 
Dollars which act as a hedge against the net asset investments in 
overseas businesses. The material depreciation of Sterling towards 
the end of 2008 significantly increased the Sterling reported amounts 
of the foreign currency net debt. Net debt increased year on year by 
£32.6m due to exchange rate movements.
At year end exchange rates, the Group now has a total of over 
£218m of facilities at its disposal, with the principal facility being a 
£150m multi currency facility signed in June 2007 and which runs to 
June 2012. These facilities afford the Group significant headroom 
against its expected requirements.
Acquisitions and disposals 
During the year we acquired the remaining 31.8% of Zinkinvent 
GmbH and at the same time divested the galvanizing operations in 
Benelux and Germany, thereby achieving our long term goal of 
100% ownership of the galvanizing and fabrication businesses in 
France (France Galva SA) and the USA (Voigt & Schweitzer, Inc.). We 
also acquired Creative Pultrusions, Inc., a company based in 
Pennsylvania, USA, manufacturing glass reinforced plastic products 
for the infrastructure and construction markets. Both of these 
acquisitions contributed to our 2008 earnings in line with 
expectations, and significantly strengthen our market positions 
going forward.
Introduction
This time last year I said that I looked forward to reporting another 
year of progress in 2008. I am therefore delighted to report that the 
Group has again produced a set of exceptional results for the year 
ended 31 December 2008, delivering another year of increased 
earnings and growth. 
During 2008 we continued to develop the Group in line with our 
strategy of increasing our concentration on our core business areas, 
of driving growth through product innovation in both existing and 
new geographic markets, and through selective acquisitions.  
A major strength of the Group is the ability to identify growth 
potential in developed and developing markets and this has played 
a significant part in strengthening our market positions, particularly 
in the resilient infrastructure sector. 
The Group is now of a different scale and composition to what  
it was five years ago with 35% of revenues and 50% of profits 
coming from our international operations.
Results from continuing businesses
Group revenue increased by 27.4% to £419.8m (2007: £329.6m). 
Profit before taxation in the period increased by 14.0% to £35.1m 
(2007: £30.8m) and underlying profit before taxation
(†)
 increased  
by 25.5% to £38.9m (2007: £31.0m). Basic earnings per share 
increased by 1.7% to 30.0p (2007: 29.5p) whereas underlying 
earnings per share
(†)
, a more consistent and meaningful measure of 
performance, was 23.4% ahead of last year at 32.2p (2007: 26.1p). 
The underlying earnings per share
(†)
 has now grown by a compound 
average growth rate of 29% over the past five years.
Dividends
These results, together with the Board’s confidence in the Group’s 
prospects, enable the Directors to recommend to shareholders  
a final dividend of 5.7p (2007: 5.1p), making a total dividend for the 
year of 10.0p (2007: 8.7p), an increase of 14.9%. Our progressive 
dividend policy has increased dividend payments by an average of 
22% in each of the last three years. The dividend for the year is 
covered 3.2 times by underlying earnings per share
(†)
. The final 
dividend, if approved, will be paid on 10 July 2009 to those 
shareholders on the register at close of business on 5 June 2009.
Group strategy 
Our strategic objective is to deliver a consistent growth in  
earnings, dividend and shareholder value, through an increasing

Our key strengths During 2008 we continued the strategic review of our non-core 
businesses and successfully disposed of Express Reinforcements 
Limited and D&J (Steels) Limited.
Board of Directors
In the announcement of the Company’s interim results made  
on 18 August 2008 I stated that I would be retiring at the end  
of 2009 and in accordance with this intention I have agreed with 
the Board that, with effect from the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 12 May 2009, I will become 
Non-executive Chairman.
 
Our succession planning has continued throughout the year  
and we are in the process of recruiting a suitable replacement  
for Dick Richardson, following his decision to retire from the 
Board at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be 
held on 12 May 2009. The Board will report to shareholders as 
soon as a decision is made. Dick has contributed significantly to 
the development and operation of the Board over the last twelve 
years and along with my Board colleagues I thank him for all that 
he has done for the Company.
Outlook
The Board are adopting a cautious outlook for the current  
year in view of the uncertainty over the scale and impact  
of the global economic downturn and on the timing of the 
infrastructure spending for the various government fiscal stimulus 
packages. Overall we are strongly positioned in broadly resilient 
markets, have strong positions in those markets and improved 
geographical balance, all of which will help us to deal with the 
current economic conditions.

Overview of our performance
2008 was another year of strong growth, achieved through  
product development and increased market penetration, and 
through selective acquisitions. This strategy has been successful  
in continuing to transform Hill & Smith into a Group with leading 
international positions in its chosen markets. 
We have also targeted our Infrastructure Products Group (‘IPG’) on 
further development of our involvement in the roads, rail, utilities, 
and security sectors of the infrastructure market. To this end, we 
have established HS Roads, HS Rail, HS Utilities and HS Security 
within the IPG.
Revenue from continuing businesses increased 27.4% to £419.8m 
(2007: £329.6m) which includes £71.0m from 2007 acquisitions. 
Organic growth was 2% and exchange rate movements contributed 
£8.7m helped by the appreciation of both the Euro and US Dollar 
versus Sterling. Underlying operating profit
(†)
 increased by 28.5%  
to £47.4m (2007: £36.9m) of which acquisitions contributed £4.1m. 
Exchange movements accounted for a further £2.1m (6%) year on 
year improvement and organic growth was again strong at 10%. 
Excluding the Associate income in 2007, underlying operating 
margin
(†)
 improved by 1.0% to 11.3%.
Group strategy
The strategic objective is to deliver a consistent growth in  
earnings, dividend and shareholder value, through an increasing 
concentration on the core business areas. Through a clear focus on 
our core strategic drivers (organic growth, geographic expansion, 
selective acquisitions and growth of legislative requirements) we 
aim to continue delivery of this objective.
During 2008 we successfully completed a number of initiatives for 
all four drivers of our strategy, as highlighted opposite, including 
significant acquisitions and development of the product range. Our 
actions have resulted in the Group having a significant international 
scale, bringing potential for growth and resilience.
We are committed to retain our position as a preferred choice 
supplier in our chosen market segments. To help achieve this  
we have an experienced and entrepreneurial management team 
capable of delivering product development and value based 
solutions. On page 27 we have given biographical details of the  
key management driving our core and international businesses to 
ensure we remain in leading positions in our markets.

Divisional highlights
All three divisions performed well in the face of an increasingly 
challenging market environment. Infrastructure Products delivered 
an excellent result with organic growth from the roads, rail and 
utilities sectors of the infrastructure market. The acquisition of 
Creative Pultrusions Inc. significantly adds to our presence in the 
USA and our overall product range. Creative Pultrusions have 
already collaborated with other Group businesses, Redman 
Composites and Access Engineering, in supplying glass reinforced 
plastic (GRP) product for a rail platform at East Midlands Parkway 
station (please see page 16 for details).
 
The economic conditions impacted the tonnage volumes for  
our Galvanizing Services division, although volumes were up by 
4.7% in our US galvanizing operation, where we completed the 
construction of a new galvanizing plant in Delaware USA. This 
new plant commenced production in January 2009. 
During the year we gained full control of Zinkinvent’s galvanizing 
and fabricating businesses in France and the USA enabling us to 
develop and maximise the benefits of their operations. 
Our Building and Construction Products division produced a solid 
profit performance as some of the operations adjusted their cost 
base in response to weakening demand. The industrial flooring 
business continued to trade well, delivering record 
results as their end markets remained strong. 
In November 2008 we disposed of Express 
Reinforcements Limited, who operated in the  
steel reinforcing bar market, as part of our focus  
on higher margin core activities.
Further details of the performance of the three 
divisions are given on page 9 and in the Operational 
Review section of this report on pages 10 to 17.
Outlook
Overall the geographic and end-market diversity  
of the Group, together with its market leading 
positions and track record of delivering returns, 
positions it favourably to deal with the challenges 
and opportunities arising from the current 
economic conditions.

Operational Performance
The review of each of the Group’s three operating divisions of 
Infrastructure Products Group, Galvanizing Services and Building 
and Construction Products is given below: 
Infrastructure Products Group (‘IPG’)
Our Infrastructure Products Group is focused on four main 
markets – roads, rail, utilities and security. We have developed  
HS Roads, HS Rail, HS Utilities and HS Security to drive and focus 
each operating unit on growing our revenue and profitability in 
these sectors of the infrastructure market. The extensive range of 
products include permanent and temporary road safety barriers, 
fencing, energy grid components, street lighting columns, bridge 
parapets, temporary car parks, GRP railway platforms, variable 
road messaging solutions, traffic data collection systems, plastic 
drainage pipes and pipe supports for the power and Liquid 
Natural Gas (‘LNG’) markets, energy grid components and 
security fencing.
Revenue increased by 32.1% to £191.8m in 2008 (2007: 
£145.2m) with organic growth, excluding exchange rate 
movements, of 12%. Underlying operating profit
(†)
 improved  
by 26.8% to £23.2m (2007: £18.3m) driven by strong organic 
growth of 15%.
During the year we experienced unprecedented increases in  
raw material prices, the impact of which was managed through 
the supply chain. This had the effect of increasing revenues 
without a corresponding increase in profits, resulting in  
a small underlying operating margin
(†)
 reduction, down by  
0.5% to 12.1% (2007: 12.6%). 
HS Roads
We continued to strengthen our position in the resilient roads 
market in addition to introducing new products to provide 
solutions for our existing and new customer base.
Excellent organic growth was delivered as the Highways Agency 
spend on improving network capacity continued apace. Major 
projects throughout the year included the widening of the M1 
where our temporary safety barrier ‘VARIOGUARD’ and vehicle 
restraint system ‘FLEXBEAM’ were deployed. As a result of this 
project, the VARIOGUARD rental pool increased over the year  
by 20km to 148km.
(†) excludes the effect of business reorganisation costs, property items, amortisation of 
acquisition intangibles, impairments, change in the value of financial instruments 
and net financing return on pension obligations.
We continued to strengthen our position 
in the resilient roads market in addition 
to introducing new products to provide 
solutions for our existing and new 
customer base. 
Another strong performance came from the  
supply of our new bridge parapet systems for 
projects in the UK, Eire and the Middle East. Our 
bridge parapet business enters 2009 with potential 
for growth from a strong export order book.
The variable electronic message signage business 
enjoyed a good second half performance giving  
rise to a substantial increase in profitability, as it 
delivered the next generation of variable electronic 
message signs on schemes across the UK under a 
four year Highways Agency contract. The order 
book is robust for 2009 with the managed 
motorways programme being a key area of 
infrastructure spend for the Highways Agency.
TopDeck, our innovative temporary or permanent 
car park structure, made its debut in May 2008 
with a significant contract for Gatwick Airport.  
This was followed by a second installation for a 
BMW dealership in Newcastle. We believe that  
the TopDeck product has a great future, particularly 
as a solution for parking congestion at airports, rail 
stations, shopping centres and hospitals. We do 
however view 2009 with caution as this product 
represents a significant capital investment  
for customers.
We also launched a number of new perimeter barrier 
systems for new builds and the refurbishment of 
existing multi-storey car parks, the largest of which 
was a major project at Heathrow’s Terminal 5.
Our UK lighting column operation produced an 
improved performance in 2008, continuing to 
benefit from the more efficient production and 
operating facilities at its new site in Chesterfield. 
This operation is poised to take advantage of the 
large anticipated spend on lighting columns by the 
regenerated PFI initiative, once funding is secured. 
The lighting column operation based in France 
continued to develop its strategy for niche markets 
and traded well, in line with expectations.

Standing 6.5m tall, the “Rise” sculpture was 
commissioned by Glasgow Harbour as part of the 
City’s riverside regeneration project. The statue was 
built by fabricating a steel frame skeleton of 12 and 
16mm diameter bars, clad with a mosaic of steel flat 
bar. Joseph Ash used its expertise to galvanize each 
section and the statue was unveiled in May 2008

We are focused upon extending our

strategy has positioned us to take further 
advantage of the opportunities arising 
in this growing market.
HS Rail
We are focused upon extending our product offering in the  
rail sector and our strategy has positioned us to take further 
advantage of the opportunities arising in this growing market, 
either through established businesses or acquisitions. 2008 saw 
positive evidence of our success with the new ‘Structured 
Solutions’ product completing its first major project at the 
Dobwalls Bypass in Liskeard, Cornwall where we installed a 
‘BEBO’ concrete rail arch. 
The acquisition of Creative Pultrusions Inc. advanced the  
strategy of increasing our presence in the US and at the same 
time complementing our Group product offering and expertise  
to afford us additional growth opportunities. 
Creative Pultrustions Inc. is an industry leader offering high-
strength pultruded products in a GRP material. The acquisition 
has been fully integrated and we are positioning the business to 
take maximum advantage of expenditure arising from President 
Obama’s economic infrastructure initiatives. In the UK we 
completed our first GRP railway platform for the new East 
Midlands Parkway station, using Creative’s GRP product, an 
example of the complementary value of the acquisition.
HS Utilities
All our businesses performed well in the growing utilities market 
with energy expenditure, particularly LNG, driving demand for our 
products which include pipe supports, storage tanks and large 
diameter pipes.
Our pipe supports operation in Thailand increased revenues by 
48% following the transfer of further production from the UK. 
This has enabled us to compete globally on price and service, 
supplying products to LNG, power and petrochemical projects  
at lower unit costs whilst retaining a level of production expertise 
and capacity at our UK plant, which now operates from a smaller 
more efficient facility. The 2009 order book for pipe supports 
continues to be at a healthy level.
In the USA, the V&S Utilities operation finished the year well, 
after a slow start, and we are encouraged by President Obama’s 
stimulus package for national grid improvements and renewable 
energy projects, particularly for the transmission and substation 
markets served by V&S Utilities. 
At the Glendoe Hydro-Electric Scheme in Scotland 
we completed the supply of 11,000 metres of large 
diameter HDPE plastic pipe. This major contract 
offset the reduction in the storm water attenuation 
market resulting from the lack of new housing 
projects. Increased revenues came from supplying 
water authorities for their AMP4 spend, mainly on 
upgrades to waste water treatment works and 
major sewage overflow schemes. 
Our specialist Envirotanks operation, which 
manufactures large industrial storage tanks, had  
a record year buoyed by the supply of fuel tanks  
to major clients such as the MoD and Royal Mail.
HS Security
Demand for palisade fencing was lower year on 
year and the focus has been on the development  
of new fence systems and growth in overseas 
markets to counter this.
Bristorm, our anti-terrorist security product had a 
strong year, increasing the number of sites being 
protected by its wire rope barrier system.
Galvanizing Services
Galvanizing Services provides zinc and other 
coatings for a wide range of products including 
fencing, lighting columns, structural steel work, 
bridges, agricultural and other products for the 
infrastructure and construction sectors.
Revenues increased by 54.4% to £127.1m in  
2008 (2007: £82.3m) with the 2007 acquisitions 
contributing £52.0m to the year on year growth. 
The reduction in zinc commodity prices together 
with lower volumes experienced towards the end  
of the year resulted in organic revenue decline of  
9% overall. Underlying operating profit
(†)
 improved  
by 28.8% to £19.7m (2007: £15.3m) with acquisitions 
contributing £2.6m and a benefit from exchange  
of £1.7m. Excluding these improvements the 
performance of the division was in line with  
the prior year.

With the acquisition of the final minority interest in the 
galvanizing and fabrication businesses of Zinkinvent, we are  
now able to develop and expand the operations in France and 
the USA as wholly owned businesses. In France, volumes were 
down 8.2% but in the context of the market place the business 
performed well. In the US, volumes were up 4.7% due to high 
infrastructure activity. We further increased our coverage of the 
east coast of the US with the construction of a new plant in 
Delaware which started production in January 2009.
For the first three quarters our UK operations produced excellent 
tonnages which included 12,000 tonnes of structural steel for an 
LNG plant in Qatar. However, a weaker final quarter led to a 6.7% 
decline in UK volumes for the year as a whole. 
Building and Construction Products
Building and Construction Products supplies such products as 
roofing systems, safety handrails and flooring, lintels and doors  
in steel and, increasingly, composite materials. These building  
and construction products are for a range of construction 
projects including those for schools and public buildings.
The reported 2007 revenues for this division have been restated 
to exclude Express Reinforcements Limited which was disposed  
of in November 2008. On that basis, revenues from continuing 
operations in 2008 fell by 1.2% to £100.9m (2007: £102.1m). 
However, the division generated good organic growth of £1.2m 
resulting in underlying operating profit
(†) 
increasing by 36.4% to 
£4.5m (2007: £3.3m). Significant reductions in the cost base in 
response to falling demand levels and improved efficiencies 
contributed to this improved performance.
The industrial flooring operations continued to trade well, 
producing record performances. Their end markets should remain 
strong as the demand for industrial flooring and safety handrails 
in infrastructure projects remains robust. 
Our Access Engineering and Redman Composites operations 
successfully completed the manufacture and installation of the GRP 
railway platform at the new East Midlands Parkway rail station, 
having been supplied with the material by Creative Pultrusions Inc. 
Volumes of lintels and residential doors at Birtley Building 
Products were down due to the decline in the UK housebuilding 
market. Early action was taken to reduce costs and the business  
is well placed to ride out the downturn in projects and respond 
to any future upturn in the market.
Ash & Lacy Building Systems had a strong first half of 2008. 
However, as large building projects were completed the order 
book has not been replenished to the same levels and 
action has been taken to reduce costs. The current 
year has started slowly as a number of PFI projects 
have been delayed due to funding constraints.
Bromford Iron and Steel managed the volatility  
of the price of steel well and produced very good 
results. The steel mesh production unit was closed 
at the time of the sale of Express Reinforcements 
Limited and we have now exited the commodity 
reinforcing bar market completely, focusing on 
specialised higher margin products.
Operational outlook
Government commitments to infrastructure 
spending during the current global economic 
volatility will continue to underpin the performance 
of many of our operations. The IPG division has 
seen a solid start to the year and both the UK  
and President Obama’s recent economic stimulus 
plans will assist our infrastructure and galvanizing 
businesses domestically and in the US. We are 
however mindful of the fact that the spending 
stimulus may not impact significantly until the 
second half of 2009 and as our profits are normally 
biased marginally to the first half, this could lead to 
a more even profit balance in 2009. 
Galvanizing in both France and the UK has 
experienced a material slowdown since our Interim 
Management Statement in November 2008. Whilst 
we are encouraged by galvanizing volumes in the 
US remaining robust and more generally the number 
of enquiries for major projects, these projects are 
likely to be skewed towards the second half of 
2009 and possibly into 2010. In the meantime 
actions have been taken to reduce manning and 
operational costs accordingly.
The volumes in the building and construction sector 
will continue to be affected by the economic 
conditions and we are adopting a cautious 
approach to our expectations for any short term 
recovery for a number of the products we supply 
into this sector.

Chief Executive
The industrial flooring operations

Financial Review
Overview
From our continuing operations, we generated record levels of 
revenue and profitability. Revenue increased by 27.4% to £419.8m 
(2007: £329.6m), underlying profit before taxation
(†)
 grew by 
25.5% to £38.9m (2007: £31.0m) and underlying earnings per 
share
(†)
 were 23.4% higher at 32.2p (2007: 26.1p).
Discontinued businesses 
Following the acquisition on 2 July 2007 of Zinkinvent GmbH 
the Group decided that it did not wish to retain the Benelux and 
German trading operations of that company. Accordingly, these 
businesses have continued to be accounted for as discontinued 
operations from the date of acquisition. These operations were 
disposed of in August 2008 for a consideration of £22.1m, 
including deferred consideration of £1.0m. 
In November 2008, the Group exited the steel bar reinforcing 
market through the disposal of its interests in Express 
Reinforcements Limited and the cessation of its related activities. 
These operations have been treated as discontinued activities 
in 2008 and the comparatives for 2007 have been restated. 
Consideration receivable in respect of Express Reinforcements 
Limited was £13.2m (including cash balances disposed of £3.8m) 
which resulted in a profit on disposal of £3.1m.
Acquisitions
In July 2008 we completed the acquisition of the remaining 31.8% 
minority shareholding in Zinkinvent GmbH for £18.8m giving 
the Group 100% ownership of the galvanizing and fabrication 
operations in Benelux, Germany, France and the US. This was 
followed by the divestment of the Benelux and German businesses 
as reported above under ‘Discontinued businesses’.
In addition to the above we acquired Creative Pultrusions Inc. in 
September 2008 for a cash consideration of £12.8m.
Exchange rates
The movement in exchange rates between 2007 and 2008 resulted 
in our reported 2008 revenue and underlying operating profit
(†)
 
being 3% and 6% higher respectively. The Euro and US Dollar 
both strengthened significantly particularly later in the second 
half of the year. If current exchange rates of €1.12 and $1.42 had 
been applied to our 2008 results, it is estimated that revenue and 
underlying operating profit
(†)
 would have been approximately 6% 
and 9% higher respectively.
Finance costs
Net financing costs rose by £2.7m to £8.3m, 
principally reflecting the full year interest charge on 
the debt taken on to acquire Zinkinvent in July 2007 
and the impact of translation due to exchange rate 
movements. The cash element of net financing costs 
is £8.0m (2007: £5.5m). Underlying operating profit
(†)
 
covered net cash interest 5.9 times (2007: 6.7 times). 
Historically the Group has not entered into any 
material fixed interest rate agreements on its principal 
financing arrangements, although the Group is 
currently contemplating committing a proportion 
of its net debt to such instruments. Nevertheless, 
given the Group’s previous policy of utilising floating 
interest rates, the Group expects to take advantage 
of recent reductions in UK and other bank base rates 
and reduce its finance costs in 2009.
 
Tax
The Group’s tax charge for the year was £15.3m 
(2007: £10.0m). The underlying effective tax rate 
for the continuing businesses was 37.5% compared 
to 39.2% (after adjusting for the post tax Associate 
income) for 2007. Further details are set out in  
note 8. Following the acquisition of the remaining 
minority interest in Zinkinvent GmbH in 2008, the 
Group expects to be able to deliver further reductions 
in its underlying effective tax rate.
Cash generation and financing
Cash generated from operations was strong at 
£54.2m (2007: £26.9m) reflecting in part the Group’s 
increased focus on day to day cash management. The 
Group invested £22.5m (2007: £19.6m) in capital 
expenditure in furtherance of its organic growth 
objectives including £5m in constructing a new US 
galvanizing plant in Delaware. Capital expenditure, 
as a multiple of depreciation and amortisation, was 
1.8 times (2007: 2.2 times). Management continues 
to maintain strict control on capital expenditure 
commensurate with growth plans and funding 
availability. In 2009, capital expenditure is expected 
to be approximately £13.0m, substantially less than 
recent years and representing around one times
The Group now has over £218m of 
facilities at its disposal which provides 
significant headroom against its expected 
requirements.

depreciation and amortisation. However, the Group will continue 
in its strategy of investing in selective organic growth initiatives 
where returns are strong and with a high degree of certainty.
Group net debt at 31 December 2008 was £146.2m  
(2007: £117.8m). The Group’s net debt is principally 
denominated in Euros and US Dollars which act as a hedge 
against the net asset investments in overseas businesses.  
The material depreciation of Sterling towards the end of  
2008 significantly increased the Sterling reported amount  
of the foreign currency net debt. Net debt increased year  
on year by £32.6m due to exchange rate movements.
At the year end the Group had committed facilities available 
of £169.3m and a further £26.6m in overdrafts and other on 
demand facilities. Since the year end, at constant exchange rates, 
the Group has increased its committed net facilities by a further 
£22.5m. The Group’s principal debt facility is a £150m multi 
currency facility signed in June 2007 and which runs to June 
2012. The facility amortises throughout its existence with  
£11.4m and £18.4m falling due for repayment in 2009 and  
2010 respectively.
At year end exchange rates, the Group now has over £218m 
of facilities at its disposal which provides significant headroom 
against its expected requirements. During the year the Group 
remained well within its banking covenants and expects to 
remain so throughout 2009.
Pensions
At the year end the obligations for retirement benefits were 
£11.8m, an increase of £2.1m. In the UK the deficit on the 
defined benefits scheme increased to £10.4m as a result of a 
fall in the value of assets, partially offset by a higher corporate 
bond discount rate and reduced inflation expectations. The next 
triennial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme is April 2009.

Key Performance Indicators
Revenue
Our aim is to increase revenue each year through a combination of 
price and volume increases, organic growth and acquisition. 
In 2008, we increased our Group revenue by 27.4% to £419.8m. 
Organic growth, excluding the effects of exchange movements, 
acquisitions and disposals, contributed 2% of this growth.
Subsidiary performance
We continue to focus on year on year profit growth, the 
management of working capital, stock turnover, debtor and 
creditor days, and return on operating capital employed. 
Other indicators relating to production efficiency and customer 
satisfaction are monitored where these are relevant to a 
subsidiary’s business.
Underlying operating margin
This represents the Group’s underlying operating profit
(†)
* divided 
by Group revenue. In 2008 our underlying operating margin was 
11.3% compared to 10.3% in the previous year.
Profitability
Our main profitability KPIs are underlying profit before tax
(†)
 and 
underlying earnings per share
(†)
. These measures increased in 2008 
by 25.5% and 23.4% respectively compared to the previous year.
Sustainability
Further progress has been made on achievement of our identified 
priorities of greater energy efficiency and lower CO
2
 emissions.  
Of particular note was the achievement of our UK galvanizing 
operation in reducing energy consumption year on year, from  
397 kwh/tonne in 2007 to 326 kwh/tonne in 2008.
We have added to our KPIs the CO
2
 usage per £ of revenue and 
this will be incorporated into future reporting.
Net cash from operating activities
The Company actively monitors working capital levels in all its 
operations. In 2008 Group net cash inflow from operating activities 
was £54.2m compared to £26.9m in 2007. This increase included 
an adverse movement in working capital of £4.0m (2007: £13.1m 
adverse).
Health and safety
The safety performance of each subsidiary is monitored, reviewed  
and reported to the Board at each Board meeting. The number of 
reported incidents is monitored each month, with 2008 showing a 
12.3% reduction in the number of accidents. An audited scoring 
system is being introduced for future reporting to identify and 
correct any weaknesses and improve monitoring of the average 
time lost per accident.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Group is required to formally review the principal areas of risk and uncertainty  
for all its businesses in order for the major risks to be addressed at all levels.
Those general risks and uncertainties that apply to most international manufacturing 
businesses apply to the Group. Typically these include changes in economic conditions, 
legislation, regulations, political policies, taxation and the impact of changes in the 
dynamics of the markets the Group operates in.
Outlined below and on the following page is a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties specific to our businesses, together with commentary on the monitoring  
and mitigation of such risks.
Risks and uncertainties Monitoring and mitigation
Market dynamics and competition
The Group operates in a business environment where it needs 
to be proactive with regards to market dynamics including 
customer preference, new technology, regulatory changes and 
competition, all of which could have an adverse effect on the 
financial performance of the Group.
We monitor those businesses most likely to be impacted by 
these risks and the markets in which they operate, working 
with customers and regulatory bodies to continue to satisfy 
their requirements. Our investment and commitment to 
research and product development continues to ensure we 
maintain strong competitive market positions.
Commercial relationships
The Group benefits from close commercial relationships with a 
number of long standing key customers and suppliers. The loss 
of any of these or a significant worsening of commercial terms 
could have an impact on the Group’s reported results.
The Group ensures sufficient resource is devoted to maintaining 
the close commercial relationships we have with customers and 
suppliers.
Financial risks
The Group is exposed to a number of financial risks including 
credit risk, liquidity risk and market risks. 
A description of these risks and the Group’s approach to 
managing them is described in Note 22 and on pages 72-77  
to the Group Financial Statements.
Product failure
Many of the Group’s products are supplied to the public sector 
for the benefit of members of the public. To the extent that any 
of the Group’s products fail, this could generate adverse 
publicity and have a similar effect on the Group’s reputation,  
its financial position and its ability to win new business.
Quality control procedures are applied to help ensure products 
are safe, compliant and fit for purpose and regular reviews are 
undertaken with the Group’s insurance brokers.
Human resources
Future success will depend, to a large degree, on the ability of 
the Group to attract and retain skilled and qualified personnel.
Policies and processes are reviewed and maintained to manage 
the risks relating to our employees. As part of these policies the 
Group seeks to offer competitive rates of pay and review 
salaries annually. Benchmarking of pay rates is undertaken 
along with performance appraisals and training programmes.

In recent years there has been a significant volatility in the price of 
certain of the Group’s key raw materials, particularly steel, which is 
used in the fabrication of many of the Group’s products, and zinc, 
which is used in the Group’s galvanizing operations. 
In common with all manufacturing businesses, the Group’s 
operations are dependent on the cost and availability of energy. 
Any supply interruptions or increase in energy costs will have an 
effect on our financial performance.
We monitor the availability and price of key raw materials and 
energy and where appropriate forward purchase these where 
prices are forecast to increase. Where market conditions permit, 
any increase in raw material or energy costs are reflected in our 
selling prices.
Acquisitions
The Group is an active acquirer. Acquisitions can involve risks that 
might have a material impact on the Group’s financial performance 
and reputation.
Comprehensive due diligence is carried out prior to the completion 
of an acquisition and, where practical, representations, warranties 
and indemnities are obtained from vendors. A post acquisition 
review of the integration and performance is undertaken.
Pensions
Factors outside the Company’s control, such as mortality rates, 
interest and inflation rates and investment performance, may lead 
to an increase in the deficit and Company contributions.
The Group liaises regularly with the Trustees and reviews any 
issues. These reviews consider risk mitigation through such actions 
as enhanced transfer values.

Business Review
Corporate Social Responsibility Review
Our strategy
To make the principles of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) part 
of our business to ensure high standards of corporate behaviour 
are maintained throughout the Group. This will be demonstrated 
by measured improvements in our CSR performance.
Responsibilities and accountability
The Board of Directors have implemented policies dealing with 
the Group’s responsibilities for the environment and relationships 
with its various stakeholder groups, including its employees. The 
policies are based upon a combination of custom and practice 
from around the Group along with industry best practice. They 
are reviewed and updated, as and when necessary, to reflect 
changes to legislation, emerging best practice and the needs of 
the business. D W Muir, the Chief Executive, is the main Board 
Director responsible for CSR in the Group.
Operating company Managing Directors are responsible for  
the implementation and compliance with these policies, their 
communication across the business units and the supporting 
principles. This involves appropriate delegation in parts of the 
business and in eleven of the operating companies this has 
evolved into specific and expanded roles for individual employees 
who act as the CSR champion.
All our employees have a responsibility to be aware of, and to 
comply with, the Group’s policies and procedures, which have 
been developed for their guidance and to regulate the conduct  
of the day-to-day operations of the business. Employees are 
encouraged to make suggestions to improve these policies  
and procedures. 
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
We continue to operate KPIs covering carbon (CO
2
) emissions, 
energy consumption and health and safety. During 2008 we  
have been developing systems for improved waste management 
and related KPI reporting. This will be finalised in 2009 for 
incorporation into our future reporting. 
2008 CSR activity
CO
2
 and energy management
The Group’s operating units report on a regular basis the 
practices for, and the improvements made in, the reduction  
of our CO
2
 emissions. 
Our UK based galvanizing operation, Joseph Ash, again achieved 
a year on year reduction in energy consumption, reducing it from 
the level of 397 kwh/tonne in 2007 to 326 kwh/
tonne for 2008. This also compares favourably to 
the Climate Change Levy target of 379 kwh/tonne.
Through the work with the Carbon Trust we have 
significantly increased the number of “smart meters” 
fitted to monitor and analyse electricity usage at 
our operating plants in the UK. Throughout the 
year we arranged training sessions to improve the 
effectiveness of these meters, resulting in further 
reductions in energy consumption. The installation 
and training programmes are increasing in scope as 
the initial trials demonstrate positive results. The 
future impact on our energy costs and CO
2 
emissions will be reported.
 
For our UK operations CMR Energy Consultants 
carried out a further review of our energy 
consumption. The review focused on routine 
maintenance, the repair of compressors, reviewing 
and adjusting heating systems and improving 
lighting efficiency. A number of opportunities were 
identified enabling us to reduce electricity and gas 
consumption. The savings have been delivered at 
relatively low cost. In addition, our related CO
2
 
emissions fell by 23%. The next stage of the project 
is being undertaken during 2009 with the focus 
upon energy usage for operational equipment.
Overall our UK operations have successfully 
managed their CO
2
 emissions during the year to 
achieve a 17% reduction in CO
2
 tonnage per £ of 
revenue. This achievement exceeds our stated target 
of a 5% reduction in CO
2
 emissions year on year.
Renewable energy
During the year we identified a suitable site and 
began the process of evaluating the introduction  
of a 2 mwh wind turbine to generate electricity  
for two of our UK manufacturing plants. There  
is however, a two-year lead time from the 
commencement of the project to achievement  
of the operational and environmental benefits, 
which are projected to lower our CO
2
 usage by 
3,000 tonnes per annum. We are currently 
continuing with the detailed evaluation for what is 
a major commitment.

Vehicle fleet
Trials involving the use of tracking devices and bio diesel produced 
encouraging results and further evaluation is being undertaken.
We take every opportunity to work with our suppliers and liaise 
with customers to ensure that within our supply chain, transport  
is being optimised and unnecessary journeys reduced. This has 
resulted in saving 105,000 lorry miles at one UK operation. Where 
appropriate, we will implement similar initiatives. 
In respect of company cars we encourage fuel efficient vehicles and 
now have 90% of our cars operating on diesel engines. We have 
also used flexible working patterns to encourage car sharing 
schemes for our employees.
Waste reduction
We continued to develop our systems for waste management  
and related reporting in order to construct suitable KPIs for 
reporting in 2009.
Environmental products
Through our subsidiary, Ash & Lacy Building Systems, we  
have actively marketed environmental roofing products, roof  
tiles for solar energy and rain water harvesting products, all of 
which complement its existing portfolio of building and 
construction products.
Business in the community
Throughout 2008 we encouraged greater engagement with 
communities in which our businesses operate. Many of our 
businesses and employees have been involved in a variety of  
local community projects ranging from sponsorship to making  
time available to organise fund raising events. Of particular note  
are employee sponsorship for Zoe’s Children’s Hospice, donations 
to St Michaels Hospice in Hereford, the Children’s Safety Education 
Council and sponsorship of the Young Persons Musical Youth 
development programme at the Symphony Hall, Birmingham. In  
the USA our operations are highly supportive of local communities 
providing a variety of help to local youth organisations, mountain 
rescue and fire and ambulance services.
We have also donated products to local communities 
for uses such as:
galvanized floor panels to a local fishing club; ideal •	
as fishing platforms for the club members.
our “Weholite” large diameter plastic pipe for use •	
as an “assault course” for training guide dogs.
galvanized products for play equipment for a local •	
school in the USA.
Health and safety
We set ourselves a target of reducing the number of 
accidents by 10% year on year for each of the three 
years 2008-2011. On a like for like basis we have met 
our target for 2008 achieving a 12.3% reduction in 
the number of accidents. 
Environment
The Group’s Environmental Policy is available 
throughout the Group and is published on  
our website.
Our policy requires high standards at all sites  
with the objective of continuous improvement  
in environmental performance, based on risk 
assessment and the management and mitigation  
of identified risks.

Employment 
Policies
The Group relies upon the abilities and commitment of its 
employees and has a clear policy objective of promoting an 
environment in which all employees are motivated and enabled in 
order to achieve their best. Employees at all levels throughout the 
Group are encouraged to make the fullest contribution. Fairness 
and equal opportunity is core to the Group’s employment policy 
and this applies to any job applicant or matters relating to 
gender, age, race, sexual preference, marital status, religion, 
belief or disability.
The Group gives full consideration to applications for 
employment from disabled persons where the requirements of 
the job can be adequately fulfilled by a handicapped or disabled 
person. In the event of an existing employee becoming disabled 
continuing employment will be provided wherever practicable.
Each operating subsidiary has employment and related policies 
and procedures detailed in staff handbooks or employment terms 
and conditions. These are reviewed and updated as necessary in 
the light of any legislative or employment practice changes.
The Group has policies and procedures in place to comply with 
the appropriate requirements of the Data Protection Act.
Employee involvement and reward
Effective communication is encouraged within the Group  
through subsidiary company management, the Group’s website 
and intranet and the development of centralised briefings and 
training programmes
The Company continues to encourage employee share ownership 
through the 2005 Employee ShareSave Scheme. As at the date of 
this report there are 509 employees participating in this and the 
former 1995 SAYE Scheme.
Training and development
Our businesses are increasingly knowledge based. Employing  
the right people and encouraging the continuous development  
of the skills of our employees is key to a successful business. The 
development of individuals at all levels is encouraged with the 
objective of maximising the overall performance of the business.
The Group provide a range of training and 
development opportunities to employees, including:
induction training; •	
health and safety training; •	
programmes relating to the enhancement of •	
knowledge/skills for each employee’s current 
position;
programmes relating to the provision of •	
knowledge/skills for new procedures or 
standards;
programmes with a specific management or •	
supervisory focus; and
support with programmes leading to a •	
professional or academic qualification.
The Group recognises that normally the main 
training method will be through each employee’s 
immediate line manager, with most training carried 
out in the workplace.
We funded thirty training courses during the year 
covering such matters as personal development, 
customer care, presentation skills, performance 
appraisals and stress management.
Health and Safety
Our Group Health and Safety Policy forms the 
foundation of our health and safety management 
together with bespoke systems and processes  
for all our operations. The policy is available 
throughout the Group and is published on our 
website. The policy requires high standards at all 
sites with the objective of continuous improvement 
in health and safety performance.
The management of our health and safety 
performance is aligned with the operation  
of the business and in practice all employees  
are responsible for ensuring that our health  
and safety policies are implemented and for 
identifying additional areas and opportunities  
for further development.

Hill & Smith Holdings PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Our prime health and safety key performance indicators focus on 
accident reporting and causes. These indicators are used to monitor 
the effectiveness of the policy and the related management 
systems, on a monthly basis. During the year, the reporting was 
extended to cover those businesses acquired in that period.
We are working to extend our accident prevention, training and 
auditing programmes throughout the Group.
Our objectives for 2009 remain to work towards a 10% year on 
year reduction in accidents with particular focus on those sites with 
below average performance. We are also developing the 
management and reduction of the average time lost per accident.
Code of Business Operation
The Board has set down a Code of Business Operation that applies 
to all its directors, managers and employees. All directors, 
managers and employees must exercise high standards of integrity 
and sound ethical judgement, adhering to the letter and spirit of 
the Code and of all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the 
conduct of the Group’s business.
Whistleblowing
The Board encourages employees to raise concerns about 
misconduct and malpractice and have adopted a Group 
Whistleblowing Policy and Procedure to ensure that such concerns 
can be raised and reviewed fairly and properly. No matters or 
concerns were raised during the year.
Supply chain
Our policy on the management of human rights, working 
conditions and the environment in the supply chain is one of a 
series of governance policies that are intended to underpin the 
Group’s values.
The Group sources components, materials and services for its 
manufacturing processes from a number of countries. Whilst there 
are local and national differences in standards in relation to many 
aspects of the manufacturing and wider business environment, there 
are a number of minimum standards that must be achieved by all.
Priorities for 2009:
CO •	
2
 Emissions: further improvements 
from management and energy 
conservation.
Health & Safety accident reduction •	
and management of lost working 
time.
Improved waste management. •	
Increased levels of training and •	
development.
Review of standards for our •	
suppliers.
Business Review
Corporate Social Responsibility Review
It is the policy of the Group that it will only trade 
with suppliers who:
meet or exceed these minimum standards; or •	
demonstrate progression towards these standards •	
over an agreed and suitable timescale.

appropriate systems in place to ensure that suppliers 
comply with or exceed the following requirements:
compliance with appropriate legislation; •	
provision of a safe and competent workforce •	
employed in accordance with industry best 
practice;

Hill & Smith Holdings PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
The Directors present their forty-eighth Annual Report  
together with the Financial Statements for the year ended  
31 December 2008.
Principal activities
During 2008 the principal activities of the Group comprised  
the manufacture and supply of:
– Infrastructure Products
– Galvanizing Services
– Building and Construction Products 
The subsidiaries operating within these three areas of business 
are detailed on pages 98 to 100 inclusive.
Business review
The Company is required to set out in this report a fair review  
of the business of the Group during the financial year ended  
31 December 2008, its position at the end of that financial  
year and its prospects.
The information required to be disclosed, in addition to that 
reported below and which is incorporated into this report by 
reference can be found in the Business Review, but excludes  
the section entitled ‘Corporate Social Responsibility’, with the 
exception of the two sections relating to employment policies 
and employee involvement and reward on page 25.
Results 
The Group profit for the year before taxation from continuing 
operations amounted to £35.1m. Revenue and operating profit 
increased by 27.4% and 19.2% respectively compared to the 
previous year. 
Details of the results for the year are shown on the Consolidated 
Income Statement on page 46 and the business segment 
information is given on pages 56 to 58.
Dividends
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of  
5.7p per Ordinary Share (2007: 5.1p per Ordinary Share) which, 
together with the interim dividend of 4.3p per Ordinary Share 
paid on 7 January 2009, makes a total distribution for the year  
of 10.0p per Ordinary Share (2007: 8.7p per Ordinary Share). 
Subject to shareholders approving this recommendation at the 
Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be paid on 10 July 
2009 to shareholders on the register at the close of business  
on 5 June 2009. The latest date for receipt of Dividend  
Re-investment Plan elections is 19 June 2009.
Articles of Association
The rules relating to amendment of the Company’s Articles of 
Association are that any change must be authorised by a Special 
Resolution of the Company in a general meeting.
Share capital
The Company’s issued share capital comprises a single class of 
share capital which is divided into Ordinary Shares of 25 pence 
each. Information concerning the issued share capital of the 
Company is set out in Note 23 to the Group Financial Statements 
on pages 77 to 79. 
During the year, 58,696 new Ordinary Shares were issued  
under employee share schemes, 30,050 under the 1995 Save  
As You Earn Scheme, 14,000 under the 1995 Executive Share 
Option Scheme and 14,646 under the 2005 Executive Share  
Option Scheme.
All of the Company’s shares are Ordinary Shares ranking equally 
and the rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s shares 
are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, copies of 
which can be obtained from Companies House in England and 
Wales or by writing to the Company Secretary.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company 
provided they are fully paid up and the Company does not hold 
any lien over them and as the shares rank equally none of them 
carry any special rights with regards to control of the Company. 
Such equal rights apply to shares acquired through any of the 
Company’s employee share schemes and those shares so acquired 
carry no lesser or greater rights than shares acquired in the 
Company in any other way. Accordingly there are no restrictions 
on voting rights attaching to any shares, whether relating to the 
level of shareholding or otherwise.
The Company is not aware of any arrangements between 
shareholders of the Company that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of Ordinary Shares or voting rights. In relation to the 
purchase by the Company of its own shares the rules relating 
thereto are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association 
which state that the Directors’ powers to authorise such purchase 
by the Company are subject to the provisions of the relevant 
statutes and also the UKLA requirements, as the Company’s 
shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Accordingly a Resolution is put to the members of the Company 
at the Company’s Annual General Meeting in each year (currently 
the authority is limited by the Resolution of the 2008 Annual 
General Meeting and will be limited by the Resolution to be put 
to the 2009 General Meeting) to market purchases not exceeding 
5% of the Company’s then issued share capital. The prices to be 
paid must be a minimum price of 25 pence per Ordinary Share 
(the nominal value) and a maximum price of 5% above the 
average of the middle market quotations for Ordinary Shares 
derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for  
the five business days immediately preceding the day on which 
any such purchase takes place.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 10 March 2009, the Directors had been advised of the 
following holdings representing 3% or more of the issued 
Ordinary Share capital of the Company:
 Number of  
Company Ordinary Shares %
Standard Life Investments 4,173,898 5.52
JPMorgan Asset Management 3,491,919 4.62
Legal & General Investment Management 3,233,829 4.27

re-election at the Annual General Meeting. 
No Director had any interest in any material contract or arrangement in relation to the business of the Company and any of its 
subsidiaries during the year. Details of the Directors’ service contracts are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 43.
Directors are appointed pursuant to the Articles of Association either by the Directors, to fill a vacancy, or by the members in general

Corporate Governance 
  
Governance framework
Effective governance is key to the Company’s ability to operate successfully and discharge its responsibilities in a challenging global 
business environment. The focus is on providing a simple but effective framework of business principles, structures and controls 
designed to drive standards and performance across the Group and accountability to the Company’s shareholders for the conduct  
of the Company’s affairs.
The Board’s commitment to a high standard of corporate governance is designed to underpin integrity within the Group and preserve 
investor confidence in the decisions taken by the Board. You can find out more about our approach to corporate governance by 
accessing the following documents online at www.hsholdings.com.
– Terms of reference for the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees
– Corporate Social Responsibility Policies (inc Health & Safety)
– Business Operating Policy
Compliance with the Combined Code
With the exception of the matters detailed below, the Directors consider the Company has fully complied throughout 2008 with the 
principles set out in Section 1 of the UK Financial Reporting Council’s Combined Code of Corporate Governance.
A former Chief Executive should not become the Chairman •	
The appointment of D L Grove was discussed with major shareholders prior to his formal acceptance of the role. Major shareholders 
were supportive of the rationale behind the appointment decision and have continued to be supportive. The Board considered the 
significant benefits of continuity, as well as the leadership that D L Grove would bring to the role of Chairman, and has been satisfied 
that this has been the case.
The Board is to assess the Non-executive Directors’ independence •	
R E Richardson, Senior Independent Director, was appointed to the Board on 1 May 1997. His length of service on the Board exceeds 
the nine years referred to in the Combined Code. The Board considers that R E Richardson maintained an independent and rigorous 
approach to the Group’s business and his length of service has not been an impairment to his independence. R E Richardson will not  
be standing for annual re-election at the forthcoming AGM and will retire.
H C Marshall’s membership of the Board has always been as a Non-executive Director and his Board colleagues consider him as  
being independent in his approach to the role and in his judgement and character. He has no interests or relationships that affect his 
independent approach.

necessary to properly discharge his duties. He facilitates the effective engagement of the Non-executive Directors. He is responsible, 
jointly with the Chief Executive, for communication with the Company’s shareholders, and representation of the Group externally.
The Chief Executive, D W Muir, has executive responsibility for executing the Group’s strategy and development. He leads the 
management of the Group with the aim of optimising long-term shareholder value by meeting key strategic and financial objectives.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Biographical details of all the Directors are set out on page 29.
The Company Secretary is responsible for assisting the Chairman in all matters relating to corporate governance. 
Details of the terms of appointment of both the Executive and Non-executive Directors are set out on pages 40 and 41 of the  
Directors’ Remuneration Report, which refers to Executive service contracts and Non-executive letters of appointment, copies  
of which are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office and which will be available for inspection at the  
forthcoming Annual General Meeting to be held on 12 May 2009.
Re-election of Directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles, not more than one-third of the Directors are required to be re-elected at each Annual 
General Meeting of the Company, the Directors so doing being those who have been longest in office since their last appointment  
or re-election. Every Director must in any event be re-elected at least every three years.
D W Muir and H C Marshall are the Directors retiring by rotation at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company and, 
being eligible, offer themselves for re-appointment. The Board and the Nominations Committee support the re-appointment of  
D W Muir and H C Marshall having assessed their performance, value to the Board and its Committees and their ability to continue  
to operate as Directors.
As recommended by the Combined Code, Non-executive Directors who have been in office for more than nine years are required to 
stand for re-election at the next Annual General Meeting. R E Richardson was appointed to the Board on 1 May 1997 and will not be 
seeking re-election at the Annual General Meeting and will retire from the Board.
The role of the Board and its effectiveness
The Board is responsible to the Company’s shareholders for strategic direction, financial performance and monitoring, resource 
allocation, risk management, governance and internal controls. The schedule of matters reserved to the Board for its own and its 
Committees’ decisions ensures exclusive decision-making powers over these responsibilities as well as such matters as remuneration 
policies, accounting policies, capital expenditure, acquisitions, disposals and financing. The Board adopts an annual timetable to ensure 
significant matters are given appropriate consideration and sufficient time for debate.
The Directors ensure the effectiveness of the Board through regular Board meetings and by having open lines of communication 
between Board members. Details of attendances at these meetings are set out below:

The Board is supplied in a timely manner with the appropriate information to enable it to discharge its duties, including providing 
constructive challenge to, and scrutiny of the management of the Company. Further information is obtained by the Board from the 
Executive Directors and other relevant Senior Executives as the Board, particularly its Non-executive members, considers appropriate. 
Procedures are in place for Directors to take independent professional advice, when necessary, at the Company’s expense.
The Board is supported by the Company Secretary who, under the direction of the Chairman, ensures good communication  
and information flows within the Board, including between Executive and Non-executive Directors and between the Board and  
its Committees. 
Board balance and independence 
Having assessed the three Non-executive Directors against the criteria set out in the Combined Code the Board continues to consider 
them to be independent. All three Non-executive Directors remain independent of management and free from any business or other 
relationship that would materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. The Board membership and that of its 
Committees is designed to ensure that no one individual or group dominates proceedings and that the wide variety of skills allows 
effective leadership across the business activities of the Group.

Annual Report and Accounts 200808  
Board development
The Board believes that the benefit of its collective experience  
is a valuable asset but accepts that Directors need to keep their 
professional knowledge up to date from time to time. Consequently, 
the Board has agreed guidelines for meeting their own training 
needs. The Board has also adopted a procedure to enable 
Directors to take professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
The Board and each of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration 
Committees undertake performance evaluations. A questionnaire 
is circulated to Directors concerning the performance of the 
Board as a whole and its main committees. Once all 
questionnaires have been completed, the results are compiled 
and summarised by the Company Secretary, and the Chairman 
will report the collective findings to the Board and agree any 
actions required. The areas covered include effectiveness of 
individual contributions, relationships, communication and 
development.
Committees of the Board
The Board has three Committees, as follows:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of the three Non-executive 
Directors and is chaired by R E Richardson. The Company 
Secretary acts as its secretary. Executive Directors are invited  
to attend as necessary. The objectives of the Audit Committee 
have been confirmed in its terms of reference as:
ensuring the integrity of the Financial Statements  •	
of the Company;
reviewing and monitoring the Group’s internal  •	
control systems;
overseeing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal  •	
audit activity;
overseeing the Group’s relationship with its external  •	
auditors; and
ensuring that Group reporting complies in all respects with •	
relevant statutory and required financial reporting standards, 
including corporate governance disclosures.
Financial Reporting: a procedure setting out responsibilities for 
the preparation of the Group’s Financial Statements and their 
review by the external auditor and the Audit Committee has been 
documented. This also sets out the basis on which the Board 
makes its statement on ‘Going Concern’. The Audit Committee 
reviewed the preliminary and interim statements prior to their 
approval by the Board. The Committee has also considered the 
external auditor’s management letter and the assumptions 
underlying the Financial Statements prior to recommending  
their approval to the Board.
External Reporting: the Audit Committee has an agreed 
procedure setting out the basis upon which the Committee will 
consider and make recommendations as appropriate concerning 
the appointment, re-appointment or removal of the external 
auditor. The Committee assesses the qualification, expertise, 
independence and objectivity of the auditor on an annual basis 
and has set down a timetable and criteria for making those 
assessments. Policies concerning the employment of former 
employees of the external auditor and the use of the external 
auditor to perform non-audit services have been adopted. In 
regard to the latter, the Committee believes that there are certain 
non-audit services where it is cost effective for the external 
auditor to be used. These primarily include merger and 
acquisition due diligence work and pensions administration, 
actuarial and consultancy services. A number of activities are 
prohibited including work on accounting records, internal audit, 
IT consultancy and advice to the Remuneration Committee. The 
policy is consistent with the ethical standards recommended by 
the Accounting Practices Board. 
The Committee approves the scope and terms of engagement  
of each audit, and then reviews the performance of the auditor 
following the completion of each audit.
Remuneration Committee
The membership of the Remuneration Committee comprises  
the three Non-executive Directors and is chaired by H C Marshall.  
The Company Secretary acts as its secretary. D L Grove and 
D W Muir are invited to attend meetings as necessary.
Under its terms of reference, the Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for:
ensuring that the Company’s Executive Directors and  •	
certain other agreed Senior Executives are fairly and properly 
rewarded for their individual contributions to the Company’s 
overall performance;
demonstrating to shareholders and other interested parties •	
that the remuneration (including all benefits and terms of 
employment) of the Executive Directors of the Company are 
set by a committee of Board members who have no personal 
interest in the outcome of their decisions and who will give 
due regard to the interests of the Shareholders and to the 
financial and commercial health of the Company; and
assessing how the Company should comply with established •	
best practice in Directors’ remuneration.
Full details of the role, policies and activities of the Remuneration 
Committee are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 37 to 43.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises the three Non-executive 
Directors and D L Grove (Chairman) and D W Muir (Chief 
Executive). The Chairman of the Committee is D L Grove and  
the Company Secretary acts as the secretary of the Committee.
The Board understands the need to refresh its membership and, 
to that end, has established a Nominations Committee whose 
objectives are:
ensuring that the size and composition of the Board is •	
appropriate for the needs of the Group;
selecting the most suitable candidate or candidates for •	
appointment to the Board; and
overseeing succession planning for the Board. •	
The Nominations Committee agrees a formal process, including 
whether external assistance would be appropriate, when it  
deems it necessary to make new appointments. The terms of 
reference of the Nominations Committee make it clear that the 
appointment of the Chairman of the Board is a matter for the 
Board as a whole to consider.
The Board has an approved standard letter for future Non-
executive appointments to the Board, including expected time 
commitments, a fee structure and a standard programme for the 
induction of new Directors. The Nomination Committee met once 
in the year to consider succession planning and appointed 
consultants to source a successor for R E Richardson.

Corporate Governance continued
  
Internal controls
The Directors have overall responsibility for ensuring that the 
Group maintains a sound system of internal control to provide 
them with reasonable assurance that all information used within 
the business and for external publication is adequate. This 
includes financial, operational and compliance control and risk 
management, to ensure that assets are safeguarded and 
shareholders’ investments protected. 
In line with past practice, the Board has reviewed the internal 
control system in place during the year and up to the date of  
the approval of this report. This review, along with internal 
consultation led by the Board, ensures that the system of internal 
control remains effective. Where weaknesses are identified as a 
result of the reviews, new procedures are put in place to strengthen 
controls and these are also reviewed at regular intervals.
The Board has in place risk assessment processes and established 
procedures to implement the relevant guidance as updated by the 
Financial Reporting Council (the Turnbull Committee Guidance). 
There is a process for identifying, managing and reviewing any 
changes in the risks faced by the business. This process, which is 
kept under continual review and improvement, has been in place 
during the year under review and remains in place as at the date 
of approval of this report. The process operates under the 
direction of the Board and is reviewed by the Audit Committee.
The key procedures that the Directors have established and  
which are designed to provide effective internal control for the 
Group are:
regular Board meetings to consider a schedule of matters •	
reserved for the Directors’ consideration;
the Audit Committee of the Board considers significant •	
financial control matters as appropriate;
monitoring of the financial performance of operating •	
companies and divisions through analysis of regular financial 
and management reports together with continuous direct 
contact with operating companies and divisional management;
consolidated reports and independent commentaries are •	
prepared and submitted to the Board for review at formal 
monthly Board meetings;
maintenance of local operating Boards and divisional •	
management teams, enabling the Board to delegate 
appropriate levels of authority to a small number of subsidiary 
company Directors and managers, all of whom are 
accountable to the Group Board;
the application of rigorous annual budgeting processes and •	
presentations. All budgets are subject to approval at Group 
Board level;
the review and comparison of detailed monthly management •	
reports, received from each business unit, against budgets and 
forecasts;
the Group has clearly defined policies for capital expenditure. •	
These include annual budgets and appraisal and review 
procedures;
adoption of a Group risk management framework that •	
identifies responsibilities at both Group and subsidiary level  
for the ongoing management of risk across the business;
programming internal audit work to take account of the risk •	
assessment results and processes; and
the use of external professional advisers to carry out due •	
diligence for potential acquisitions.
Through the procedures set out above the Board has reviewed, in 
accordance with the Turnbull Committee Guidance, the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control in operation during the financial year.
Internal Audit
The Audit Committee has set down the criteria by which it will 
assess the effectiveness of the internal audit function on an 
annual basis.
In addition to the above areas of activity set out in its terms of 
reference, the Committee has also approved arrangements by 
which staff may raise concerns about possible improprieties in 
matters of financial reporting. This whistleblowing policy has 
been communicated to subsidiary companies and employees.
Group Treasury management
The Group uses financial instruments comprising borrowings, 
cash and liquid resources, trade receivables and payables and  
in particular forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps 
to manage financial risks associated with its underlying business 
activities and the financing of those activities. In the context of 
the increased scale of the Group’s international earnings and the 
effects of the changing economic climate, additional resource 
was recruited to the Group Treasury management function 
during the year. This function is run purely as a service centre  
for the Group and its prime objective is to manage financial  
risk arising from liquidity, interest rates and foreign exchange.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review and up  
to the date of approval of this report, the Group’s policy that no 
speculative trading in financial instruments be undertaken. 
Shareholder communications and relations 
The Board recognises the importance of good clear 
communications with shareholders. There is continuing dialogue 
with institutional investors to discuss the progress of the business 
and deal with a wide range of enquiries. This includes one-on-
one meetings, presentations after the preliminary announcement 
for the year and the results for the half year and specific analyst 
presentations with feedback from the Company’s brokers as 
necessary. Directors regularly receive copies of analyst reports 
and reports on movement in major shareholdings as well as  
key broker comments. The Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director are available to meet with shareholders concerning 
corporate governance issues, if so required. Copies of all major 
press releases and interim and annual reports are posted on the 
Company’s website together with additional detail on major 
contracts and projects, key financial information, Company 
products, structure and background.
The Board wishes to encourage the constructive use of the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting for shareholder 
communication. Each of the Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees will be in attendance at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting, which will be convened  
on at least 20 working days’ notice.
As with previous practice, the level of proxies cast for each 
resolution will be communicated following approval of each 
resolution at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. After  
the conclusion of the meeting the final results are published 
through a Regulatory Information Service on the Company’s 
website.

Key activities during the year
During the year the Committee:
reviewed the remuneration policy for Executive Directors  •	
and certain other agreed senior managers;
determined final annual bonus payments for Executive •	
Directors and certain other senior managers with respect  
to the 2007 financial year;
considered and approved awards to Executive Directors and •	
certain other senior managers under the Company’s 2007 
Long Term Incentive Plan (including a review of performance 
conditions/targets to ensure that they were appropriately 
challenging);
approved the Directors’ Remuneration Report which was •	
included in the 2007 Annual Report; and
conducted a Committee effectiveness review which concluded •	
that there were no items of concern.
Advisers
The Committee used the external services of Deloitte LLP as  
its principal external adviser during 2008 on matters relating to 
Executive Directors’ remuneration. During the year Deloitte LLP 
also provided taxation advice and other non-audit services to  
the Company. 
The Chairman and the Chief Executive also gave advice to the 
Committee by request. Neither the Chairman nor the Chief 
Executive were present when their own remuneration was  
under consideration. 
Overall remuneration policy and purpose
Broad policy
The remuneration policy is designed to be in line with the 
Company’s fundamental principals of fairness, being competitive 
and supporting the Company’s corporate strategy. 
The Committee believes that a consistently applied cohesive 
reward structure with links to corporate performance is critical  
in ensuring attainment of the Company’s strategic goals. 
Accordingly, the Company sets out to provide competitive 
remuneration to all its employees, appropriate to the business 
environment in the markets in which it operates. To achieve this, 
the remuneration packages are based on the following principles:
total rewards should be set to be fair and attractive. •	
appropriate elements of the remuneration package should be •	
designed to reinforce the link between performance and reward.
The Company also seeks to align the interests of shareholders 
and employees at all levels by giving employees opportunities  
and encouragement to build up a shareholding interest in the 
Company through various share option schemes.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report is divided into two  
parts. The first part contains commentary on the Company’s 
remuneration policy, which is not required to be audited.  
The second part contains information that has been audited  
in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.
As required, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed 
at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 12 May 2009.
PART 1 - NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT
Remuneration committee 
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) determines, on 
behalf of the Board, the Company’s policy on remuneration and 
the terms of engagement of the Executive Directors and certain 
other agreed senior Executives. 
Membership
The members of the Committee during the year were  
H C Marshall (Chairman), R E Richardson and C J Snowdon.  
The members of the Committee are the Non-executive  
Directors of the Company, and the Board considers them all  
to be independent. The Committee members have no personal 
financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters  
to be decided. They have no conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships nor from any involvement in the day-to-day 
business of the Company. They do not participate in any form of 
performance related pay or pension arrangements.
Meetings
The Committee met three times in the period under review  
and on each occasion all the Committee members were present. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. The 
Chairman and the Chief Executive also attended meetings of the 
Committee by invitation. No Executive Director or other attendee 
is present when their own remuneration is under consideration. 
Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Committee include:
reviewing and recommending the remuneration policy for •	
Executive Directors and certain other senior managers for  
the Board to approve;

packages of the Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director, 
and certain other agreed Senior Executives;
approving the design of, and determining targets for, any •	
performance related pay schemes operated by the Company 
for the Executive Directors and certain other senior managers 
and approving the total payments made under such schemes;

all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and 
shareholders;

service agreements for Executive Directors and certain other 
agreed Senior Executives; and
approving the terms of any compensation package in the •	
event of early termination of contracts of Executive Directors 
or certain other senior managers, ensuring that they are fair to

will ensure that failure is not rewarded and the duty to 
mitigate loss is fully recognised.

Hill & Smith Holdings PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
  
Executive remuneration 
The Company operates in highly competitive environments and for it to continue to compete successfully, it is essential that the level  
of remuneration and benefits offered for leadership roles achieve the objectives of attraction, retention, motivation and reward of high 
calibre individuals. 
The base salaries of Executive Directors continue to be reviewed annually. The Committee does not have a formal positioning policy for 
base salary as it is acutely aware of the issues around setting pay solely by reference to a benchmark reference point. Instead, to review 
salaries, the Committee uses external base salary information as a basis for considering a range of factors, including:
– the performance of the business/function under the incumbent’s stewardship;
– the scope and relative complexity of the business/function;
– individual performance and experience;
– reporting relationships;
– the importance of each role within the organisation;
– the external market for talent at that level; and
– the levels of incentives, pension and other benefits which are driven from base salary.
The performance related elements of remuneration are reviewed on an annual basis. As an integral part of this process the 
performance conditions and targets are reviewed to ensure that they are sufficiently stretching and that they continue to be aligned 
with the business strategy and the creation of shareholder value. This ensures that Executive Directors’ incentives are firmly aligned  
with the interests of shareholders.

Hill & Smith Holdings PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 200808  
Finance Director
M Pegler receives a payment of 25% of his base salary as a 
defined contribution to his own private pension arrangements. 
The table on page 43 gives details of the changes in the value  
of the Executive Directors’ accrued pensions during 2008. Other 
than as stated above, there are no other pension arrangements  
in place for Executive Directors.
Other benefits
These principally comprise car benefits, life assurance, 
membership of the Company’s healthcare, income protection 
scheme and accident insurance. These benefits do not form part 
of pensionable earnings.
Performance related remuneration
Cash bonus
Executive Directors are eligible for an annual performance  
related cash bonus. The basis for the payment of any bonus  
is determined by reference to underlying earnings per share 
performance over one financial year of the Company. The 
Committee is committed to only paying maximum bonuses in 
circumstances where stretching performance targets have been 
satisfied. Bonuses are not pensionable.
Long term incentive plans
The Company operates three share plans: the 2007 Long Term 
Incentive Plan; the 2005 Executive Share Option Scheme and,  
the 2005 ShareSave Scheme. The Long Term Incentive Plan is  
the primary long term incentive vehicle for Executive Directors. 
Prior to the implementation of the Long Term Incentive Plan in 
2007, awards were made to Executive Directors under the 2005 
Executive Share Option Scheme. 
2007 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The Hill & Smith 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan provides for  
the grant of conditional share awards. Generally, awards are 
made to Executive Directors on an annual basis with the level  
of vesting determined by reference to stretching performance 
conditions. The maximum market value of shares pursuant to an 
award to any employee in respect of any financial year is 100%  
of that employee’s base salary. Awards are not pensionable and 
may not generally be assigned or transferred.
Awards to the Chief Executive and Finance Director were made 
on 14 March 2008. The value of the shares subject to the award 
was 100% of their base salary. The Committee also reviewed the 
original performance conditions and were satisfied that they 
continue to be aligned with the business strategy and the 
creation of shareholder value. 
Further details of subsisting awards to Executive Directors are 
shown in the table on page 42. 
LTIP Performance targets for subsisting awards made in 
2007 and 2008
For subsisting awards made pursuant to the LTIP, the performance 
targets are based on the Company’s underlying earnings per 
share (UEPS) measured over the relevant three year period. The 
UEPS criterion was chosen to reflect the business strategy and 
ensure that earnings attributable to the shareholders increased  
at an appropriate rate before any awards under the LTIP vest. 
Detail of Executive Directors’ remuneration
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors is structured  
to ensure a proper balance of fixed remuneration and variable 
performance related remuneration (linked to short and long term 
objectives). 
The current balance of the Executive Directors remuneration 
between fixed and variable performance related components 
(excluding pension and “other benefits”) is as follows:
The components of Executive Directors’ remuneration are 
outlined in more detail below. 
Fixed remuneration
Basic salary
Basic annual salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed by the 
Committee on an annual basis or when a material change of 
responsibility occurs. In making salary decisions the Committee 
considers salaries offered for similar roles by reference to practice 
across industry comparators and companies of a similar size and 
complexity to the Company. 
The Committee is committed to managing the salaries for 
Executive Directors as they mature and gain further experience  
in a particular role. In 2008, the Chief Executive’s salary was 
reviewed in the context of his promotion to the position in late 
2007. Accordingly, the Committee determined that an increase 
would be appropriate which positioned the salary for 2008 
towards the lower end of the appropriate benchmark ranges. 
Similarly, the Finance Director’s base salary on appointment to  
the Board in March 2008 was towards the lower end of the 
benchmark ranges to reflect his recent appointment. 
Pension arrangements
Chief Executive
D W Muir participates in the Hill & Smith Executive Pension 
Scheme, a defined benefit arrangement, which provides pensions 
and other benefits. 
During the year an agreement was made with D W Muir to limit 
the Company’s liability with respect to his pre 1 October 1998 
pension benefit. Under the terms of the agreement the final 
pensionable earnings, to which his pre October 1998 benefits 
were linked, became fixed as at 6 April 2008. Accordingly no 
account will be taken of salary increases or bonus payments  
after 6 April 2008 and this element of his pension arrangement 
effectively became a deferred entitlement. D W Muir’s post  
1 October 1998 pension benefit is based upon an accrual of 
1/30th of the Earnings Cap (that applied prior to 6 April 2006 
and increased in line with the rules of the Scheme) for each year 
of pensionable service from 1 October 1998; the resultant effect 
being that salary and bonus increases are no longer pensionable.

Hill & Smith Holdings PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
  
Half of the award is based on the Company’s UEPS performance 
against prescribed targets which were determined by the 
Committee at the time each award was granted. The Committee 
set a threshold level of UEPS growth (20% over the performance 
period), below which none of this proportion of the award vests, 
and a stretch level of UEPS growth (45% over the performance 
period), at which all of this proportion of the award vests. Vesting 
is on a straight line basis between the two threshold points of 
20% and 45%. 
The Committee determined that absolute UEPS targets were 
appropriate to incentivise the Executive Directors to develop the 
UEPS in line with the business plan.
The remaining half of the award is based on the Company’s UEPS 
growth relative to the FTSE All-Share index basic earnings per 
share (EPS) growth (the index uses basic earnings per share only). 
The ranking of the Company’s UEPS performance over the 
performance period determines the vesting for this proportion of 
the award, as per the vesting schedule shown in the table below:
 
Performance  
ranking of   Vesting 
the Company   percentage
Below median   0%
Between median and upper quartile   50%
Between upper quartile and 100th percentile  100%
The Committee determined that the measurement of relative 
growth for half of the award would complement the absolute 
growth targets to ensure that an award could only fully vest if  
the Company’s performance is superior to a majority of the 
companies on the FTSE All-Share index. 
The Committee also has the discretion to make an adjustment to 
the number of shares vesting from an award to take account of 
the underlying financial performance of the Company over which 
performance is measured. 
2005 Executive Share Option Scheme
Under this scheme, options may be awarded at the discretion of 
the Committee to acquire Ordinary Shares at an exercise price no 
lower than the market value of a share at the date of grant. The 
options can only be exercised between three and ten years after 
the date of grant. Additionally options may only be exercised if 
the growth in underlying earnings per share of the Company over 
a three year period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price 
Index plus nine per cent, over the same period. 
No awards were made to Executive Directors under this scheme 
in 2008. For options outstanding under the 2005 Executive Share 
Option Scheme see the table on page 43.
2005 ShareSave Scheme
The 2005 ShareSave Scheme is open to all employees (including 
Executive Directors) who have completed six months’ continuous 
service. Under this scheme the Company can, if it thinks fit, grant 
options at a price up to twenty per cent below the market price. 
Executive Directors did participate in the scheme in 2008 and 
details are contained in the table on page 43 including those for 
subsisting options.
Dilution 
The dilutive effect of the grants of awards is considered by the 
Committee when granting awards under the long term incentive 
plans. In accordance with its commitment, the percentage of the 
issued share capital that could be allocated under all of the 
Company’s employee share plans over a period of ten years 
should be under 10%. Currently the LTIP, as the principal long 
term incentive vehicle for Executive Directors, does not have a 
dilutive effect because it does not involve the issue and allotment 
of new shares in the Company but rather relies on the market 
purchase of shares. 
 
Executive Directors’ service agreements
The Committee operates a policy of one-year rolling contracts for 
Executive Directors. Each Executive Director has such a contract, 
executed at the time of his appointment (and amended from  
time to time as required). The Committee would consider the 
circumstances of any individual case of early termination and 
would determine compensation payments accordingly. A fair but  
robust principle of mitigation would be applied to the payment of 
compensation in these circumstances. 
 Date of  
 Service   Notice 
Executive Director Contract  period
D W Muir 4 June 2007 12 months
M Pegler   28 November 2007 12 months
D L Grove 9 July 1999 12 months
D W Muir’s service agreement provides for D W Muir to  
receive twelve months notice of termination by the Company  
and for D W Muir to give the Company twelve months notice of 
termination. During the period of ninety days following a change 
of control the notice period to be given by the Company to  
D W Muir is twelve months and by D W Muir to the Company  
is reduced from twelve months to ninety days. If during the 
period of ninety days following a change of control, the service 
agreement is terminated by D W Muir or is terminated by the 
Company without prior notice, D W Muir is entitled to a sum 
equal to twelve month’s basic salary. 
M Pegler’s service agreement entitles him to receive twelve 
months notice of termination by the Company. In the event that 
M Pegler terminates the service agreement he is due to give the 
Company six months notice. During the period of ninety days 
following a change of control the notice period to be given by the 
Company to M Pegler is twelve months and by M Pegler to the 
Company is reduced from six months to ninety days. If during the 
period of ninety days following a change of control, the service 
agreement is terminated by M Pegler or is terminated by the 
Company without prior notice, M Pegler is entitled to a sum equal 
to twelve months’ basic salary. 
D L Grove has announced his intention to retire from the Board 
on 31 December 2009. As reported in the 2007 Director’s 
Remuneration Report, by an agreement dated 6 December 2007, 
D L Grove waived all entitlement to future cash performance 
related bonus payments due under his service agreement dated  
9 July 1999, in return for a one-off compensation payment of 
£600,000 (subject to deduction of PAYE and National Insurance). 
This payment was conditional upon the net sum being used by  
D L Grove to purchase shares in the Company and for those 
shares to be held until 1 January 2009. D L Grove purchased such 
shares on 7 December 2007 prior to receiving the cash payment

in January 2008 and has continued to hold those shares, as well 
as increasing his holding by a further 250,000 shares during the 
course of 2008.
C J Burr’s service agreement terminated following early retirement 
from the Board on 11 March 2008. The termination of the service 
agreement dated 20 June 2001, which provided for twelve months 
notice to be given to C J Burr, resulted in compensation of 
£425,000 being paid to C J Burr comprising payment of salary, 
bonus and all other benefits (excluding pension) due under the 
terms of his service agreement. Further details regarding C J Burr’s 
retirement provision are given on page 43.
Apart from the above, there are no special provisions in the 
Executive Directors’ service contracts for compensation for loss  
of office. 
Shareholding guidelines
During the year the Committee established a shareholding 
guideline under which it is expected that Executive Directors 
retain half of any shares which vest for awards made from  
2008 onwards, pursuant to the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan. 
Policy on external appointments 
Subject to the approval of the Board in each case, Executive 
Directors may accept external appointments as Non-executive 
Directors of other companies and retain any related fees paid to 
them provided always that such external appointments are not 
considered by the Board to prevent or reduce the ability of the 
Executive to perform his role to the required standard. Such 
appointments are seen as a way in which Executives can gain a 
broader business experience and, in turn, benefit the Company. 
Currently the Chief Executive and the Finance Director do not 
hold any external Non-executive Directorships. 
D L Grove is a Non-executive Director of Headlam Group plc. In 
respect of such position he retained the fees paid to him for his 
services. In 2008, the total amount of such fees paid to him in 
respect of these services was £35,000. 
Non-executive Directors 
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts. Fees 
for Non-executive Directors are determined by the Chairman and 
Chief Executive in light of market best practice and with reference 
to the time commitment and responsibilities associated with the 
role. The Non-executive Directors do not participate in any 
decision made by the Board in relation to the determination  
of their fees.
The Audit Committee Chairman and the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman receive additional fees as does the  
Senior Independent Director.
The Non-executive Directors are not eligible for performance 
related bonuses or the grant of awards under the Company’s 
long term incentive plans. No pension contributions are made  
on their behalf. 
The appointments of H C Marshall, R E Richardson and  
C J Snowdon are governed by letters of engagement. Under  
the terms of their engagement, the notice period to be given by 
H C Marshall, R E Richardson and C J Snowdon to the Company  
is three months and the Company is obliged to give the same 
length of notice to the individual to terminate the engagement.  
R E Richardson has announced his decision to retire from the 
Board at the forthcoming AGM to be held on 12 May 2009. 
 
Total shareholder return graphs
The UK Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002  
require the inclusion in the Directors’ Remuneration Report of  
a graph showing total shareholder return (TSR) over a five year 
period in respect of a holding of the Company’s shares, plotted 
against TSR in respect of a hypothetical holding of shares of a 
similar kind and number by reference to which a broad equity 
market index is calculated. 
The following graph shows the TSR performance of the Company 
over the five year period to 31 December 2008. The Company’s 
performance has been compared against the FTSE All-Share Index 
and FTSE Small Cap Index (which were chosen because they 
represent broad equity indices of which the Company is a 
constituent). The graph is based on three-month average values 
and has been re-based to 100 at the start of the five year period.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual report and the Financial Statements
Directors’ responsibility statement 
The Directors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in this •	
Annual Report, which have been prepared in accordance with 
applicable UK law and with the applicable set of accounting 
standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Company and Group as  
a whole; and
the management report (which comprises the Directors’ •	
Report and the Business Review) includes a fair review of  
the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the Group as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.
By order of the Board
John C. Humphreys
Company Secretary
10 March 2009
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable  
law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company Financial 
Statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and 
applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
The Group Financial Statements are required by law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and the 
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides  
in relation to such financial statements that references in the 
relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true  
and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The Parent Company Financial Statements are required by law  
to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Parent 
Company.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them •	
consistently;
make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and •	
prudent;
for the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have •	
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
for the Parent Company Financial Statements, state whether •	
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained  
in the Parent Company Financial Statements; and
prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis •	
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
Parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that its Financial Statements comply with the Companies 
Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement  
that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and  
integrity of the corporate and financial information included  
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Hill & Smith Holdings PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 200808  
Independent Auditor’s Report 
to the members of Hill & Smith Holdings PLC
We have audited the Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements (the ‘’Financial Statements’’) of Hill & Smith Holdings 
PLC for the year ended 31 December 2008 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated and Company 
Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the 
Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and 
the related notes. These Financial Statements have been prepared 
under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also 
audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the EU, and for preparing the Parent Company 
Financial Statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report in 
accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards 
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 44.
Our responsibility is to audit the Financial Statements and the  
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements  
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Financial 
Statements give a true and fair view and whether the Financial 
Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group Financial 
Statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report  
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report is consistent with the Financial Statements.  
The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that 
specific information presented in the Business Review Report  
that is cross-referenced from the Business Review section of  
the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We 
are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on 
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on 
the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance 
procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Financial 
Statements. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the Financial Statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,  
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the 
Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in  
the preparation of the Financial Statements, and of whether  
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and 
Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the Financial Statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated  
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the 
Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
the Group Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in •	
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of 
the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of its profit 
for the year then ended;
the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared •	
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation;
the Parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair •	
view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice, of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2008;
the Parent Company Financial Statements and the part of the •	
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent •	
with the Financial Statements.

Hill & Smith Holdings PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Group Accounting Policies
Hill & Smith Holdings PLC is a company incorporated in the UK. 
The Group considers a company a subsidiary when it holds more than 50% of the shares and voting rights, so that it has the power to 
govern the operating and financial policies of that entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The Group considers a company to 
be an associate when it holds more than 20% of the shares and voting rights and is able to significantly influence the decisions of that 
entity.
The Group Financial Statements consolidate the Company and its subsidiaries, proportionately consolidate any jointly controlled entities 
and equity account the Group’s interest in associates. The Parent Company Financial Statements present information about the 
Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards, as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company Financial Statements in 
accordance with UK GAAP, these are presented on pages 88 to 95.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group 
Financial Statements.
In the current year the Group has amended its treatment of Non-Underlying items in the Consolidated Income Statement, to reflect a 
more representative view of the Group’s definition of underlying earnings. In addition to business reorganisation costs, property items 
and amortisation of acquisition intangibles included for the year ended 31 December 2007, Non-Underlying items now also include 
impairments, changes in the fair value of financial instruments and financial income and expense on pension obligations. All 
comparatives including the Consolidated Income Statement have been restated. 
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the Group Financial 
Statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in Note 27.
Going concern and liquidity risk
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Business Review on pages 06 to 27. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are described in the Business Review on pages 18 and 19. In addition Note 22 to the Group Financial Statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments 
and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The businesses of the Group have long established relationships with customers and suppliers, which together with the Group’s current 
financial strength, provide a solid foundation. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current bank facilities, of which the Group’s 
principal debt facility is a £150m multi currency facility expiring in June 2012. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is 
well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and its subsidiaries have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Annual Report and Accounts.
New IFRS standards and interpretations adopted during 2008
In 2008 the following standards became effective and were adopted by the Group:
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions •	
The adoption of this standard has not had a significant impact on the results of the Group in 2008.
New IFRS standards and interpretations not adopted
The IASB and IFRIC have issued additional standards and interpretations which are effective for periods starting after the date of these 
Group Financial Statements. The following standards and interpretations have not yet been adopted by the Group:
IAS 1 (Revised) – Presentation of Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). •	
IAS 27 (Revised) – Consolidated and separate Financial Statements (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009). •	
Amendment to IFRS 2 – Share-based payments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). •	
IFRS 8 – Operating segments (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009). •	
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction (effective for annual •	
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009).

Annual Report and Accounts 200808  
Upon adoption of IFRS 8, the Group will be required to disclose segment information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed 
by the Group’s Chief Executive in order to assess each segment’s performance and to allocate resources to them. Currently the Group 
presents segment information in respect of business and geographical segments (see Note 1). Under the management approach, the 
Group will continue to report its existing three operating segments as these form the basis of internal reporting.
IFRIC 14 provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the surplus that can be recognised as an asset. It also 
explains how the post employment benefit asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding 
requirement. It is not expected that the interpretation would have a material impact on the results or net assets of the Group.
The Group does not anticipate that the adoption of the remaining standards and interpretations will have a material effect on its Group 
Financial Statements on initial adoption. 
Measurement convention
The Group Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except where the measurement of balances at fair value is 
required as explained below. 
Intangible assets
In respect of subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associated companies, goodwill on acquisition comprises the excess of the fair 
value of the purchase consideration and any associated acquisition costs for the investment over the Group’s share of the fair value of 
the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. On an ongoing basis the goodwill is measured at cost less impairment losses (see 
accounting policy ‘Impairment of assets’). Fair value adjustments are always considered to be provisional at the first Balance Sheet date 
after the acquisition to allow the maximum time to elapse for management to make a reliable estimate.
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively. Goodwill prior to 1 October 1998 was written off to reserves. Goodwill from 
1 October 1998 to 31 December 2003 was amortised in line with UK GAAP. From 1 January 2004 this goodwill is subject to annual 
impairment testing. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a minority interest in a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of the additional investment 
over the carrying amount of the net assets acquired at the date of exchange.
Brands and customer lists that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses (see accounting policy ‘Impairment of assets’). Cost reflects management’s judgement of the fair 
value of the individual intangible asset calculated by reference to the net present value of future benefits accruing to the Group from 
the utilisation of the asset, discounted at an appropriate discount rate. 
The US brand is considered to have an indefinite life and therefore is subject to annual impairment testing (see accounting policy 
‘Impairment of assets’). For other brands and customer lists, amortisation is provided equally over the estimated useful economic life of 
the assets concerned, currently up to 20 years.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is considered to be technically and commercially viable 
and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct 
labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Other development expenditure is recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement as an expense as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. Amortisation is provided equally over the estimated useful economic life of the assets concerned, currently up to 
seven years. 
Trade licences are amortised over the specific term granted to each individual licence.
Property, plant, equipment and depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or deemed cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by 
equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Freehold buildings   5 to 50 years
Leasehold buildings   life of the lease
Plant, machinery and vehicles  4 to 20 years
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
The Group has chosen to take the first time adoption exemption available under IFRS 1 to use a previous revaluation for certain land 
and buildings as its deemed cost at the transition date. All other items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost unless it is 
felt that this value should be impaired.

Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Discontinued operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area 
of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or represents operations acquired exclusively with a view to resale. 
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria as a discontinued operation, 
the comparative Consolidated Income Statement is represented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the 
comparative period.
The results and cash flows of major lines of business that have been divested have been classified as discontinued operations and the 
comparatives for the year to 31 December 2007 amended accordingly.
Assets and liabilities held for sale
Assets and liabilities reclassified as held for sale
Non-current assets (or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities) that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather 
than through continuing use are classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets (or components 
of a disposal group) are remeasured in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Thereafter generally the assets (or disposal 
group) are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as 
held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. Gains are not recognised in excess of 
any cumulative loss.
Operations held exclusively with a view to resale
Operations acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal are classified as assets and liabilities held for sale at the acquisition 
date only where all criteria set out in IFRS 5 are satisfied within a short period following the acquisition.
When acquired as part of a business combination, operations acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal are initially 
measured at fair value less costs to sell. Subsequently, these operations are measured at the lower of their current carrying value and 
current fair value less costs to sell. Subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. Gains are not 
recognised in excess of any cumulative loss.
Properties held for resale
Resale properties are valued at the lower of fair value less cost to sell and their carrying amount. Any surplus, deficit or impairment 
arising is credited or charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
All of the above assets and liabilities held for sale are classified as current in line with IFRS 5.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
The Group’s investments in equity securities and certain debt securities are classified as available for sale financial assets. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and 
losses on available for sale monetary items, are recognised directly in equity. When an investment is derecognised, the cumulative gain 
or loss in equity is transferred to profit or loss. 
Trade receivables and trade payables are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. 
Derivative financial instruments of the Group are used to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risks arising from 
operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the 
Consolidated Income Statement.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the Balance 
Sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate such contracts 
at the Balance Sheet date, taking into account the forward exchange rates prevailing at that date. 
Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in 
the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.

Annual Report and Accounts 200808  
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an 
integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Any gain or loss on 
translation of monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities arising from a movement in exchange rates subsequent to initial 
measurement is included as an exchange gain or loss in the Consolidated Income Statement.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are 
translated at the closing exchange rate. Income statements and cash flows of such undertakings are translated into Sterling at weighted 
average rates of exchange, other than substantial transactions that are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction. The 
adjustments to period end rates are taken to the cumulative translation reserve in equity and reported in the Consolidated Statement  
of Recognised Income and Expense. When an overseas operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the translation 
reserve is transferred to profit or loss.
Income from associates is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, translated at the average exchange rate during the period.
Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign 
operation are recognised directly in equity and reported in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, to the 
extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, such differences are recognised in profit or loss. When the 
hedged part of a net investment is disposed of, the associated cumulative amount in the translation reserve is transferred to profit or 
loss as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal.
The principal exchange rates used were as follows:
   2008 2007
     Average Closing Average Closing
Sterling to Euro (£1 = €)     1.25  1.03  1.44  1.36 
Sterling to US Dollar (£1 = $)     1.84  1.44  2.03  2.00 
Sterling to Thai Baht (£1 = Baht)      60.69  50.00  64.61  60.06 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods 
purchased for resale, the FIFO or average cost method is used. Cost for work in progress and finished goods comprises direct materials, 
direct labour and an appropriate proportion of attributable overheads.
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the Balance Sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring 
either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for. 
In accordance with the Group’s environmental policy and applicable legal requirements, a provision for site restoration in respect of 
contaminated land is recognised as an obligation arises.
The estimated cost of returning properties held under leases to their original condition in accordance with the terms of specific lease 
contracts is recognised as soon as such costs are able to be reliably estimated. 
Put option in respect of a minority interest in a subsidiary
Where the Group has an obligation to purchase shares in a subsidiary from a minority interest through a put option, a financial liability 
is recognised for the present value of the estimated consideration payable under the put option and the minority interest is not 
recognised.
In this case the fair value of the liability is estimated based on the market value for the shares in the subsidiary discounted over the 
period over which the consideration is payable, using a discount rate based on borrowing rates for a term corresponding to the 
payment period and reflecting local borrowing costs.

Hill & Smith Holdings PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
At each reporting date, changes in the carrying amount of the liability arising from variations in the estimated fair value of the purchase 
consideration (excluding the effect of the unwinding of the discount, which is accounted for as a financial expense) are recognised by 
adjusting the carrying amount of the goodwill recognised on initial recognition of the business combination.
Impairment of assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories (see accounting policy ‘Inventories’) and deferred tax 
balances (see accounting policy ‘Deferred taxation’), are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine whether there is an 
indication of impairment. Impairment reviews are undertaken at the level of each significant cash generating unit, which the Group 
generally considers to be each of its subsidiaries in the case of the UK and then regionally in the case of France and the USA. If such an 
indication exists, the relevant asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount 
of the asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
For goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite life, the recoverable amount is assessed at each Balance Sheet date and an 
impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post tax discount rate based on an 
internally assessed weighted average cost of capital which accounts for the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
Leases
Leases for which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial 
recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that 
asset. 
Other leases are classified as operating leases and the leased assets are not recognised on the Group’s Balance Sheet. Payments made 
under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Lease 
incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease. 
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the 
outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Rental income from operating leases is recognised as revenue in the Consolidated Income Statement on an accruals basis.
Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods represents the amount (excluding value added tax) invoiced to third party customers, net of returns, 
trade discounts and volume rebates. Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. No revenue is recognised where the recovery of the consideration is 
not probable or where there are significant uncertainties regarding associated costs or the possible return of goods.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised as a liability in the Balance Sheet and credited to operating profit over the estimated useful 
economic life of the relevant assets or the length of employment specified in the grant.
Guarantees
The Group’s policy is to not give external guarantees. 
Retirement benefits
The Group operates pension schemes under which contributions by employees and by the sponsoring companies are held in trust funds 
separated from the Group’s finances.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income 
Statement as incurred.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the 
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. This benefit is 
discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the 
Balance Sheet date on AA rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation 
is performed by a qualified Actuary using the projected unit method. Scheme assets are valued at bid price.

Annual Report and Accounts 200808  
Current and past service costs are recognised in operating profit within the Consolidated Income Statement. Also in the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the expected return on pension scheme assets is included in financial income and the expected costs on pension 
scheme liabilities in financial expense.
All actuarial gains and losses in calculating the Group’s obligation in respect of defined benefit schemes are recognised annually in 
reserves and reported in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Share-based payment transactions
The fair value of shares/options granted is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity reserves. The 
fair value is calculated at the grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the 
shares/options. The Black-Scholes model has been adopted as the method of evaluating the fair value of the options, with the amount 
recognised as an expense being adjusted to reflect the actual number of options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share 
prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
In accordance with IFRS 2 transitional arrangements, no expense is recorded for equity settled options granted prior to 7 November 
2002 or vested before 1 January 2005.
Financial income and expense
Financial income comprises interest income on funds invested, expected returns on pension scheme assets and gains on the fair value 
of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in the Consolidated 
Income Statement using the effective interest method. 
Financial expense comprises interest expense on borrowings, expected interest cost on pension scheme obligations, unwinding of 
discounts, losses on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and the interest expense 
component of finance lease payments. All borrowing costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective 
interest method.
Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised 
in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are not taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the Balance Sheet date, and any adjustments to tax 
payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full using the Balance Sheet liability method and represents the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used 
for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial 
recognition of assets and liabilities not resulting from a business combination that affect neither accounting or taxable profit, and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of 
deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
asset can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group 
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Ordinary dividends
Dividends are accounted for in the Financial Statements when the Group is committed to the payment of the dividend.

3. Discontinued operations and assets held for sale
Discontinued operations
Following the acquisition on 2 July 2007 of Zinkinvent GmbH the Group decided that it did not wish to retain the Benelux and German 
trading operations of that company. Accordingly, these businesses were accounted for as discontinued operations from the date of 
acquisition. At 31 December 2007, the assets and liabilities of these businesses were separately included in the Balance Sheet at fair 
value as held exclusively with a view to resale. These operations and a 31.8% minority interest in Vista Investments N.V. valued at £1.7m 
(Note 24) were disposed of in August 2008 for a consideration of £22.1m, including deferred consideration of £1.0m. In November 
2008, the Group exited the steel bar reinforcing market through the disposal of its interests in Express Reinforcements Limited and the 
cessation of its related activities. As a result these operations have been treated as discontinued activities and the comparatives for 
2007 have been restated.
The results of the discontinued operations are as follows:

3. Discontinued operations and assets held for sale continued
Assets held for sale
In addition to the Benelux and German trading operations, the assets and liabilities of D&J (Steels) Limited were also held for sale at 
31 December 2007. D&J (Steels) Limited did not meet the criteria of a discontinued operation and therefore its results were included in 
continuing operations. Both of these businesses were disposed of in 2008. No gain or loss arose on the disposal of the businesses as 
they had been remeasured to their fair value prior to their disposal.
In February 2008 the sale of D&J (Steels) Limited completed, realising £0.3m cash consideration, with £0.4m being deferred to 2009. 
The loss on remeasurement of £0.3m was realised in 2007 (Note 4).

4. Non-Underlying items
2008
Non-Underlying items in 2008 principally comprise reorganisation and redundancy costs of £1.9m and a goodwill impairment charge of 
£1.9m offset by a net curtailment gain of £0.6m in respect of the Group’s retirement obligations. Amounts included within financial 
income and expense represent the net financing return on pension obligations of £0.2m (2007: £0.6m) and the change in fair value of 
financial instruments of £nil (2007: £0.3m expense). Tax on Non-Underlying items includes a charge of £1.1m resulting from a change in 
the UK tax legislation preventing the recoverability of Industrial Buildings Allowances.
2007
The 2007 costs include £1.0m relating to the relocation and factory closures of the production facilities of Ash & Lacy Perforators 
Limited and the newly acquired H M Doors business. Also included is £0.4m in respect of losses incurred on the disposal of Ash & Lacy 
Pressings Limited and loss on remeasurement as held for sale on D&J (Steels) Limited (Note 3), two non-core Group businesses. A 
further £0.7m relates to relocation costs of other Group operations. There is also a charge of £1.1m relating to the changes in Directors’ 
contracts.
The profit on sale of properties in 2007 relates to the sale of two properties located in Hayle and Levenshulme and the sale and 
leaseback of one operating property. No tax liability arose on these sales due to the availability of indexation allowances and capital 
losses for offset.

Goodwill of £5.9m, brands of £0.9m and customer lists of £0.6m arose on the acquisition of Creative Pultrusions Inc. in September 
2008. Goodwill arises on this acquisition due primarily to the assembled workforce, technical expertise, knowhow, market share  
and geographical advantages afforded to the Group through this acquisition. Details of the acquisition are provided in the table on  
the next page.
Goodwill of £5.0m arising on the acquisition of minority interests consists of the following:
£4.3m in respect of the purchase in July 2008 of the 31.8% minority interest in Zinkinvent GmbH. The £4.3m represents the excess •	
of the net consideration of £18.8m over the fair value of the put option recognised on acquisition in respect of the Group’s potential 
obligation to purchase the minorities’ shareholdings. 
£0.7m in respect of the purchase in January 2008 of the minority interests in the US fabrication operations of Voigt & Schweitzer •	
Inc. for a consideration of £2.2m.

Policy alignment and provisional fair value adjustments principally relate to harmonisation with Group IFRS accounting policies, 
including the application of fair values on acquisition and the elimination of inter Group balances.
If the above acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2008 the continuing results of the Group for the year would have shown revenue 
of £434.5m and a profit for the year of £20.6m.
2007
Goodwill of £37.5m, brands of £9.0m and customer lists of £1.6m arose on the purchase of a further 34.9% in Zinkinvent GmbH to 
increase the Group’s investment to 68.2%. Details of the acquisition are provided in the table on the next page.
The acquisition of minority interests represents the goodwill arising on the purchase of the outstanding 10% shareholding in V&S Inc., 
the USA holding company within the Zinkinvent Group. The £0.7m goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the carrying 
value of the minority interest held within reserves (Note 24). The final 1.5% minority interest in Pipe Supports Asia was also acquired 
during the year.

Impairment tests on the carrying values of goodwill and the US brand name of £7.0m (2007: £5.5m), which is the Group’s only other 
indefinite life intangible asset, are performed by analysing the carrying value allocated to each significant cash generating unit against 
its value in use. The Group’s accounting policies define cash generating units to be subsidiaries in the UK, but regions in the case of the 
overseas businesses. All goodwill is allocated to specific cash generating units. Value in use is calculated for each cash generating unit 
as the net present value of that unit’s discounted future cash flows. These cash flows are based on budget and forecast cash flow 
information for a period not exceeding five years, with the exception of CA Traffic Limited, where a period of seven years has been 
used, due to the longer incubation period for its technological assets.

An impairment charge of £1.9m (2007: £nil) was recognised in respect of the whole of the goodwill relating to Ash & Lacy Perforators 
Limited, a single cash generating unit which forms part of the Group’s Building and Construction Products Division. This charge has 
been treated as a Non-Underlying Item and is included in continuing administrative expenses for the year. This charge has been 
recognised in response to a decline in market conditions in the building and consumer products sector. The remainder of this cash 
generating unit’s recoverable amount is calculated on a value in use basis. The discount rate used in the impairment of this business 
was 9.98%. 
Based on past experience and management judgement an average growth rate of 1.0% has been applied for revenues and associated 
cost growth. The initial measurement of the post tax weighted average cost of capital was 6.98% (pre-tax 9.55%). However, to reflect 
the differing risks and returns applied to the different cash generating units and the geographies in which they operate, the discount 
rates and growth rates respectively have been adjusted as follows: 
Continental Europe: 7.98% and 1.0% •	
USA: 8.98% and 0.5% •	
Joseph Ash Limited: 7.98% and 1.0% •	
Other cash generating units with no individually significant amounts of goodwill principally consist of subsidiaries in the Building and 
Construction Products and Infrastructure Products segments.

Available for sale financial assets consists of the 33.3% shareholding of Vista Investment N.V. in Neholl B.V., a Dutch holding company. 
Neholl B.V. owns 100% of Nedcoat B.V., a Dutch company with galvanizing businesses in the Benelux region. The Group neither has 
representation on the Board of Neholl B.V. nor is it able to influence commercial or dividend policy. For this reason the Board considers 
the Group does not exert significant influence over Neholl. Accordingly, the results of Neholl are not equity accounted into the results 
of the Group and the investment is instead held as an available for sale financial asset. The fair value of this financial asset has been 
derived by the Directors from their judgement as to its future profitability and cash flows and its ultimate marketability. 
The Group holds a 68.2% share in Vista Investment N.V., the remaining 31.8% minority interest is disclosed in Note 24.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses of £14.6m (2007: £16.1m) as their future use is uncertain. There is no 
time limit on the carrying forward of these losses.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of £66.3m (2007: £32.9m) of undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as 
the Group is able to control the timing of remittances so that any tax is not expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax charge of £1.1m (2007: £nil) has been made resulting from a change during the year in the UK tax legislation preventing 
the recoverability of Industrial Buildings Allowances.

The Articles of Association of Zinkinvent GmbH, in common with many German holding companies, provide all shareholders the right 
to require Zinkinvent to buy back their shares. This constitutes a put option under IAS 32, which is recognised as a liability in the 2007 
Balance Sheet, without regard to the option actually being exercised. The acquisition of the minority interest in Zinkinvent GmbH in July 
2008 for a consideration of £18.8m resulted in £4.3m of goodwill (Note 11) and removed this liability.

The unsecured bank borrowings carry a rate of interest of 1.5% above LIBOR/EURIBOR subject to a ratchet as defined in the facility 
agreement. In the USA bank borrowings that are not fixed (Note 22) are at Prime rate –0.5% and are secured against substantially all of 
the assets of V&S Inc. and its subsidiaries. Obligations under finance leases and hire purchase obligations are secured on the relevant 
assets.

Property provisions relate to potential exposure to environmental costs of properties owned by the Group and dilapidation costs on 
leasehold properties. Other regulatory provisions relate in the main to employment issues. The Group has sought independent expert 
valuations where appropriate on these matters, although there are factors outside the Group’s control that give rise to uncertainties 
surrounding these events. The Group does not expect to be reimbursed for any of these future costs.
All provisions relate to ongoing issues which are not anticipated to be resolved or result in a cash outflow within the next 12 months.
22. Financial instruments
(a) Management of financial risks
Overview
The Group has exposure to a number of risks associated with its use of financial instruments.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of these risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. 
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits 
and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect 
changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, 
aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. 
The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and 
procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Group Audit 
Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk 
management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and principally from the Group’s receivables 
from customers. The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
It is the Group’s policy to insure a substantial part of the Group’s trade receivables, any residual risk is spread across a significant 
number of customers. As such the impairment losses are not significant. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which 
represents the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Board; these limits are reviewed regularly. Customers that 
fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis. 
The Group’s UK companies represent the majority of the trade receivable at 31 December 2008 with 60.4% (2007: 69.0%) and 
currently the only geographical region that does not insure their trade receivables is the USA, which represents 12.7% (2007: 8.7%) of 
the Group’s trade debt. The USA has a policy of taking out trade references before granting credit limits and selectively insuring where 
it is deemed necessary by management.
The Group’s policy is to not provide financial guarantees. At 31 December 2008 and 2007, no guarantees were outstanding.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to 
managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both 
normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. 
It is the Group’s policy to minimise its liquidity risk in terms of limiting the amounts of borrowings maturing within the next 12 months 
and as at 31 December 2008 all such debt was covered by cash and cash equivalents netting to £9.2m positive current liquidity (2007: 
£2.8m). The Group has an amortising £150.0m multi currency facility consisting of fixed term and revolving credit that runs to June 
2012. Subsequent to the year end arrangements for the £150m multi currency facility resulted in a revised amortisation of the fixed 
term, which is consistent with the previous profile and using 2008 year end exchange rates is as follows:
    £m
 2009   11.4 
 2010   18.4 
 2011   23.2 
 2012   62.4 
Along with various other on demand lines of credit, including bank overdrafts, finance leases and bills of exchange, the Group has 
access to facilities of £218.3m.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control 
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. 
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market 
risks. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board. 
Currency risk
The Group is primarily UK based and publishes its Consolidated Financial Statements in Sterling, but conducts business in several 
foreign currencies, including significant operations based in Continental Europe and the USA. This results in foreign currency exchange 
risk due to exchange rate movements which will affect the Group’s transaction costs and the translation of the results and underlying 
net assets of its foreign operations.
The trading currency of each operation is predominantly in the same denomination, however, the Group uses forward exchange 
contracts to hedge the majority of exposures that do exist. The Group does not apply hedge accounting to these derivative financial 
instruments.
The Group has hedged its investment in US and European operations by way of financing the acquisitions through like denominations 
through its multi currency banking facility. The Group’s investments in other subsidiaries are not hedged because fluctuations on 
translation of their assets into Sterling are not significant to the Group.
Interest rate risk
The Group adopts interest rate swaps when engaging in long term specific investments or contracts in order to more reliably assess 
financial implications of these procurements. However, the Group currently feels that using fixed interest rates for short term  
day to day trading is not appropriate.

Insurance
The Group purchases insurance for commercial, legal and contractual reasons. The Group retains insurable risk where external 
insurance is not commercially viable.
Capital management
The Board maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development 
of the business. The Board monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group 
defines as total shareholders’ equity and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders. 
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the 
advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There are financial covenants associated with the Group’s borrowings which are interest cover and EBITDA to net debt. The Group 
comfortably complied with these covenants in 2008 and 2007.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
(b) Total financial assets and liabilities
The table below sets out the Group’s accounting classification of its financial assets and liabilities and their fair values as at

The Group’s financial assets, excluding short term receivables, consist mainly of cash, call deposit accounts and available for sale 
financial assets (Note 14), which represent a 33.3% holding in Neholl B.V. and a 19.5% holding in an unlisted company whose fair value 
cannot be accurately measured and is fully written down.
Where cash surpluses arise in the short term, interest is earned based on a floating rate related to bank base rate or LIBOR/EURIBOR. 
Where the Group’s funding requirements allow longer term investment of surplus cash, management will review available options to 
obtain the best possible return whilst maintaining an appropriate degree of access to the funds.
The Group’s financial liabilities, excluding short term creditors, are set out below. Fixed rate financial liabilities comprise Sterling, Euro 
and US Dollar denominated finance leases and hire purchase agreements and bank loans. Floating rate financial liabilities comprise 
Sterling, Euro and US Dollar bank loans and overdrafts, and Sterling finance leases and hire purchase agreements. The floating rate 
financial liabilities bear interest at rates related to bank base rates or LIBOR/EURIBOR.
Each subsidiary has financial assets and liabilities which are predominantly in the same denomination as that subsidiary’s functional 
currency. Excluding the UK Parent Company, the financial assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of these 
entities are insignificant to the Group.
The UK Parent Company holds Euro £77.8m (2007: £97.2m) and US Dollar £38.7m (2007: £nil) denominated interest bearing loans, 
which is predominantly used to fund its European and United States operations and includes £78.0m (2007: £37.6m) designated as a 
hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation. The foreign currency loss of £21.6m (2007: £3.1m) for the effective portion was 
recognised directly in equity netted against exchange differences on translation of foreign operations, any ineffective portion 
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement is insignificant.

Subsequent to the year end the Group has increased its committed borrowing facilities by a further £22.5m through an extension of its 
£150m multi currency facility and additional finance leases.
(d) Fair values
The loss in the year on the fixed rate interest swaps was £0.0m (2007: £0.3m) which is the result of US Dollar interest rates remaining 
lower than when the derivative was taken out. The fair value of unhedged forward exchange contracts realised in the Consolidated 
Income Statement as part of fair value derivatives amounted to a cost of £0.2m (2007: £0.0m). The values of the Group’s other financial 
instruments at 31 December 2008 and 2007 were not materially different to the carrying value. Fair values were calculated using 
market rates where available, otherwise cash flows were discounted at prevailing rates.
The Group has impaired £1.9m (2007: £0.0m) of the carrying value of goodwill as detailed in Note 11.
(e) Credit risk
Exposure to credit risk
The exposure to credit risk is substantially mitigated by the credit insurance employed by the Group, however, in the absence of this 
insurance the maximum credit exposure on the carrying value of financial assets at the reporting date was:

(f) Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term fluctuations on the Group’s earnings. 
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated 
earnings. At the end of the reporting periods, the effects of hypothetical changes in interest and currency rates are as follows:
Based on average month end net debt balances that are not subject to an interest rate swap, if interest rates had varied throughout •	
the year by 1% the positive or negative variation on the year’s result would have been £1.3m (2007: £0.6m), which would directly 
impact on the Consolidated Income Statement.
Based on a 10% weakening in Sterling against all currencies throughout the year, the impact on the Consolidated Income Statement •	
would have been a gain of £1.3m (2007: £1.1m) and the impact directly in equity would have been a gain of £1.4m (2007: £1.0m).
Based on a 10% strengthening in Sterling against all currencies throughout the year, the impact on the Consolidated Income •	
Statement would have been a loss of £1.1m (2007: £0.9m) and the impact directly in equity would have been a loss of £1.1m  
(2007: £0.8m).

Share-based payments
All option schemes marked as being subject to share-based payments have 2005, 2007 or 2008 as their first qualifying year.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options 
granted. The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes model. The contractual life is the 
life of the option in question and the growth in dividend yield is based on the best current estimate of future yields over the contractual 
period.

The expected volatility is wholly based on the historic volatility (calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share 
options), adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
Share options have been granted to qualifying employees in line with either HM Revenue & Customs approved or non-approved 
schemes, as indicated above. Other than the LTIP, the strike price for the option is made based on the market values of shares at the 
date the option is offered.

Other reserves represent the premium on shares issued in exchange for shares of subsidiaries acquired. The Group has taken advantage 
of Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.
The minority interest of £1.7m arose on the Group’s purchase of a 68.2% interest in Vista Investment N.V., a Belgian holding company 
whose principal asset is a 33.3% shareholding in Neholl B.V., a Dutch holding company with galvanizing businesses in the Benelux 
region, which is held as an available for sale financial asset as disclosed in Note 14.

26. Pensions continued
United Kingdom
The Group operates two main pension schemes in the UK, the Hill & Smith Executive Pension Scheme provides benefits on a defined 
benefit basis, the other larger Hill & Smith Pension Scheme provides benefits that are on a defined contribution basis. This second 
scheme also contains some defined benefit liabilities. The assets of both schemes are administered by trustees and are kept entirely 
separate from those of the Group. Independent actuarial valuations are carried out every three years. Contribution rates are determined 
on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified Actuary, with the objective of providing the funds required to meet 
pension obligations as they fall due. There is also a separate Group personal pension plan operated by one of the Group’s subsidiaries.
The Consolidated Income Statement for the year includes a pension charge of £2.5m (2007: £2.3m), which includes the costs of the 
defined contribution scheme and the defined benefit scheme and which are detailed below.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense. 
Composition of the Scheme
The Group operates defined benefit schemes in the UK. A full Actuarial valuation of the schemes was last carried out as at 5 April 2006 
and was updated to 31 December 2008 by a qualified Actuary.
The principal assumptions used by the Actuary
 
      2008 2007 2006 2005 2004
Rate of increase in salaries   2.70% 4.80% 4.50% 4.00% 3.90%

Mortality table    PA92YOB* PA92YOB* PA92YOB* PA92C2005 PA92Base
* With the addition of the short cohort for the Hill & Smith Executive Pension Scheme, approximately 1.5 years is added to the life expectancies shown below:
The mortality assumptions imply the following expected future lifetimes from age 65:
      2008 2007 2006 2005 2004
Males currently aged 45   21.0 years 20.9 years 20.9 years 18.5 years 16.9 years

Females currently aged 65     22.8 years 22.7 years 22.7 years 21.4 years 19.9 years
The assumptions have been chosen by the Directors from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales 
covered, may not be borne out in practice.

Assets and liabilities
One scheme holds assets and liabilities in respect of defined contribution benefits which are equal in value and are excluded from the 
following figures. The fair value of scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to 
significant change before they are realised, and the value of the scheme liabilities, which is derived from cash flow projections over long 
periods and which is therefore inherently uncertain, are as follows:

The overall expected return on assets assumption has been calculated as an approximate weighted average of the expected returns of 
each asset class taking into account the asset allocation of the scheme. When setting an expected return for each asset class, the 
following factors have been considered:
Equities – a higher long term rate of return is expected on equity investments than that which is available on bonds. The extent to 
which equities are assumed to provide higher returns than bonds in the future is estimated based on the returns achieved above bond 
returns historically, market conditions at the Balance Sheet date and the employment of a UK active management approach with 
equities. 
Bonds, gilts and cash – where assets are held in bonds, gilts and cash, the expected long term rate of return is taken to be the yields 
generally prevailing on such assets as at the Balance Sheet date.
With profit policies – the underlying asset allocation of the policies and the overall rate is based on the expected long term rate of 
return on each of the asset classes with reference to this allocation. 
Hedge funds – these funds invest in a range of investments including equities, bonds and alternatives to generate stable absolute 
returns at a level above cash. The extent to which these funds are assumed to provide higher returns than cash in the future is based on 
the manager’s objectives with regards to the average annual returns above cash and having regard to market conditions at the Balance 
Sheet date.

Currency funds – these funds incorporate gearing to generate expected returns significantly above the returns available on cash. The 
extent to which these funds are assumed to provide higher returns than cash in the future is estimated based on expected returns on

Overseas
In France the Group provides certain long term benefits and operates post employment defined benefit plans which provide lump sum 
benefits at retirement in accordance with collective labour agreements. Some of those plans are funded with insurance companies.
The Group also operates defined contributions with plans in the USA. The amount contributed to these plans during the year was 
£0.1m (six months to 31 December 2007: £0.0m).
The Consolidated Income Statement for the year includes a pension charge of £0.1m (six months to 31 December 2007: £0.2m), which 
includes the costs of the defined contribution scheme and the defined benefit scheme as detailed below.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense. 
Composition of the scheme
The Group operates defined benefit schemes in France. An actuarial valuation of the schemes was carried out by an independent 
Actuary as at 31 December 2008.

Assets and liabilities
The fair value of scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before 
they are realised, and the value of the scheme liabilities, which is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and which is 
therefore inherently uncertain, are as follows:

27. Accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements
The principal accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements employed in the preparation of these Consolidated Group Financial 
Statements which could affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet date are as follows:
Actuarial assumptions on pension obligations
In determining the valuation of the defined benefit pension deficit, certain assumptions about the scheme have been made, notably the 
expected return on assets, inflation, discount rates, mortality, salary increases and pension increases. The factors affecting these 
assumptions are largely outside the Group’s control (Note 26).
Impairment of goodwill
The determination of whether goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets should be impaired requires the estimation of future 
cash flows and growth factors adopted by each cash generating unit. Furthermore, discount rates applied to these cash flows are 
determined by reference to the markets in which they operate and are risk adjusted to reflect risks and opportunities existing for each 
cash generating unit. These factors are all affected by prevailing market and economic factors outside the Group’s control. Further 
information on this issue is included in Note 11. 
Share-based payments
In valuing the share-based payments charged in the Group’s accounts, the Company has used the Black-Scholes calculation model, 
which makes various assumptions about factors outside the Group’s control, such as share price volatility and risk free interest rates. 
Details of the options and assumptions used in deriving the share-based payments are disclosed in Note 23.
Environmental and dilapidation provisions
Estimated environmental and dilapidation costs have been derived on the basis of the most recent assessments of the likely cost. 
Certain factors concerning these costs are outside of the Group’s control. In making this assessment the Group has sought the aid of 
independent experts where appropriate. Further information is included in Note 21.

Annual Report and Accounts 200808  
27. Accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements continued
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation has been estimated using the best information available, including seeking the opinion of independent experts where 
applicable (Note 15).
Valuation of intangible assets
Where an acquisition is of a significant size, it is reviewed by independent experts to assess the specific intangibles arising from the 
acquisition. Brands and customer lists have been identified as part of this process and are disclosed in Note 11. The reasons for the 
residual excess of consideration over net asset value are then identified to identify the reasons for goodwill arising, which in the case of 
recent acquisitions, has resulted mainly from assembled workforce, technical expertise, knowhow, market share and geographical 
advantages. 
Brands have been valued based on estimated royalty rates discounted over their useful lives, which is normally 20 years, but considered 
indefinite for the US Voigt & Schweitzer brand which has been successfully trading since 1956. Customer relationships have been 
valued based on discounted forecast turnover rates and have been deemed to have a useful economic life of five years based upon the 
average expected length of relationships with customers.
Fair value of available for sale financial assets
The Group’s investment in Neholl B.V. included as an available for sale financial asset is held at fair value, which inherently requires a 
degree of estimation of its potential realisable value on sale, future earnings and cash flows. Further information regarding this asset is 
included in Note 14.
28. Related party transactions
The key management are considered to be the Board of Directors of Hill & Smith Holdings PLC, whose remuneration can be seen in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 43. The compensation in total for each category required by IAS24 is as follows:

Hill & Smith Holdings PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
Company Principal Accounting Policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Company’s Financial Statements, except as noted below.
Basis of preparation
The Company’s Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK GAAP accounting standards and under the 
historical cost accounting rules.
Under Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own Profit and Loss 
Account.
Under FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a Cash Flow Statement, on the grounds 
that the Company is included in its own published Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions contained in FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures and has not disclosed transactions 
or balances with entities which form part of the Group. 
Investments in subsidiary undertakings 
In the Company’s Financial Statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, less amounts written off for 
impairment. They are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be 
recoverable.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at closing rates at the Balance Sheet date and the gains or losses 
on translation included in the Profit and Loss Account. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at historic rates of 
exchange and are not updated to closing rates at the Balance Sheet date.
This policy applies to the Company’s long term bank loans denominated in foreign currencies, which are monetary items, and therefore 
are translated into Sterling at closing rates at the Balance Sheet date, with exchange differences arising passing through the Profit and 
Loss Account. This policy also applies to long term amounts denominated in foreign currencies owed to subsidiary undertakings and to 
investments denominated in foreign currencies in intermediary holding companies.
However, the Company applies fair value hedge accounting, in accordance with FRS 26, in order to hedge loans denominated in foreign 
currencies against all, or part, of the foreign currency denominated investments. Therefore, foreign exchange differences arising on 
translation into Sterling of both the hedging loans and hedged investments using the closing rates at the Balance Sheet date are taken 
to the Profit and Loss Account. Any unhedged investment balances continue to be held at cost as described above.
Financial instruments
The Company has adopted the requirements of FRS 29 and has taken the exemption under that standard from disclosure on the 
grounds that the Consolidated Financial Statements contain disclosures in compliance with IFRS 7 in Note 22.
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
The principal financial instruments utilised by the Company are interest rate swaps. These instruments are used for hedging purposes in 
line with the Group’s risk management policy. Interest differentials are taken to net interest in the Profit and Loss Account.
Bank loans and overdrafts are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, bank 
loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the Profit 
and Loss Account over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets by equal instalments 
over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Leasehold improvements  life of the lease
Plant, machinery and vehicles  4 to 20 years

Hill & Smith Holdings PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 200808  
Leases
Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in creditors. Operating 
lease rentals are charged to the Profit and Loss Account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Pension scheme arrangements
The Company participates in the Hill & Smith Executive Pension Scheme and the Hill & Smith Pension Scheme, as described in Note 13.
As the Company is unable to identify its share of the Group pension scheme assets in respect of the defined benefit sections on a 
consistent and reasonable basis, the schemes are accounted for as if they are defined contribution schemes, as permitted by FRS 17.
Contributions in respect of defined contribution schemes are charged to the Profit and Loss Account in the period to which they relate.
Share-based payments
The share option programme allows employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of options granted after 7 November 
2002 and those not yet vested by 31 December 2004 are not recognised as an employee expense. Those vested since 1 January 2005 
are expensed with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which 
the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option 
pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an 
expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not 
achieving the threshold for vesting.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises an increase in the cost of 
investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiary’s Financial 
Statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity. This increase is offset in full by amounts recharged to the 
subsidiary, which are recognised as a reduction in the cost of investment in subsidiary.
 
Income tax
The charge for taxation on the profit or loss for the year represents the sum of the tax currently payable or recoverable and deferred 
tax. This charge is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in 
which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or recoverable on the taxable result for the year. The taxable result differs from net profit or loss 
as reported in the Profit and Loss Account because it excludes items of income or expense that are not taxable or not deductible. The 
Company’s debtor or creditor for current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the Balance Sheet date, 
and any adjustments in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided, without discounting, on timing differences between the treatment of items for taxation and accounting 
purposes as required by FRS 19.
Ordinary dividends
Dividends payable are accounted in the Company’s Financial Statements when the Company is committed to the payment of the 
dividend. Dividends receivable are accounted for on a cash accounting basis.
Financial guarantees
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to secure the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the 
Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be 
required to make a payment under the guarantee.

12. Guarantees and other financial commitments
(a) Guarantees
The Company had no financial guarantee contracts outstanding (2007: £nil).
The Company guarantees the bank loans and overdrafts of certain subsidiary undertakings. The amount outstanding at 31 December 
2008 was £25.4m (2007: £18.4m).
(b) Operating lease commitments
Annual commitments under non-cancellable operating leases expire in the periods as detailed below:
   2008 2007

     buildings Other buildings Other 
     £m £m £m £m
After five years     0.1  –  0.1  – 
13. Pensions
The Company contributes to two Group pension schemes; one providing benefits accruing in the future on a defined benefit basis and 
a second scheme providing benefits that are on a defined contribution basis. Details of the schemes and their most recent actuarial 
valuations are contained in Note 26 to the Group Financial Statements. Because the Company is unable to identify its share of the 
scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, the schemes have been accounted for by the Company as if they 
were defined contribution schemes, as permitted by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The pension cost for the year includes contributions payable by the Company to the fund and amounted to £1.6m (2007: £0.8m), of 
which £1.4m (2007: £0.7m) related to additional deficit contributions as detailed in Note 26 to the Group Financial Statements. The 
Company also incurred costs of £1.2m to reduce the liability to deferred defined benefit pensioners, which resulted in net curtailment 
gains in the Group Financial Statements. There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at either the beginning or the end of the 
financial year.
Full details of the Group schemes are given in Note 26 to the Group Financial Statements.
14. Related party transactions
During the year the Company had some minor transactions with GIL investments Limited of which D L Grove was during the year a 
major shareholder. All of these transactions were undertaken on an arm’s length basis.

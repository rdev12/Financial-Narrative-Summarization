chairman’s statement
I am delighted to report a year of significant progress together with a number of positive changes within the Group.
We have had a strong year of growth with revenue increasing by 66.9%. As a result I am able to report our maiden adjusted 
EBITDA profit of £411,000 whilst also reducing our statutory bottom line losses to £84,000, down 87.7% on last year’s loss 
of £676,000.
The increase in revenues largely came from the Managed Hosting division where revenues grew 174% in addition to the 
23.2% increase in the SME Hosting division.
We also completed two acquisitions during the year, acquiring Evohosting, whose tightly knit team effortlessly integrated 
with their Daily counterparts and Q4Ex based in Liverpool. The combination of Netplan’s highly qualified staff and the very 
experienced Q4Ex team was of enormous and immediate benefit to both parties.
We are currently working to integrate the Group further and to make best use of the excellent and highly qualified resource 
our team possess.
Our new CEO Chris Evans has instigated and overseen this change and has made an immediate impact through his 
energy, work ethic and ideas. I extend my thanks to all our dedicated staff who have worked tirelessly to help put us into, 
what we believe, is an increasingly strong position to capitalise on future revenue opportunities.

chief executive officer’s report
Introduction
I am pleased to provide my first report since taking on the role of Chief Executive from December 2014, having formerly 
been a Non-Executive member of the Board.
I became Chief Executive following the acquisition by the Group of Q4Ex Ltd, a cloud company which I had founded 
with two other partners. At this time and following a period of transition, Abby Hardoon the former CEO and founder of 
the Group moved to a Non-Executive role to allow for an evolvement in direction and to allow Abby to reduce his time 
commitment to the business.
The change in direction is one of concentrating our efforts on the Managed Hosting segment and a re-aligning of our cost 
base in support of this.
I am pleased to report a year of significant improvement in both operational and financial performance. Our revenues 
increased 66.9% to £3,891k from £2,331k a year earlier and we have today reported our maiden adjusted EBITDA profit of 
£411k versus an EBITDA loss of £45k a year earlier. As a result of this performance our statutory loss after taxation reduced 
from £676k in 2014 to £84k a reduction of 87.7%.
Operational Review
Daily Internet Plc was founded as a provider of SME hosting solutions to the mass market. Our SME Hosting segment has 
performed well in the year increasing revenues by 23.2% to £2,039k from £1,655k a year earlier. This was largely due to 
the contribution of the Evohosting acquisition. Underlying revenue remained at levels consistent with last year although as a 
result of the continuing re-organisation profitability was vastly improved.
The Group entered the Managed Hosting market in late October 2013 through the acquisition of Netplan Internet Solutions 
Limited. For the financial period under review, our Managed Hosting segment delivered revenues of £1,852k, up from a 
contribution of £676k for part of the year.
The Managed Hosting segment is the main focus of the Group as we see the largest current and future potential revenue 
opportunities arising in this area. Managed Hosting includes a range of Cloud offerings including design, implementation, 
control and managing environments and solutions for our customers. 
The market is currently seeing a number of trends develop, all of which indicate that the shift to Cloud delivered solutions 
will remain key future focus points for our customers.
One particular trend we are seeing is an increasing adoption of the Public Cloud. There is a developing level of acceptance 
and sufficient confidence in Public Cloud that we have been able to add into the product mix when proposing a new 
solution to a customer, particularly concerning business continuity. Previously we would replicate a Private Cloud across 
two Datacentres, but are increasingly replicating data to a Netplan designed continuity solution with Amazon Web Services 
(AWS). The “pay as you use” elements of Public Cloud are bringing into reach solutions that were previously cost prohibitive 
for some customers. This is helping us bring a greater breadth and depth of service, increasing revenues but all the time 
protecting or growing our overall gross margin.
strategic report Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 10
The vast and growing array of methods of delivering a solution are making decisions more complex for IT departments, 
who do not have the market knowledge, skills and infrastructure and so seek the expert advice of a partner such as 
Netplan. It is certainly the case that our larger customers are placing an increasing amount of business with us due to 
the increasing complexities in the overall solution. We believe this will help maintain our low levels of client churn in this 
segment moving forward.
One key attraction of some customers to Netplan is our PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) 
capabilities and offerings. PCI DSS applies to all entities involved in payment card processing—including merchants, 
processors, financial institutions and service providers, as well as all other entities that store, process or transmit 
cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data.
Netplan is a certified PCI DSS Level 1 Service provider and has a dedicated PCI team. This has assisted in attracting 
business from payment processing business to insurance companies who wish to outsource their PCI environment and 
elements of their compliancy process.
Acquisitions
During the year we acquired Evohosting Ltd and Q4Ex Ltd. Both acquisitions have performed better than expected and 
have now been fully integrated into the Group. We continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that must fit our stringent 
acquisition criteria.
Evohosting added CPanel specific hosting capacity to our SME Hosting segment. CPanel are the market leaders in SME 
shared hosting control panels. Evohosting continues to grow under our ownership.
Q4Ex, a Cloud hosting provider, brought key specialist personnel to the Group in the form of a strong management team 
and access to a vertical market which complimented Netplan. It now trades under the Netplan umbrella and is making 
substantial progress as the ‘Merchant and Distribution’ division of Netplan. This division was identified as being a vertical 
market, “ripe for change”, especially given the bulk of potential clients still utilise Windows Server 2003. Microsoft are 
withdrawing support and updates as the product reaches the end of life span on 14 July 2015.
Current Trading and Outlook
Trading post the financial year end has been in line with management and market expectations.
Our pipeline of opportunities continues to grow and we are well placed to take advantage of the continued move to the 
cloud. We will continue to invest over the next 12 months in our network infrastructure, automated systems and internal 
processes and drive further operational efficiencies with the integration of staff and systems across our business units and 
offices.
I look forward to the year ahead with confidence.
Chris Evans
Chief Executive Officer
19 June 2015 Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 11
finance director’s report
All of the Group’s activities relate to delivering Cloud based products, services and overall solutions. The Group is 
segmented into SME Hosting and Managed Hosting.
The SME Hosting Division includes the Daily, Namehog and Evohosting Brands and offer Domain Registration, Email 
Provision and Web Hosting solutions to the mass market.
The Managed Hosting division includes the Netplan and Q4Ex brands and offers all forms of Cloud hosting, including 
private cloud on its various flavours of Private Cloud offering and via the Public Cloud via Amazon AWS and Microsoft 
Azure. The Managed Hosting division also includes PCI DSS consultancy and compliance services.
The revenue split of the divisions is shown below:

Managed Hosting £1,852 48% £676 29%
Total £3,891 100% £2,331 100%
It is the Group’s intention to grow the SME Hosting division by leveraging on the automated systems that have been 
developed and continue to be developed since the business started in 2007. All acquisitions will be fully integrated to 
reduce overhead costs, increase supplier discounts and enable cross sell and up-sell opportunities. 
The focus of the Managed Hosting division is to continue to expand on its Cloud capabilities and solutions, widen its sales 
and marketing channels by investment in its sales force, and by customer facing marketing.
 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
In line with the nature, size and complexity of the business the senior management team work very closely to identify and 
evaluate areas of risk whilst developing and monitoring action plans to deal with any potential threats. All outcomes are 
reported to the Board and support is given as necessary to ensure actions are carried out.
Identifiable areas of risk include:
• Dependency on key suppliers – the Group is dependent on certain key suppliers for the continued operation of its 
business, the most significant of which are the supply of third party software and datacentre services. If any of these 
suppliers fail in the provision of their services it may have an adverse effect on the Group’s ability to provide services 
to its customers. However, the Group continually assess suppliers for both price competitiveness and technical 
innovation and are confident that alternative providers could be found.
• Customer retention – the Group provides an essential service to its customers. Any diminution in service levels could 
impact customer retention levels. However, the Group constantly monitors service levels and the low level of customer 
attrition is evidence of the Group’s ability to provide the level of service required.
strategic report Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 12
• Network – the datacentres we utilise are linked by fibre that we lease. Should the network fail there would be an 
adverse impact on the service provided to our customers. The Group has designed its network to have no single point 
of failure, it connects with transit providers at different geographical locations.
• Employees – the Group is a service organisation and as such, is dependent on the skills, knowledge and commitment 
of its staff. The performance of the Group is dependent on retaining its staff. We mitigate this risk by offering 
competitive reward packages.
• Search engine optimisation – a significant amount of the Group’s sales revenues are generated from customers using 
internet search engines (specifically in the SME Hosting segment). Should the Group’s search engine optimisation 
performance deteriorate, this could have an adverse impact on Group revenue. The Group continually monitors 
the position of its websites with respect to these search engines. The Group has experienced staff that work with 
specialist agencies to maintain or enhance the position of if websites for inclusion in search results.
• Acquisitions – the Group has stated that its strategy is to continue to make acquisitions to strengthen its growth. The 
risk is that we may not be able to find suitable acquisition targets. We mitigate this risk by employing and retaining high 
quality individuals whose focus is solely to find suitable targets.
Key Performance Indicator Review
Revenue Growth 2015 2014
Revenue £3,891k £2,331k
Gross 66.9% 49.7%
Revenue from continuing operations grew by 66.9% over the year compared to a growth of 49.7% in the previous year. The 
SME Hosting segment grew revenues by 23.2% (2014: 6.5%) and the Managed Hosting segment which was established in 
2014 grew revenues by 174.0%.
The adjusted EBITDA margin has improved from an EBITDA loss of £169k in 2013 reduced to a loss of just £45k in 2014 to 
an adjusted EBITDA profit of £411k in 2015. 
Performance Review
Group revenue for the year grew by 66.9% and reached £3,891k for the year to 31 March 2015.
The majority of our revenue growth came from the Managed Hosting division which incorporated the Netplan acquisition 
from 18 November 2013 and the Q4Ex acquisition on 08 December 2014. Q4Ex contributed £113k from the acquisition 
date. The SME Hosting division contributed 23.2 % growth with revenues increasing from £1,655k to £2,039k. The 
acquisition of Evohosting on 20 August 2014 contributing £250k of revenues since acquisition.
We continue to have good visibility of future revenues as many of our customers continue to pay in advance for their 
services and larger customers have multi-year contracts. As at 31 March 2015 there is £755k of deferred revenue which will 
be released to profit in future periods. 
Gross profit for the year was £2,422k (2014: £1,286k) representing a gross margin of 62.2% (2014: 55.2%). The 
improvement in Gross profit being attributable to the Managed Hosting segment which drives much higher margins than 
the domain driven SME Hosting division.
  Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 13
Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the year to 31 March 2015 is reported in the 
financial statements at £464k (2014: loss of £333k). Included within this figure are acquisition and integration costs, share 
based payment costs and fair value adjustments. The adjusted EBITDA is £411k (2014: loss of £45k) a maiden adjusted 
EBITDA profit. The directors consider that an adjusted EBITDA figure is a more appropriate measure of the underlying 
performance of the business.
The managed hosting division has contributed £567k of adjusted EBITDA to the Group for the year. The SME hosting 
division generated an adjusted EBITDA of £278k for the year.

Balance Sheet
Net cash inflow from operating activities during the year amounted to £386k (2014:  £71k). Cash at bank at 31 March 2015 
was £426k (2014: £999k).
 
Payables falling due within one year are reported at £1,854k (2014: £2,264). This figure includes an amount of £755k 
(2014: £421k) for deferred revenue which will be released to profit in future years  and an amount of £0.1m representing the 
carrying value on convertible loan notes which are due to be repaid in Jan 2016.
The Directors are confident there is sufficient working capital within the Group, however should accretive acquisitions’ 
become available the Group would seek to raise finance either through debt, equity or a mixture.
Payables falling due after one year are reported at £1,678k (2014: £509k). This figure includes an amount of £1,225k which 
represents the contingent consideration payable on the Q4Ex acquisition, which is the fair value of the amounts payable in 
shares.
Our People
Our people are very highly valued and the Directors place considerable emphasis on employees sharing in the success of 
the Group. This is achieved through the participation in share option schemes. Due to the nature and size of the business, 
employees are constantly encouraged to communicate with the Group’s senior management to discuss business issues 
and potential improvements.
It is the policy of the Group that there should be no unfair discrimination in recruiting and promoting staff, including 
applicants who are disabled. The Directors are committed to maintaining and developing communication and consultation 
processes with employees, who in turn are encouraged to develop an awareness of the issues affecting the Group.  Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 14

Environment and Society
In the wake of the Global warming debate and rising energy costs the Group aim to reduce their Carbon footprint in the 
following ways:-
• By virtualisation - Reducing the number of physical machines we use in our datacentres by virtualising machines 
wherever possible thus increasing efficiency and reducing energy consumption
• By choosing the correct hardware – we always purchase the most up to date technologies that are designed to 
reduce the energy requirements

directors’ report
The Directors present their Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2015.
Principal Activities
The principal activities of the business are the provision of Cloud hosting services and are more particularly explained in the 
strategic report.
Business Review and Future Developments
A review of the Group’s operations and performance during the financial year, setting out the position at the year-end, 
significant changes in the year and providing an indication of the outlook for the future is contained in the Strategic report 
on page 7 to 14.
Group Reorganisation
On 31 December 2014 the trade, assets and liabilities of Q4Ex Limited were transferred to Netplan Internet Solutions Ltd.
On 28 February 2015 the trade, assets and liabilities of Namehog Limited and Evohosting Limited were transferred to Daily 
Internet Services Limited.
Following these transfers Q4Ex Limited, Namehog Limited and Evohosting Limited became dormant companies. Daily 
Internet Plc has given a parental company guarantee in respect of audit exemption of these subsidiaries in the form 
prescribed by section 479C of the Companies Act 2006.
Results and Dividends
The Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year is set out on page 33. The Directors do not propose 
the payment of a Dividend for the year ended 31 March 2015.
Financial Instruments
The Group uses various financial instruments. These include bank loans, other loans, finance leases, cash and various 
items (such as trade receivables and trade payables) that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these 
financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The existence of these financial instruments exposes the 
Group to a number of financial risks, which are described in more detail below.
Liquidity Risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to 
invest cash assets safely and profitably. Short-term flexibility is achieved through available cash balances. Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 19
Interest Rate Risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of loan notes, finance leases and ordinary shares. The interest rate on 
the loan notes and finance leases are fixed.
Credit Risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash, and trade and other receivables. These balances are actively monitored 
to avoid significant concentrations of credit risk however the total of the cash balances and trade and other receivables 
represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.
In order to manage credit risk, the agreement with the customer states preferred collection by direct debit and limits are set 
for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references. Credit limits are reviewed by 
the credit control team on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. For hosting services, the 
Group predominantly invoices in advance and the agreement with the customer states preferred collection by direct debit, 
therefore the financial risk in respect of these debtors is limited.

• Michael Edelson Chairman
• Christopher Evans Chief Executive
• Julie Joyce Finance Director
• Robert Khalastchy Non-Executive Director

corporate governance report
Introduction
The Directors recognise the importance of, and are committed to, high standards of corporate governance. Although 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code is not compulsory for AIM companies, and therefore the Directors 
do not claim compliance with the code, the Directors intend to apply the principles as they consider appropriate to a public 
company of the size of Daily Internet Plc quoted on AIM, taking into account the recommendations contained in the QCA 
Guidelines. 
Board of Directors
The Board comprises five Directors, two Executives and three Non-Executives, and reflects a blend of different experience 
and backgrounds. The roles of Chairman (which is a non-executive position) and Chief Executive have been split by 
the Board and there is a clear division of responsibility between the two. The Board considers Michael Edelson, Abby 
Hardoon and Robert Khalastchy to be independent in character and judgement notwithstanding their shareholding and/
or share options in the Group. The Board, through the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors as well as the Executive 
Directors, maintains regular contact with its advisers and seeks to ensure that the Board develops an understanding of the 
views of the major shareholders about the Company. The Board meets regularly throughout the year and is responsible for 
formulating, reviewing and approving the Company’s strategy, financial activities and operating performance. Day-to-day 
management is delegated to the Executive Directors who are charged with consulting the Board on all significant matters. 
Consequently, decisions are made promptly following consultation amongst the Directors concerned where necessary and 
appropriate. All necessary information is supplied to the Directors on a timely basis to enable them to discharge their duties 
effectively and all Directors have access to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense, as and when 
required. The Chairman is available to meet with institutional shareholders to discuss any issues and concerns regarding 
the Group’s governance. The participation of the private and institutional investors at the AGM is welcomed by the Board.
Internal Controls
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Company’s and the Group’s systems of internal controls, which are 
designed to safeguard the assets of the Group and ensure the reliability of financial information for both internal use and 
external publication. Overall control is achieved by a regular detailed reporting system covering both technical progress of 
a project and the state of the Group’s financial affairs. Any system of internal controls can provide only reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities will be detected or that risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
is eliminated. The Directors consider that the system of internal controls operated effectively throughout the financial year 
and up to the date the financial statements were signed. Based on the size and complexity of the Group, the Board of 
Directors do not consider that there is a need for any internal audit function. 
Committees 
Audit Committee
The Company has established an Audit Committee that comprises of Michael Edelson and Robert Khalastchy. Michael 
Edelson is the Chairman of this Committee. The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year and is responsible for 
reviewing the integrity of the financial statements of the Group, the Group’s compliance with legal and regulatory  Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 26
requirements, and the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial controls and risk management 
processes including the extent to which internal audit review is required. It reviews the external auditors’ performance and 
independence and makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment of the auditors. 
Remuneration Committee
The Company has established a Remuneration Committee that comprises Michael Edelson and Robert Khalastchy. 
Michael Edelson is the Chairman. The Committee meets at least twice a year and is responsible for determining and 
reviewing with the Board the policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and such other members of the 
executive management it is designated to consider. Within the terms of the agreed policy, it determines the total individual 
remuneration of the Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee also approves the design of, and determines 
targets for, any performance related pay schemes, reviews the design of any share incentive plans, determines the awards 
to the Executive Directors and determines the policy for, and scope, of pension arrangements for each Executive Director.
Rule 21 of The AIM Rules 
The Board will comply with Rule 21 of the AIM Rules relating to Directors’ dealings and will also take all reasonable steps 
to ensure compliance with that rule by the Group’s applicable employees. The Company has adopted a code on dealing in 
securities of the Company and will take all reasonable steps to ensure compliance by the Directors and relevant employees 
in due course. 
Human Resources
The Group endeavours to appoint employees with appropriate skills, knowledge and experience for the roles they 
undertake. The Group has a range of polices which are aimed at retaining and providing incentives for key staff. Objectives 
are set for departments and employees that are derived from the Group’s business objectives. The Group has a clear and 
well-understood organisational structure and each employee knows his or her line of accountability. Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 27
statement of directors’ 
responsibilities Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 28
statement of directors’ 
responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, Report of the Director’s and the Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare the Group and company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial 
Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. The directors are also required to prepare financial statements in 
accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on Alternative Investment 
Market.
In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and 
enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the Financial Statements are made available on a website. 
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility 
also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:

been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

notes to the consolidated  
financial statements
1. Accounting Policies
Statement of Compliance
These Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations) as endorsed by the European Union (“endorsed IFRS”) and with those parts of 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies preparing their accounts under endorsed IFRS.
Basis of Preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Financial Statements are set out below. The policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial liabilities which have been 
valued in accordance with IAS 39.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates. It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. The 
areas where significant judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the Financial Statements and their effect 
are disclosed in note 2.
Going Concern
The Directors have prepared the Financial Statements on a going concern basis which assumes that the Group and the 
company will continue to meet liabilities as they fall due.
The directors have reviewed forecasts prepared for the period ending 30 September 2016 and considered the projected 
trading forecasts and resultant cash flows together with confirmed loan facilities and other sources of finance.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that 
the Group can continue to operate within the current facilities available to it.
The Directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements.
for the year ended 31 march 2015 Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 50

The directors consider that the adoption of the above standard only has an impact on the disclosures in the financial 
statements.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the following Standard in future periods may have an impact on the results 
and net assets of the Group, however, it is too early to quantify this.
 
New standard or interpretation EU endorsement date

into the Group. Revenue represents the fair value of amounts received or receivable for goods and services provided net 
of trade discounts and VAT. Revenue from the sale of domain name registrations is recognised when the domain name is 
registered or renewed. Revenue from value added services is recognised as these services are delivered. Revenue from

Where the company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The company controls an investee if 
all three of the following elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, 
and the ability of the investor to use its power to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts 
and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control. De-facto control exists in 
situations where the company has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee without holding the 
majority of the voting rights. In determining whether de-facto control exists the company considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances, including:
• The size of the company’s voting rights relative to both the size and dispersion of other parties who hold voting rights
• Substantive potential voting rights held by the company and by other parties
• Other contractual arrangements
• Historic patterns in voting attendance.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they 
formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method. 
In the statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially 
recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date on 
which control ceases.
Business Combinations
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. On acquisition, all of the subsidiaries’ 
assets and liabilities that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values reflecting the conditions at that 
date. The results of subsidiaries acquired in the period are included in the income statement from the date on which control 
is obtained.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the total acquisition date fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is capitalised as an intangible 
asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
In determining the fair value of consideration, the fair value of equity issued is the market value of equity at the date of 
completion, and the fair value of contingent consideration is based on the expected future cashflows based on whether the 
directors believe performance conditions will be met and thus the extent to which the further consideration will be payable. 
Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the 
excess is credited in full to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on the acquisition date.
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually 
at the financial year end. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on 
the asset’s cash-generating unit (i.e. the lowest Group of assets in which the asset belongs for which there are separable  Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 52
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from the other assets or Groups of assets). Goodwill is 
allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies 
of the combination giving rise to the goodwill.
The estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash 
flows have not been adjusted.
Impairment charges are included in administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement, except to the extent 
they reverse gains previously recognised in other comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is 
not reversed.
Foreign Currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet 
date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Segment Reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision 
maker. The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.
Financial Instruments
Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as 
either financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a 
residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Financial Assets
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the 
consolidated statement of financial position. Trade receivables are minimal as the Group operates a cash on delivery 
model for recurring subscriptions. Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value and an impairment provision will 
be recognised if there is evidence that the amount is irrecoverable and will be shown in administrative expenses in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at 
call with banks. 
Share Capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a 
financial liability or financial asset. The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments and are recorded at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial Liabilities
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories, depending on the purpose for which it was acquired. 
The Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows:
• Fair Value Through Profit or Loss – This category comprises only contingent consideration. They are carried in the 
statement of financial position at fair values which changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income 
statement. Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 53
• Other Financial Liabilities – Other financial liabilities include trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities, 
which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method.
Fair Value Measurement Hierarchy
IFRS 7 requires certain disclosures which require the classification of financial assets and financial liabilities measured at 
fair value to reflect the significance of the inputs used in making the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy has 
the following levels:
a. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1)
b. Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) (Level 2); and
c. Inputs from the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (Level 3)
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the financial asset or financial liability is categorised is determined on the 
basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
classified in their entirety into only one of the three levels.
Convertible Debt
The proceeds received on issue of the Group’s convertible debt are allocated into their liability and equity components. 
The amount initially attributed to the debt component equals the discounted cash flows using a market rate of interest 
that would be payable on a similar debt instrument that does not include an option to convert. Subsequently, the debt 
component is accounted for as a financial liability measured at amortised cost until extinguished on conversion or maturity 
of the bond. The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option and is recognised in the “Other reserve” 
within shareholders’ equity, net of income tax effects.
Share Based Payments
The fair value of employee options granted is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than 
employees, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is charged with the fair value of goods and services 
received. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black Scholes pricing model, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
Leases
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are capitalised as tangible assets and depreciated over 
the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Obligations under such agreements are included in payables net of 
the finance charge allocated to future periods. The finance element of the rental payment is charged to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the net obligation outstanding 
in each period. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged against income on a straight line basis over the lease 
term. Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 54
Property Plant and Equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation. Depreciation is provided at annual rates 
calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows:
Furniture and Equipment 20% – 33.3% reducing balance
Investment in Subsidiaries
Fixed asset investments in the Parent Company are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Research and Development
Research expenditure is written off to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the year in which the 
expenditure occurs. Development expenditure is treated in the same way unless the directors are satisfied as to the 
technical, commercial and financial viability of individual projects, there is an intention to complete and sell the product 
and the costs can be easily measurable. In this situation, the expenditure is capitalised and amortised. The amoritisation 
expense is included in administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the years 
during which the Group is to benefit.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separable from the acquired entity or give rise to 
other contractual / legal rights. The amounts ascribed to such intangibles are arrived at by using appropriate valuation 
techniques (see section related to critical estimates and judgements below).
The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their estimated useful economic lives and the methods used to 
determine the cost of intangibles acquired in business combinations are as follows:
Intangible Asset Customer relationships
Estimated UEL 5-7 years
Valuation Method Estimated discounted cash flow
Deferred Taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated 
statement of financial position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on: 
• the initial recognition of goodwill; 
• the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the 
transaction affects neither accounting or taxable profit; and 
• investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of 
the difference and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those instances where it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the difference can be utilised.  Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 55
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered). 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either: 
• the same taxable Group company; or 
• different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on intangible assets and other temporary differences recognised in business 
combinations.
2. Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of this financial information requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities at the period end date and the amounts reported for revenues and 
expenses during each period. However the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those 
estimates. The key sources of estimation that have a significant impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities are 
discussed below.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles
The Group tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in line with the accounting policy noted above. This involves 
judgement regarding the future development of the business and the estimation of the level of future profitability and cash 
flows to support the carrying value of goodwill. An impairment review has been performed at the reporting date and no 
impairment has been identified. More details including carrying values are included in note 13.
Impairment of Other Assets
The Group reviews the carrying value of all other assets for indications of impairment at each period end. If indicators 
of impairment exist, the carrying value of the asset is subject to further testing to determine whether its carrying value 
exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Valuation of Intangibles Acquired in Business Combinations
Determining the fair value of customer relationships acquired in business combinations requires estimation of the value 
of the cash flows related to those relationships and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. More 
details including carrying values are included in note 13.
Valuation of Contingent Consideration
When valuing the contingent consideration still payable on acquisitions, the Group considers various factors including the 
performance of the acquired entity since acquisition together with its expected performance to the end of the earn-out 
period. Following the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised) – Business Combinations, contingent consideration is recognised at, and 
carried thereafter at, fair value. All changes in fair value (other than measurement period adjustments) are reflected in the 
income statement.  Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 56
Useful Economic Lives of Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives. Useful lives are based on management’s estimates of 
the period over which the assets will generate revenue, which are periodically reviewed for continued appropriateness. 
Changes to estimates can result in changes in the carrying values and hence amounts charged to the income statement in 
particular periods which could be significant.
3. Financial Instruments – Risk Management
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources, convertible bonds and various items such as trade 
receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks or the 
methods used to measure them from previous periods.
The Group’s objective is to ensure adequate funding for continued growth and expansion. 
All of the Group’s financial instruments are carried at amortised cost.  There is no material difference between the carrying 
and fair value of its financial instruments, in the current or prior year, due to the instruments bearing interest at floating rates 
or being of short term nature.

The fair value adjustment relates to the contingent consideration payable on the Netplan acquisition in the prior year which 
was settled in the current year. The Group and Company activities expose it to a number of risks such as interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme seeks to minimise the potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Board, on a regular basis, reviews key risks and, where appropriate, 
actions are taken to mitigate the key risks identified.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on 
its debt instruments. It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s policy is to prepare periodic working capital forecasts, allowing an assessment of the cash requirements of 
the Group and Company, to manage liquidity risk. Cash resources are managed in accordance with planned expenditure 
forecasts and the directors have regard to the maintenance of sufficient cash resources to fund the Group and Company’s 
immediate operating requirements and capital expenditure.

A 4% decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the contingent consideration would have increased the fair value of 
the contingent consideration by £41k.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group seeks to minimise exposure to interest rate risk by borrowing at fixed interest rates.
Credit Risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited as the majority of services provided within the SME hosting segment are 
under terms whereby payment is due on delivery or in advance of services provided. The managed hosting division gives 
30 day terms and historically has had no requirement for doubtful debts. For cash and cash equivalents, the Group only 
uses recognised banks with high credit ratings. Daily Internet Plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2015 59
Capital Disclosures
The Group monitors “adjusted capital” which comprises all components of equity (i.e. share capital, share premium, non-
controlling interest, retained earnings, and revaluation reserve).
The Group’s objective when maintaining capital are: 
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide returns for shareholders in future 
periods and benefits for other stakeholders, and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital it requires in proportion to risk. The Group manages its capital structure and makes 
adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
4. Segmental Analysis
The chief operating decision maker for the Group is the Board of Directors. The Group reports in two segments:
• SME Hosting – this segment provides a range of VPS, shared hosting, email and domain registration services to 
individuals and SME’s. Namehog Limited which was acquired in January 2014 and Evohosting Limited which was 
acquired during the year are included in this segment.
• Managed Hosting – this segment provides all forms of Cloud hosting to larger customers. This segment was created 
on the acquisition of Netplan in November 2013. Q4Ex which provides Cloud and professional services was acquired 
during the year has been included in this segment since acquisition.
Information regarding the operation of the reportable segments is included below. The performance of each operating 
segment is based on revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) before any 
allocation of Group overheads, share based payments, fair value adjustments or acquisition costs, as the Board believe this 
is the best measure for performance. The Groups EBITDA has been calculated after deducting Group overheads which 
include the cost of the Board, Group marketing, legal and professional fees, share based payments, fair value adjustments 
and acquisition costs.
Assets and liabilities are not reviewed on a segmental basis. All segments are continuing operations. The accounting 
policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. 
Transactions between segments are accounted for using an arms length commercial basis.

Convertible Loan Note
During the year thirty four “2005 Loan Notes” £5,000 convertible loan notes were redeemed and 22 “2016 Loan Notes” 
remain due in January 2016. 
The 2016 Loan Notes offer a rate of interest of 9 per cent and are convertible at a conversion price of 3p per share. The 
Company is able to redeem a minimum of £1,000 nominal value of each New Loan Note as cash flow allows by repaying 
the redeemed nominal value plus six months pro rata interest, subject to the relevant holders being entitled to convert such 
loan notes into ordinary shares in the capital of the Company at their election at 3p per share.
In the previous financial year a warrant was also issued entitling the holder to subscribe for 100,000 ordinary shares at a 
price of 5p per share, exercisable at any time before 8 January 2022, provided that the Company may require the exercise 
of these warrants if its shares are traded at a price in excess of 8p per share for a period of 60 business days and an 
aggregate value of bargains exceeding £60,000 occurs over that period. The value of the convertible loan notes recognised

considered at the end of the Annual General Meeting.

any territory or the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange; and
b.  in any other case, up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1,600,000 (such amount to be reduced by the nominal

e. the allotment (otherwise than pursuant to resolutions 5(a) to (d) above) of equity securities up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £360,000
The power granted by this resolution will expire 15 months from the date this resolution is passed or, if earlier, the 
conclusion of the Company’s next annual general meeting (unless renewed, varied or revoked by the Company prior to or 
on such date) save that the Company may, before such expiry make offers or agreements which would or might require 
equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of any such offer 
or agreement notwithstanding that the power conferred by this resolution has expired.
This resolution revokes and replaces all unexercised powers previously granted to the Directors to allot equity securities as 
if section 561(1) of the 2006 Act did not apply but without prejudice to any allotment of equity securities already made or 
agreed to be made pursuant to such authorities.

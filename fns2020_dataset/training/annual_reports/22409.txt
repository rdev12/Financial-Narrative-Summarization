Barry Olliff after a twenty-plus year career in equity markets,
specialising in investment trusts
1991 Launch of the first City of London Group product, the Emerging
Markets Country T rust
1995 Launch of the first US based mutual fund for institutional
investors, beginning the development of the US business
1997 Opening of the US office in Pennsylvania. Stockbroking activities

2000 Singapore office established, linking with London and US hubs
and enabling 24 hour coverage of global investment markets
2006 The Group becomes a publicly traded company via an IPO on
the AIM market in London
2008 Fourth Group office opened in Dubai
2010 Proposed listing on the main market of the London Stock Exchange
Our shares were admitted to the AIM market of the London
Stock Exchange in April 2006 and since then we have grown
the business significantly with funds under management
increased to US$4.4 billion, a new office opened in Dubai and
a market capitalisation that has risen by 50% to £73 million.
As a result of this progress we expect to upgrade to a full
listing on the London Stock Exchange later this year,
enhancing our status with our institutional clients and
widening the Group’s appeal to international investors.
The way in which we run
our business has remained
essentially the same since our
inception and it is worth
restating our key strengths
that we set out in last year’s
annual report.
Expertise
At City of London, we focus not
on gathering assets, but on building
products that reflect our expertise.
Initially, and for many years since
the firm was founded, that
expertise was very specific to closed-
end funds which offered emerging
markets exposure.  This was
subsequently complemented by
research into the underlying
equities, both via natural resources
and via country specific emerging
markets stocks, which in turn
spawned regional and global
emerging market equity funds.
Most recently, we have applied
our unrivalled knowledge of City of London Investment Group Plc  Annual Report 2010 3
1. Investment performance drives our business
2. T echnology leverages our capabilities
3. Focus on profits, margins, costs
4. Aversion to risk in the management of our business
5. 1-4 above create opportunities for further growth
6. CoL differentiation and diversification
City of London’s operating philosophy can
best be represented by the six key drivers:
  
         
Other 
Institutions 9%
Retail 1%
Endowment 22%
Foundation 20%
Pension 48%
Client type 
As a percentage of total assets as at 31st May 2010
closed-end funds around the world
to the development of a global
(ex US) closed-end fund product.
So today, while we remain both
proud and protective of our
“boutique” status, we offer a range
of products which are defined by
the twin pillars of our expertise:
emerging markets and closed
end funds.
Process
We have always striven to develop
and nurture an investment process
which does not rely on ‘star’ fund
managers, but rather upon a series
of analytical procedures that can
produce repeatable and sustainable
first or second quartile performance
versus our peers. Our process
employs an array of proprietary tools
for analysing and identifying value.
These quantitative tools supplement
both macroeconomic analysis and
the trading expertise that has been
developed over a period of nearly
20 years. Whether it is taking
advantage of discount anomalies in
closed-end funds, or company
specific valuations in our equity
business, our aim is to deliver
consistent relative outperformance
combined with low volatility relative
to the applicable emerging markets
benchmarks.
Client service
Our clients are our business.
If performance is our first priority,
then client service is a close second.
We understand that a “one size fits
all” approach is not appropriate.
Our aim is to be open and
accessible to each and every client,
and while we have a designated
client service team we also expect
and encourage our institutional
clients to enjoy direct contact
with fund managers and other
key individuals within the
investment management team.
We acknowledge that our industry
has faced some difficult issues in
recent times, both with respect to
the opaque practices of a few, and
with respect to volatile market
conditions. We are, and always have
been, an open book to our clients.
While we would never seek to
impose, we try to anticipate the
concerns of our clients, and with
that in mind we offer personal visits
by our senior investment officers to
all of our institutional clients and
achieve a significant take up rate.
We believe that our focus on client
service is a key driver of our long
term client retention. Our financial year to 31st May 2010 saw
a marked and sustained recovery in our
principal markets from the lows recorded
in the prior year following the end of the
credit boom and the collapse of financial
markets around the world. Measured by
the MSCI Emerging Markets Index
(MXEF), emerging markets increased by
some 20% during the year under review as
global investors increased their exposure to
countries growing, and forecast to
continue to grow, at rates considerably
ahead of developed economies. City of
London’s funds under management (FuM)
grew over the same period by 25% to a
year-end total of US$4.38 billion,
reflecting performance in line with the
benchmark and the addition of net new
money from clients as they increased their
weighting in emerging markets.
Since the year end, the MXEF has
continued to strengthen and at
31st August the index was 5% higher
than at 31st May. FuM have also
continued to increase, ending August
at US$4.86 billion, a rise of 11% over
the financial year-end figure.
Due to the weakness of sterling against the
US dollar in particular (a topic covered in
more detail in the Financial Review), the
increase in FuM in sterling terms has been
even stronger with a 39% rise to £3.01
billion being recorded in the year to 31st
May 2010. FuM in sterling increased by a
further 5% to £3.16 billion during the
three months to 31st August 2010, less
than the US dollar increase as sterling
weakness continued to unwind.
Results
The substantial improvement in the
Group’s financial results principally reflects
the sustained recovery in emerging markets
during the period and the consequent
increase in FuM, together with new
monies received from existing clients and
the award of new mandates.
Gross fee income for the year to 31st May
2010 (being the revenues derived from the
Group’s management charges on FuM)
increased by 49% to £30.0 million (2009:
£20.2 million). Profit before profit share,
investment losses and tax was up 77%
to £15.2 million (2009: £8.6 million),
demonstrating once again the operational
leverage inherent in the Group’s business.

in the Group’s financial results
principally reflects the sustained
recovery in emerging markets
during the period...”

Profit before tax increased by 93% to
£10.4 million (2009: £5.4 million) and
after a tax charge of £3.4 million,
representing 33% of pre-tax profits (2009:
£1.5 million or 28% of pre-tax profits),
profit for the period was up by 82% to
£7.0 million (2009: £3.8 million).
Basic earnings per share were up 77% to
28.5p (2009: 16.1p) and fully diluted
earnings per share, reflecting dilutive
options held by directors and employees,
increased by 79% to 26.9p (2009: 15.0p).
Cash and cash equivalents at the year-end
were £4.8 million (2009: £4.7 million).
Dividends
The Group’s dividend policy is essentially
unchanged. We pay dividends to
shareholders that are covered
approximately 1.5 times by earnings per
share, split one third: two thirds between
the interim and final payments. Following
the exceptional, and volatile market
conditions experienced last year, the level
of cover was temporarily reduced to reflect
the Board’s belief that these conditions
were unlikely to be repeated. It is our
intention to restore dividend cover to the
long term level over the next two years.
The Board is recommending a final
dividend for the year to 31st May 2010 of
15p per share (2009: 10p) to be paid on
19th November 2010 to shareholders on
the register on 29th October 2010. Taken
together with the interim dividend of 7p
paid in March, this makes a total for the
year of 22p (2009: 15p), an increase of
47%. This level of payout is covered
1.30 times by basic earnings per share
compared to 1.07 times last year.
T ransfer from AIM to the main market
I advised shareholders in my statement
accompanying the half year results that
we were revisiting our plans to migrate
our share listing from AIM to the main
market of the London Stock Exchange.
We determined that these plans should be
implemented this year and shareholders
received a notice convening a meeting to
approve the move together with a letter
explaining the benefits to the Company
and its owners. Approval was granted at
the meeting (held in July) and the next
step in the process will be the publication,
and despatch to shareholders, of Listing
Particulars ahead of the grant of listing
and delisting from AIM. We currently
expect this to take place around the end
of October.
The Board believes that a main market
listing in London will widen the potential
universe of investors in City of London,
both institutional and private individuals –
who will be able, for instance, to hold our
shares in an ISA. We also believe that a
main market listing could enhance the
Group’s reputation and brand with the
large and sophisticated institutional
investors that account for the largest
proportion of our current client base.
There are a limited number of current
private shareholders who have expressly
invested in the Company as an AIM
stock in order to take advantage of UK
Inheritance Tax benefits. Hopefully they
will feel that they have received adequate
notice of our intentions.
Operations
We have continued to develop and
progress our strategy to diversify our client
base, the type of funds we run and our
geographical coverage. This strategy is
long term in its execution and reflects the
Group’s core tenet of risk aversion.
During the year under review our focus
has been on the recruitment of
experienced individuals who bring new
skills to the Group and who are able to
help us implement our plans to offer
additional investment products to existing
and potential clients. These new products
include funds investing directly
in equities, in frontier emerging markets
and in global closed-end funds.
The process of internalising the Group’s
marketing functions is now almost
complete. We are extending and
strengthening our contacts and
relationships with the consultant
community worldwide that forms our
principal source of new business. We are
optimistic that the dedicated marketing
resources in place in the US, London and
Singapore will not only generate high
quality new business for us in due course
but also ultimately improve net margins
as payments to present external new
business finders decrease.
A more detailed review of the Group’s
operations and strategy is provided by our
Chief Executive Officer, Barry Olliff,
on page 8.
Board change
In August 2010, we announced the
resignation of Omar Ashur as a non-
executive director to devote more time to
his business interests in Dubai. Omar had
been a director of the Company since
2001 and has been a source of wise and
commercially experienced advice for many
years. On behalf of the Board, I wish him
success and happiness in the future.
Outlook
Developed economies remain difficult to
forecast as government finances continue
to worsen prompting near universal
cutbacks in public spending that may well
reduce or extinguish the recovery in
activity seen in the last 12 months.
The outlook for emerging markets appears
to be more hopeful with relatively high
growth in GDP forecast, at least compared
to the developed economies. If this
translates into increased weightings
towards emerging markets and if we
maintain our investment performance,
then the current financial year should see
further growth in revenues for the Group.
Increased revenues, given our low cost base
and loyal and experienced staff, should
result in increased profitability.
I will update shareholders on progress in
this financial year at the time of the AGM.

Closed-end funds
The original expertise
1868
Launch of what is generally
regarded as the first investment
trust by Foreign & Colonial in the
form of a collective investment
scheme protected by limited
liability for its shareholders. The
Foreign & Colonial Government
T rust set out to raise an initial 
£1million with a stated objective of
providing “the investor of moderate
means the same advantage as the
large capitalist in diminishing risk
in Foreign & Colonial stocks by
spreading the investment over a
number of stocks”.
1873
Launch of the first Scottish
investment trust by Robert Fleming,
The Scottish American Investment
T rust, to invest surplus capital
originally generated in Dundee from
the weaving of imported jute into
tenting and sailcloth and supplied in
vast quantities to forces in the US
Civil War. This was “the first
Association in Scotland for
investments in American railroad
bonds, carefully selected and widely
distributed, and where investments
would not exceed one-tenth of the
capital in any one security”.
In response to the world’s first
telecommunications boom,
The Globe T elegraph and T rust
Company was launched in London
to participate in the business of
laying and operating cable links
between countries. Globe went
on to become the largest UK
investment trust, a position it
held for over 100 years.
1900 – 1930
The 20th century began with
over 80 investment trusts in the
UK, reflecting the success of the
earlier launches and the popularity
of the schemes with the fast
growing number of individual
investors. These investors could
access, via the trusts, opportunities
that until then had been reserved
for only the very richest families –
from railroads and telegraphs
to rubber plantations and
infrastructure in every continent.
In the US as well, investment
trusts slowly gained in popularity
but really took off during the
bull market preceding the Wall
Street Crash of 1929. 
A closed-end fund (or an investment trust or company)
is one with a fixed number of shares outstanding, and
one which does not redeem shares in the way an
open-ended one (such as a mutual fund or unit trust)
does. The price of a share in a publicly traded closed-
end fund is determined entirely by supply and demand,
so shares can either trade below their net asset value
(“at a discount”) or above it (“at a premium”). It is this
characteristic that we seek to exploit, buying those
shares we consider cheap, generally at what we believe
to be an unjustifiable discount, and selling those we
consider expensive, those at an unwarranted small
discount or at a premium. City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010 7
1932
With the worldwide Great
Depression came a wave of defaults
by companies and over-leveraged
trusts on both sides of the Atlantic.
The conservatively managed
survivors in the UK took the then
radical step of forming an
‘association’ of investment trust
companies (not managers) to
address common issues such as:
taxation and gearing levels,
represent the interests of the trusts
and their shareholders, speak with
one, powerful voice on behalf of its
members and begin the processes
that would lead to greater
transparency in their dealings.
1950 – 1980
The trust sector in the UK enjoyed
a period of significant growth after
the calamity of the Second World
War despite having to deal with
increasing taxation levels, exchange
controls and the emergence of
institutional investors. Increasing
transparency and technology
combined to allow the accurate
analysis of each trust’s underlying
portfolio (by now almost exclusively
in publicly traded equities) by
brokers and therefore whether the
shares were cheap or dear. Sector or
geographic specialisation became
increasingly popular in a return to
the very beginning of the
investment trusts’ history.
1980 to date
The trends begun in the last 50
years continued as institutional
investors came to dominate
ownership of closed-end funds and
ever more sophisticated analysis was
carried out into their underlying
assets. In addition, the rise of
activist investors, and in some cases
successful predators, has sharpened
the focus of all managers around
the world, whether they are in
developed or emerging financial
centres. T oday’s trust sector offers
investors professionally managed,
diversified exposure to almost any
sector and geography they wish –
just as they were designed to do
140 years ago. Chief Executive Officer’s review
Significantly less emotional
behaviour this year
For us this was a boring year.
As shown below our index hardly moved!
Whereas in 2008/9, moves of the order of
magnitude of over 20% in MXEF were
common (there were at least six), in
2009/10 there was one!
Our business was very stable as well.
Clients seem to be happy and the asset
class seems to be well supported at around
current levels. Looking out a few years, at
least at present, the Emerging asset class
seems likely to be one of the few listed
asset classes of choice potentially for many
years to come.
On the right I’ve shown a graph of CDS
Spreads which compares the Developed
with the Emerging countries. This has to
be one of the most remarkable turnarounds
in terms of reversal of roles within our
industry over the past twenty years. The
interesting thing is that where the CDS
relationship went over the past year, P/E’s
could easily follow next. Imagine that –
paying a higher P/E for exposure to a
basket of Emerging countries (say Brazil,
China, Korea and Taiwan) than for a
Developed basket (say US, UK, Germany
and France). We are not only fortunate to
be exposed to this asset class at this point
in its development but it is worth pointing
out that the Developed world is now
suffering from many of the same problems
that the Emerging countries had to deal
with a few years ago. Many of our
shareholders will recall the advice given out
at that time by the US: confront the
problem, reduce deficits, eliminate excess
capacity and pay down or renegotiate
leverage. Now that the boot is on the other
foot it seems likely that, as a result of this
advice being too painful to heed, the
adjustment process will be extended.
Diversification
We have continued to develop our
diversification plans over the past year.
The Business Diversification Product
Map opposite shows the extent of this
diversification.
Current areas of focus include Natural
Resources and the Developed CEF
Products. Both have performed well from

an investment perspective and there seems
to be significant appetite for our
Developed CEF expertise which effectively
does what we presently undertake within
the Emerging space. Since winning our
first mandate in September 2009 this
account has outperformed its benchmark
by around 300bps. Obviously shareholders
are not interested in the investment
performance of a specific fund but this
performance has afforded us the
opportunity to significantly short-circuit
the normal time required to create a
relevant record. We will start marketing
this product in November and I’ll provide
more information regarding progress in
the Interim Statement. In addition, in the
above Product Map you can see the
breakdown of the different businesses that
we are attempting to develop. In all cases
these are part of our diversification plans.
Apart from the Developed CEF Fund and
Natural Resources we are expecting these
products to take around two to three years
to build adequate track records. Each of
these areas of business is being developed
on a stand-alone basis with separate
staffing and the creation of a team
environment from their beginning.
North Bridge Capital
As referenced in earlier CEO’s statements,
and apart from one consultant where there
was a one year extension, as of 13th
October 2009 the agreement that we had
with North Bridge Capital with regard to
marketing came to an end. As of 13th
October 2010 we will be responsible for all
of our US Marketing, having internalised
this process. T odd Fawaz, who is in charge
of our US Marketing effort, having now
been with the firm for two years, has
effectively started again regarding our
attempts at diversification. One of the
issues that we have had to confront is that
while we consider that there is a significant
need to diversify our business for reasons
I’ll go into later, North Bridge in retrospect
seem to have been keener to focus on our
old business, that of Emerging Markets
CEF’s. This effectively has meant that
while we had assumed that the relevant
profile building was proceeding, it would
now appear that it was not. The bottom
line is that in our experience third party
marketing works very well when small and
having a single product to sell. It does not
work, or at least is unlikely to work, when
there is an established wish to grow and
market a number of products. Obviously
from our perspective it is not until a
contract of this type comes to an end that
it is possible to take a new direction.
Regarding our need to diversify our
business, in my opinion there are three
main reasons for this:
1) Staff. In my opinion employees thrive
in a growing business. In fact I would
suggest that it’s difficult to keep good
employees if you do not intend to grow a
business. Staff have needs, they are
ambitious and they have a need for
security. If they consider that they are in a
dead end job they will move on to another
business where there are plans for growth.
2) Clients. For similar reasons clients
should expect continuity of staffing.
Changing staff leads to risk. For example
the Investment Process would potentially
alter in the event that investment staff
were to change. In my opinion, while it
used to be argued that diversification was a
risk, I would suggest that recent experience
amongst our peer group would imply that
zero plans for growth leads to staff
departures which leads to insecurity in
terms of investment performance.
3) Competitive Pressure. In my opinion
there is going to be ongoing pressure on
margins, salaries and the costs associated
with the general infrastructure of doing
business. Not surprisingly the regulatory
responsibilities of doing business are
increasing too. In my opinion there is a
need to ensure that these costs are spread
over increased assets, otherwise there is
the potential appearance of reduced
profitability.
Thus while I would not accept that we are
on a treadmill, there is a very real need to
grow our business via diversification and at
the core of delivering in that regard is our
decision to internalise marketing.

10 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010
I have produced below the projected run
off payments to North Bridge Capital
over the next ten years, this being the
extent of their participation. These figures
are based upon two key assumptions: first
that the clients remain and second a
constant index level. Obviously there are
additional variables as well including
investment performance and currency
rates, but in terms of the big picture as
these ten year trails run out so we start to
receive those fees that otherwise would be
paid to North Bridge Capital. In all cases
this relates to an increase of 20% in our
fees received.
Migration to main market listing
There are many additional responsibilities
that we assume as a result of moving from
AIM to the main market. These not only
include a number of existing differences
that are well established, but in addition
from 1st June 2011 we will have to meet
the requirements of the new Corporate
Governance Code.
Rather than attempt to achieve all of the
relevant changes this year (within this
Annual Report and Accounts) we will
complete most of the other requirements
next year, leaving a few of our
responsibilities for the year after. The main
difference in this set of accounts is the new
Corporate Governance Report, which
I’m sure will be expanded over time.
Within this context, I would like to draw
particular attention to our Remuneration
Policy, as it is very different in many
respects from recently released guidelines,
and I think it is important for
shareholders to understand why we
believe that our way is better, at any
rate for us. What follows is some
background plus some core values:
From my experience of the City, when I
consider remuneration and remuneration
packages, I’m taken in the direction of
instability, greed and selfishness. I’m also
taken away from the creation and the
maintenance of a brand.
Picking up on these three points:
Instability, because the existing system seems
to be broken. T urnover of staff around the
City implies that employees do not get
job satisfaction and / or that existing
remuneration packages do not create loyalty.
Greed. The City is made up of many
selfish people who are encouraged by
management, and management’s approach
to remuneration, to develop egotistical
tendencies. This culture of greed, in my
opinion, manifests itself often via a lack of
risk awareness, poor team spirit and
significant key man risk.
Selfishness creates an attitude of negotiation
at the point of salary, bonus and option
notification. At City of London we do not
negotiate any aspect of remuneration.
Selfishness can also be observed when
analysing the extent to which colleagues
train the rest of their team. Again our
senior employees are encouraged to take
responsibility for the training of their team.

If we are genuine in wishing to create a
team culture then there is a need to treat
employees as a team. This in effect means
that we do no t pit them one against
another. Rather we attempt to instil in
them that the competition is outside the
firm, which actually is where it is.
The net result of this is that there is little
intrigue at the point of salary and general
compensation disclosures. Staff accept that
the way it is, is the way it is. If they do not
like it they can leave which sometimes
happens within a year of joining.
I would make the point that directors’
remuneration is disclosed via the Report
and Accounts.
In essence, we are not looking for freedom
fighters. Rather we would say it is better
to appoint decent people, who can
genuinely work in a team environment,
than appoint just no1’s.
We often say, better to appoint a good
no2 who is a decent person than a no1
who is greedy, political and does not
consider the maintenance and
development of the brand.
The net result of the above is that the
Group salary, bonus, and option pool to a
great extent reflects seniority and loyalty.
From time to time, usually quarterly, we
review these three but sometimes two
components. Our recommendations are
forwarded to the Remuneration
Committee which requests substantiation
for recommendations that involve salary
levels in excess of £100,000.
Most quarters we will make a change or
two to reflect changes to our perception
of seniority and loyalty, but I would
emphasise that these are gradualist
alterations and are relatively rare.
In conclusion, and as referenced earlier,
I would suggest that remuneration
packages and the system via which they
are arrived at in the City is broken.
Our system however is not broken.
Our approach has been developed by
management using many years of
experience in the UK and the US.
Like our Risk Controls, our Bonus
Formula and our Dividend and Bonus
relationship, I hope that elements of
what we undertake might one day be
considered best practice.
Recent recommendations regarding best
practice as it relates to Remuneration
include deferred bonus. Is this really the
way to go? Why not pay someone on
time for their work. Or, is this meant to
delay their departure, a sort of enforced
loyalty? Or is it that there is insecurity
regarding the profits that the individual
has created? If this is so then surely the
focus should be on the quantum,
measurement and the quality of the
corporation’s earnings. Either way I
would suggest that deferral of
remuneration is irrelevant in our case.
We are running a cash business where
clients pay us for work undertaken
calculated on a monthly basis.
The other structural weakness that I
would suggest needs to be confronted in
the City is the cult of the individual.
This seems to me to embody the very
volatility of earnings and the extreme risk
taking that was displayed by parts of our
industry over the past few years.
Unfortunately the passage of time does
not seem to have altered what seems to
have become considered best practice.
Staffing and outlook
Over the past year we have taken on
around a dozen additional staff. Staff have
been added primarily in the areas of
Compliance, Fund Management, Fund
Accounting and Performance and
Attribution. In most cases this has been
to accommodate further growth.
As a small boutique with a number of
conservative Core Values, as we grow it
would be very easy to not only
compromise but in some cases forget those
Values. We remain committed to our
brand. We are a small specialist fund
manager positioned at the Performance
end of our industry. We are not seeking
to grow fast, we do not want hot money
and we are as a result not only committed
to but are able to maintain our margins.
T o preserve a culture you have to recruit
and keep the right people, and that
applies at every level because if you get
recruitment right at the junior level you
build for the future. We remain
committed to our team approach and
more specifically, not employing greedy,
selfish people. The employees at City of
London have remained very loyal over a
significant period of time and at the end
of another testing year have much to be
proud of. On behalf of the shareholders
I would like to say that we would like
more of the same over the next few years.
Suffice it to say, the new financial year
has started very well and I would hope
that we will have further progress to
report in a few months time.
The past six months, running up to the
most recent month end of 31st August,
have been the most profitable period that
we have experienced. Operating profit,
measured before profit-share, share option
charges and tax, has averaged close to
£1.4 million per month.
I would like to reiterate my intentions
regarding any sale of shares which remain
unchanged, that is to say that I would
intend, subject to close periods and other
regulatory requirements to sell 375,000
shares at 310p, 500,000 at 350p and
500,000 at 400p. Should these intentions
alter, perhaps as a result of a material
change in market conditions, I will
inform the Board and an appropriate
announcement will be released.

Emerging markets
The first application of our expertise
Emerging Markets as a description of young high growth
economies first appeared in 1981 when only six such markets
(Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand) could be accessed by foreign investors. Today there
are almost 60, including the ‘frontier’ markets that are at
earlier stages of development, with the largest being the so-
called BRIC’s economies – those of Brazil, Russia, India and
China. City of London realised early on that institutional
investors were struggling to access these markets in a
professionally managed, risk-diversified way and that a
product focused on the closed-end funds run by specialist
managers could hold great appeal.
1980s
Investing in emerging markets
becomes an equity play rather than
debt as stock markets open up and
companies in developing economies,
particularly in Asia, begin to raise
equity capital on their local markets.
International investors, attracted by
high growth and increasing liquidity
build positions. Because successful
emerging market investment
requires specialist skills and
knowledge, collective investment
vehicles, including closed-end
funds start to become popular with
all classes of investor. 
1991
In response to growing demand
from institutional investors for
exposure to high growth emerging
markets and the number of closed-
end funds now available, City of
London Group launches the
Emerging Markets T rust, a UK unit
trust with a global remit. This was
one of the first products to access
emerging markets via closed-end
funds, the historic core expertise of
City of London.
1992 – 1996
Investment in emerging markets
booms as more and more countries
reduce controls on foreign direct
investment and growth in
manufacturing output together with
a surge in natural resource prices
significantly increases GDP for the
emerging markets. The high growth
forecast for many countries
encouraged them to borrow heavily
on international markets. During
this period, City of London launches
additional products and successfully
exports its conservative approach to
US institutional investors. City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010 13
1997 – 1998
Asian currency devaluations, led by
Thailand, and severe financial and
structural issues in Russia leading to
default, prompt a collapse in
emerging market stock prices as
international investors attempt to
withdraw and liquidity shrinks. The
downturn, following the boom of
the early and mid 1990s, leads
many investors to question again
the potential volatility of emerging
markets and creates an opportunity
for specialist, risk-averse managers
such as City of London to gain
additional mandates.
2000 – 2007
Lessons were learned by both
companies and governments in
emerging markets. In a period of
cheap money, many reduce
borrowing – with some building
large financial surpluses – and the
boom in commodity prices
particularly benefits the exporters.
Stock prices increase substantially
in the period as emerging
economies’ growth rates
outperform those of developed
economies and investors seek to
add to their holdings.
Emerging markets become a core
asset class in the portfolios of
almost all institutional investors.
2008 to date
The worldwide financial crash saw
emerging markets initially falling
further and faster than many
developed markets as liquidity
shrank and panicked international
investors sought an exit. But the
economic fundamentals of
emerging countries and companies
soon reasserted themselves and
performance to date from the lows
post crash is significantly better
than developed markets. Higher
growth rates are forecast to
continue and transparency and
liquidity to improve further.
Emerging market investment has
become mainstream. 85 basis points throughout the year, a
small reduction from the 87 basis points
average for the previous year. This was due
not to any form of fee erosion but rather
to the relative weightings of segregated
accounts versus commingled funds within
the overall portfolio, the former tending to
attract slightly lower fees in recognition of
the size of the investments.
There is very little to say about investment
income this year, with realised losses of
£0.1m from the liquidation of one seed
investment being offset by a recovery of
similar size against the impairment
previously recognised against another one,
leading to a net zero in rounded terms
(2009: £0.4 million loss). Interest income
rounds up to £0.1 million, having last year
rounded down to that figure.
Administrative expenses of £19.7 million
(2009: £14.5 million) includes the
commissions that we pay against our fee
income, as noted above, which this year
totalled £4.8 million (2009: £3.0 million),
and it includes the 30% of operating
profit that forms the profit-share pool, at
£4.9 million including payroll taxes (2009:
£2.8 million). Stripping out these, plus
custody and administration charges of
£1.1 million (2009: £0.9 million), leaves
core overhead of £8.9 million (2009:£7.8
million), representing a cost-income ratio
of 37% (arrived at by comparing core
overhead to net fee income), a marked
improvement against the previous year’s
figure of 48%, which had of course been
inflated by the extreme market conditions
of September 2008 to March 2009.
Human resource costs continued to form
some 56% of overheads, a percentage
unchanged from 2009 despite a marginal
increase in headcount from 58 to 64, the
latter attributable in part to supporting
new products and in part to the
strengthening of the firm’s Singapore
and Dubai offices.
Pre-tax profit of £10.4 million compares
to £5.4 million for the previous year, the
increase of 93% effectively restoring
profitability to the pre September 2008
level. Tax accounts for nearly 33% of
profit, significantly higher than the 29%
level in 2008-9 as a result of an increased
level of investment activity in the United
States, where federal and state taxes

Consolidated income statement
The financial year started with funds
under management (FuM) of US$3.5
billion, and the market recovery which
had started in early 2009 continued pretty
much uninterrupted through to the end of
November, our half year end, at which
point FuM had reached US$4.9 billion
(including of course the effect of net new
money over the period). Thereafter, FuM
moved within the range US$4.4 billion to
US$4.9 billion for the remainder of the
year, finishing in May at the lower end of
that range. Sterling continued to weaken
against the US dollar as the year
progressed, maintaining a trend that had
started back in January 2008. The average
rate for the year was around 1.59,
compared to around 1.63 for 2008-9
(both figures representing a straight
average of twelve month-end rates), with
the effect that, in sterling terms, FuM rose
almost as a straight line from February
2009 to May 2010. With margins
unchanged from the previous year, this
combination delivered gross fee income of
£30.0 million as against last year’s £20.2
million, an increase of 49%.
The weighted average net fee margin (net
of finder’s commission and of custody and
administration fees as applicable) across all
of the client accounts was stable at around

combined can exceed 40%. Profit after tax

previous year’s £3.8 million.
Consolidated statement of
financial position and statement
of changes in equity
Net assets rose during the year from £8.7
million to £10.6 million, with the main
components offsetting the profit for the
period being the payment of dividends
and the repurchase by the company of a
number of its own shares.
The final dividend for 2008/9 was 10p per
share (2007/8: 13.5p), and the interim for
2009/10 was 7p per share (2008/9: 5p). In
cash terms these dividends amounted to
£2.5 million and £1.7 million respectively
(2008/9: £3.2 million and £1.2 million
respectively), making a total paid in the
year of £4.2 million (2009: £4.4 million).
Opportunities arose during the year to
apply some of the cash which was
considered surplus to the Company’s needs
to the buyback of shares. The following
repurchases were undertaken:
November 2009 143,350 shares at £2.95
November 2009 100,000 shares at £3.0175
April 2010 439,000 shares at £2.65
The first two purchases were undertaken
by the Company’s ESOP , whereas the
shares purchased in April were bought by
the Company itself and were cancelled,
thereby enhancing earnings per share for
the remaining shareholders. In total,
including transaction costs, the cash outlay
on shares was £1.9 million, of which £0.7
million was in the form of an increase in
the loan from the Company to the ESOP .
With respect to share options, the exercise
by directors and employees of 426,200
dilutive options and 271,842 ESOP held
options during the course of the year
generated £0.4 million (2009: £0.3
million), and left at the end of the year
1,446,447 dilutive options and 1,427,533
ESOP options outstanding (2009:
1,872,647 and 1,262,375 respectively).
The increase in net assets was applied, in the
main, to the diversification of the business, by
setting aside a further £2.8 million (net) as
seed funding for new products. Three new
funds were created, two as US Delaware
Statutory T rusts and one as a new sub fund
under the Dublin Open End Investment
Company umbrella structure. As at 31st May
these new funds, plus the pre-existing Natural
Resources sub fund in Dublin, represented a
total investment of £3.6 million (2009: £0.4
million), with the balance of the increase over
the year representing an uplift in market
value of £0.4 million, which is reflected in the
increase in the revaluation reserve.
Cash was virtually unchanged year on year
at £4.8 million (2009: £4.7 million), and
similarly the deferred tax asset of £1.5
million and share option reserve of £1.7
million were only marginally different from
the prior year’s figures of £1.6 million and
£1.8 million respectively, despite the
increase in the Company’s share price from
£2.285 to £2.81 over the year.
Currency exposure
The Company’s approach to currency
exposure is unchanged from previous years
but it is worth revisiting the parameters
each year and so I make no apologies for
doing so again.
At first glance, the starting point would
appear to be that as the Group’s income is
earned almost exclusively in US$, based as
it is upon a percentage of FuM which is
itself US$ denominated (with minor
exceptions), there is a significant exposure
to the value of the US$. In truth though,
it is worth going back one stage, to see
that the level of FuM in US$ terms is itself
a function of the predominantly emerging
market currencies that underlie the
investments of our managed funds and
client accounts. Accordingly, as the US$
strengthens against these currencies the
level of FuM will tend to fall, and of
course conversely as the US$ weakens
FuM in US$ terms will rise.
The significance from an earnings
perspective is that, at a given level of FuM
in US$ terms, the fee income generated in
reported sterling terms will rise and fall as
the US$ strengthens and weakens
respectively. The net effect of this is that
in very general terms a weak US$ will
provide uplift to FuM but the effect on fee
income will be offset or perhaps nullified
by the translation to sterling. T o put this
another way, it is in reality the relationship
of sterling to the underlying investment
currencies that influences the reported
earnings, with the US$ being principally
a conduit for the transaction. As emerging
currencies strengthen relative to sterling,
reported earnings will tend to rise, and of
course the reverse is true.
Despite this, given that FuM is
denominated and presented in US$, it is
still relevant to consider the table below,
which is included in this statement every
year, as a guide to how the fluctuation of
the US$/£ rate potentially impacts
earnings at any given level of FuM:
Post-Tax Profit: illustration of US$/£

1.60 5.5 6.7 7.9 9.2
1.65 5.2 6.4 7.6 8.8
Assumes:
1. Average net fee 85 basis points
2. Annual operating costs £4.5 million plus 
US$8.2 million
3. Profit-share 30%
4. Average tax of 33%
The table shows annualised profit figures
given the assumptions/conditions
described, which approximate very closely
to the Company’s operating environment.
T o take an example, at FuM of US$5.0
billion and an exchange rate of 1.50 the
annualised profit would be expected to be
around £8.6 million, whereas at an
exchange rate of 1.40 the expectation
would increase to around £9.4 million.
As a separate point on currency exposure,
the Company maintains a programme of
forward sales of US$ with a view to
eliminating or minimising the Group’s
balance sheet exposure to exchange rate
risk, and at 31st May these forward sales
amounted to a total of US$6.5 million at
an average rate of 1.5973 (2009: $3.6
million at an average of 1.7694).

Natural resources
A core sector for closed-end funds and
emerging markets
The global natural resources sector has been a key focus for
investing in both closed-end funds and emerging markets
for many years. It is a sector we have always understood and
researched, making it one of the first choices for beginning
to diversify the Group’s product range. Our investment
activity in emerging markets brings us detailed knowledge
of a whole range of resources from oil and gas, metals,
minerals and diamonds to grain, coffee and cocoa, and
forestry. With end-user economies generally ‘resource-poor’
in many commodities, we believe the long term prospects
for investment products in this area to be attractive.
19th century
Investors flocked to the natural
resource booms of the nineteenth
century – the California Gold
Rush, T exas and Arabian oil
discoveries and metals and minerals
throughout Africa and South
America. Many of the earliest
investment trusts were targeted at
these opportunities as well as those
closer to home such as Cornish tin.
Industrialisation had by the end of
the century created vast appetites
for natural resources and motor
transport and electricity would
enlarge these even further. 
1900 – 1973
The insatiable demand for natural
resources continued to mushroom
through economic cycles, two
world wars and the rise in
developed economies of the
consumer society, which increased
still further the demand for energy
and raw materials. By the end of
the period, developed economies
were reliant for some or all of their
requirements on emerging, less
developed economies, having
depleted much of their own
resources. In energy, the step
change came with the oil price
shock of 1973 when the oil
exporting countries seized pricing
power from consuming nations.
1970s
The sharply increased oil prices
resulted in a renewed focus on
‘safe’, that is politically safe, sources
of oil and gas in particular. In the
UK, that meant the North Sea.
After a number of commercial gas
discoveries in the southern North
Sea in the late 1960s, BP discovered
the giant Forties oil field in 1970.
As the decade progressed, many
new oil discoveries were to follow City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010 17
and a new independent, and often
publicly traded, sector of oil and gas
exploration and production
companies grew up.
1980s
Following the first boom in mineral
exploration in Australia in the
1960s, the late 1980s saw a second
boom of even larger proportions,
beginning a trend of larger and
larger scale projects that continues
today. Coal, iron ore, copper and
uranium were discovered in size and
it was the exports of iron ore that
began to underpin China’s
emergence as a manufacturing
powerhouse. The downside for
Australia’s own manufacturing
industry was the steady rise in the
Australian dollar making
competition in international
markets more and more difficult.
1990s
The decade saw the arrival, largely
through consolidation, of the
mining and oil majors with
operations spanning the globe and
the financial resources to fund,
develop and operate the very largest
projects. Around these projects
grew up a host of locally based
independents and service suppliers
and by the end of the decade the
‘natural resources’ sector was among
the biggest in the world, if not the
biggest, on a number of measures.
T oday
With much of the world’s
remaining natural resources
contained within emerging markets,
the two sectors have become
inextricably entwined. The
industrial growth of China, India,
Brazil and Russia is driving
commodity demand and prices and
growing, in turn, the GDP of
resource exporting countries.
Debates still rage over the effect 
of resource booms on emerging
economies, in terms of focus,
equality and governance but as 
long as demand continues to grow,
natural resources will remain an
attractive sector for investors. Board of directors

20 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010
The Combined Code
While AIM listed companies are not strictly bound by the provisions of the June 2008 FRC Combined Code (the “Combined
Code”), the Board recognises the importance of good corporate practice and is committed to maintaining high standards of
corporate governance throughout the firm, and accordingly stated at the time of the AIM listing that its intention was to abide by
the principles of the Combined Code and to meet the specific requirements to the extent appropriate for a company of this size,
nature and stage of development. More recently, the Company has announced its intention to move the listing of its shares to the
main market, whereupon the Combined Code (and in due course the Corporate Governance Code June 2010) will formally apply.
The Board of directors
The Board now comprises four executive directors and four non-executive directors, following the resignation of Omar Ashur on
14th August 2010. Certain matters are reserved for the consideration and approval of the Board, principally:
• Group long term objectives and strategy
• Corporate announcements, including annual and interim reports
• Dividend policy
• Share buy-back policy
• Effectiveness of compliance
• Effectiveness of internal controls
• Annual budget
• Acquisitions
• Capital expenditure in excess of £100,000
• Board appointments
The role of the Chairman is to lead the board and ensure its effectiveness, and to oversee shareholder communications. The Chief
Executive Officer’s role is to achieve execution of group strategy through day to day management, and to communicate strategy and
performance to the shareholders.
Committees
The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nominations Committee (each comprising of at
least three non-executive directors, who will invite other members of the Board to join meetings as appropriate) with formally
delegated duties and responsibilities.
The Audit Committee meets at least twice each year and is responsible for monitoring the quality of internal control, ensuring that
the financial performance of the Group is properly measured and reported on, meeting with the auditors and reviewing reports from
the auditors relating to accounting and internal controls. The finance director is invited to attend meetings but the committee meets
with the auditors at least once a year without the finance director being present.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of executive directors and sets the scale and structure of their remuneration
and reviews the basis of their service agreements with due regard to the interests of the shareholders. The Remuneration Committee
also makes recommendations to the Board concerning the allocation of share options to executive directors and employees. It also
reviews individual compensation at salary levels in excess of £100,000. The remuneration and terms of appointment of non-
executive directors is set by the Board. The Group has a remuneration policy, the aim of which is to provide, in the context of the
Group’s business strategy, remuneration that will attract and retain high calibre executives and staff. In order to achieve this, total
rewards are set at levels that are competitive within the relevant market. Rewards are earned through the achievement of objectives
based on measures consistent with shareholder interests.
The Nominations Committee is responsible for reviewing and proposing appointments to the Board and the various Board
committees. In addition, the committee has responsibility for reviewing the composition of the Board and for selecting candidates
for appointment, to meet the desired composition. City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010 21

Company Secretary
9th September 2010 Statement of directors’ responsibilities
26 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010
The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these
financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the
financial statement;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions. Independent auditors’ report to the shareholders
of City of London Investment Group Plc
City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010 27
We have audited the financial statements of City of London Investment Group Plc for the year ended 31st May 2010 which comprises
the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated and Company statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated and
Company statement of financial position, the Consolidated and Company statement of changes in equity, the Consolidated and
Company cash flow statements and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the
Parent Company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 26, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors;
and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31st May 2010
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 31st May 2010
1 Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted
by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
(a) New IFRS Standards and Interpretations
The Group adopted the following during the year:
IAS 1 (revised 2007) “Presentation of financial statements”. The amendments make certain changes to the format and titles of
the primary financial statements and to the presentation of some items within these statements. Some items that were recognised
directly in equity are now recognised in other comprehensive income. IAS 1 affects the presentation of owner changes in equity
and introduces a “Statement of comprehensive income”.
IFRS 7 “Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments”. The amendments to IFRS 7 expand the disclosures required in
respect of the fair value measurements of financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position. The Group has
elected not to provide comparative information for these expanded disclosures in the current year in accordance with the
transitional reliefs offered in these amendments.
IFRS 8 “Operating Segments”. The adoption of IFRS 8 requires the disclosure of segment reporting as reviewed by
management. The Group is managed as a single business unit, namely asset management, and therefore only has a single
reportable segment.
There is also a requirement for an entity-wide disclosure of revenues from external customers and certain non-current assets
attributable to the Group’s country of domicile and foreign countries. The Group allocates revenue based on the domicile of its
clients and non-current assets based on where the assets are held. Any individual client generating revenue of 10% or more
would be disclosed separately, as would assets in a foreign country if they are material.
Under IFRS 8 the only change for the Group is a more detailed analysis of the countries to which revenue is attributed.
Previously just three geographical locations were reported; Europe, North America and Other.
Comparative segmental information has been restated accordingly.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which are relevant to the
Group, were in issue but not yet effective:
IAS 1 (revised) Presentation of financial statements – Minor changes to reporting of other comprehensive income effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2011. IAS 1 will also be amended by the changes noted
below in IFRS 9.
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures – Amendments effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January
2011 relating to clarification of qualitative and quantitative disclosures and removal of references to materiality
in relation to risk. In addition, IFRS 7 will also be amended by the changes noted below in IFRS 9. In
particular the disclosures by category of financial asset will be altered to reflect the new categorisation.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments – Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1st January 2013. This is the first part of
a new standard on classification and measurement of financial assets that will replace IAS 39. IFRS 9 replaces the
four categories of financial assets with two; those carried at amortised cost and those at fair value. The Group will
need to consider how it wishes to reclassify its financial assets, in particular those currently classified as available-
for-sale. The Group’s approach will determine the impact of the new standard on the financial statements.
There are a number of other Standards and Interpretations, and revisions to existing Standards and Interpretations, including the
2008 improvements project, in issue but not in force at 31st May 2010. These are not considered likely to have a material
impact on the Group’s financial statements. City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010 33
1 Basis of accounting continued
(b) Basis of consolidation and preparation
These financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings.
The Company’s principal subsidiaries are City of London Investment Management Company Limited and City of London
US Services Limited, all other subsidiaries being dormant at 31st May 2010.
The Company is domiciled in the UK and its shares are issued in sterling. The functional currency of the business is however
US Dollars. Management have decided that the presentational currency of the financial statements should be sterling rather than
the functional currency due to the Company being a UK registered entity.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain financial
instruments as outlined in point (c) (iii) on page 34.
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Whilst estimates are
based on management’s best knowledge and judgement using information and financial data available to them, the actual
outcome may differ from those estimates.
The most significant areas of the financial statements that are subject to the use of estimates and assumptions are noted below:
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in different jurisdictions. There are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from
the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in
which such determination is made.
Share-based payments
In order to calculate the charge for share-based compensation as required by IFRS 2, the Group makes estimates principally
relating to the assumptions used in its option pricing model. Details of these assumptions are outlined in note 24.
Intangible assets
The useful economic life of intangible assets, such as computer software, is determined on acquisition using value in use
calculations based on management’s assumptions and estimates of future cash flows as well as other cost/benefit factors.
The principal accounting polices adopted are set out below and have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all
periods presented in these accounts. In addition, where presentational changes are made in the current year, the prior year figures
are also updated to present a true comparative.
(c) Significant accounting policies
(i) Property and equipment
For all property and equipment depreciation is calculated to write off their cost to their estimated residual values by equal
annual instalments over the period of their estimated useful lives, which are considered to be:
Short leasehold property improvements – over the remaining life of the lease
Furniture and equipment – four years
Computer and telephone equipment – four years
(ii) Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight line basis. Amortisation charges are
spread over the useful life of the asset as follows:
Long term software licences – ten years
This represents a perpetual licence for the Group’s fund accounting system which is being brought in-house. The directors
consider ten years as a reasonable estimate of useful life given the improved control and flexibility to manage and develop the
software in-house. Notes to the financial statements

(iii) Financial instruments
Under IAS 39, “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”, financial assets must be classified as either:
• Loans and receivables
• Held-to-maturity investments
• Available-for-sale financial assets
• At fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities must be classified at fair value through profit or loss or at amortised cost.
The Group’s investments in the funds that it manages are designated as available-for-sale financial assets. Such investments are
initially recognised at fair value, being the consideration given together with any acquisition costs associated with the investment.
They are subsequently carried at fair value, with any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value included as part of other
comprehensive income. Fair value is determined using the price based on the net asset value of the fund. Investments are
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group
has transferred all risks and rewards of ownership. When derecognition occurs a realised profit or loss is recognised in the income
statement, calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the original cost of the financial asset. Any fair value
gains or losses previously recognised as part of other comprehensive income are recycled into the income statement as part of this
calculation of the profit or loss arising on derecognition.
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is
impaired. In the case of an investment classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the
investment below its cost is considered as an indicator that the investment is impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-
for-sale investments, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value,
less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the income statement – is removed from other
comprehensive income and recognised in the income statement.
The Group’s investments in derivatives are designated as financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such
investments are initially recognised at fair value, and are subsequently remeasured at fair value, with any movement recognised in
the income statement. The fair value of the derivatives held by the Group is determined as follows:
• Options – priced using the quoted market bid price
• Forward currency trades – priced using prevailing exchange rates
The only exception is where the Group holds an investment in options on unquoted equity instruments. Such investments are
designated as available-for-sale financial assets and are measured at cost less impairment on the grounds that the fair value can
not be reliably measured and the cost of the investment of $75,000 is not considered to be material.
The Group’s investments have been classified here for recognition and measurement purposes under IAS39 but are not
necessarily reported in the statement of financial position under those headings. A table showing how they are reported is shown
in note 26.
(iv) T rade receivables
T rade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently carried at the lower of original fair value
and their recoverable amount. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income
statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
(v) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand, deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, and
other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value. City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010 35
1 Basis of accounting continued
(vi) T rade payables
T rade payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
(vii) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes. However, deferred tax is not
accounted for if it arises from goodwill or the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets or
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the accounting nor the taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
The tax rates used are those that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax is
charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly as part of other
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with as part of other comprehensive income. For share-based
payments, where the estimated future tax deduction exceeds the amount of the related cumulative remuneration expense, the
excess deferred tax is recognised directly in equity.
(viii) Share-based payments
The Company operates an Employee Share Option Plan. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for share
options is recognised as an expense. The fair value has been calculated using the Binomial pricing model, and has then been
expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the number of shares that will
actually vest.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS2, the above treatment has been applied only to grants of share options
after 7th November 2002 that had not vested as at 1st June 2006, although, as required by IFRS2, the disclosures in note 24(b)
include grants of share options prior to 7th November 2002.
(ix) Revenue
Revenue comprises investment management fees earned. Fees are based on a percentage of Funds under Management and are
recognised in revenue as the investment management services are provided, in accordance with the underlying agreements.
(x) Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Foreign exchange gains
and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of period-end monetary assets and
liabilities are recognised in the income statement.
The functional currency of the Group’s main trading subsidiaries, City of London Investment Management Company Limited
and City of London US Services Limited, is US dollars. The functional currency of City of London Investment Group Plc
(the “Company”) is sterling. The Group uses sterling as the presentation currency. Under IAS 21 this means that exchange
differences caused from translating from the functional currency to presentational currency for the main trading subsidiaries
would be recognised in equity. However, the Group operates a policy whereby the foreign exchange positions of the subsidiaries
are sold to the Company and therefore it is the only entity with any exchange differences. As such any exchange differences
arising in the Company are “real” in that the functional currency matches the presentational currency. This means that all such
exchange differences are included in the income statement and no split is required between other comprehensive income and
the income statement. Notes to the financial statements

(xi) Leases
The cost of operating leases is charged to the income statement in equal periodic instalments over the periods of the leases.
(xii) Pensions
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes covering the majority of its employees. The costs of the pension
schemes are charged to the income statement as they are incurred.

10 Earnings per share
The calculation of earnings per share is based on the profit for the period of £6,982,782 (2009 – £3,846,783) divided by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the year ended 31st May 2010 of 24,491,592 (2009 – 23,844,801).
As set out in Note 20, the Employee Benefit T rust held 1,589,158 ordinary shares in the Company as at 31st May 2010. The
T rustees of the T rust have waived all rights to dividends associated with these shares. In accordance with IAS 33 the ordinary shares
held by the Employee Benefit T rust have been excluded from the calculation of the weighted average of ordinary shares in issue.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year of £6,982,782 (2009 – £3,846,783) divided by
the diluted weighted average of ordinary shares for the year ended 31st May 2010 of 25,953,758 (2009 – 25,587,418).

Historically, the expected life of the options has been assumed to be three years, however this assumption has been revised for
the latest grants to six and a half years based upon the empirical evidence available. The risk-free rate has been assumed to be
represented by the yield to maturity at the date of grant of a UK Gilt strip with term to maturity equal to the expected life of
the option. Historically, the volatility of the Company’s share price at each date of grant has been calculated as the average of the
standard deviations of daily continuously compounded returns on the stock of a group of comparable companies. Now that
there is sufficient share price data for the Company it has been possible to calculate its expected volatility and this has been used
to calculate the fair value of awards granted on and after 5th June 2009.

(ii) Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value,
grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
• Level 1: fair value derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 2: fair value derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the assets or
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
• Level 3: fair value derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on
observable market data.
The fair values of the financial instruments are determined as follows:
• Investments in own funds are determined with reference to the net asset value (NAV) of the fund. Where the NAV is a
quoted price the fair value is shown under level 1, where the NAV is not a quoted price the fair value is shown under level 2.
• Forward currency trades are valued using the prevailing quoted exchange rates and are shown under level 2.
The level within which the financial asset or liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input to
the fair value measurement.

Total 1,816,491 1,797,666 – 3,614,157
There were no transfers between any of the levels in the reporting period.
All fair value gains and losses included in other comprehensive income relate to the investment in own funds.
Where there is an impairment in the investment in own funds the loss is reported in the income statement. Due to improved
market conditions, the Group has written back £159,418 of the £238,790 impairment charge recognised in 2009.
The fair value loss on the forward currency trades is offset in the income statement by the foreign exchange gain on other currency
assets and liabilities held during the year and at year end. The net gain reported for the year is £177,664 (2009 – net loss £94,256).
(iii) Foreign currency risk
Most of the Group’s revenues, and a significant part of its expenses, are denominated in currencies other than sterling,
principally US and Canadian Dollars. These revenues are derived from fee income which is based upon the net asset value of
accounts managed, and have the benefit of a natural hedge by reference to the underlying currencies in which investments are
held. Inevitably, debtor and creditor balances arise which in turn give rise to currency exposure. Each of the Group’s subsidiaries
eliminates its currency exposure by transfer to the holding company. All hedging activity is therefore assessed at the Group level.
Forward foreign exchange transactions are executed so as to substantially reduce the Group’s exposure to currency market
movements. The level of forward currency hedging is such as is judged by the directors to be consistent with market conditions.
As at 31st May 2010, the Group had net asset balances of US$6,854,423 (2009 – US$4,422,628), offset by forward sales
totalling US$6,500,000 (2009 – US$3,600,000), and net asset balances of C$411,851 (2009 – C$371,190).
Had the US Dollar strengthened or weakened against Sterling as at 31st May 2010 by 10%, with all other variables held
constant, there would have been no material impact on the Group’s net assets, because the US Dollar position net of forward
sales is minimal.
Further details on the effects on the Group’s post-tax profits due to movements in the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate have
been demonstrated in the Financial review on page 15.
(iv) Market risk
Changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and equity prices will affect the Group’s income and the value of its
investments.
The Group is, from time to time, exposed to market risk directly via its investment holdings and indirectly via its assets under
management, from which its fee income is derived. To hedge against any potential loss in fee income due to a fall in the
markets, the Group will look to invest in out of the money put options on the emerging markets index. The purchase and sale
of these options are subject to limits established by the Board and are monitored on a regular basis. The investment management
and settlement functions are totally segregated.
The cost of hedging recognised in the Group income statement for the period is £32,027 (2009 – income £21,194). 50 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010
Notes to the financial statements

26 Financial instruments continued
(v) Credit risk
The majority of debtors relate to management fees due from funds and segregated account holders. As such the Group is able to
assess the credit risk of these debtors as minimal. For other debtors a credit evaluation is undertaken on a case by case basis.
The Group has zero experience of bad or overdue debts.
The majority of cash and cash equivalents held by the Group are with leading UK banks. The credit risk is managed by carrying
out regular reviews of each institution’s credit rating and of their published financial position. Given their high credit ratings,
management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
(vi) Liquidity risk
The Group’s liquidity risk is minimal due to the liquidity profile of its debtors and creditors being evenly matched and its
strategy to maximise its cash position. In addition, the Group’s current available-for-sale assets represent investments in funds
that it manages and can be liquidated immediately if required.
(vii) Interest rate risk
The Group has no borrowings, and therefore has no exposure to interest rate risk other than that which attaches to its interest
earning cash balances and forward currency contracts. The Group’s strategy is to maximise the amount of cash which is
maintained in interest bearing accounts, and to ensure that those accounts attract a competitive interest rate. At 31st May 2010
the Group held £4,774,473 (2009 – £4,718,766) in cash balances, of which £4,168,469 (2009 – £4,693,287) was held in bank
accounts which attract variable interest rates. The effect of a 100 basis points increase/decrease in interest rates on the Group’s net
assets would not be material.
(viii) Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that all entities within the Group are able to operate as going concerns and exceed any
minimum externally imposed capital requirements. The capital of the Group and Company consists of equity attributable to the
equity holders of the Parent Company, comprising issued share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves as
disclosed in the statement of changes in equity on page 30.
The Group’s principal operating subsidiary company, City of London Investment Management Company Ltd is subject to the
requirements of the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) in the UK. This subsidiary held surplus capital over its requirements
throughout the year.  City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010 51

1. A member entitled to receive notice, attend and vote at the annual general meeting (“AGM”) is entitled to appoint a proxy or
proxies to attend and, on a poll, vote instead of him. Such proxy need not be a member of the Company. Completion of a form
of proxy does not preclude the member attending the meeting and voting in person if they so wish. To be valid, the instrument
appointing a proxy, together, if appropriate, with a power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a
notarially certified copy of such authority, must be deposited at the offices of the Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, PXS,
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU no later than 11.30 am on 23rd October 2010. A form of proxy
accompanies this notice.
2. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the time by which a person must be entered on the
register of members of the Company in order to have the right to attend and vote at the annual general meeting (and for the
purposes of the determination by the Company of the numbers of votes they may cast) is 6.00 pm on 23rd October 2010.
The rights of members to attend and vote at the meeting will be determined by reference to entries on the register of members
at 6.00 pm on 23rd October 2010. Changes to entries on the register of members of the Company after that time will be
disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
3. In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that
(i) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with instructions to
vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the
meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will
vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and
(ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate
shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate
representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other
corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative. Corporate shareholders are
referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate
representatives – www.icsa.org.uk – for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of
representation letter if the Chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above.
4. The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose ordinary shares are held on their behalf by another person and
who have been nominated to receive communication from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Companies Act
2006 (‘nominated persons’). Nominated persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered shareholder who holds
shares on their behalf to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if nominated persons do not
have such a right, or do not wish to exercise it, they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the person
holding the ordinary shares as to the exercise of voting rights.
5. In the case of joint holders, the signature of only one of the joint holders is required on the form of proxy, but the vote of the
first named on the register of members will be accepted to the exclusion of the other joint holders.
6. The following documents are available for inspection between 10.00 am and 12.00 noon at the registered office of the Company
on any weekday and will also be available for inspection at the place of the AGM from the commencement of the meeting until
the conclusion thereof:
(a) The register of interests of the directors (and their families) in the share capital of the Company.
(b) Copies of the directors’ contracts of service and letters of appointment of the non-executive directors.
(c) Terms of reference of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
(d) Copies of the Company’s articles of association. Explanation of the business of the Annual General Meeting
54 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010
Report and accounts (Resolution 1)
The first item on the agenda requires that the directors must present the accounts of the Company for the year ended 31st May
2010 together with the directors’ report and the independent auditors’ report thereon.
Re-appointment of directors (Resolutions 2 – 5)
Articles 132 and 137 of the Company’s articles of association require that at each annual general meeting, any director who has been
in office for more than three years shall retire by rotation and that any director who has been appointed by the directors since the
last annual general meeting of the Company will stand for re-appointment. In addition, such further directors (if any) shall retire by
rotation as would bring the number retiring by rotation up to one-third of the number of directors in office as at 9th September 2010
(or if their number is not a multiple of three, the number nearest to but not greater than one third).
Article 138 of the Company’s articles of association requires that a resolution for the appointment or re-appointment of two or more
persons as directors by a single resolution may not be moved unless a resolution that it shall be so moved has first been agreed to by
the meeting without any vote being given against it. Consequently separate resolutions will be put to the meeting.
Section A.7.2 of the Combined Code (which is replaced by Section B.7.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code for financial years
beginning on or after 29th June 2010) provides that non-executive directors may serve longer than nine years (e.g. three three year
terms), subject to annual re-election.
Brief biographical details of all the directors may be found on page 19 of the annual report.
Re-appointment of auditors (Resolution 6)
The Company is required at each general meeting at which its annual accounts and reports are laid before the shareholders (an
“accounts meeting”) to appoint auditors for the next financial year to hold office from the conclusion of that accounts meeting until
the conclusion of the next accounts meeting. Moore Stephens LLP are the current auditors and have indicated their willingness to
continue in office. If Resolution 6 is passed, Moore Stephens LLP will be re-appointed as auditors to the Company for the financial
year ending 31st May 2011, at a fee to be agreed by the board of directors.
Authority to allot shares (Resolution 7) 
Resolution 7 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution, in accordance with section 551 of the Companies Act 2006, to authorise
the directors generally to allot shares and rights over shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £86,500.00 representing
approximately one third of the existing issued ordinary share capital as at the date of this resolution.
Such authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2011, unless renewed, varied or revoked
by the Company prior to or on that date.
Disapplication of pre-emption rights (Resolution 8) 
Resolution 8 will be proposed as a special resolution, in accordance with section 570 of the Companies Act 2006, to authorise the
directors of the Company to allot a limited number of shares for cash other than on a pre-emptive basis, up to an aggregate nominal
value of £13,000.00, representing approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital at the time of this resolution. This authority
will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2011, unless renewed, varied or revoked by the Company
prior to or on that date.
Your Board of Directors is aware of the institutional guidelines which state that no more than 7.5% of a company’s ordinary share
capital should be issued for cash on a non pre- emptive basis in any three year rolling period. Over the last three years, the directors
have not allotted shares for cash on a non pre-emptive basis other than pursuant to employee share schemes. City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2010 55
Purchase by the Company of its own shares (Resolution 9)
Under section 701 of the Companies Act 2006, the directors of a company may make market purchases of that company’s shares if
authorised to do so. The Company’s articles of association give a general authority to the directors to purchase shares on the market
but that authority is subject to the approval of shareholders. Your directors believe that granting such approval would be in the best
interests of shareholders in allowing directors the flexibility to react promptly to circumstances requiring market purchases.
Accordingly, Resolution 9, which will be proposed as a special resolution, will give the directors the authority to purchase issued
shares of the Company under section 701 of the Companies Act 2006. The authority contained in this Resolution will be limited to
an aggregate nominal value of £25,965 which represents approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as
at the current time. The price which may be paid for those shares is also restricted as set out in the Resolution. This authority will
expire at the conclusion of the Company’s annual general meeting in 2011 or on 25th April 2012 (whichever is the earlier).
The board has no present intention of exercising this authority. However, this will be kept under review, and the board will use this
power only if and when, taking account of market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate
gearing levels and the overall financial position of the Group, they believe that the effect of such purchases will be in the best
interests of shareholders generally and that they will result in an increase in earnings per share.
Shares purchased under this authority may be held as treasury shares. The Company may purchase and hold shares as treasury shares
up to a maximum amount equal to 10% of the nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital at that time, rather than cancelling
them. Shares held in treasury do not carry voting rights and no dividends will be paid on any such shares. Shares held in treasury in
this way can be sold for cash or cancelled. This would allow the Company to manage its capital base more effectively and to
replenish its distributable reserves.
If and when the board resolves to exercise its authority to make market purchases, it will at that time decide whether shares
purchased are to be cancelled or held in treasury. Professional advisers

Bloomsbury Publishing Plc has established
itself as one of the world’s leading independent
publishing houses with a reputation for a high
quality publishing team and a highly valuable
portfolio of intellectual properties.
Throughout our twenty two years history Bloomsbury Publishing
has never lost sight of its founding principles:
Publishing books of excellence and originality. 
We have a strong balance sheet with in excess of
£50 million on deposit, and, though investment
income will be less than in 2008 due to the
reduction in interest rates, we are in a good
position to expand our academic division, 
as we make new acquisitions, and to pursue
organic growth for our existing divisions.

Chairman’s Statement
The transformation of Bloomsbury
continued in 2008 as it re-balances
its business in the wake of the
Harry Potter phenomenon and of
the demands of a global recession.
The Chief Executive’s statement
outlines the considerable work done
by him and the Executive members

growing potential of electronic 
and digital publishing, whilst
ensuring stability and efficiency 
in the Group’s traditional 
publishing business.

The transformation of Bloomsbury continued in 2008
as it re-balances its business in the wake of the Harry
Potter phenomenon and of the demands of a global
recession. The Chief Executive’s statement outlines
the considerable work done by him and the Executive
members of the Board in managing their business
units as they exploit the growing potential of
electronic and digital publishing, whilst ensuring
stability and efficiency in the Group’s traditional
publishing business.
This process of change is not complete, indeed 
such change, especially at times of economic stress,
tends to accelerate, but the performance of the Group
reflects the drive behind development of the new, 
and the rigour in management of the old. In the teeth
of the worst recession in living memory, the shape of
Bloomsbury is being changed to ensure the long-term
success of the Group.
Bloomsbury has a strong balance sheet. Cash is
critical at a time like this; it allows the Group latitude
for change, and for judicious and timely acquisitions to
strengthen its traditional businesses and to build new
technology-based publishing activities. It also takes
away the damaging distraction of untoward debt
management now preoccupying the Boards and
managements of many of its competitors and peers.
The Group’s obligation to all its stakeholders at a 
time like this is to avoid the excesses of acquisition
strategies which squander a valuable asset, and to
use its resources wisely to position it for the
economic recovery. The Board therefore regularly
reviews new acquisition prospects, judging the
relative impacts of the return of the Group’s cash
asset against the returns of new business assets
whose capital values are far from certain in current
conditions and could rapidly undermine any perceived
short- or long-term profit enhancement. Information
on the acquisitions it has made and the organic
growth initiatives of the Group are outlined in more
detail in this report.
The Executive team is both experienced and
committed to the long-term future of Bloomsbury.
These are proving to be invaluable human assets 
at a time when short-term opportunism has damaged
the values of companies across the commercial
spectrum. Nigel Newton, Founder and Chief Executive
of the Company over its 22 years, has deployed his
own talents and those of Richard Charkin and Colin
Adams to maximise the strengths of each, and
greater emphasis has been placed on the Board
Committees to exploit the role of the Non-Executive
Directors through the key functions of the Audit,
Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
This Group has an enviable reputation and brand 
value in and outside publishing. Those owe a great
deal to the professionalism and dedication of its staff,
including some of the most respected professionals 
in the industry. Whether recruited to support the
growing new businesses of the Group, or forming
part of that long-standing and committed community
behind the long history of Bloomsbury’s component
parts, they have worked tirelessly and loyally through
conditions more challenging than any can remember.
Those conditions are not over yet and the Board 
and all the Group’s stakeholders owe them a strong
vote of thanks for the role they play in the future 
of Bloomsbury.

Overview
I am pleased to report an excellent set of results for
the year. In making comparison to 2007 , it is important
to remember that the 2007 results included the
launch of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the
last volume of JK Rowling’s series, one of the highest
selling books in publishing history. During 2008 the
Group was restructured into two overarching
divisions: Specialist and Trade. This was done to
provide greater focus on the two key strands of 
80971 PRE 1:80971 Bloomsbury Pre 1  21/4/09  18:20  Page 8 Bloomsbury Publishing Plc
09
our business and to ensure that the intellectual
property within each division is exploited to its
maximum potential across all territories in which
those divisions operate. At the same time, and as part
of this change in operating structure, we identified
and implemented significant annualised cost savings
net of expansion activities of approximately £2m.
Managing the Group’s cost base continues to be 
a high priority.
Bloomsbury had the two highest selling books of the
year in the Times list of Top Bestsellers of 2008 and
three of the top ten. A Thousand Splendid Suns was
number one, The Tales of Beedle the Bard, published
by the Children’s High Level Group charity, was
number two, and The Kite Runner was number eight.
In 2008 overall sales by value in the UK publishing
industry, through UK retail outlets as tracked by
Nielsen BookScan, showed a year-on-year decline of
1.5%, but a slight increase if Harry Potter is excluded
from the 2007 figures. Other geographical markets
have shown similar trends, although the relative value
for money represented by books has mitigated the
impact of overall consumer spending restraint.
Of greater concern than sales value is the threat to
retailers and the potential reduction of outlets for
book sales. To date, the only significant casualties 
in the UK have been Zavvi and the Woolworths 
Group, but a number of other customers in overseas
territories have also failed. We have so far avoided
material damage from these insolvencies and 
have benefited from our credit insurance where
appropriate. 
It has also been pleasing that both Bloomsbury USA
and Berlin Verlag recorded profits in difficult markets. 
Technology for the marketing and delivery of books 
is having an impact on the industry and opening 
up medium-term opportunities for new income
streams and more effective customer contact. We 
are embracing these changes on many fronts and 
in particular now have a comprehensive digital 
archive for exploitation.

Directors’ Report-Business Review
Chief Executive’s Statement
Financial performance
Revenue for the Group was £99.95m (2007 , £150.21m).
In 2007 we published Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows which made a significant contribution during
that financial year. Revenues from Continental Europe,
which were generated by Berlin Verlag, increased
35.6% to £11.57m (2007 , £8.53m). Revenues from the
US operations increased by 29.4% to £17 .32m 
(2007 , £13.39m). 
Profit before tax for the Group was £11.63m 
(2007 , £17 .86m). Basic earnings per share was 
10.67 pence (2007 , 16.06 pence). Diluted earnings 
per share was 10.67 pence (2007 , 15.63 pence).
At the year end the Group had increased its net cash
balances to £51.91m (2007 , £47 .56m) after the net
cash consideration of £7 .43m (2007 , £0.08m) paid 
for the four acquisitions made during the reporting
period. We continue to invest in future growth through
acquiring new authors, new titles and specialist
publishing companies. Our strong balance sheet 
puts us in an excellent position to take advantage 
of these opportunities as they arise. As at 
31 December 2008, the Group had under contract
1,139 titles (2007 , 1,240) for future publication, with
a gross investment of £26.44m (2007 , £27 .58m). 
After payment of the initial tranches of advances 
to authors, our liability for future cash payments 
on these contracted titles at that date was £15.60m
(2007 , £16.32m). 
Specialist Publishing Division
Expansion of the Specialist Division in 2008 has been underpinned
by solid organic growth from A&C Black throughout the world and
by a number of strategic acquisitions and partnerships. Acquisitions
included:
■ Featherstone, acquired in March 2008, a specialist educational
publisher aimed at teachers and professionals who work with 
0-7 year olds. The list is complementary to A&C Black’s leading
lists in primary education and teacher resources and is now
successfully integrated into our schools sales and marketing
organisation.
■ Berg Publishers, acquired in September 2008, a specialist
Oxford-based academic publisher of books and journals aimed 
at students and professionals in the subjects of design, fashion,
anthropology, history and craft. 
80971 PRE 1:80971 Bloomsbury Pre 1  23/4/09  15:22  Page 10 Bloomsbury Publishing Plc

■ John Wisden & Co, acquired in November
2008, is the UK’s and the world’s best-known
sports yearbook, with its annual Almanack
approaching its 150
th
anniversary. Wisden
Cricketers’ Almanack will join our other famous
reference titles including Who’s Who, Whitaker’s
Almanack, Writers’ & Artists’ Y earbook and
best-selling sports books such as the Know the
Game series. The great names in cricket have
been contributors to Wisden, from Sir Neville
Cardus to Mike Atherton. New books for 2009
include Wisden on the Ashes.
■ The Arden Shakespeare, purchased in December
2008, publishes the premier scholarly editions of
Shakespeare worldwide. It is being integrated into
Methuen Drama, a list which has shown strong
organic growth since its acquisition in 2006, with a
number of important new estates signed, including
Arthur Miller and George Bernard Shaw. We
expect similar growth from Arden which will
benefit from the global sales and marketing
operation already in place for Methuen and in
particular sales being handled through Bloomsbury
USA’s operation.

In September 2008, Bloomsbury launched its own
scholarly imprint, Bloomsbury Academic, specialising
initially in the humanities and social sciences.
Publications will be available on the internet free of

Simultaneously, physical books will be produced and
sold on normal business terms around the world. For
the first time a major publishing company is opening
up an entirely new imprint to be accessed easily 
and freely on the internet. By supporting scholarly
communication in this way, our authors will be better
served in the digital age.

Richard Charkin’s appointment has had a hugely
positive impact on the success and leadership of the
Trade Publishing Division since he joined in the final
quarter of 2007 . 2008 has been a year of consolidating
our strategy for acquiring rights across as many
territories as possible, using digital infrastructure 
for the marketing, selling and delivery of titles, and
ensuring our cost base is appropriate for the business. 
In spite of the global downturn, we have been able 
to record good sales across all our publishing genres
in our three key markets of USA, UK and Germany
thanks to carefully targeted marketing, high-quality
sales and distribution and excellent books. Clearly a
number of retailers have suffered cash flow problems,
but we have managed our exposure very carefully in
order to protect our profits.
We have seen the benefits from actions taken in 
2007 and early 2008 to reduce overhead and office
costs and the renegotiation of key print, sales and
distribution contracts. 
On the digital front we have signed a significant deal
for the distribution of our books on the Sony e-reader
and other devices. 
Children’s
JK Rowling’s The T ales of Beedle the Bard, published
by the charity, The Children’s High Level Group using
Bloomsbury’s editorial, design, production, sales and
marketing, was the best-selling title of the year in
many countries of the world. With this venture, 
we have raised a significant amount of money 
for the charity.
Wherever possible, we publish titles in English and in
German for sale throughout the world so that we can
keep prices as low as possible, a vital ingredient for
the success of children’s books in particular.

2008 was an excellent year for the novels of Khaled
Hosseini, even surpassing 2007’s excellent sales. 
The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns
dominated best-seller lists in the UK, Germany,
Australia, South Africa, India and many other 
territories. Other international successes included
Kate Summerscale’s The Suspicions of Mr Whicher, 
Elizabeth Gilbert’s Eat, Pray, Love, Heston
Blumenthal’s The Big Fat Duck Cookbook, Alice
Schroeder’s biography of Warren Buffett, The
Snowball and Jonathan Littell’s controversial novel,
Die Wohlgesinnten.
The strong programme continues in 2009 with
exciting new titles from William Boyd, Margaret
Atwood, David Kynaston, William Dalrymple, Hugh
Fearnley-Whittingstall, Monty Don, Anne Michaels,
Marc Fitten, Roger Boyes and Kamila Shamsie’s
Burnt Shadows which has been long-listed for the
Orange Prize.
Dividend
The Directors are recommending a final dividend 
of 3.47 pence per share (2007 , 3.30 pence) making 
a total of 4.22 pence per share (2007 , 4.00 pence) 
for the year. This represents a 5.5% increase in the
full-year dividend. The final dividend will be payable 
on 1 July 2009 to Ordinary Shareholders on the
register at the close of business on 22 May 2009.
In spite of the global downturn, 
we have been able to record good
sales across all our publishing
genres in our three key markets 
of USA, UK and Germany  . . .

Directors’ Report-Business Review
Chief Executive’s Statement
. . . we are in a good position to expand our academic
division, as we make new acquisitions, and to pursue
organic growth for our existing divisions.
Management and staff
I would like to thank our staff for their tremendous
contribution to a very busy year where we have seen
major strategic as well as operational achievements. 
Current trading, developments and
prospects
The Group has a number of strengths and
opportunities in 2009 and also a number of risks 
and areas of caution which have been heightened 
by the recession. Visibility of future revenue has 
been decreased due to the current uncertainty 
in the global market place, though books have 
fared better than many other consumer products.
In terms of potential bestsellers in 2009 our year
started well with the paperback of The Suspicions of
Mr Whicher reaching the number one position, and
our list for the second half is as strong as it has ever
been with new works by some of the world’s greatest
and most successful writers, including John Irving,
Margaret Atwood and William Boyd. Having said this
however, both unit sales of our bestsellers and our
backlist bestsellers might be lower in the later part of
2009 than in 2008 due to caution in the world-wide
booktrade and the possibility of losing whole
distribution channels in the event that more key
customers have liquidity problems or go out of
business entirely.

In terms of rights and database deals and
management contracts, the Company had a strong
2008 with a number of long-term contracts having
been signed. We also have very strong new projects
on offer in 2009 which compare favourably to the
same stage in 2008. Such deals depend on the
strength and appetite of large third-party partners and
it cannot be ruled out that either the number of deals
or the size of them will be affected by the impact of
the global economy on those third parties later in the
year. There is a risk, for instance, of decreased
government spending on books in schools,
universities and libraries.
We have a strong balance sheet with in excess of 
£50 million on deposit, and, though investment
income will be less than in 2008 due to the reduction
in interest rates, we are in a good position to expand
our academic division, as we make new acquisitions,
and to pursue organic growth for our existing divisions.

Directors’ Report-Financial Review
Results
Revenue for the Group was £99.95m (2007 ,
£150.21m). The Group was working against an
exceptionally strong comparative year as the final
book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and 
the Deathly Hallows, had been launched in 2007 .
During 2008 Bloomsbury benefited from a number 
of publishing successes across the group, in particular
A Thousand Splendid Suns, The Kite Runner, The T ales
of Beedle the Bard and Eat, Pray, Love. The Group 
has also shown significant growth in long-term
revenues generated from rights, database and
management contracts.
Bloomsbury’s primary segmental analysis is by
geographic breakdown, which follows the Group’s
international publishing strategy. Revenue in the UK
was £71.06m (2007 , £128.29m). Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows was launched in 2007 . Profit before
investment income was £8.15m (2007 , £18.16m). 
US revenue increased by 29.4% to £17 .32m (2007 ,
£13.39m) which was primarily due to the success of
titles such as The Suspicions of Mr Whicher, the sale
of The Tales of Beedle the Bard into the Canadian
territory and increased rights and database income
sales. Profit before investment income was £0.38m
(2007 , loss £1.64m). The impact on the US 2008
operating profit applying the average US Dollar
exchange rate from 2007 is immaterial. For
Continental Europe, revenue, which was generated 
by Berlin Verlag, increased 35.6% to £11.57m (2007 ,
£8.53m) on the back of strong performances from
authors including Khaled Hosseini and Jonathan Littell.
Additional advance and stock provisions were taken
during the year which resulted in a profit before
investment income of £0.19m (2007 , £0.28m). The
impact on Berlin’s 2008 operating profit applying the
average Euro exchange rate from 2007 is immaterial.
The Group’s secondary segmental disclosure is 
split into three main operating areas: Children’s, 
Adult and Reference publishing. Under the current
Group structure Children’s and Adult form the Trade
Publishing Division, and Reference the Specialist
Publishing Division. All three segments operate in the
UK, US and Germany. For 2008 the breakdown of
revenue between the three areas was: Children’s
38% (2007 , 66%), Adult 42% (2007 , 24%) and
Reference 20% (2007 , 10%). 
Revenue in Children’s was £38.33m (2007 , £98.92m).
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was launched in
July 2007 and was the main reason for the revenue
decrease. However, there were strong performances
during 2008 from The Graveyard Book by Neil
Gaiman, The Tales of Beedle the Bard and the 
Harry Potter series of titles including the paperback 
of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Gross profit
for Children’s for 2008 was £17 .10m (2007 , £39.60m),
with the contribution before administrative expenses
of £13.65m (2007 , £30.01m). 
Adult revenue was £42.03m (2007 , £35.85m). 
The revenue increase was driven by a number of
strong selling titles including The Kite Runner (UK 
and Germany), A Thousand Splendid Suns (UK and
Germany), Eat, Pray, Love (UK and Germany), The Big
Fat Duck Cookbook (UK and USA), Just Me (UK), The
Suspicions of Mr Whicher (UK and US), The Snowball
(UK) and Die Wohlgesinnten (Germany). Gross profit
for Adult for 2008 increased 15.5% to £15.32m (2007 ,
£13.26m), with the contribution before administrative
expenses up 32.6% to £7 .97m (2007 , £6.01m).
Reference revenue increased 26.8% to £19.59m
(2007 , £15.45m). The revenue growth was primarily
due to the increase in value of income recognised on
rights and database income deals during the year and
the revenues from the acquisition of Featherstone,
Berg and Wisden. Arden Shakespeare was acquired
on 31 December 2008 with no contribution to the
Income Statement in 2008. The gross profit for 2008
was up 71.6% to £10.83m (2007 , £6.31m), with the
contribution before administrative expenses up
161.4% to £6.90m (2007 , £2.64m).

Rights revenue, which includes subsidiary rights,
electronic database income, management contracts
and income derived from third-party agencies,
increased 77 .5% to £9.30m (2007 , £5.24m). The 
profit attributable to this revenue was £5.84m 
(2007 , £2.95m). £4.50m (2007 , £1.92m) of the profit
was generated in the Specialist Publishing Division
and £1.34m (2007 , £1.03m) was generated in the Trade
Publishing Division. The growth in rights and database
income includes income from paperback renewals 
in US, the Macmillan English Dictionary Database,
income from the digital edition of Who’s Who,
QFINANCE and the strategic partnership with the
Qatar Foundation.
Gross profit for the Group for the year was £43.25m
(2007 , £59.17m). Gross profit margin increased to
43.3% (2007 , 39.4%). The increase in the gross 
profit margin was primarily due to lower royalty 
costs charged to the Income Statement than in 2007
and the increased contribution from higher margin
rights revenues. Royalty costs decreased to £13.96m
(2007 , £44.00m) and represented 14.0% of revenues
(2007 , 29.3% of revenues). Royalty rates vary
according to the type of books published in any
particular year. Provisions against unearned advances
charged to the Income Statement were £9.13m 
(2007 , £9.23m) and represented 9.1% of revenues
(2007 , 6.1% of revenues). Within the provision for
unearned advances of £9.13m made during the year 
is an additional amount provided on the basis that in
light of the current economic climate management
does not consider those amounts to be recoverable.
The value of the additional write-off of author
advances to the Income Statement is £5.4m. Books
returned by customers are credited to the returns
provision. In addition there was a write-back in the
returns provision relating to the provision brought
forward from 2007 which, as a result of the level of
returns actually received during 2008, is no longer
required. The value of the write-back to the Income
Statement is £5.1m. Stock provisions charged to 
the Income Statement decreased to £2.83m 
(2007 , £4.30m) and represented 2.8% of revenues
(2007 , 2.9% of revenues). 
80971 PRE 1:80971 Bloomsbury Pre 1  21/4/09  18:20  Page 21 Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 
28.1% to £14.74m (2007 , £20.51m). The variable
element of these costs decreased in line with
revenue. Administrative expenses decreased 9.3% 
to £20.11m (2007 , £22.18m), due in part to cost
reductions made during 2007 and 2008, and a
reduction in the IFRS2 options charge to £0.19m
(2007 , £1.01m) as a result of the performance
conditions not being met.
Profit before investment income was £8.40m 
(2007 , £16.48m).
Investment income increased by 122.3% to £3.29m
(2007 , £1.48m) primarily as a result of higher average
cash balances during the year and higher rates of
interest earned on those balances. 
The effective corporation tax rate for the year was
32.6% (2007 , 33.9%). The decrease in the rate from
2007 mainly reflects profits generated in the US
offset against brought-forward tax losses, the partial
write-down of the deferred tax asset of Bloomsbury
USA, the lower share-based payment charge for
which tax relief will not be given until the relevant
options are exercised, and certain expenses that are
permanently disallowable for tax purposes. The Group
continues to recognise deferred tax assets in respect
of tax losses of Bloomsbury USA and Berlin Verlag
which we expect will be utilised in the foreseeable
future.
Basic earnings per share was 10.67 pence (2007 ,
16.06 pence). Diluted earnings per share was 
10.67 pence (2007 , 15.63 pence).
BALANCE SHEET
Non-current assets
Intangible assets increased to £27 .54m (2007 ,
£17 .72m) primarily due to the acquisition of four
companies during the year, namely Featherstone,
Berg, Wisden and Arden Shakespeare. In addition
there was an exchange gain of £1.4m (2007 , £0.02m)
which was taken to the translation reserve on the
goodwill of the overseas subsidiaries.
Current assets
Inventories increased 15.1% to £16.59m (2007 ,
£14.41m). The main factors leading to the increase
was the movement on the USD / sterling exchange
rate for our US operation, the Euro / sterling exchange
rate for our German operation, an increase in the
number of series titles published in the Specialist
Division and the stock acquired on the four
acquisitions made during the year.
Trade and other receivables decreased 35.7% 
to £48.98m (2007 , £76.21m). Trade receivables
decreased 51.7% to £22.94m (2007 , £47 .53m). At 
the end of 2007 , there were outstanding receivables
relating to the sale of Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows, which was published during that year and
cash was received during 2008. Since books sold are
generally returnable by customers, the Group makes a
provision against books sold in the accounting period.
The unused provision at the year end is then carried
forward as an offset to trade receivables in the
balance sheet, in anticipation of further book returns
subsequent to the year end. A provision for the 
Group of £7 .78m (2007 , £13.03m) for future returns
relating to 2008 and prior year sales has been carried
forward in trade receivables in the balance sheet 
at 31 December 2008. This provision at margin
represents 7 .8% (2007 , 8.7%) of revenues. Within
trade and other receivables, prepayments and accrued
income decreased 7 .9% to £25.71m (2007 , £27 .91m)
due to provisions of £9.13m (2007 , £9.23m) against
advances to authors on titles published (‘advance
provisions’). There is also a reduction in the amount
invested in future unpublished titles.

Directors’ Report-Financial Review
80971 PRE 1:80971 Bloomsbury Pre 1  21/4/09  18:20  Page 22 Equity and liabilities
As at 31 December 2008 total equity stood at £113.67m
(2007 , £100.07m). The increase was due to retained 
earnings of £4.76m (2007 , £9.11m), shares issued as part
consideration for the acquisition of Berg, the translation 
gain of consolidation of the assets and liabilities of overseas
subsidiaries, and the increase in the share-based payment
reserve due to the share-based payment charge for the year
of £0.19m (2007 , £1.01m).
Current liabilities decreased 44.2% to £32.92m 
(2007 , £58.95m). Accruals and deferred income, which 
is included in trade and other payables, decreased 
to £24.01m (2007 , £47 .04m). Accruals and deferred income
includes royalty payments to authors, which vary from year
to year depending on turnover and the authors’ royalty rates
which typically escalate on triggered thresholds as volume
sales increase. 
Cash flow
The Group had a net cash inflow from operating activities
before tax of £16.34m for the year (2007 , £26.60m). Cash
generation was particularly strong for the UK operation as a
result of the continued success of titles, such as A Thousand
Splendid Suns, The Kite Runner and Eat, Pray, Love, and cash
received from long-term rights and database contracts.
Corporation tax paid during the year was £6.18m (2007 ,
£1.93m). The amount paid in 2007 included the impact 
of a claw-back of corporation tax overpaid on account 
for the 2006 financial year. During the year £3.03m (2007 ,
£1.35m) of interest was received from deposits, and £2.98m
(2007 , £2.72m) of dividends were paid. £7 .43m, net of cash
acquired, was spent on the four companies acquired during
the year (2007 , £0.08m). The Group’s net cash on the balance
sheet as at 31 December 2008 was £51.91m (2007 , £47 .56m).

future success. The total avoidance of risk in a business environment is impossible. Actions were taken and processes were
in place during the year, and up to the date of approval of this report, for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks.
These processes were regularly reviewed by the Board and were in accordance with the Turnbull guidance. 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Group, like all businesses, faces a number of risks and uncertainties as it conducts its operations. There are a number of
factors that could impact the Group’s long-term performance and steps are taken to understand and evaluate these in order to
achieve our objective of creating long-term, sustainable returns for shareholders.
Details on financial risk management are given in note 22.
Principal risks and uncertainties to the business fall into the following three categories:
Title Acquisition 
Advances to authors have the potential to reduce margins when portions of those advances remain unearned. When
considering a title acquisition, an initial purchase evaluation process is carried out and signed off at a senior level. There 
is also a system of continuous review, analysis and feedback on title performance to better inform future acquisitions.
Market 
Consumers may not buy a book that has been sold to retailers, and unsold books are returned for credit. Also, customers
seek to price promote many titles which can reduce margins. The steps taken to protect and grow revenues are as outlined
in the Chief Executive’s Review.
Business Continuity 
The security and robustness of our systems, in particular our IT systems, are important in all aspects of our business,
whether in respect of the editorial and production processes, publicity, marketing and sales, or in respect of stock monitoring
and order fulfilment. IT processes are continually updated and security improved, with daily offsite backup of electronic files.
The performance of our key print and distribution suppliers is regularly monitored.

The Board takes regular account of the significance of social, environmental and ethical issues and has identified and
assessed significant risks and opportunities to the Company’s short-term and long-term value arising from these matters. 
Our commitment in this area is recognised by our continued inclusion in the FTSE4Good Index, FTSE’s responsible

Employees
Employee Involvement and Communication
Employees are encouraged through the Company’s share option schemes to own shares in the Company. Regular employee
meetings are set up, aimed at consultation, so that employees’ views are taken into account. Information about the Group’s
affairs, including financial and economic factors affecting the Group’s performance, is communicated to employees through
regular management meetings, electronic notice boards, intranet and social events.
Health and Safety 
The Company takes reasonable and practicable steps to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of its employees, and
recognises its responsibility for the health and safety of others who may be affected by its activities. Colin Adams has
executive responsibility for health and safety issues.
Diversity in the workplace
The Company is committed to providing a working environment in which its employees are able to realise their potential and
to contribute to business success irrespective of gender, marital status, ethnic origin, nationality, religion, disability, sexual
orientation or age.
Employment of disabled persons
It is the Group’s policy to offer equal opportunities to disabled persons in matters of recruitment, training, career development
and promotion. Where people become disabled during the course of their employment, the Group seeks to retain their
services and to provide retraining where necessary.
Social Responsibility
The Company recognises the importance of respecting and supporting the communities in which it operates, thus improving
the positive impact of business in society.
During the year Bloomsbury continued its association with World Book Day. As a sponsor and partner, the Company was able
to provide support for this global initiative, established in 1995 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) with the objective of promoting and celebrating books and reading amongst children and adults. 
The Company was also pleased to support the Puntland and Sri Lanka Tsunami reconstruction project through its continued
partnership with Book Aid International, the registered charity working in developing countries to create reading and learning
opportunities for people of all ages to help them realise their potential and alleviate poverty.

Bloomsbury is committed to, and expects its employees to exercise, high ethical and moral standards at all times whilst
representing the Company. Bloomsbury also expects all relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties to be
conducted on a sound ethical footing. The Company has an Employee and Business Protection Policy which allows employees
to raise, in confidence, concerns about possible improprieties in such matters. 
Charitable and political donations
The Group is a strong supporter of, and participant in, various charities and initiatives. Charitable donations of £3,500 were
made by the Group during the year (2007 , £3,000). In addition, the Group was able to support numerous schools, libraries 
and other organisations, including charities such as Barnados and Shelter, with significant donations of books.
No political donations were made during the year or in the previous financial year.
The Environment
The Company recognises that the wise use of resources delivers both environmental and financial benefits. As part of our
overall approach to corporate social responsibility, we aim to promote the maintenance of a healthy environment through
responsible and sustainable consumption and production. 
Our direct operations are predominately office-based, and our activities have been assessed by environmental consultants
Trucost as having a low impact on the environment. However, our policy is to seek to minimise our impacts both in areas
where we have direct control and through our supply chain. In particular, we have identified waste and greenhouse gas
emissions as areas we shall be monitoring going forward, and therefore in accordance with the 2006 Government Guidelines,
Environmental Key Performance Indicators, Reporting Guidelines for UK Businesses, these measurements, carried out by
Trucost, are set out below.

The Supply Chain
Our indirect impacts through our suppliers are clearly more significant than our direct impacts, which relate to our own office-
based operations. We have analysed the impact of over 25 major suppliers, and we will monitor and engage with our key
suppliers to reduce our environmental impact where possible.
We recognise that the use of paper has a significant impact on the environment. We therefore stipulate that the pulp, used 
to produce the papers for our books, must come from well-managed forests. We are also encouraging our suppliers to obtain
*Forest Stewardship Council A.C. (FSC) accreditation and use FSC certified papers. The majority of our UK and European
suppliers are now FSC Chain of Custody certified, along with one of our main Far Eastern colour printers.
Our policy is to spread the use of FSC certified papers across our lists. Since December 2005 the majority of our mono
hardback and trade format paperbacks manufactured in the UK have been printed on *FSC certified mixed sources papers.
The use of FSC accredited papers was extended in 2008 to include our UK produced mass market paperbacks. During 2008
we continued to extend the use of FSC accredited stocks to colour titles from both our Adult and Children’s lists. Where
possible, the Company seeks to use paper produced from 100% post consumer waste recycled pulp (PCW). For the Harry
Potter and the Deathly Hallows paperback editions published in July 2008 we used a 100% ancient-forest friendly paper for
the text, this was an *FSC certified stock made from a mixture of *FSC pulp and PCW pulp with FSC certified cover boards.

Directors’ Report - Corporate Governance
Board of Directors
80971 PRE 2:80971 Bloomsbury Pre 2  21/4/09  18:26  Page 29 Application of the Principles of Good Governance
The Board has reviewed the requirements of the Combined Code 2006, as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. The
ways in which the Company applies and complies with the principles of the Code are described below and, in respect of
remuneration, on pages 40 to 45.
The Board
At 31 December 2008, the Board consisted of three Executive Directors and three Non-Executive Directors, including a 
Non-Executive Chairman. The names of the six current Directors and their respective responsibilities are shown on page 29.
EN Calder retired as an Executive Director on 1 April 2008.
The Board considers each of the three Non-Executive Directors to be independent in character and judgement and does 
not consider that there are any relationships or circumstances which affect, or could appear to affect, their independent
judgement. 
The Board operates both formally, through Board and Committee meetings, and informally, through regular contact amongst
directors. High level decisions on such matters as strategy, financial performance and reporting, dividends, risk management,
major capital expenditure, acquisitions and disposals are reserved for the Board or Board Committees. For its regular formal
meetings, the Board receives appropriate information in advance from the management. Other decisions outside of these
areas are delegated to the Company’s management, which reports to the Executive Directors.
The Chairman meets regularly with the Non-Executive Directors to consider their views. They constructively challenge and
help develop proposals on strategy at meetings specifically set up for the purpose, which are attended by all Board members.
The directors can obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s own expense in the performance of their duties
as directors and have access to the Company Secretary.
The Board formally approves the appointment of all new directors on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee 
(see below). All directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at the first Annual General Meeting following their
appointment and subsequent to this submit themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting on a rotational basis,
which ensures that each director is submitted for re-election approximately every three years. 
Proposals to re-elect directors are set out on page 34 and in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting on page 99.
Board Committees
Remuneration Committee – The current composition of the Remuneration Committee is shown on page 40 and the
statement of the remuneration policy developed by the Committee and details of each director’s remuneration are given
within the Directors’ Remuneration Report set out on pages 40 to 45. The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee
are available on the Company’s website.
Audit Committee – The current composition of the Audit Committee is shown on page 29. The Audit Committee operates
under terms of reference agreed by the whole Board and meets with the external auditors to consider the Company’s
financial reporting in advance of its publication, and with the internal auditors to consider the internal audit programme,
feedback and reports. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are available on the Company’s website.
Nomination Committee – The current composition of the Nomination Committee is shown on page 29. The Committee

Board Evaluation
During the year the Board carried out a formal Board evaluation. Designed to provide a mechanism to assess individual
director and overall Board and Committee performance, the evaluation had two stages:
Stage One: Self Evaluation
A self assessment completed by each director and reviewed by the Chairman (or in the case of the Chairman’s self evaluation,
by the Senior Independent Director, the other Non-Executive Director and the Executive Directors), who involves the other
Non-Executive Directors as necessary. The reviewer determines follow-up action required including face-to-face meetings,
training and development or the implementation of new processes or procedures. This may also generate items for discussion
in Stage T wo. 
Stage Two: Board/Committee Evaluation and Communication
Conducted within a Board forum environment and prompted by key pre-determined questions (including any items generated
from Stage One of the process), the Board examines separately the performance of the Board, the Board Committees and
Board Communication. The forum is minuted and action points noted. 
Shareholder Communications
The Board’s assessment of the Group’s position and prospects are set out in the Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 8 
to 19 and the Financial Review on pages 20 to 23.
The Executive Directors meet regularly with institutional shareholders to discuss the Company’s performance and future
prospects. The views of institutional shareholders are canvassed and subsequently reported back to the Board. 
In addition, the Chairman offers annually to meet with major shareholders to review with them the performance and
governance of the Group and the Senior Independent Director and the Non-Executive Director are kept informed of
shareholder views by regularly receiving reports from the Company’s brokers. 
The Annual General Meeting is used as a forum for communication with private shareholders.

80971 PRE 2:80971 Bloomsbury Pre 2  21/4/09  18:26  Page 31 Compliance with the Combined Code
The Board considers that the Company has complied throughout the year ended 31 December 2008 with the Combined Code
except in relation to the following matters:
● Provision A.4.1 - the Chief Executive was and still is the Chairman of the Nomination Committee.
● Provision D1.1 – The Senior Independent Director did not attend meetings with major shareholders but was and still 
is kept informed of shareholder views by regularly receiving reports from the Company’s brokers.
Internal Control
The Combined Code requires the directors to review, on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of the systems of internal
control, including financial, operational, compliance and risk management. The Board acknowledges that it has overall
responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for monitoring its effectiveness.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the two Non-Executive Directors, Charles Black (its Chairman), and Michael Mayer. 
Both members of the Committee have significant financial experience due to the senior positions they hold or have 
held in the past. 
The Audit Committee reports to the Board on any matters on which it considers that action or improvement is needed, 
and makes recommendations as to the steps to be taken. In particular, the Committee is responsible for:
● ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly monitored and reported;
● monitoring the formal announcements relating to financial performance;
● meeting the external auditors and reviewing reports prepared by the external auditors and management relating to
accounts and internal control systems;
● appointing internal auditors, agreeing the internal audit plan and meeting with them to review reports and consider future
internal audit strategy; and
● making recommendations to the Board in respect of external auditor appointment and remuneration.
The effectiveness of the internal controls systems for the period covered by the financial statements has been examined. 
The examination comprised a detailed review of internal controls with any significant findings or identified risks being closely
examined so that appropriate action can be taken. 
Since their appointment in December 2006, an experienced external provider of internal audit services, KPMG LLP , has
worked with the Company to develop a risk-based internal audit programme for the Group. A representative of KPMG LLP
regularly attended the Audit Committee meetings during the year and submitted their reports.

The Board maintains full control and direction over appropriate strategic financial, organisational and compliance issues, and
has put in place an organisational structure with defined lines of responsibility and delegations of authority. 
The annual budget and forecasts are reviewed by the Board prior to approval being given. This includes the identification 
and assessment of the business risks inherent in the Group and the publishing sector as a whole along with associated
financial risks. 
The system of internal financial control is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss. The key procedures include:
● detailed budgeting and forecasting programme with annual budget and forecast approved by the Board;
● regular review by the Board of actual results compared with budget and forecasts;
● regular reviews by the Board of year-end forecasts;
● established procedures for acquisition of books for future publication, capital expenditure and expenditure incurred in the
ordinary course of business;
● detailed budgeting and monitoring of costs incurred on the development of reference databases;
● established procedures for credit evaluation of new and existing customers with credit insurance on material customer
accounts;
● reporting to, and review by, the Board of changes in legislation and practices within the publishing sector and accounting
and legal developments pertinent to the Group;
● appointing experienced and suitably qualified staff to take responsibility for key business functions to ensure maintenance
of high standards of performance; and
● an internal audit programme.
Auditor Independence
The Audit Committee also undertakes a formal assessment of the external auditor’s independence each year which includes:
● confirmation of the external auditor’s objectivity and independence in the provision of non-audit services provided to the
Group including the use of separate teams to provide such services.
● discussion with the external auditor of a written report detailing relationships with the Company and any other parties that
could affect independence or the perception of independence;
● a review of the external auditor’s own procedures for ensuring independence of the audit firm and partners and staff
involved in the audit, including the regular rotation of the audit partner; and
● obtaining written confirmation from the external auditor that, in their professional judgement, they are independent.
An analysis of the fees payable to the external audit firm in respect of both audit and non-audit services during the year is set
out in note 2 to the accounts.

80971 PRE 2:80971 Bloomsbury Pre 2  21/4/09  18:26  Page 35 Special Business – Annual General Meeting
Resolution 7 – On 27 June 2008, resolutions were passed by the Company’s shareholders whereby the directors were 
given authority, under Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985, until the conclusion of the 2009 Annual General Meeting, to
allot shares up to a maximum of the authorised but unissued share capital of the Company. The directors recommend by
Resolution 7 to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting that this authority should be extended so that it
applies until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company. If Resolution 7 is approved by shareholders,
the directors will have the authority to allot up to 18,316,377 Ordinary Shares, representing 24.86% of the Ordinary Shares
currently in issue, of which 2,868,018 (3.897% of the Ordinary Shares currently in issue) are reserved for issue under the
Company’s share option schemes and performance share plan. The balance available for allotment is therefore 15,448,359
Ordinary Shares, representing 20.97% of the Ordinary Shares currently in issue. The Company does not currently have any
treasury shares in issue. The directors have no present intention of exercising the authority except in connection with the
issue of shares under the Company’s share and share option schemes. The authority, if granted, will expire on conclusion of
the next Annual General Meeting of the Company after the passing of the proposed Resolution 7 , unless previously varied,
revoked or renewed by the Company in the general meeting.
Resolution 8 – In addition, the directors were given authority under Section 95 of the Companies Act 1985, until the
conclusion of the 2009 Annual General Meeting, to allot equity securities for cash, other than to existing shareholders in
proportion to their holding, in connection with a rights issue, pursuant to the terms of employees’ share or share option
schemes approved by the members in general meeting and, in addition, up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to 5% 
of the issued Ordinary Share capital. The directors recommend that this authority should be renewed until the conclusion 
of the next Annual General Meeting or fifteen months from the date of passing of this resolution, whichever is the earlier,
unless previously varied, revoked or renewed by the Company in the general meeting.
The Companies Act 1985 allows shares purchased by the Company to be held as treasury shares, which may then 
be cancelled, sold for cash or used to meet the Company’s obligations under its share or share option schemes. The
requirements to allot equity securities for cash to existing shareholders will also apply to the sale by the Company of any
shares it holds as treasury shares. These requirements may be similarly disapplied by shareholders. The authority sought, 
and limits set, by Resolution 8 will then apply also to a sale of treasury shares. Apart from potentially acquiring shares to
satisfy the vesting of options or awards under any of the Company’s share or share option schemes, the directors have 
no present intention of holding shares in treasury pursuant to the Companies Act 1985.
Resolution 9 – This resolution renews the existing authority for the Company to make purchases of its own shares. The
maximum number of Ordinary Shares which may be purchased pursuant to the authority is 3,684,181 being equal to 5% of
the issued share capital of the Company as at the date of this Directors’ Report. The total number of options to subscribe for
equity shares currently outstanding is 1,063,201 being equal to 1.44% of the issued share capital. The total number of share
awards currently outstanding granted under the performance share plan is 1,804,817 being equal to 2.45% of the issued
share capital. If the full authority to buy back shares is used, the options and awards will represent 3.89% of the equity 
share capital. The minimum price which may be paid for an Ordinary Share (exclusive of expenses) shall be an amount 
equal to 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for the Company’s ordinary shares for the five business 
days immediately preceding the date of purchase.
The authority sought to make market purchases of its own shares is intended to apply equally to shares to be held by the
Company as treasury shares in accordance with the Companies Act. However, as mentioned above, the directors have no
present intention of holding shares in treasury pursuant to the Companies Act 1985.
The directors consider that the authority proposed to be granted by Resolution 10 may be necessary in order to increase the
earnings per share of the Group. They have no intention of exercising the authority at the present time but, if they do, the
directors will neither be encouraging nor recommending shareholders to buy or sell shares in the Company nor in any way
suggesting that it is an appropriate time to deal in such shares. This authority, if conferred, will only be exercised if to do so
would result in an increase in the earnings per share and is in the best interests of shareholders generally.

in the best interests of the shareholders as a whole.
Directors’ Indemnities
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, directors are granted an indemnity from the Company to the extent
permitted by law in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office.
Authority to Buy-back shares 
The Company’s Articles of Association empower the Company to buy-back its own shares. The Directors consider that the
power to make purchases in the market of the Company’s own shares should be maintained and the necessary special
resolution will be proposed at the annual general meeting. The power was not exercised in 2008. 
Insurance of Company Officers
The Group has maintained insurance throughout the year for its directors and officers against the consequences of actions
brought against them in relation to their duties for the Group.
Policy on Supplier Payments
The Group does not follow a standard code for dealing with the payment of suppliers, but aims to pay all its suppliers within
pre-agreed credit terms, provided that the supplier has performed in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions. 
At 31 December 2008 the number of days credit taken for purchases by the Group was 51 days (2007 , 42 days).
Going Concern
Having made enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Share Capital and Rights Attaching to the Company’s Shares
Under the Articles of Association, any share in the Company may be issued with such rights or restrictions, whether in regard
to dividend, voting, return of capital or otherwise as the Company may from time to time by ordinary resolution determine (or,
in the absence of any such determination, as the Directors may determine).
At 31 December 2008, the Company’s issued share capital consists of a single class of ordinary shares with nominal value of
1.25p. At a general meeting of the Company every member has one vote on a show of hands and on a poll one vote for each
share held. The notice of general meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights either by proxy or present in person
in relation to resolutions to be passed at a general meeting. Details of the authorised and issued share capital of the
Company can be found in note 14 together with details of the shares issued during the year.
No shareholder is, unless the Board decides otherwise, entitled to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a general
meeting or to exercise any other rights conferred by being a shareholder if he or she or any person with an interest in shares
has been sent a notice under Section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 (which confers upon public companies the power to
require information with respect to interests in their voting shares) and he or she or any interested person failed to supply 
the Company with the information requested within 14 days after delivery of that notice. The Board may also decide that 
no dividend is payable in respect of those default shares and that no transfer of any default shares shall be registered. 
These restrictions end seven days after receipt of the Company of a notice of an approved transfer of the shares or all the
information required by the relevant Section 793 notice, whichever is earlier. The Directors may refuse to register any transfer
which is not a fully-paid share, although such discretion may not be exercised in a way which the Financial Services Authority
regards as preventing dealing in the shares of that class from taking place on an open proper basis. The Directors may
likewise refuse any transfer of a share in favour of more than four persons jointly.

restrictions that may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and pursuant
to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority whereby certain employees of the Company require approval of the
Company to deal in the Company’s shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of the
securities or voting rights.
Resolutions will be proposed at the 2009 Annual General Meeting to authorise the directors to exercise all powers to allot
shares and approve a limited disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights. Details are set out in the Notice of Meeting as
contained on pages 99 to 100.
Directors’ appointments and replacements 
The procedure for the appointment of new directors is given on page 30 under the heading ‘The Board’. A director may 
be removed from office by the passing of an ordinary resolution at a general meeting of the Company for which special 
notice is given. 
Amendments to the Articles of Association
The Articles of the Company may be amended by the passing of a special resolution at a general meeting of the Company. 
Share Schemes
The Bloomsbury Employee Benefit Trust 2005, as Trustee of the Bloomsbury Employee Benefit Trust, as at 21 April 2009 held
0.12% of the share capital of the Company for employee share schemes. The Trustee may vote on shares held by the trust at
its discretion, but waives its right to a dividend.
Statement as to Disclosure of Information to Auditors
The directors who were in office on the date of approval of these financial statements have confirmed that, as far as they are
aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware. Each of the directors have confirmed that
they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that it has been communicated to the auditor.
Auditor
A resolution to reappoint Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP as auditor will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

80971 PRE 2:80971 Bloomsbury Pre 2  21/4/09  18:26  Page 38 The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and regulations.
UK Company law requires the directors to prepare group and company financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the directors are required to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the EU and have elected to prepare the company financial statements in accordance with
IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The group financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and
performance of the group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the
relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The company financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of
the company.
In preparing each of the group and company financial statements, the directors are required to:
a.  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b.  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
c.  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS’s adopted by the EU;
d.  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group
and the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of
the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

remuneration and the basis of their service agreements with due regard to the interests of shareholders. In determining that
remuneration, the Remuneration Committee seeks to offer a competitive remuneration structure to maintain the high calibre
of the Company’s executive board. The Committee believes that maintaining the Group’s business growth and profit record
requires an overall compensation policy with a strong performance-related element.
The main components of the executive directors’ remuneration are:
1) Basic salary
Basic salary for each director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account external market data. 
The Committee’s policy is to review salaries annually.
2) Annual bonus
The Company operates an annual bonus scheme for its executive directors. For 2008 Nigel Newton and Colin Adams the
amount payable was determined by reference to achieving budgeted operating profit targets. For Richard Charkin the amount
payable was determined by reference to a combination of Group EPS and budgeted operating profit. 
For 2008 the bonus for each of the aforementioned directors, which is not pensionable, was limited to a maximum of 100%
of basic salary at the end of the financial year. Liz Calder, who retired on 1 April 2008, did not participate in the annual bonus
scheme in 2008. 
The 2009 bonuses for Nigel Newton, Richard Charkin and Colin Adams will remain a maximum of 100% of basic salary. 
80% of their bonus will be based on a range of pre tax profit targets set by reference to the Group budget and 20% 
will be based on the successful delivery of pre-set strategic and personal goals. 
All annual bonuses are payable in cash following the release of the Group’s preliminary audited results.
3) Pension contributions
The Group does not operate a pension scheme, but the executive directors receive a contribution to their private pension
arrangements. These contribution levels have been reviewed by the Committee during the year. With effect from 1 January
2009 Nigel Newton and Colin Adams will each receive a contribution of 15% of their basic salary to their private pension
schemes, and Richard Charkin will receive an additional contribution of 5% of his basic salary in lieu of pension.
4) Share options, the Performance Share Plan and Sharesave Plan
The Group believes that share ownership by executive directors strengthens the link between their personal interests and
those of the shareholders in respect of shareholder value. Upon listing of the Company in 1994, Approved and Unapproved
Executive Share Option Schemes (“the Schemes”) were introduced. The 10 year life of the Schemes has now expired and 
no new options have been granted under either of the Schemes since 2004.

Remuneration Report
80971 PRE 2:80971 Bloomsbury Pre 2  21/4/09  18:26  Page 40 At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 27 September 2005 resolutions were passed approving the
setting up of a Performance Share Plan (to incentivise the executive directors and other senior employees), a Sharesave Plan
(to incentivise the Bloomsbury workforce as a whole) and an Employee Benefit Trust (to operate in conjunction with the new
plans, as appropriate) – further detail on the Employee Benefit Trust is set out on page 91. 
Performance Share Plan (“the PSP”)
The plan allows the Remuneration Committee to grant conditional allocations of Ordinary Shares to eligible employees with 
a maximum value (normally) of 150% of base salary per annum. Awards granted under the PSP will normally only vest after
three years, provided the participant is still employed in the Group and that performance conditions have first been achieved
(these conditions are set by the Remuneration Committee each year prior to award). The first awards under the PSP were
made on 4 November 2005, since when there have been further awards on 26 October 2006, 8 May 2007 and 12 May 2008
to directors and the conditions attached to those awards are set out on page 44.
The Remuneration Committee has not granted and has no present intention of granting awards greater than 100% of base
salary per annum, save for an initial grant to Richard Charkin on joining the Company of 150% of base salary which was
awarded during 2008. The Remuneration Committee is conscious that it may be appropriate to apply even more demanding
performance conditions if it is felt appropriate to make awards under the PSP in excess of 100% of salary in any year.
Sharesave Plan
This is an all-employee savings-related share option scheme under which options can be granted to acquire Ordinary Shares
after a vesting period of three, five or seven years at an exercise price determined at the outset, on condition that they agree
to make savings into a special savings account. This plan is approved by HM Revenue and Customs and gives participants tax
and National Insurance benefits. The first grant of 115,671 options under this plan was made on 5 May 2006, a second grant
of 100,118 options on 8 June 2007 and a third grant of 92,983 was made on 12 May 2008. 
Contracts of Service
All the executive directors have service contracts which are terminable by either party giving to the other not less than twelve
months’ written notice. 
Nigel Newton’s contract, dated 24 June 2003, had an initial fixed term of two years. Under the terms of the contract, on 
24 June 2005 this agreement effectively became and continues to be determinable by either party giving to the other not 
less than twelve months’ written notice as recommended by the Combined Code. 
Colin Adams’ and Richard Charkin’s contracts are dated 24 September 2004 and 10 October 2007 respectively. Liz Calder’s
contract was dated 1 July 2004 and ended on 1 April 2008.
The non-executive directors, Charles Black and Michael Mayer, do not have service contracts, but each has a letter of
appointment. Each letter of appointment is dated 7 July 2006, and all confirmed that the term of appointment was until the
2007 Annual General Meeting and thereafter subject to re-election every three years in accordance with the Company’s
Articles of Association. The Chairman Jeremy Wilson’s letter of appointment is dated 31 October 2007 and is determinable 
by either party giving three months’ notice and is subject to re-election every three years. 
There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination of service contracts. Compensation on early
termination may be payable by the Company by agreement between the Company and the director and with the approval 
of the Remuneration Committee. No compensation was paid to Liz Calder when she retired on 1 April 2008.
Policy on Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the executive directors. The non-executive directors do not participate
in the Company’s pension, annual bonus or equity plans and their fees are paid entirely in cash compensating them for their
time and responsibilities.

(1) For the purposes of determining the number of Ordinary Shares comprised in an award the market value of a share shall be equal to either the average
middle-market price of a Share during the five dealing days immediately preceding the award date or the middle-market price on the dealing day before the award
date. The 2005 awards under the PSP were based on the average middle-market price of 337 .9p. The 2006 awards under the PSP were based on the average
middle-market price of 315.25p. The 2007 award under the PSP were based on the average middle-market price of 181.4p. The 2008 award under the PSP were
based on the middle market price of 144.5p.
(2) All awards are granted for nil consideration and are in respect of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc Ordinary Shares of 1.25p.
(3) For all awards made to the directors, there are two performance conditions which need to be satisfied if awards are to vest at the end of the three year
performance period (the “Performance Period”):
a. In respect of 50% of the total award, the performance condition is growth in Bloomsbury’s normalised Earnings Per Share (EPS) over the Retail Prices Index
(RPI) during the three full financial years immediately preceding the end of the relevant Performance Period. If EPS growth is between 5% and 8% p.a. over
RPI, the number of shares vesting will be pro rata to actual growth, with 17 .5% of total award vesting at 5% p.a., and the full 50% vesting at 8% p.a. None 
of this part of the award will vest if EPS growth over RPI is less than 5% p.a.
b. In respect of 50% of the total award, the performance condition is Bloomsbury’s rank over the relevant Performance Period in terms of its Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) compared to companies constituting the FTSE Mid 250 (excluding investment trusts) at the date of grant. If the Company’s TSR ranking is
between median and the upper quartile, the number of shares vesting will be pro rata to position, with 17 .5% of total award vesting at median, and the full
50% vesting if the Company’s position is in the upper quartile. None of this part of the award will vest if the Company’s TSR ranking is below median.
(4) There will be no opportunity to retest performance if the performance conditions are not satisfied over the relevant Performance Period.
Directors’ Interests 
a) Interests in shares

Source: Thomson Datastream Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements on pages 48 to 95. We have also audited the
information in pages 42 to 44 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to 
you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the Directors’
Report includes that specific information presented in the Operating and Financial Review that is cross referenced from the
Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the
Combined Code 2006 specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does
not. We are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Five Year Financial Summary, the Chairman’s Statement, the Directors’ 
Report, the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities and the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.

Independent Auditor’s Report
80971 PRE 2:80971 Bloomsbury Pre 2  21/4/09  18:26  Page 46 Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•  the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2008 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
•  the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the Parent
Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2008;
•  the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation; and

for the year ended 31 December 2008
80971 PRE 2:80971 Bloomsbury Pre 2  21/4/09  18:26  Page 54 (a)  Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations endorsed by the European Union (“EU”) and
those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared
under the historical cost convention.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out below, which have been
consistently applied to all years. These accounting policies comply with applicable IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations issued, effective
and endorsed by the EU at the time of preparing these statements.
IFRIC interpretation 11, IFRS 2 ‘Group and Treasury Share Transactions’, is mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 March 2007 . IFRIC 11 provides guidance on applying IFRS 2 when a parent grants rights to its equity instruments to
employees of its subsidiary. 
The following Standards and Interpretations, which were effective for this financial period, have no material impact on the financial
statements of the Group:
• IFRIC 7 ‘Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 ‘Reporting in Hyperinflatory Economies’’ (effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006);
• IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006);
• IFRIC 10 ‘Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 November 2006).
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not yet 
been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
• IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009); this Standard 
replaces IAS 14 ‘Segment Reporting’ and requires segmental information reported to be based on that which
management uses internally for evaluating performance of operating segments and requires increased disclosure 
relating to reportable segments.
• IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009); 
requires amendments to the structure of financial statements.
• IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009); this requires disclosure
of estimates used to determine recoverable amount. 
• IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payments’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009); changes to vesting
conditions and cancellations in relation share-based remuneration. 
• IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009); comprehensive revision 
on applying the acquisition method. 
• IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008); disclosure amendment;
reclassification of financial assets.
• IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009);
amendments arising from IFRS 3.
• IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments’ (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008); amendment,
reclassification of financial assets. 
There were no other Standards and Interpretations which were in issue but not effective at the date of authorisation of these
financial statements that the directors anticipate will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.

Financial Statements - Accounting Policies
80971 notes:80971 notes  21/4/09  18:27  Page 55 (b)  Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill, being the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of assets acquired, is recognised as an intangible asset. 
Goodwill is not amortised, but instead is subject to annual impairment reviews. Any impairment losses are recognised immediately 
in the income statement and are not subsequently reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of
impairment testing. 
Negative goodwill is credited to the income statement in the period in which it arises.
Intangible assets are capitalised and amortised over their expected useful lives by equal annual instalments at the following rates:
Publishing Relationships – 5% - 12.5% per annum
Imprints – 3% - 5% per annum
Subscriber Relationships – 6% per annum
Order Backlog – 33% per annum
The amortisation is included in administrative expenses.
(c)  Revenue
Revenue represents the amount derived from the provision of goods, services and rights falling within the Group’s ordinary activities,
after deduction of trade discounts, value added tax and anticipated returns. Revenue from book publishing is recognised on delivery.
Revenue from the sale of publishing and distribution rights, including film, paperback, electronic, overseas publishing rights and
sponsorship, is recognised on the delivery of the related content. Revenue from database contracts is recognised in accordance 
with the stages of completion of contractual services provided. 
(d)  Inventories
Inventories include paper, sheets and bound stock. The cost of work in progress and finished stock represents the amounts invoiced
to the Group for paper, origination, printing and binding. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is
determined using the weighted average cost method.
(e)  Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated in order to write down their cost by equal annual instalments over their expected
useful lives at the following rates: 
Short leasehold improvements – 7 - 17% per annum
Furniture and fittings – 10% per annum
Computer equipment – 20% per annum
Other office equipment – 20% per annum
Motor vehicles – 25% per annum
Depreciation is pro-rated in the years of acquisition and disposal of an asset.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.

Financial Statements - Accounting Policies
80971 notes:80971 notes  21/4/09  18:27  Page 56 (f)  Royalty advances to authors
Advances to authors are included within prepayments and accrued income and are written off to the extent that they are not covered
by anticipated future sales or firm contracts for subsidiary rights receivable.
(g)  T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can 
be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or
from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither
the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the
Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in
the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled
based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited
in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also
dealt with in equity. 
(h)  Foreign currencies
The presentational currency is sterling. The parent Company’s functional currency is sterling. The functional currencies of its overseas
subsidiaries are Euros and US dollars. 
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the
transactions. Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at closing rates of exchange at the balance sheet
date. Income statements and cash flows of overseas subsidiary companies are translated into sterling at average exchange rates for
the year. The closing rate of exchange is used to translate net assets.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
entity and translated at the closing rate. All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of opening net assets and income statements of overseas subsidiary companies
are dealt with as movements in equity.

80971 notes:80971 notes  21/4/09  18:27  Page 57 (i)  Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group has become a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument. The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are as below:
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the
effective interest method less any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and changes
to debtor payment patterns are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank and other short-term deposits held by the Group, repayable on
demand.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(j)  Operating leases
Operating leases are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the related asset are not
transferred to the Group. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement as they fall due. 
(k)  Pension costs
Pension costs relating to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the period for which
contributions are payable. 
Until 1997 a subsidiary company operated a defined benefit pension scheme. The liability in respect of the defined benefit pension
scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligations, calculated using the projected unit credit method at each balance
sheet date by the scheme actuary, less the fair value of the scheme’s assets.
The current service cost, interest on scheme liabilities and all actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.

Financial Statements - Accounting Policies
80971 notes:80971 notes  21/4/09  18:27  Page 58 (l)  Share-based payment
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payment transactions to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payment
transactions are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based
payments is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of
shares that will eventually vest. 
Options granted under the Group’s share option schemes and Sharesave scheme are equity settled, as are awards granted under the
Group’s share appreciation rights scheme. The fair values of such options have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model or a
modified version of the same, based on publicly available market data. 
Awards granted under the Group’s performance share plan are equity settled. Due to the Total Shareholder Return performance
condition that applies to half of any award granted under the plan, the fair value of awards has been calculated using the Monte-Carlo
style stochastic model.
Awards granted under the Group’s share appreciation rights scheme are equity settled.
(m)  Employee share ownership plans
The Company operates an employee benefit trust and has de facto control of shares held by the trust and bears their benefits and
risks. The Group records certain assets and liabilities of the trust as its own. Finance costs and administrative expenses are charged
as they accrue.
(n)  Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries at the year end. The results of the
subsidiaries are accounted for in the income statement from the date of acquisition. 
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies to obtain economic
benefit to the Group. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal,
as appropriate.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange,
plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a
business combination are initially measured at fair value at the acquisition date irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line
with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on
consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred.
(o)  Segmental reporting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations that provide a product or service and that is subject to risks and returns that
are different from other business segments. A geographic segment is a group of assets and operations that provide a product or
service within a particular economic environment and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from segments operating
in different economic environments.

80971 notes:80971 notes  21/4/09  18:27  Page 59 (p)  Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash
flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which 
the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher value of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments and
the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount
of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
(q)  Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including reasonable
expectations of future events. The resultant estimates will, by definition, not necessarily equal the related actual results and may
require adjustment in subsequent accounting periods. The estimates and assumptions that may cause a material adjustment to the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are:
Book returns
As books are returnable by customers, the Group makes a provision against books sold in the accounting period which is then carried
forward and offset against trade receivables in the balance sheet in anticipation of book returns received subsequent to the year end. 
Author advances
A provision is made by the Group against published advances which may not be covered by anticipated future sales, paperback
editions or contracts for subsidiary rights receivable. At the end of each financial year a review is carried out on all published titles
advances. If it is unlikely that royalties from future sales, paperback sales or subsidiary rights will fully earn down the advance, a
provision is made to the income statement for the difference between the carrying value and the anticipated recoverable amount
from future earnings.
Inventory
At the end of each financial year a review is carried out on all published titles where inventory is held. A provision is made by 
the Group against unsold inventory on a title by title basis to value the inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Impairment reviews
IFRS requires management to undertake an annual test for impairment of indefinite life assets and, for finite life assets, to test for
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Group
currently undertakes an annual impairment test covering goodwill and other indefinite life assets and also reviews finite life assets 
to consider whether a full impairment review is required. 
Intangible assets recoverability is an area involving management judgement, requiring assessment as to whether the carrying value
of assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets using cash flow projections which
have been discounted at an appropriate rate. In calculating the net present value of the future cash flows, certain assumptions are
required to be made. Note 9 details the assumptions used.

Pension costs
The pension costs summarised above of £512,000 (2007 , £564,000) relate to the Group’s defined contribution and defined benefit
pension arrangements. 
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit plans for all qualifying employees.
The total cost charged to income of £493,000 (2007 , £545,000) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at
rates specified in the rules of the schemes. As at 31 December 2008, contributions of £18,000 (2007 , £19,000) due in respect of the
current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes and are accrued in the balance sheet.
Defined benefit plan
A subsidiary company operates a defined benefit scheme for some staff. Accrual of benefits ceased in 1997 , with the scheme now
operated as a closed fund. A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 1 January 2007 and updated to 31 December 2008 by a
qualified independent actuary.
At the date of the last completed independent actuarial valuation, which was 1 January 2007 , the market value of the assets of the
scheme was £424,000. The actuary advised that at that date the actuarial valuation of the assets of the scheme was sufficient to
cover 73% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in earnings. The scheme is actuarially
valued every three years. The next valuation of the scheme will be as at 1 January 2010.
Contributions are paid by the employer as and when required to cover any expenses of the scheme. In addition, contributions 
paid to the scheme during the year were £19,000 (2007 , £19,000). The directors’ best estimate of the contribution to be paid in 
2009 is £19,000. 
The Group’s policy is to fund the deficit in the scheme by additional contributions to meet the scheme’s commitment to members.

Details of the Group’s deferred tax assets are shown in note 11.
On 19 July 2007 the UK Finance Bill 2007 received Royal Assent. The Bill included a reduction of the full corporation tax rate 
from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008. Accordingly, UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date have
been calculated at 28%. In the year ending 31 December 2008, the current tax charge reflected an effective UK corporation tax 
rate of 28.5%.

For the prior year
A final dividend for 2007 of 3.30 pence per share (£2,428,000) was paid to the equity shareholders on 1 July 2008, being the amount
proposed by the directors, and subsequently approved by the shareholders at the 2008 Annual General Meeting (2007 , final dividend
for 2006 paid in 2007 of 3.00 pence per share, £2,203,000).
For the current year
On 18 November 2008 an interim dividend of 0.75 pence per share (£552,000) was paid to the equity shareholders (2007 , 0.70 pence
per share, £515,000).
The directors propose that a final dividend of 3.47 pence per share will be paid to the equity shareholders on 1 July 2009. Based on
the number of shares currently in issue, the final dividend will be £2,557 ,000, This dividend is subject to approval by the shareholders
at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
7 .  Earnings per share
The basic earnings per share has been calculated by reference to earnings of £7 ,840,000 (2007 , £11,804,000) and a weighted 
average number of Ordinary Shares in issue after deducting 88,760 shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust of 73,503,495 
(2007 , 73,518,044). The diluted earnings per share has been calculated by reference to earnings of £7 ,840,000 (2007 , £11,804,000) 
and a weighted average number of Ordinary Shares of 73,506,869 (2007 , 75,529,183) which takes account of share options 
and awards.
The reconciliation between the weighted average number of shares for the basic earnings per share and the diluted earnings 
per share is as follows: 
2008 2007
Number Number
Weighted average number of shares for basic earnings per share 73,503,495 73,518,044

In accordance with IFRS 3, goodwill has been frozen at its net book value at 1 January 2004 and is not amortised, but instead is
subject to annual impairment reviews. Any impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement. The carrying
value is determined on the basis of value in use.

Financial Statements- Notes to the Accounts
On 30 September 2008 A&C Black acquired the whole of the issued share capital of Oxford International Publishers Limited t/a Berg
Publishers for an initial consideration of £2,092,245 comprising £1,893,000 cash and the issue of new ordinary shares to the value 
of £199,245. 121,824 ordinary shares of 1.25p were issued in Bloomsbury Publishing Plc on 30 September 2008 at a market price 
as quoted on the London Stock Exchange. Berg Publishers is an independent academic publishing company with a particular focus 
on books and journals for the academic student market in the fields of fashion, design and culture studies. There will also be a
contingent consideration based on the average revenues for the Berg Fashion Library element of the business in 2014 and 2015 
up to a maximum of £1,000,000. None of the contingent consideration has been recognised as it is not considered probable that 
an amount will be paid and a reliable measurement cannot be ascertained due to the timescales the contingent consideration is
based on. The acquisition has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. The goodwill of £1,194,000 arising on 
the acquisition has been capitalised in the Group balance sheet.
On 30 November 2008 A&C Black acquired the whole of the issued share capital of John Wisden (Holdings) Limited for a cash
consideration of £2,842,000. John Wisden (Holdings) Limited is the publisher of Wisden Cricketers’ Almanack. The acquisition 
has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. The goodwill of £1,556,000 arising on the acquisition has been
capitalised in the Group balance sheet. 
On 31 December 2008 A&C Black acquired the trade and net assets of Arden Shakespeare, a publisher of academic Shakespeare

Identifiable intangible assets of £1,602,000 consist of the following: £257 ,000 of imprints and series names and £1,345,000 of
publishing rights. Imprints and series names have a useful life of thirty years and publishing rights twenty years. 
A deferred tax liability of £449,000 has been provided against these intangible assets. Although this liability has been recognised 
in accordance with IAS 12 and a proportion will be amortised to the income statement as the related intangible asset is amortised,
this liability is only payable if the intangible asset is sold separately and this is not expected to happen. 
The goodwill is attributable to the expected profitability of the acquired business and the synergies expected to arise after 
the acquisition.
The following pro forma summary presents the Group as if Featherstone Education Limited, Oxford International Publishers Limited
t/a Berg Publishers, John Wisden (Holdings) Limited and the net assets of Arden Shakespeare were acquired on 1 January 2008.
The pro forma amounts do not include any possible synergies from these acquisitions. The pro forma information is provided for
comparative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred, nor is it necessarily indicative
of future results of operations of the combined companies.

80971 notes:80971 notes  21/4/09  18:27  Page 79 The carrying amount of the Group’s goodwill relates to the following geographical segments:

United Kingdom 17 ,109 13,510
North America 3,651 2,714
Continental Europe 1,699 1,255
At 31 December 22,459 17 ,479
In testing goodwill for impairment, the recoverable amount of each geographical segment’s assets is calculated on the basis of future
cash flows, whilst also taking into account past performance for well established operations, such as in the United Kingdom. The
operating performance of each segment is based on the Board’s approved budgets for the year ending 31 December 2009 for all
segments and extrapolated forecasts for subsequent years up to 2018 for Continental Europe and up to 2028 for North America 
and the United Kingdom. 
Forecasts greater than five years can be justified on the basis that the remaining carrying value of goodwill largely relates to acquired
business units which have been established for over one hundred years. This is further supported by the recent valuations which
were required to be undertaken as a result of the acquisitions made during the year, useful lives of separately identifiable intangibles
acquired on acquisition have been assessed as greater than twenty years. 
The following key assumptions in the value in use calculations were applied to each geographical segment:
• The discount rate used was 6% for the United Kingdom, North America and Continental Europe. This is justified, as although
current interest rates have fallen, the recessionary environment has increased commercial risk.
• Gross margins have been based on historic performance and have been applied on a consistent basis to future projections.
• The budgeted revenue and cost increases were based on the Group’s approved budgets.
• Forecast revenue and cost increases for subsequent years were based on growth rates applied to approved budgets of one 
year and other factors which management consider should be taken into account, such as growth in the backlist revenues,
development of new revenue streams within each geographical segment and cost savings following ongoing operational 
reviews, as follows:
United Kingdom North America Continental Europe
Revenue growth after 2009 4.0% 8.0% 9.0% - 10.0%
Overhead growth after 2009 4.0% - 11.0% 8.0% 4.0% - 10.0%
The directors feel the growth rates, although higher than industry averages, are justifiable on the basis of past performance 
and history of growth in the Group. 
Management is of the opinion that it does not currently foresee a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions it has
employed when determining the value in use calculations that would cause the carrying value of any segment to exceed its
recoverable amount.

48,982 76,213 32,288 74,199
The amounts falling due after more than one year owed by Group undertakings represent loan balances due from the US subsidiary,
which are technically repayable on demand. However there is no intention to demand repayment of the loans within the next twelve
months. During the year £13,954,000 of the US loan was capitalised as the Company’s cost of investment before investment
impairment, as set out in note 10.
Trade receivables comprise amounts receivable from the sale of books. Payments are received on the basis of contracted payment
terms with the distributors and for co-editions according to contractual agreements. At 31 December 2008 the average number of
days’ credit taken for sales of books by the Group was 106 days (2007 , 126 days), and the average number of days’ credit taken by
the Company was 43 days (2007 , 130 days). The difference in the number of days was due to the timing of distributor payments at
the year end. The majority of trade receivables are secured by credit insurance, third party distribut rs and letters of credit. At the
year end an allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of £807 ,000 (2007 , £287 ,000) by
the Group and of £476,000 (2007 , £89,000) by the Company. This allowance has been made by reference to specific debts, past
default experience, trading history and the current economic environment. The increase in the year-end provision on trade receivables
since 31 December 2007 was £520,000 (2007 , £97 ,000) for the Group and £387 ,000 (2007 , £84,000) for the Company. 
As books are returnable by customers, the Group makes a provision against books sold in the accounting period which is then carried
forward in trade receivables in the balance sheet in anticipation of book returns received subsequent to the year end. At the end of
2007 there were outstanding receivables relating to the sale of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, which was published during
that year and cash was received during 2008. A provision for the Group of £7 .78m (2007 , £13.03m) at margin for future returns
relating to 2008 and prior sales has been included in trade receivables in the balance sheet at 31 December 2008. This included 
a provision for the Company of £3.04m (2007 , £8.40m). 
The Group makes a provision against published titles advances which may not be covered by anticipated future sales, paperback
editions or contracts for subsidiary rights receivable. At the end of each financial year a review is carried out on all published titles
advances. If it is unlikely that royalties from future sales, paperback sales or subsidiary rights will fully earn down the advance, 
a provision is made to the income statement for the difference between the carrying value and the anticipated recoverable 
amount from future earnings (the “advance provision”). The advance provision for the Group has been increased by £9.1m since 
31 December 2007 (year to 31 December 2007 , £9.2m). The provision for the Company has been increased by £6.3m (year to 
31 December 2007 , £7 .2m). The net advance is included within prepayments and accrued income. Within the increased provision 
for advances of £9.1m made during the year is an additional amount taken on the basis that in light of the current economic climate
management does not consider those amounts to be recoverable. The value of the additional write off is £5.4m. In addition to books
returned by customers during 2008, there was a write-back in the returns provision relating to a provision brought forward from 2007
which, as a result of the level of returns actually received during the year, is no longer required. The value of the write back to the
Income Statement is £5.1m.

option remains unexercised after a period of ten years (Approved) or seven years (Unapproved) from the date of grant, the options
will expire. Furthermore, except in certain circumstances, options lapse if the employee leaves the Group. No options have been
granted under the Schemes since 2004.

The Bloomsbury Performance Share Plan 2005 (“the PSP Plan”)
Under the rules of the PSP Plan, awards of fully paid Ordinary Shares are granted for nil consideration by the Remuneration
Committee. For the purposes of determining the number of Ordinary Shares comprised in an award, the value of a share shall be
equal to either the average middle-market price of the Ordinary Share for the five dealing days immediately preceding the award 
date or the middle-market price on the dealing day before the award date. The vesting period is generally three years and the level 
of vesting is subject to the achievement of Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) and Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance conditions
(see Remuneration Report on page 44) set by the Remuneration Committee. Except in certain circumstances, awards lapse if the
employee leaves the Group.
No awards were made under the PSP Plan prior to 4 November 2005.

For all awards made under the PSP Plan to date, vesting is on the third anniversary of grant, a three year expected life has been assumed.
The expected volatility was based on Bloomsbury’s share price volatility over the period prior to grant equal in length to the expected three
year life. Half of any award is subject to an EPS performance condition (which is not factored into the valuation) and the other half is subject
to a Total Shareholder Return condition whereby performance is compared to the FTSE Mid 250 companies (excluding Investment Trusts)
over a three year period from the date of grant, with 35% of shares subject to this performance condition vesting for a median ranking rising
to 100% for an upper quartile ranking. The discount for this TSR condition is calculated at the date of grant using the “Monte-Carlo” model.

A period of six years was assumed for the expected life, being the average term as demonstrated in extensive exercise modelling
conducted by New Bridge Street Consultants for their clients. The expected volatility was based on Bloomsbury’s share price volatility
over the period prior to grant equal in length to the expected six year life.
2006 Share Appreciation Rights Scheme (“The SAR Scheme”)
During 2006 the Company introduced an equity-settled share appreciation rights scheme. Under the rules of the SAR Scheme, a
participant, in respect of the number of shares set out in an award, will be granted the right to acquire for nominal value a number 
of ordinary shares in the Company with a value equal to the gain in excess of the exercise price of the award up to the market value
of Bloomsbury’s ordinary shares on the date of exercise. An award becomes exercisable for a period of up to four years after the
vesting date but only if at the date of exercise the Earnings per Share pre-condition is satisfied. Any right not exercised at the end 
of the relevant exercise period will lapse.
No awards were made under the SAR Scheme prior to 17 November 2006.

The Bloomsbury Employee Benefit Trust 2005 (“the EBT”)
Set up in 2005, the EBT is a discretionary trust of which all employees of the Group are potential beneficiaries. The trustee is
independent of the Company. Its main purpose is to operate with the Company’s share schemes, in particular with the PSP Plan.
While the trustee has power to subscribe for Ordinary Shares and acquire Ordinary Shares in the market or from treasury, it is not
permitted to hold more than five per cent of the Company’s issued share capital without prior approval of the shareholders. At 
31 December 2008 the trust held £116 in cash and 88,760 of ordinary shares of 1.25p each, purchased during 2008 for £134,000.

shareholders on 1 July 2009 to Ordinary Shareholders on the register at close of business on 22 May 2009. Based on the number 
of shares currently in issue, the final dividend will be £2,557 ,000 (2007 , £2,428,000). This dividend is subject to approval by the
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
21.  Parent Company result

22.  Financial instruments and risk summary
Financial risk management 
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
1.  Capital risk management 
2.  Market risk
3.  Credit risk
4.  Liquidity risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s management of capital and the
Group’s objectives, policies and procedures for measuring and managing risk. 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. 
The Board has approved the Group Treasury policies and procedures by which the Group Treasury function is to be managed, headed
by the Group Finance Director and part of Bloomsbury’s Finance Department, it operates under a delegated authority from the Board. 
As the Company is responsible for managing the Group’s Treasury function, the same polices and procedures are also adhered to in
the managing of its own function. 
The treasury management policies and procedures focus on the investment of surplus operating cash likely to be needed in order 
to support Bloomsbury’s ongoing operations, foreign currency requirements and interest rate risk management. The policies are
reviewed at least on an annual basis by the Group Finance Director and any amendments approved by the Board. The Board is
assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, who undertake regular reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the
results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. 
1.  Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising 
the return to shareholders as well as sustaining the future development of the business. In order to maintain or adjust the capital
structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders and issue new shares. The Group’s overall strategy
remains unchanged from 2007 .
The capital structure of the Group comprises cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent,
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity and

2.  Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk. 
The Group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest
rates. The Group incurs costs in the same currencies as it earns revenue creating some degree of natural hedging. 
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. 
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by
the Board of Directors. Group Treasury monitors the distribution of its cash assets so as to control exposure to the relative
performance of any particular territory, currency or institution. 
The Board provides written principles for overall risk managements, as well as polices covering specific areas, such as funding,
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investments of excess liquidity. 
(i) Interest rate risk
The Group has significant interest bearing assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents as such cash flows are dependent of
changes in market interest rates. 
The Group maintains a low risk stance to investing cash surplus balances and does not allow speculative trading or investment and
invests surplus funds only in investments that meet certain criteria which includes the following:
•  Meet the permitted rating requirements issued by a recognised rating agency
•  Investing utilising permitted instruments as authorised by the Board
•  Are held at a permitted institution 
•  Have a defined maximum maturity date which is no longer than twelve months unless a UK Government bond
•  Are denominated in sterling, Euro or USD
•  Pay interest at a fixed, floating, or discount rate
•  Are within preferred concentration limits

The Group had no borrowings at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007 .
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The Group derived the following sensitivities to assess the impact of changes in interest rates, based on the effect of the market
volatility in the current climate and the previous 12 months:
2008 2007
£’000 £’000
Impact on equity
2% increase in base rate of interest 1,038 951
2% decrease in base rate of interest (1,038) (951)
Impact on profit or loss
2% increase in base rate of interest 1,038 951
2% decrease in base rate of interest (1,038) (951)
(ii) Currency risk
The Company believes in its current circumstances that the Group’s risk from foreign currency exposure is limited and no active
currency risk management by hedging is considered necessary, as a significant proportion of revenues are matched by expenditure 
in the same local currency creating some degree of natural hedging.
Of the Group’s total financial assets of £76,478,000 (2007 , £96,256,000), comprising certain receivables as above and cash,
£5,770,000 is denominated in US dollars (2007 , £2,986,000) and £1,512,000 is denominated in euros (2007 , £5,457 ,000). Of the
Group’s total financial liabilities of £31,500,000 (2007 , £55,107 ,000), £1,786,000 is denominated in US dollars (2007 , £3,332,000) 
and £2,453,000 is denominated in euros (2007 , £2,330,000). 
Of the Company’s total financial assets of £70,735,000 (2007 , £102,865), comprising certain receivables as above and cash, £688,000
is denominated in US dollars (2007 , £482,000) and £452,000 is denominated in euros (2007 , £438,000). Of the Company’s total 
financial liabilities of £22,902,000 (2007 , £47 ,033,000) £265,000 is denominated in US dollars (2007 , £318,000) and £109,000 
is denominated in euros (2007 , £52,000). 
No financial assets or liabilities are denominated in currencies other than sterling, US dollars and euro.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
The Group derived the following sensitivities based on the foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities at the year
end. The percentage has been determined based on the effect of the market volatility in exchange rates between the current and
previous year end.

Financial Statements- Notes to the Accounts
80971 notes:80971 notes  21/4/09  18:27  Page 94 3.  Credit risk 
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables of £22,939,000 (2007 , £47 ,531,000) and rights income
receivable of £1,631,000 (2007 , £1, 167 ,000), the majority of which is secured by credit insurance, third party distributors and letters 
of credit. The Company’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables of £11,671,000 (2007 , £36,716,000) and rights
income receivable of £1,260,000 (2007 , £1,028,000), the majority of which is secured by credit insurance, third party distributor and
letters of credit. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s
management based on the trading experience and the current economic environment. The movement in the allowance during the year
is shown in note 13.
The majority of trade receivables is due on the basis of set contracted payment terms with the distributors and co-edition contractual
agreements and therefore falls within due dates.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-
rating agencies. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties
and customers.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk, including trade receivables, rights income receivable and cash, is £76,478,000 (2007,
£96,256,000). The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk, including trade receivables, amounts owed by Group undertakings,
rights income receivable and cash, is £70,735,000 (2007 , £102,865,000).
4.  Liquidity Risk 
The Directors do not consider that the Group currently has an exposure to liquidity risk, as the Group has no borrowing and has
sufficient cash deposits to meet its debts as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
Fair value of financial instruments
There is no material difference between the fair value and book value of financial assets and liabilities. 
23.  Related party transactions
Trading transactions
During the year the Company entered into the following transactions and had the following balances with its subsidiaries:
2008 2007

Amounts owed by subsidiaries at year end 9,945 22,683
Amounts owed to subsidiaries at year end 512 1,052
Inter-company loan capitalisation 13,954 3,619

and will be settled in cash. No guarantees have been given or received. No provisions have been made for doubtful debts in respect
of the amounts owed by subsidiaries.

Notice of Annual General Meeting
Bloomsbury Publishing Plc
80971 notes:80971 notes  21/4/09  18:27  Page 100 Notes:
1 Only the holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend the meeting and vote. A member entitled to attend and vote may appoint one or
more proxies to attend, speak and vote on his behalf. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A form of proxy is enclosed for your
use. Further copies of the form of proxy may be obtained from the registered office of the Company.
2 If a member wishes his proxy to speak on his behalf at the Meeting, he or she will need to appoint his own choice of proxy (who is not the
Chairman) and give instructions directly to the proxy. The completion and return of a form of proxy will enable a shareholder to vote at the
General Meeting without having to be present at the General Meeting, but will not preclude him or her from attending the General Meeting
and voting in person if he or she should subsequently decide to do so. 
3 A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares. A member
may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy, please sign and date
the form of proxy and attach a schedule listing the names and addresses (in block letters) of all your proxies, the number of shares in
respect of which each proxy is appointed (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you) and indicating how you
wish each proxy to vote or abstain from voting. If you wish to appoint the Chairman as one of your multiple proxies, insert “Chairman of the
Meeting” in the box which is used to identify the name of the proxy on the relevant proxy card.
4 To be valid, the enclosed form of proxy must be lodged with the Company’s Registrars, Capita Registrars, not later than 48 hours before the
time appointed for the holding of the Annual General Meeting. 
5 Shareholders included on the register of members (in relation to ordinary shares held in CREST , pursuant to Regulation 41 of the
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001) at 6pm on 27 May 2009 will be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting in
respect of the number of ordinary shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to the register of members after that time will be
disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
6 Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information
rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, have a
right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such
proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she, under any such agreement, has a right to give instructions to the
shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
7 The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies does not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights
described in this regard can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
8 Shareholders should note that it is possible that, pursuant to requests made by shareholders of the Company under section 527 of the
Companies Act 2006, the Company may be required to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of
the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting;
or (ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual
accounts and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company may not require the shareholders
requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Companies Act 2006. Where the
Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, it must forward the statement to
the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with
at the Annual General Meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006
to publish on a website.
9 In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that (i) if a
corporate shareholder has appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative to vote on a poll in accordance with the
directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives
will give voting directions to the chairman and the chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with
those directions; and (ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the
corporate shareholder has not appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative
will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will
give voting directions to that designated corporate representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the
Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of this
procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of appointment letter if the chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above.
10 In the case of joint registered holders, the signature of one holder will be accepted and the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether
in person or proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. For this purpose, seniority shall be determined
by the order in which the names stand on the register of members in respect of the relevant 
joint holding.
11 Copies of the following documents will be available for inspection at the Company’s registered office, 36 Soho Square, W1D 3QY , during
usual business hours on any weekday, Saturdays and public holidays excepted, from the date of this notice until the date of the Annual
General Meeting and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting:
• Copies of all service agreements under which Directors of the Company are employed by the Company or any subsidiaries
•  Copies of letters of appointment of the non-executive Directors
• A copy of the Articles of Association of the Company.

 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC / ANNUAL REPORT 2016
ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Welcome to our Annual Report. 
2016 marks an important milestone 
in our journey with our listing on the 
London Stock Exchange. Since Countryside 
was founded in 1958, we have maintained 
a belief that placemaking is more than 
geography. It is both a practice and a 
philosophy. A place to us is as much 
about the feeling people experience in 
our homes as it is the physical buildings. 
We recognise that choosing a place to 
live is just as much an emotional decision 
as a financial one.
As we enter the next phase of growth, 
our philosophy remains unchanged. 
We have secured a leading position, with 
our strategic land bank and relationships 
with regeneration partners, that helps 
create a distinct advantage in the market 
and long-term growth for our business.

 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 3
We have a balanced business with two 
differentiated, complementary divisions 
and a clear strategy for growth over 
the medium term. Growth in the 
Housebuilding division is underpinned 
by the Group’s industry-leading 
strategic land bank of 19,322 plots. 
89 per cent of this land is strategically 
sourced via options and conditional 
contracts with an average 10 per 
cent discount to open market value.
The Partnerships model complements 
the Housebuilding division with a low 
risk, capital-light model building homes 
on public sector land, typically local 
authority estate regeneration and 
brownfield sites. The Group has a 
strong track record of partnership 
development and has an excellent 
pipeline of future work of 14,504 
plots including those at preferred 
bidder stage.

2016 PERFORMANCE
2016 has been another year of significant progress 
for the Group. It marked increased activity for both 
our Partnerships and Housebuilding divisions and 
the return of the business to the London Stock 
Exchange in February 2016. I am delighted to report 
strong results for the year, with a 12 per cent 
increase in completions to 2,657 homes and a 
34 per cent increase in adjusted operating profit 
to £122.5m. 
At 30 September 2016 we had 43 sales outlets, 
14 more than the year before. We have a further 
29 sites under construction, which, when combined 
with a strong sales rate and record private forward 
order book, gives us excellent visibility over our 
growth plans for the coming year. 
More detailed information on our financial 
performance can be found on pages 26 to 29.
STRONG BALANCE SHEET
We have significantly strengthened our balance 
sheet during 2016. We raised £114m of net primary 
proceeds in new share capital when we listed on 
the London Stock Exchange in February. Then in 
May 2016 we successfully refinanced our debt 
facilities, securing a new £300m revolving credit 
facility together with a further £100m accordion 
facility at a lower interest cost. Our financial 
strength positions us well to deliver the growth 
strategy set out at our Initial Public Offering (“IPO”). 
At the year end we had net cash of £12.0m. 
WELL POSITIONED FOR GROWTH
We welcome the Government’s commitment 
to housing and particularly to urban regeneration, 
which is a key differentiator of our business. Our 
track record in delivering regeneration projects 
across London and the North West of England 
over the last 30 years positions us well to help 
local authorities meet their housing needs. We 
continue to work in partnership with both private 
and public sector landowners to develop new 
communities and undertake urban regeneration. 
While we are mindful of the medium-term 
uncertainty over the United Kingdom’s exit from 
the European Union, our targets, as outlined at 
our IPO, remain unchanged. We remain firmly 
on track to deliver our medium term targets of 
over 3,600 completions per year, an adjusted 
operating margin of over 17 per cent and 
improvement in return on capital employed 
(“ROCE”) to over 28 per cent. 
RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS
Our share price has held up well since our flotation, 
despite the turbulence in the market. From our 
IPO date of 17 February 2016 to the end of our 
financial year on 30 September 2016 we delivered 
a total shareholder return of 7.9 per cent. 
We have recommended our first dividend of 
3.4 pence per share. Subject to approval at the 
AGM on 26 January 2017, the dividend will be 
paid on 3 February 2017 to shareholders 
registered at 13 January 2017. 
We have set a target dividend pay-out ratio of 
30 per cent of adjusted earnings as we look to 
use the remaining profits to reinvest in growth, 
while maintaining a broadly debt-neutral strategy. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
During the year we continued to strengthen our 
corporate governance ensuring that the financial, 
operational and qualitative measures required 
to operate our business and manage the risks 
are in place. 
More information can be found within our 
Corporate Governance Report on pages 44 to 46.
OUR PEOPLE
Our people are essential to delivering our  
strategy. At 30 September 2016 we had 1,087 
employees across the business, an increase of 
25 per cent over the prior year. 70 per cent of 
our employees subscribed to our Save As You 
Earn scheme and will therefore participate in 
our growth. 
I would like to thank each and every one 
of our employees for their hard work during 
the course of the year.

A YEAR OF 
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“ We are delighted with the performance of the Group in 2016, delivering solid growth and 
a strengthened balance sheet and marking our return to the London Stock Exchange.  
We enter the 2017 financial year in a strong position with an industry-leading land bank and 
record private forward order book. Our strategy remains to deliver growth, increasing returns 
and capital efficiency from our balanced business models of Housebuilding and Partnerships.  
We see significant growth opportunities in Partnerships with increased estate regeneration 
in London and geographic expansion into the West Midlands, while our increased scale and 
operational efficiency in Housebuilding continues to improve operating margins.” countryside-properties.com

FIRMLY ON TRACK TO DELIVER 
ON OUR GROWTH TARGETS
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
the £600,000 Help-to-Buy threshold. We have a 
strong land bank in both divisions but will look to add 
selectively to this, particularly in the Partnerships 
division, where we seek to expand our footprint 
within our existing geographic areas of operation.
OVERVIEW OF THE MARKET
2016 was another positive year for the housebuilding 
sector, with strong customer demand underpinned 
by a structural shortage in housing, supportive 
Government policy and favourable mortgage lending 
conditions. The demand for all tenures of housing, 
particularly in London and the South East, continues 
to be strong and resilient. Political support from 
all parties in the form of Help-to-Buy and planning 
policy reform has both stimulated demand for 
homes and enabled a greater supply of land 
for development.
The availability of public sector land has also increased, 
with estate regeneration opportunities in London 
expanding significantly as local authorities seek to 
monetise their assets and improve their housing stock. 
The mortgage market has also improved over the 
past 12 months, with a wider range of products, 
low interest rates and stable valuation metrics.
There is evidence of the housing market feeling 
the stress of increased taxation, with the revised 
Stamp Duty Land Tax rates having a negative 
impact on higher value homes and Buy-to-Let 
properties particularly in the second hand 
market. This has been more than offset by the 
growth of Help-to-Buy in the new build market 
under the £600,000 value threshold.
The immediate impact of the EU Referendum in 
June 2016 was relatively short-lived, with cancellation 
rates running higher directly before and after the 
vote. Visitor levels remained solid throughout and 
net reservations returned to their previously strong 
performance within a month of the Referendum. 
The medium-term impact of the Referendum as 
EU exit terms are negotiated is yet to be seen.
PERFORMANCE
Both operating divisions have performed well in 
the past 12 months.
Overall, the Group has grown strongly, with total 
completions up 12 per cent to 2,657 (2015: 2,364) 
on the back of construction site starts and open 
sales outlets. This, combined with a 21 per cent 
increase in Group private average selling price 
(“ASP”) to £465,000 (2015: £385,000), resulted 
GROUP STRATEGY
The Group continues to make progress with its 
strategic objectives of sector-leading growth, top 
quartile returns and building resilience through 
the economic cycle. We deliver this strategy through 
our two balanced operating divisions of Housebuilding 
and Partnerships, both of which offer strong growth 
through differentiated models that manage capital 
efficiency and risk. We deliver well designed properties 
at a wide range of price points, from properties 
aimed at first-time buyers to our premium brand 
Millgate homes.
Our Housebuilding model is based on an 
industry-leading strategic land bank, all of which 
is located in economically resilient markets within 
50 miles of London but without exposure to the 
Central London market. Almost 90 per cent of our 
Housebuilding land bank is strategically sourced via 
long-term planning promotion, which ensures over 
20 years’ visibility of future supply, together with 
an average 10 per cent discount to the prevailing 
open market value. Additionally, as 67 per cent 
of this land is controlled via options or conditional 
contracts, it ensures both balance sheet efficiency 
and flexibility through the cycle.
Our Partnerships division operates in the outer 
boroughs of London, the North West of England 
and, from the 2017 financial year, the West Midlands. 
Like Housebuilding, it delivers private and affordable 
homes on larger sites, typically public sector 
brownfield sites or local authority estate 
regeneration. The land is sourced via public 
procurement or direct negotiation and is typically 
low value being developed in partnership with 
local authorities, housing associations or Private 
Rental Sector (“PRS”) providers. As such, it is a 
low capital model offering strong returns and the 
flexibility of long-term development agreements, 
many with phased viability and priority returns. 
The division has an excellent track record of 
winning new work, reflecting over 30 years of 
experience on over 45 regeneration schemes, 
strong relationships with local authorities and 
expertise in placemaking. Typically we secure 
around 40 per cent of bids we submit, which 
gives significant visibility of future work, with a 
current pipeline (land bank plus preferred bidder) 
of over seven years.
We aim to maintain the balance between our two 
divisions depending on market conditions, delivering 
over 80 per cent of our private for sale homes below 
The Group continues to make progress with its strategic objectives 
of sector-leading growth, superior returns and building resilience 
through the cycle. STRATEGIC REPORT
 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 7
6,434 plots. These included Beam Park (Dagenham), 
Rochester (Kent), Hounslow (London) and a number 
of smaller sites in our Partnerships North region. 
At Group level, adjusted gross margin improved 
30bps to 21.9 per cent (2015: 21.6 per cent). 
Adjusted operating margin improved further, up 
100bps to 15.8 per cent (2015: 14.8 per cent), 
due to greater scale and overhead efficiency. 
When combined with the additional volume, this 
has delivered a 34 per cent increase in adjusted 
operating profit to £122.5m (2015: £91.2m). 
On a reported basis, operating profit increased 
29 per cent to £87.3m (2015: £67.9m). Improved 
capital efficiency, combined with stronger earnings, 
have resulted in return on capital employed increasing 
to 26.8 per cent, up 210bps on the prior year 
(2015: 24.7 per cent).
During the course of the year we experienced 
between three per cent and five per cent build 
cost inflation, initially as a result of higher labour 
costs, although these eased somewhat in the 
second half of the year. We continue to build on 
our strong relationships with our supply chain. 
By giving them excellent visibility over future 
workload, we are able to deliver efficiencies for 
both parties, which helps control our build costs. 
The quality of our business has also been maintained 
throughout this period of growth. Our health and 
safety Accident Incident Rate was 305 (2015: 265) 
and our National House Building Council (“NHBC”) 
reportable items were 0.23 (2015: 0.22) per home. 
Both of these measures are significantly ahead of 
the industry benchmarks. Our customer service 
has improved over the prior year, with our NHBC 
Recommend a Friend score now standing at 
84.8 per cent (2015: 82.7 per cent).
OUTLOOK
Current trading remains robust with sales rates 
and values above year end numbers. The markets 
in which we operate have recovered post the EU 
Referendum and we continue to trade well. We 
remain successful at winning new Partnerships work 
and we had 6,623 plots with preferred bidder status 
compared with 2,957 plots a year earlier. Additionally 
we are working on a potential bid pipeline of a 
further 33,515 plots. Reservations remain robust and 
any softness in higher price points has been more 
than compensated for by our lower priced homes 
and our Partnerships division, which performed 
strongly during the year. Across the Group we 
continue to open new sites, with 43 open sales 
outlets at year end and a further 29 sites under 
construction, giving us great visibility over delivery in 
2017. We have started the year with a record private 
forward order book up 64 per cent and continued 
strong demand which gives us great confidence in 
delivering both our growth plans for 2017 and our 
medium term targets. 
We remain firmly on track to deliver our medium 
term targets of over 3,600 total completions 
per year, an adjusted operating margin of over 
17 per cent and an improvement in return on 
capital employed to in excess of 28 per cent.

in a 26 per cent increase in adjusted revenue 
to £777.0m (2015: £615.8m). On a reported 
basis, revenue increased 23 per cent to £671.3m 
(2015: £547.5m) Our reservation rate per open 
sales outlet remained steady at 0.78 (2015: 0.76) 
despite the increased number of sales outlets 
at 43 (2015: 29) and a short period of more 
cautious consumer behaviour around the 
EU Referendum. At 30 September 2016 we 
had a further 29 sites under construction. 
Our Housebuilding division performed 
well, with total completions up 20 per cent at 
783 homes versus 653 in 2015. Private ASP increased 
14 per cent to £665,000 (2015: £583,000) largely 
driven by product mix and underlying house price 
inflation, particularly in the London commuter 
markets. We saw particular strength in the mid 
priced market and we continue to plan our product 
to ensure it remains affordable for local people. 
Despite a tougher market above £1m, our premium 
brand Millgate delivered another strong performance 
with 81 private completions in the year, up from 
52 in 2015. 
We started on 15 new Housebuilding sites during 
the year, including two new phases at Beaulieu in 
Chelmsford, one of our key strategic sites, and three 
new sites in our Southern Housebuilding region 
as we expand our operations there. 
Our Partnerships division delivered a strong 
performance, with total completions up 10 per cent 
at 1,874 homes versus 1,711 homes in 2015. The 
Partnerships private ASP rose sharply, up 27 per cent 
to £307,000 (2015: £242,000), driven by site mix, 
the effect of placemaking as we continue with our 
large estate regeneration projects and house price 
inflation in the sub £600,000 price points. During 
the year we delivered homes on a number of key 
regeneration schemes, including St. Paul’s Square in 
Bow and Brook Valley Gardens in Barnet, and are 
now on site with four different phases at our 
flagship site in Acton. 
PRS homes delivered the largest element of growth 
for our Partnerships North region in partnership 
with Sigma Capital Group and we continue to see 
PRS as an important method for meeting housing 
demand across the country. In total, we started 
work on 21 new Partnerships sites during the year. 
We see increasing demand for us to work 
in partnership to regenerate public sector land

us winning bids during the year which will deliver

8 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC
The UK housing market has been in a long-term 
position of structural undersupply as the number 
of new homes built has failed to keep pace with 
the number of new household formations and the 
replacement of redundant stock (see chart 1).
Over the past few years there has been a recovery 
in the housing market driven by wider economic 
recovery, increased access to low cost mortgage 
financing, improved availability of land through the 
planning process and Government support for 
the housing sector. These remain key drivers for 
the market over the longer term with the outlook 
strong in the near term. 
INCREASING DEMAND FOR HOUSING
Mortgage availability and affordability
One of the leading indicators for UK housing activity 
is the level and value of mortgage approvals. 
Seasonally adjusted mortgage approvals remain 
well below peak levels at around 835,000 approvals 
over the 12 months to 30 June 2016 versus 1.4 million 
in the comparable period in 2007 (see chart 2). 
Since the low point in gross mortgage lending 
of £144bn in 2009, the Council of Mortgage 
Lenders reported a pick-up to £220bn in 2015, 
which remains significantly below the peak of 
£363bn in 2007. 
House price inflation (“HPI”) 
UK house prices have increased by 5.0 per cent 
over the past 12 months as demand for housing has 
remained strong, albeit with some significant 
regional variances. On average, house prices have 
risen by 7.3 per cent per annum over the past 20 
years (see chart 3).
POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR THE UK 
HOUSEBUILDING SECTOR AND, IN 
PARTICULAR, URBAN REGENERATION 
REMAINS STRONG
Since the creation of the National Planning Policy 
Framework in 2012 and the introduction of 
Help-to-Buy in 2013, there has been strong 
and consistent political support for housebuilding 
in the UK. 
Planning
The Government announced several planning 
reforms in its 2015 report “Fixing the foundations: 
Creating a more prosperous nation” including 
tightening planning performance by punishing 
local authorities that make 50 per cent or fewer 
planning decisions on time, introducing a dispute 
resolution mechanism for section 106 agreements, 
and announcing an intent to not proceed with 
the zero carbon Allowable Solutions carbon 
offsetting scheme. In addition, initiatives such 
as the National Planning Policy Framework have 
made the planning system less complex and are 
ensuring greater land supply. 
Help-to-Buy
Help-to-Buy equity share is designed to encourage 
home ownership in the UK. Under the scheme, 
buyers put down a minimum five per cent deposit 
and the UK Government provides an equity loan 
of up to 40 per cent inside London and 20 per cent 
outside of London up to a maximum purchase 
price of £600,000. The property must be a new 
build home and the buyer’s only home. Funding for 
the scheme has been increased a number of 
times since the initial launch in April 2013 and 
currently runs through to 2021. The Help-to-Buy 
mortgage guarantee scheme will be concluded at 
the end of 2016. This scheme provided support 
for homeowners seeking a 95 per cent mortgage; 
however, this has been replaced by the mortgage 
lenders and had little take-up.
The Government also launched the Help-to-Buy 
ISA scheme on 1 December 2015, through which 
the Government will provide a bonus of £50 for 
every £200 saved up to a maximum bonus of 
£3,000, payable on purchase of a new home.

THE UK HOUSING MARKET
Demand for all tenures of housing, particularly in London and the South East, 
continues to be strong and resilient. Political support through Help-to-Buy and 
planning policy reform has both stimulated demand and ensured greater supply 
of land for development.

Affordable homes
The Affordable Homes Programme was established 
in 2008 to increase the supply of new affordable 
homes in England, with the majority of required 
homes for affordable rent. It is currently in its 
third round of funding, which covers the period 
from 2015–2018. It will provide £2.9bn of funding, 
£1.7bn of which is available for the delivery of 
165,000 new affordable homes outside London 
and £1.25bn for the delivery of 45,000 new 
affordable homes in Greater London.
Regeneration
The UK Government announced in January 2016 
that it will seek to regenerate some of England’s 
most run-down housing estates, following a report 
by Savills which stated that approximately 50,000 
new homes are needed in London over each of 
the next 20 years to make up for past shortfalls 
in housing supply and to meet new demand. 
According to Savills, the regeneration of these 
housing estates has the potential to provide 
somewhere between 190,000 and 500,000 homes, 
of which between 54,000 and 360,000 would be 
new, representing a significant increase over the 
number of existing homes. In its statement, the UK 
Government announced the formation of a new 
Estate Regeneration Advisory Panel and committed 
£140.0m to help fund regeneration of these estates.
Stamp Duty
Over recent years there have been a number 
of changes to Stamp Duty Land Tax (“SDLT”), 
which is payable on the purchase of a residential 
property over £125,000 in the UK. Before 
December 2014 there was a tiered system where 
the effective tax rate stepped up at different 
thresholds. This was subsequently replaced by a 
blended rate system with higher tax rate payable 
on properties above £1m (see chart 4). The 
Government further reformed the system in the 
2015 Autumn Statement, increasing SDLT by a 
further three per cent for purchasers of 
Buy-to-Let or second homes. 
EU Referendum
On the 23 June 2016, the UK population voted to 
leave the EU. As a result there was a short-term 
impact on consumer confidence which led to a 
temporary increase in cancellation rates. Visitor 
levels and gross reservations remained unchanged 
through that period and within a month of the vote, 
trading was back to normal with virtually all 
cancelled reservations resold. 
The wider impact of the Brexit vote is unknown 
and could result in some uncertainty while the 
terms of exit are negotiated. A devaluation of 
Sterling will have an impact on imported materials, 
such as timber and steel, and any restrictions on 
EU labour may cause delays to developments 
and potential cost increases. 
Chart 3 Chart 4
MARKET OPPORTUNITIES
Strength in the market under 
£600,000
The segment of greatest demand in the 
housing sector remains first-time buyers. 
Historically, new build has accounted for 
around 10 per cent of all first-time buyer 
transactions, with the remainder in the 
second-hand market. With growing new 
build supply and Government support for 
the sector in the form of Help-to-Buy, 
coupled with strong demographic demand, 
the share of first-time buyers has grown 
and now represents 49 per cent of 
Countryside’s private completions. 
Nearly all first-time buyer transactions are 
below the £600,000 Help-to-Buy maximum 
value, with the increased equity share to 
40 per cent in London further boosting this 
demand. Our geographic presence in strong 
commuter markets and outer London 
Boroughs continues to make our homes 
good value in comparison to neighbouring 
higher priced areas. Managing our product 
mix to meet location, affordability and 
Government support is therefore critical 
to delivering both increased completions 
and price growth.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW: HOUSEBUILDING
CONTINUED
STRATEGY
Our Housebuilding operations develop medium 
to larger-scale sites, providing private and affordable 
housing on land owned or controlled by the Group. 
Operations are focused on the outer London 
Boroughs and the South East of England, 
predominantly in the London commuter towns. 
Within our Housebuilding division, we look to 
maintain our industry-leading strategic land bank 
with almost 90 per cent of our land strategically 
sourced at 30 September 2016. In total we had 
19,322 plots within our Housebuilding land bank 
(2015: 18,410) of which only 33 per cent was 
owned outright with the rest controlled by either 
option agreements or conditional contracts. 
This provides flexibility, creates value through 
embedded discounts to open market value 
and enhances the efficiency of the balance sheet, 
while still giving us strong visibility of future work.
MARKET
During the year, in the markets in which we 
operate, we continued to see strong demand 
for new housing outstripping supply, particularly 
in the outer London Boroughs and commuter 
towns. We saw a dual speed market, segmented 
by price band rather than by geographic location, 
with product under £600,000 delivering strong 
price growth, both as a result of demand for 
our product and the support of Help-to-Buy. 
Above £600,000, house price inflation was 
more muted as trade-up from the second-hand 
market became more difficult and affordability 
became stretched. 
Despite the differentiation in house price inflation, 
sales rates were strong throughout the first half 
of the year at all price points. This continued into 
the second half with no real impact seen from 
the changes in Buy-to-Let investor Stamp Duty 
in April 2016, given our relatively limited exposure 
to that market. The period immediately before 
and after the EU Referendum saw a short-term 
increase in cancellations impacting our net 
reservation rate. This was largely confined to the 
London and commuter markets, with little or no 
impact in the regions. 
Help-to-Buy continues to be an important 
mechanism for purchasers, with the increase in 
the London Help-to-Buy threshold to 40 per cent 
in February further supporting the new build market. 
The planning environment remains broadly positive 
with the Government having introduced a variety 
of reforms over the past two years including 
initiatives such as the National Planning Policy 
Framework, which has made the planning system 
less complex and is ensuring greater land supply.
OUR PERFORMANCE
During 2016, our Housebuilding division continued 
to grow well, underpinned by strong customer 
demand for quality homes, particularly in the 
Home Counties and outer London Boroughs. 
Total completions were up 20 per cent to 
783 units (2015: 653 units). 
Total private completions of 499 units were up 
nine per cent (2015: 456) driven by sales across 
a range of sites with particular contributions from 
our sites in Cambridge, Harold Wood, Little Hollows 
and St Luke’s Park in Essex, and Wickhurst Green 
in West Sussex. Our premium brand, Millgate, 
delivered significant growth in private homes of 
over 50 per cent which, along with an improvement 
in product mix, contributed to a 14 per cent 
increase in the Housebuilding private ASP to 
£665,000 (2015: £583,000).
Affordable completions of 284 units were higher 
than the prior year (2015: 192 homes) as a result 
of the mix of sites in the period. 
OUR HOUSEBUILDING 
DIVISION CONTINUED 
TO GROW WELL, 
UNDERPINNED BY 
STRONG CUSTOMER 
DEMAND FOR 
QUALITY HOMES.
We continued to develop out our legacy sites at 
Harold Wood, Essex and Horsted Park, Kent in 
the period, delivering 127 homes from the two sites 
combined with a further 505 homes planned 
between now and 2020, which is the expected 
completion for those sites. Demand for these 
sites remains strong with good transport links 
at both locations. 
LAND BANK
During the year we acquired 14 Housebuilding 
sites with a total of 1,931 plots, taking our 
Housebuilding land bank to 19,322 plots at 
30 September 2016 (2015: 18,410). We continue 
to focus on maintaining balance sheet flexibility, 
with only 6,388 plots directly owned (2015: 4,993) 
and the remainder either controlled or under 
option agreements. 
We were successful on a number of planning 
applications, with planning gains on 1,289 plots 
during the year including 800 plots at one of our 
strategically sourced sites in Maidstone, Kent.
In addition to new sites coming through our pool 
of option agreements, during the year we bought 
out our joint venture partner, Land Securities, at 
our Springhead development at Ebbsfleet in Kent. 
This gives us control over more than five years’ 
worth of production at that site. We also continue 
to look at land sales where developing the site 
is not part of our core offering (for example 
commercial developments or where we are a 
smaller partner). During 2016 we completed 
three significant land sales at Bury St Edmunds 
(Suffolk), Bicester Village (Oxfordshire) and 
Medipark (Cambridge).

on site to make sure it is affordable for local people. 
We are currently replanning phases at Beaulieu, 
Chelmsford, and Great Kneighton, Cambridge, to 
ensure product and price points fit with demand. 
We expanded our position in Kent with a larger 
office at Sevenoaks for our Southern region. This 
business has more than doubled in size over the 
past three years with further new sites due to 
come on stream during the course of 2017 
and 2018.

 – 3,660 new homes and in excess of 118 acres of parks and open spaces
 – 24 acres providing employment, leisure, retail and new railway station
 – Delivery: 2014 to 2027
Located north west of Chelmsford, Beaulieu is designed to be a major new district for the 
city of Chelmsford, comprising approximately 3,660 new homes on the 700-acre site. Beaulieu 
has a landscaped master-planned setting that will include a new business park, community centre, 
schools, shops, railway station and local road improvements including links to the A12 dual carriageway. 
Beaulieu is being undertaken in joint venture with London & Quadrant (“L&Q”), with profits 
split between the two parties. During 2016, the joint venture delivered 119 new homes, 
as well as starting on site on the neighbourhood centre, due for delivery in 2017.
The initial site was strategically sourced in 1988 and was added to under multiple 
option agreements from 2000 to 2007. The Group commenced development of Beaulieu 
in November 2014 and sales began in August 2015. The site currently has two open sales 
outlets and is on site with three different phases. The tenure mix is 73 per cent private 
housing and 27 per cent affordable housing.

STRATEGY
Our Partnerships division specialises in medium 
to large-scale urban regeneration of public sector 
land delivering private and affordable homes. 
It operates primarily in and around London and 
in the North West of England, with a new office 
opened in Wolverhampton in 2016 to service 
the West Midlands conurbations from 2017. 
Our Partnerships model is a resilient, low-risk, 
low-capital model where we look to develop 
regeneration projects in partnerships, predominantly 
with public sector landowners, such as local 
authorities and housing associations. We have a 
track record of delivering more than 45 regeneration 
projects over 30 years, making us one of the most 
experienced deliverers of regeneration in the UK. 
Developments are mixed tenure in nature with a 
focus on delivering tenure-blind private, 
affordable and Private Rental Sector (“PRS”) 
homes in line with the Group’s placemaking 
ethos. 
The business models in the North and South are 
based on the needs of the local areas and therefore 
differ in product mix but are based on the same 
principles. Our Northern business builds largely 
low-rise timber-framed family houses whereas 
our Southern business often operates in more 
space constrained environments with a mix of 
mid-rise apartment blocks and family housing. 
MARKET
During the year we saw significant interest in 
our regeneration offering, with the need for 
more housing in the London regions in particular, 
highlighted by a Savills report commissioned by the 
UK Government and published in January 2016. 
At the time of the publication, the UK Government 
announced that it will seek to regenerate some of 
England’s most run-down housing estates. It stated 
that 50,000 additional new homes are needed in 
London alone over each of the next 20 years to 
make up for past shortfalls in housing supply and 
to meet new demand. To support this, the 
formation of a new Estate Regeneration Advisory 
Panel and £140m of funding to regenerate these 
estates was announced.
9.5%
increase in completions
In our Northern business, the supply of public 
sector land remains solid with a strong pipeline 
of opportunities for mixed-tenure developments, 
particularly those that incorporate PRS homes. 
As with our Housebuilding division, demand 
for private for sale homes was robust across all 
geographies and reservation rates were strong 
throughout the year, aside from a temporary 
increase in cancellation rates in the South during 
the period immediately before and after the EU 
Referendum. Our Northern business did not 
experience any EU Referendum-related 
cancellations. Similarly, we saw particular strength 
in the price bands below £600,000 in the South, 
which represents nearly all our product in our 
Partnerships division, and below £300,000 in the 
North West of England. 
OUR PERFORMANCE
Our Partnerships business delivered an excellent 
performance during 2016, setting the pace for delivery 
in 2017. Total completions were up 10 per cent 
to 1,874 units (2015: 1,711 units) driven by 
significant growth in affordable completions up 
17 per cent, as expected, with the private element 
of delivery on those sites planned for 2017. 
A large element of the growth in affordable 
completions came from our Northern business 
where we continue to develop our partnership 
with Sigma Capital Group for PRS homes. During 
the year we delivered 725 PRS homes for Sigma 
with a further 975 identified plots within our 
land bank. The delivery of PRS homes, alongside 
private for sale homes, continued to be successful 
during the year. We adopted a similar tenure-blind 
approach to elsewhere in the business, including 
WE HAVE HAD AN

at Norris Green Village (Liverpool) where we 
delivered 135 PRS units in 2016 alongside the sale 
of 35 private homes. 
T otal private completions of 628 units were broadly 
flat on the prior year (2015: 634) with a strong 
increase in private ASP of 27 per cent to £307,000 
(2015: £242,000). This large increase was as a 
result of house price inflation, with the majority 
of product sitting in the sub £600,000 price bracket, 
the regeneration effect, along with a change in 
mix of sites with more in outer London Boroughs 
than satellite towns. Major schemes in the year 
included Acton (Ealing), St. Paul’s Square (Bow) 
and Brook Valley Gardens (Barnet), with Acton 
and St. Paul’s Square also expected to be a 
significant part of 2017 delivery, particularly 
for the private units.

LAND BANK
As at 30 September 2016, our Partnerships division 
had 7,881 plots within the land bank (2015: 7,803) 
with a further 6,623 plots at preferred bidder 
status (2015: 2,957). We have had an outstanding 
year for winning new work in our Partnerships 
division with 6,434 plots awarded as preferred 
bidder. These included 2,781 plots at Beam Park 
(Dagenham), 1,262 plots at Rochester (Kent), 
and 288 plots at Hounslow (London) all for our 
Partnerships South business. Our Partnerships 
North business also had a strong year for bid 
success, albeit sites typically tend to be medium 
sized with the award of 284 plots at Western 
Avenue (Liverpool) and our first two sites in the 
West Midlands totalling 367 plots combined. 
In addition to where we have been awarded preferred 
bidder status we have identified a further 33,515 
plots in our current bid pipeline (2015: 15,487) 
providing excellent visibility of future work and 
growth opportunity across all our geographies. 
OUTLOOK
We continue to see increased growth opportunity 
in the Partnerships division. We have maintained our 
historic bid win rate at 40 per cent and now have 
over seven years of future work secured. 
Furthermore the bid pipeline has grown to 33,515 
plots. The public sector seeks to regenerate Local 
Authority housing estates and brownfield land. We 
see continued demand for our homes both from 
private for sale, PRS and affordable. This mixed 
tenure approach is both accelerating delivery in the 
short term and also providing resilience in the 
medium term. 
ACTON GARDENS, LONDON 
One of the largest regeneration 
schemes of its kind.
 – Over 2,800 new homes (50 per cent affordable)
 – New social and community facilities centred around 55,000 sq ft hub
 – Delivery: 2010 to 2026
Located across the railway bridge from Chiswick, the South Acton estate is one of the largest 
estates to be regenerated in Britain. At the time we started on site, the estate was riddled 
with decaying properties and antisocial behaviour. It neither looked nor felt safe. 
We are now six years into a 16-year project with over 500 homes completed or underway. 
We are working with the London Borough of Ealing, L&Q and local residents. The project 
involves an investment of around £840m over 21 phases of development, with over 500 staff 
working on site at any one time. Creative placemaking is at the heart of the project’s design 
and delivery. 
The masterplan includes plans for over 2,800 homes to replace the pre-existing 1,800 largely 
socially rented homes. The scheme has a target of 50 per cent affordable housing, and 
tenure-blind design and management. 
The community is key to the delivery of the scheme, with residents given a say in how the 
masterplan is developed and delivered, along with a number of community initiatives to help 
enhance local residents’ lives. To date, 46 projects have been funded through the “community 
chest” initiative, where £50,000 per annum is allocated for initiatives such as after school clubs 
and IT training. In addition, the project allows for £3.5m of funding for local infrastructure 
including schools and healthcare facilities as well as better public spaces, with new public 
parks equivalent to two football pitches planned. 
During 2016, the joint venture delivered 233 new homes, winning both the Regeneration Award 
and a project award at the Housing Design Awards 2016. It is currently active on four different 
phases, including the central plaza, which will include a youth centre, a shop and other 
community facilities.

A YEAR OF STRONG 
PERFORMANCE
GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
TRADING PERFORMANCE
T otal completions were up 12 per cent to 2,657 homes (2015: 2,364 homes) 
which, combined with an increase in private average selling price (“ASP”) 
of 21 per cent to £465,000 (2015: £385,000), increased adjusted revenue 
by 26 per cent to £777.0m (2015: £615.8m). Statutory revenue increased 
by 23 per cent to £671.3m (2015: £547.5m). The difference between the 
adjusted and reported measures reflects the proportionate consolidation 
of the Group’s joint ventures.
Our continued focus on operational efficiency as well as the divisional mix 
of the business resulted in an increase in adjusted operating margin up 100bps 
to 15.8 per cent (2015: 14.8 per cent) and a 34 per cent increase in adjusted 
operating profit to £122.5m (2015: £91.2m). Statutory operating profit increased 
by 29 per cent to £87.3m (2015: £67.9m). The difference between the adjusted 
and reported measures reflects the proportionate consolidation of the Group’s 
associate and joint ventures and non-underlying items relating to the Group’s 
IPO and legacy management incentive plan, partially offset by the reversal 
of a receivable impairment.
Group
Another year of strong growth saw total completions of 2,657 homes 
(2015: 2,364 homes), up 12 per cent year on year.
Private unit completions increased by 3 per cent to 1,127 homes 
(2015: 1,090 homes). Private ASP increased 21 per cent to £465,000 
(2015: £385,000), driven by a greater proportion of our private sales 
being in the Housebuilding division. Within the Partnerships division, there 
was a higher proportion of private homes delivered in Greater London 
compared to the prior year. In both divisions, growth has been strongest 
at the lower price points, particularly below £600,000, with house price 
inflation on a like-for-like basis steady at 6 per cent (2015: 6 per cent).
Affordable completions were up 22 per cent in the period to 1,415 homes 
(2015: 1,161 homes). Within this, Private Rental Sector (“PRS”) sales were 
up 60 per cent to 738 homes (2015: 461 homes) due to the increased 
number of PRS homes delivered in the North West with our strategic 
partner Sigma Capital Group (“Sigma”). Design and Build completions were 
broadly flat at 115 homes (2015: 113 homes). 
As a result, total adjusted revenue increased by 26 per cent to £777.0m 
(2015: £615.8m). On a reported basis, revenue increased by 23 per cent 
to £671.3m (2015: £547.5m). 
Private forward sales were up 64 per cent to a record £225.4m (2015: £137.5m), 
reflecting robust trading through the summer months and the continued 
strength of the market at price points below £600,000.
We have delivered a strong set of results since listing, with both 
divisions performing well, and we remain firmly on track to deliver 
the medium-term targets set out at IPO. STRATEGIC REPORT
 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 27
Our reservation rate per open sales outlet remained steady at 0.78 (2015: 
0.76) with the uplift in revenue driven by the increased number of sales outlets 
at 43 (2015: 29). The introduction of 40 per cent Help-to-Buy in London from 
February 2016 helped sustain reservation rates and whilst we saw a short-term 
increase in cancellations following the EU Referendum in June 2016, our net 
reservation rate returned to normal levels after a few weeks and, with 
cancelled reservations resold, this has had no impact on results for the year. 
Adjusted gross margin (including the Group’s share of associate and joint venture 
gross profit) increased by 30bps to 21.9 per cent (2015: 21.6 per cent), in 
particular supported by regeneration schemes in the outer London Boroughs. 
This, together with tight cost control as the business grew, resulted in an uplift 
in adjusted operating margin of 100bps to 15.8 per cent (2015: 14.8 per cent). 
The significant investment made in new offices and increased headcount in 
previous years has now slowed and should aid future operating margin accretion. 
Adjusted operating profit increased by 34 per cent to £122.5m (2015: £91.2m), 
as a result of the increased scale of the business and margin accretion discussed 
above. Within this, land sales contributed £10.6m (2015: £0.2m), including a 
number of overage receipts with a further £5.9m (2015: £11.3m) delivered 
through commercial sales. 
On a reported basis, operating profit increased by 29 per cent to £87.3m 
(2015: £67.9m) with the difference to adjusted profit being the impact 
of significant growth at key sites, including Acton Gardens, London, and 
Beaulieu Park, Chelmsford, which took place in joint ventures.
After raising £114m of net primary proceeds in the IPO, we successfully 
refinanced the business, signing a £300m revolving credit facility in May 2016 
on enhanced terms. We ended the year with net cash of £12.0m (2015: net 
debt £59.5m) and expect lower interest costs in 2017.
Housebuilding
Our Housebuilding division continued its growth trajectory as we saw customer 
demand maintained throughout the year. T otal completions were up 20 per cent 
to 783 homes (2015: 653 homes) as we opened additional sales outlets during 
the year. As a result, adjusted revenue increased by 29 per cent to £427.1m 
(2015: £330.7m).
Private completions increased by nine per cent on 2015 to 499 (2015: 456), 
at an ASP of £665,000 (2015: £583,000). We continued to see strength in 
the market at prices below £600,000 with Help-to-Buy supporting the market 
at this level. At higher prices, particularly over £1m, the market has been more 
challenging, although sales volumes in this price band were ahead of 2015.
Affordable revenue increased by 68 per cent to £44.6m (2015: £26.5m), 
with completions of 284 (2015: 192) and an increase in ASP up 13 per cent 
to £157,000 from £139,000.
Housebuilding adjusted gross margin reduced by 90bps to 22.4 per cent 
(2015: 23.3 per cent) as we incurred additional costs at our joint venture 
with Annington Developments Limited at Mill Hill, London, following the 
insolvency of a principal sub-contractor. We were able to offset this 
reduction by tight control of overheads, resulting in adjusted operating 
margin remaining steady at 15.6 per cent (2015: 15.6 per cent). 
With growth in sales, we delivered a 30 per cent uplift in adjusted operating 
profit to £66.8m (2015: £51.6m). Housebuilding represented 55 per cent 
of Group adjusted operating profit in 2016 (2015: 57 per cent). 
In the second half of the year, we completed the buyout of our joint venture 
partner, Land Securities, at our development in Springhead, Kent, giving us greater 
flexibility to develop the site. T o date we have developed almost 300 homes 
at the site with plans for a further 500 homes.
On a reported basis, Housebuilding revenue increased by 28 per cent to £358.1m 
(2015: £278.7m) with growth coming from the increased number of open sales 
outlets and house price growth. Reported Housebuilding operating profit 
increased to £48.5m (2015: £38.0m). 
Partnerships
Our Partnerships division has had a strong year, with total completions 
up 10 per cent to 1,874 homes (2015: 1,711 homes) and adjusted revenue 
up 23 per cent to £349.9m (2015: £285.1m). A combination of site mix 
and underlying house price inflation in the period resulted in an increase 
in private ASP of 27 per cent to £307,000 (2015: £242,000).
Private completions of 628 homes were down one per cent on the prior 
period (2015: 634 homes). This reflects the mix of sites in the period and 
we would expect the growth rate in private homes to increase in 2017 as 
schemes such as St. Paul’s Square, Bow and East City Point, Canning T own 
deliver a full year of production. Affordable completions were up substantially 
at 1,131 homes (2015: 969 homes). These affordable completions included the 
delivery of PRS housing in our ongoing partnership with Sigma in the North 
West which contributed 725 completions (2015: 461).
Adjusted gross margin was up 160bps to 21.3 per cent (2015: 19.7 per cent) 
due to the impact of site mix together with house price inflation. Adjusted 
operating profit of £55.6m was up 40 per cent in the period (2015: £39.6m), 
with our operations in the South performing particularly well. The increase 
in gross margins, combined with a tight focus on divisional cost control, 
resulted in adjusted operating margin increasing by 200bps to 15.9 per cent 
(2015: 13.9 per cent). Partnerships represented 45 per cent of Group 
adjusted operating profit in 2016 (2015: 43 per cent).
Demand for our product has remained strong, particularly at lower price points 
and in London following the introduction of the Government’s 40 per cent 
Help-to-Buy scheme from February 2016, which has improved affordability 
of housing. 
We made good progress in identifying new opportunities to expand our 
Partnerships model into the West Midlands, where we will shortly begin 
development of our first site of 186 homes at Rowley Regis. We opened 
an office in Wolverhampton in the summer and we have continued to 
control overheads by utilising resources from our Partnerships business 
in the North West to develop these opportunities.
On a reported basis, Partnerships revenue increased by 17 per cent to 
£313.2m (2015: £268.7m) with of sales from St. Paul’s Square, Bow and 
continued strong performance from other Partnerships sites. Partnerships 
reported operating profit increased to £51.3m (2015: £33.8m).

GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
CONTINUED
TRADING PERFORMANCE CONTINUED
Non-underlying items
During the year, the Group engaged in corporate activity in relation to the 
listing of its ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange. Advisory costs 
of £10.6m (2015: £1.7m) were incurred in relation to this activity. These 
costs primarily relate to the fees of professional advisors.
The non-recurring charge of £2.7m in the year to 30 September 2015 related 
to the non-cash impairment of a receivable which management believed to be 
irrecoverable. Subsequent to the year end, substantially all of this amount was 
received in cash by the Group, resulting in a reversal of the impairment 
of £2.6m in 2016.
In the year ended 30 September 2013, a management incentive plan (“Plan”) 
was approved in which certain senior employees of Countryside Properties 
(UK) Limited, a subsidiary company, were invited to acquire shares issued by 
OCM Luxembourg Coppice Holdco S.à r.l.. Further shares were issued under 
the Plan during the years ended 30 September 2014 and 2015.
£1.9m was charged to the income statement in the year ended 
30 September 2016 (2015: £1.3m) in respect of non-cash accounting 
charges related to the Plan, including £1.0m (2015: £Nil) which arose as 
a result of the IPO.
The Group entered into a new debt facility with four lending banks in May 2016. 
As a result of the new facility, the previous facility was repaid in full in May 2016 
and the capitalised arrangement fees of £3.2m relating to the previous facility 
were expensed within finance costs.
A total tax credit of £1.0m (2015: £1.4m) in relation to all of the above 
non-underlying items was included within taxation in the income statement.

Net finance costs
Net finance costs were £28.3m (2015: £50.5m). £16.5m (2015: £41.0m) of 
finance costs in relation to mandatory redeemable preference shares issued 
to the Group’s previous owner were incurred prior to the Group’s IPO in 
February 2016. On IPO, these preference shares and all accrued interest 
were repaid in full. 
Interest on bank debt decreased by £1.1m to £5.2m (2015: £6.3m), reflecting 
both lower levels of debt during the year following the receipt of £114.0m of 
net primary proceeds on IPO and lower borrowing costs in the Group’s new 
debt facility. The interest cost associated with the new facility will be lower 
than under the previous facility, reflecting the Group’s new status as a listed 
entity and lower market rates. The interest rate on the Group’s debt is variable, 
based on LIBOR and the Group’s gearing ratio as measured quarterly.

Net finance costs 28,343 50,491
Countryside expects net finance costs in 2017 to be lower than 2016, 
reflecting lower debt levels and interest rates following the IPO.
Taxation
The income tax charge was £17.3m (2015: £8.2m), with an underlying tax 
rate of 21.8 per cent (2015: 24.2 per cent) and, on a reported basis, an 
effective tax rate of 22.0 per cent (2015: 29.2 per cent). 
The underlying rate has reduced predominantly due to a reduction in disallowable 
expenditure during the year, mainly in relation to finance costs connected 
to the mandatory redeemable preference shares. The underlying tax rate 
reconciles to the reported rate as follows:

 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 29
Earnings per share (“EPS”)
Adjusted basic earnings per share increased by 196 per cent to 16.3 pence 
(2015: 5.5 pence) reflecting the increase in underlying operating profit during 
the year, together with a decrease in the underlying tax rate. 
As a result of the capital restructuring performed in February 2016 at 
the time of the IPO, the number of shares in issue is 450 million. For the 
purposes of the EPS calculation, the number of shares in issue in 2015 is 
assumed to be 450 million (for further details refer to Note 10 to the 
financial statements). For the purposes of the EPS calculation, the number of 
shares in issue in 2015 is assumed to be 450 million.
The weighted average number of shares in issue was 450 million 
(2015: 450 million).
Basic earnings per share was 13.6 pence (2015: 4.4 pence). Basic earnings 
per share is lower than underlying basic earnings per share due to the effect 
of non-underlying items that are excluded from adjusted results.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 3.4 pence per share (2015: Nil), 
representing a payout of 30 per cent of adjusted profit after tax for the second 
half of the financial year. This will be paid on 3 February 2017 to shareholders 
on the Register of Members at the close of business on 13 January 2017, 
subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM. 
The proposed final dividend was recommended by the Board on 
28 November 2016 and, as such, has not been included as a liability 
as at 30 September 2016.
In 2017, Countryside intends that the dividend will represent 30 per cent 
of adjusted profit after tax.
Statement of Financial Position
As at 30 September 2016, TNAV was £537.4m (2015: £329.0m), an increase 
of £208.4m, which was mainly attributable to the receipt of primary proceeds 
on IPO and retained earnings.
As we continued to grow the business, inventory grew by £144.1m to 
£583.6m (2015: £439.5m) and we were active on 72 sites at 30 September 2016 
(2015: 68 sites). Investments in associate and joint ventures also grew to 
£59.1m (2015: £54.3m), principally due to activity at Acton Gardens in 
West London, Beaulieu in Chelmsford and Five Oaks Lane at Chigwell 
in Essex.
Improving returns
By continuing to focus on the efficiency of our build programmes, we maintained 
asset turn (defined as adjusted revenue divided by average TNAV excluding 
net cash or debt) at 1.7 times for the financial year (2015: 1.7 times). This, 
together with the adjusted operating margin improvements, helped our return 
on capital employed increase by 210bps to 26.8 per cent (2015: 24.7 per cent), 
despite our significantly higher level of investment in sites.

Financing
On 11 May 2016, the Group signed a new £300m revolving credit facility 
agreement. The agreement has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR and 
expires in May 2021, although the Group has the opportunity to extend the 
term of the facility by a further two years. As a result of the signing of the 
new facility agreement, the unamortised arrangement fee for the previous 
facility of £3.2m (2015: £Nil) was expensed to the income statement as a 
non-underlying finance cost.

earnings and other non-cash items, resulted in £14.9m of cash being used 
by the Group’s operations.
£114m of net primary proceeds were raised in the IPO in February 2016. 
These proceeds were used to repay the Group’s debt facility and to accelerate 
a number of developments, including our joint ventures at Acton Gardens, 
West London, and Beaulieu, Chelmsford.

OUR PEOPLE
PEOPLE ARE OUR 
GREATEST RESOURCE
Countryside wants to attract and retain the 
best people in the housebuilding sector to deliver 
our strategy. We believe that our people truly 
differentiate us from our competitors. In the last 
two years, we have nearly doubled our employee 
numbers and now have over 1,000 people working 
for us. Our employee turnover of 17.5 per cent 
is in line with the rest of the construction sector. 
Our aim is to “grow our own” as much as we can, 
together with a healthy balance of new recruits. 
OUR PEOPLE ARE HIGHLY ENGAGED
In 2016 we ran the Group’s inaugural all-employee 
survey, and over 80 per cent of our people 
responded. Our overall engagement score of 
81 per cent positions us in the upper quartile 
for UK employers as a whole. From this, we 
believe that our people feel valued, well led 
and excited about the future.

Council (“NHBC”) awarded a 
Pride in the Job Seal of Excellence 
Award to Thomas Moore, our 
Senior Site Manager at Abode in 
Cambridge. Thomas also received 
an NHBC Health & Safety Award. 
Dave Parry, Mick Montgomery, 
Charlie Barbara and David T aylor, 
together with their respective 
teams, also received a Pride in the 
Job Award for their outstanding 
quality of workmanship. 
Our people are our greatest resource and without them we 
would not be able to build sustainable communities where 
people want to live. STRATEGIC REPORT
 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 31
WE INVESTED MORE IN OUR PEOPLE 
LAST YEAR THAN EVER BEFORE
We have launched a new Group-wide approach 
to succession and talent management as part of 
our “grow our own” people strategy. We overhauled 
our training proposition and significantly improved 
the quality and quantity of delivery, particularly 
around induction, customer service, sales and 
leadership. In the last year alone, over 200 of our 
line managers have received refresher training 
focusing on recruiting and managing their team’s 
performance. We are committed to developing 
our people at all levels of the organisation through 
both leadership and vocational training. Building 
a pipeline of talent is critical to our success.
OUR APPROACH TO FUTURE 
TALENT HAS IMPROVED
Our two-year graduate programme is proving 
very successful. We again increased our graduate 
intake in 2016, and launched a construction 
management training programme to meet our 
future site management needs. The first entrants 
onto this programme will join us early in 2017.
OUR PEOPLE ARE 
OUR SHAREHOLDERS
In February 2016, soon after IPO, we launched 
our first all-employee share plan which was 
significantly oversubscribed. 70 per cent of our 
employees signed up to buy shares in the newly 
created listed company under the terms of the 
scheme described on page 114.
At the same time, we also offered our first 
Long T erm Incentive Plan to our Director 
population as a retention tool for this key 
population. With the launch of these two 
share plans, we believe we offer a highly 
market-competitive reward package.
WE WANT OUR PEOPLE TO 
CHOOSE THE RIGHT BENEFITS 
FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES
At Countryside we are committed to providing 
an inclusive working environment where 
everyone feels valued and respected.
Recognising the diversity of our employee base, 
our approach to reward is centred on choice. 
Over four in ten of our people selected at least 
one flexible benefit this year. These benefits range 
from buying and/or selling days of annual leave, 
through reduced fees on life, dental and travel 
insurance, to participation in the Government’s 
Cycle to Work scheme. 
For those of our employees who qualify for a 
car or cash allowance, we have a sector-leading 
fleet proposition. This focuses on offering our 
employees choice based on their lifestyle, while 
remaining environmentally conscious by capping 
our CO
2
 emissions.
HUMAN RIGHTS
Our policies and procedures are designed to ensure 
we comply with UK law and best practice guidelines, 
including areas such as business conduct, equal 
opportunities, anti-corruption, whistleblowing 
and countering modern slavery and human trafficking. 
Our contracts explicitly oblige suppliers to meet 
all current employment legislation.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Countryside conducts its business with due regard 
for the health, safety and welfare of its employees, 
contractors, clients, visitors and members of the 
public. We develop a positive culture towards health 
and safety throughout our operations and as a 
minimum we observe all the requirements of the 
Health and Safety at Work etc. Act, 1974 at all times. 
Countryside operates a comprehensive Health 
and Safety Management system (fully registered 
to OHSAS 18001) and we are committed to 
continual improvement through a comprehensive 
training programme and by actively encouraging 
feedback from all levels of our workforce. Regular 
on-site inspections are carried out internally by the

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
PLACES PEOPLE LOVE
From the character of the homes we build to the 
planning of environments and considerate use of 
materials, our creative approach to placemaking 
ensures we have a positive impact on all those 
who live in and around our developments. 
We create places people love.
STRATEGY
We contribute to the creation and improvement 
of residential communities and workplaces in an 
environmentally and socially responsible, sensitive 
and sustainable manner. T o achieve this the Group’s 
corporate policies and values are implemented 
throughout the business at all stages of the 
development process, ensuring we continue to 
manage our sustainability impacts and “future-proof” 
our business. Our key policies include:
 – climate change;
 – environmental;
 – health and safety;
 – procurement;
 – quality management; and
 – sustainable development.
To deliver high levels of financial and sustainable 
returns for our shareholders, our sustainability 
strategy focuses on four key priority objectives:
 – Management – to apply sound social, 
environmental and quality management 
systems across the Group’s operations.
 – Social and ethical – to strive for continuous 
health and safety improvement and to 
promote social and ethical best practice.
 – Sustainability – to strive for 
continual environmental performance 
improvement, thereby reducing the 
Group’s environmental impacts.
 – Community – to promote and build 
sustainable communities. 
Positively, we continue to make good progress 
in achieving our sustainability objectives 
with an 96 per cent achievement in 2016 
(2015: 90 per cent). In addition we made £2.5m 
in sustainability-related savings during the reporting 
period. Our five-year track record can be found 
in the Group’s Sustainability Report 2016  
www.countryside-properties.com/about-us/
who-we-are/sustainability.
In addition to the management of material 
business risks and uncertainties by the Group 
and its divisions, an Environmental Aspects, 
Impacts and Legislation Register is maintained 
at Group level and is used by the divisions 
to inform and manage project risks. Overall 
responsibility for risk is managed by the Board 
and our Risk Management Committee. Oversight 
of more detailed aspects is managed through 
the Health and Safety and Environmental and 
Quality Committees. 
OUR SUSTAINABILITY
This is our 16th year of sustainability reporting 
– the longest in our sector. Since 2000 we have 
received 360 awards for our design and sustainability 
practices, which highlights our approach and 
commitment to sustainable development. 
Through regenerating existing neighbourhoods 
or creating new communities, we are developing 
places that are socially inclusive and have lower 
environmental impacts than existing areas.
OUR CREATIVE 
APPROACH TO 
PLACEMAKING ENSURES 
WE HAVE A POSITIVE 
IMPACT ON ALL THOSE 
WHO LIVE IN AND 
AROUND OUR 
DEVELOPMENTS.
ACTON GARDENS 
COMMUNITY CENTRE
We are passionate about creating places where people 
aspire to live, that deliver enduring value and where people 
feel a true sense of belonging.
96%
of our sustainability objectives 
were achieved in 2016
DESIGN
We believe in a design-led approach, creating visually 
attractive and innovative homes whilst ensuring 
the quality and practicality of the completed 
product. The Group is committed to adding value 
through placemaking and long-term partnerships. 
We continue to hold more Housing Design Awards 
than any other developer.
In February 2016 the RICS published professional 
guidance on “Placemaking and Value”. The research 
found that placemaking does add commercial value. 
However, there is considerable disparity in the size 
of the premium, of between 5 and 56 per cent. 
This also varies between different dwelling types. 
Greater premiums are achievable in areas that already 
have higher local embedded new-build values. STRATEGIC REPORT
 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 33
The findings reflect the Group’s strategy of 
developing in the right locations with design 
quality at the heart of our approach. Countryside 
was involved in three of the five featured schemes 
and each demonstrated strong uplifts in values 
compared to other homes in the locality. 
To ensure that our business model is fit 
for purpose, we hold a range of corporate 
memberships and participate in a range of 
committees and forums, including, for example:
 – Future of London;
 – the Home Builders Federation (“HBF”) 
and associated working groups; and
 – NHBC Expert Panel.
These alliances provide us with the opportunity 
to discuss, share and influence best practice in 
our industry, with Government, experts and 
interested parties. 
MANAGEMENT
Management systems
In accordance with our approach to continuous 
improvement, the Group is fully accredited to 
ISO 9001 (Quality), ISO 14001 (Environmental) 
and BS OHSAS 18001 (Health and Safety) 
standards – each standard is independently 
verified. We are working towards recertification 
(November 2016) against the newly revised and 
updated ISO 9001 and 14001 standards.
Legal compliance
Since 2004, we have received zero prosecutions 
against our environmental and health and 
safety practices. 
ASPIRATIONAL
We build homes people aspire to 
live in and a company people aspire 
to be part of.
SUSTAINABLE
We ensure the long-term future of 
our developments, our people and 
our Company through our thinking 
and approach.
PARTNERING
We collaborate with our partners to 
achieve shared goals, mutual success 
and places of exceptional quality.
INTEGRITY
We deliver our promises and hold 
ourselves to a high standard of 
personal conduct.
RESPECTFUL
We respect everyone we work 
with, the communities which 
we develop and the future we 
contribute to building.
EXCELLENCE
We strive for excellence and 
continuous improvement in 
every endeavour.
Our values
For the 13th consecutive year Countryside’s 
Accident Incident Rate (“AIR”) continues to be 
lower than the Industry average.
During the reporting period it averaged 305 
(2015: 265) reportable incidents per 100,000 
employees, compared with the National Incident 
Rate of 421 (2015: 412).
Awareness and communication 
of sustainability issues
We monitor our progress against four key priority 
objectives twice annually, through environmental 
representatives in all areas of the business and via 
our Environment and Health and Safety Committees, 
to ensure they are fit for purpose for the duration 
of the business plan.
Our people receive information and guidance about 
our policies, processes, procedures and their 
responsibilities through monthly staff presentations, 
new starter induction days, training courses and 
toolbox talks, as well as via our intranet.
ENVIRONMENT
Our approach to environmental sustainability is 
informed by our values, compliance requirements 
and the needs of our stakeholders. This applies to 
all aspects of our business and involves setting key 
objectives and measuring performance against 
them in order to ensure continual improvement.
Waste
The Group is implementing more stringent practices 
and commercially focused systems in order to 
recycle more and reduce waste going to landfill. 
For the reporting period a 10 per cent reduction, 
7.9T/m
2
 (2015: 8.8T/m

Resource use
At Countryside we want to partner with our supply 
chain in an open, co-operative and collaborative 
manner. Partners enjoy a number of preferential 
terms which also enables us to:
 – aid design development and minimise direct 
and indirect waste;
 – maximise value engineering and minimise 
resource use;
 – reduce critical path programme; and
 – assist in planning of associated health, 
safety and sustainability risk assessments.
Ecology 
Our commitment to being a placemaker helps 
us establish coherent ecological networks that 
are more resilient to current and future climate 
change pressures. During 2016, 82 per cent 
(2015: 51 per cent) of our projects were on 
brownfield land, which is a positive improvement 
and is indicative of the make-up of our land bank.
T o manage local risks, qualified ecologists undertook 
full ecological surveys as part of the site evaluation 
process on 97.8 per cent (2015: 97.4 per cent) 
of our projects. Ecological protection and design 
features are incorporated to create quality of 
place, and to improve sales values and the 
desirability of the homes.
Transport
We encourage the use of sustainable transport 
modes by providing an increasing number 
of cycling facilities and electric charging points 
at our developments. In 2016 95.6 per cent 
(2015: 89.7 per cent) of our schemes were 
located within 1km of a public transport node 
and 83.3 per cent (2015: 82.1 per cent) are 
within 500m. Good locations and model choice 
are proven to help residents minimise their 
environmental footprint.
Energy
The energy efficiency of the homes we have 
built – as measured by the Standard Assessment 
Procedure (“SAP”) – continues to be above 
the national standards at an average rating of 
85.45/100 (2015: 84.84/100). The average SAP 
rating for new homes in England was 81.5/100.
Non-operational performance
In addition to reducing the impacts of 
the communities and homes that we 
develop, we continue to improve our 
non-operational performance. 
The Group complied with the Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme during this reporting 
period. Several opportunities for improvement 
have been implemented. 
Scope 1:  These are emissions that arise directly from sources that are owned or controlled 
by the Group, for example from fuels used in generators and plants on our sites.
Scope 2:  These are the emissions generated by purchased electricity consumed by the Group.
Scope 3:  These emissions are a consequence of the activities of the Group but occur from 
sources not owned or controlled by the organisation. This includes emissions 
associated with business travel.
A cost benefit analysis of the remaining suggestions is being developed. During 2016, a Carbon 
Reduction Commitment report was undertaken by Oaktree for the period of its ownership 
of the Group. 
Water usage
We monitor water usage in the Group’s offices. Our water usage in our offices has decreased to 4,242m
3
 
(2015: 4,779m
3
). This equates to a reduction of 33.6 per cent per employee.
OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
During the year we collated our energy usage for the Scope one, two and three activities as illustrated 
by the tables below, to demonstrate our GreenHouse Gas (“GHG”) impacts.

PRINCIPAL RISKS 
AND UNCERTAINTIES
RISK MANAGEMENT
HOW WE MANAGE RISK
Risk identification and management is built into every aspect of Countryside’s 
daily operations, ranging from the appraisal of new sites, assessment of the 
prospects of planning success, building safely and selling effectively to achieve 
long-term success through the property market cycle. Risk management is built 
into standardised processes for each part of the business at every stage of 
the housebuilding process. Financial risk is managed centrally through 
maintenance of a strong balance sheet, forward selling new homes and the 
careful allocation of funds to the right projects, at the right time and in the 
right locations. Risk management also includes the internal controls described 
within the Corporate Governance Report on page 48. 
The Risk Management Committee normally meets every quarter to review 
the Group’s risk register. Given the uncertainty leading up to the outcome 
of the EU Referendum on 23 June 2016, on the UK’s continuing membership 
of the European Union, additional meetings were held by members of the 
Risk Management Committee to agree appropriate mitigating actions should 
they be required. 
More detail on the Risk Management Committee’s assessment 
of the impact of the EU Referendum vote is on the next page.
The Group’s risk register is maintained to record all principal risks and 
uncertainties identified in each part of the business and an appropriate 
“risk owner” for each risk. The risk owners conduct an analysis of each 
risk, according to a defined set of assessment criteria which includes:
 – How does the risk relate to the Group’s business model and/or strategy?
 – What is the likelihood of the risk occurring?
 – What is the potential impact were the risk to occur?
 – Would the consequences be short, medium or long term?
 – What mitigating actions are available and which are cost effective?
 – What is the degree of residual risk and is it within the Group’s risk 
appetite parameters?
 – Has the risk assessment changed and what is expected to change 
going forward?
The Risk Management Committee reviews the assessments made, 
compares it to the Group’s appetite for each risk, reviews the current 
level of preparedness and determines whether further actions or resource 
are required. In reviewing and agreeing the mitigating actions, the Risk 
Management Committee considers the impact of risks individually and 
in combination, in both the short and the longer term.
Countryside has policies and procedures in place for the timely identification, 
assessment and prioritisation of the Group’s material risks and uncertainties. 
This section describes how these risks are identified, managed and mitigated 
appropriately in order to deliver the Group’s strategic objectives.
The Board
 – has delegated responsibility from the Board to oversee risk management and 
internal controls;
 – reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal 
control procedures; and
 – monitors the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function and 
the independence of the external audit.
 – is responsible for identification of operational and strategic risks;
 – is responsible for ownership and control of specific risks; and
 – is responsible for establishing and managing the implementation of 
appropriate action plans.
 – determines the Group’s approach to risk, its policies and the procedures 
that are put in place to mitigate exposure to risk.
Audit Committee
Executive Management
 – is responsible for the effective 
maintenance of the Group’s 
risk register;
 – oversees the management of risk;
 – monitors risk mitigation and 
controls; and
 – monitors the effective 
implementation of action plans.
 – undertakes independent reviews 
of effectiveness of internal 
control procedures;
 – reports on effectiveness of 
management actions; and
 – provides assurance to the 
Audit Committee.
Risk Management Committee Internal Audit
BOARD AND AUDIT COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITY
The Audit Committee reviewed the Group’s risk register and the assessment 
of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties prepared by the Risk Management 
Committee at its meetings in February and July 2016. The Audit Committee 
also considered the effectiveness of the Group’s systems, and has taken 
this into account in preparing the Viability Statement on the next page.
The Audit Committee reported on its findings to the Board at the Board’s 
July and September meetings, in order to support it in making its confirmation 
that it had carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks. The table 
on pages 38 to 39 of the report sets out the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties, mitigation and any change during the period.  STRATEGIC REPORT
 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 37
VIABILITY STATEMENT
The following statement is made in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (September 2014) (the “Code”) provision C.2.2. After 
considering the current position of the Company, the Directors have 
assessed the prospects and viability of the Company over a three-year period 
to September 2019. In making this statement, the Board has performed 
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including 
those risks that would threaten Countryside’s business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. The principal risks facing Countryside 
and how the Company addresses such risks are described in the Strategic 
Report and the key risks are summarised on pages 38 to 39 (Principal 
Risks and Uncertainties).
Although longer-term forecasts are prepared to support the strategic planning 
process, the nature of the risks and opportunities faced by the Group limits 
the Directors’ ability to reliably predict the longer term. Accordingly, a 
three-year horizon is used to allow for a greater degree of certainty in 
our assumptions.
The Directors’ assessment includes a financial review, which is derived from 
the Group’s annual strategic forecasts and identifies divisional business 
performance, expected cash flows, net debt headroom and funding covenant 
compliance throughout the three years under review. These forecasts also 
incorporate severe but plausible downside case scenarios, illustrating the 
potential impact upon viability of one or more of the Group’s principal risks 
crystallising during the period, both individually and in combination. As disclosed 
in the financial statements, Countryside recently entered into a new debt 
facility with its funding banks, which is available throughout the three-year 
period under review. 
A number of reasonable assumptions are included within these 
assessments, including: 
 – the assumption that funding facilities will continue to be available or renewed 
on the same or similar basis throughout the period under review; 
 – the assumption that, following a material event, the Group would adjust 
its strategy accordingly to preserve cash. This would include, inter alia, 
suspending the purchase of land, changing the build profile of existing 
developments or adjusting Group dividend policy; 
 – the assumption that counterparties including local authorities and 
housing associations honoured the phased viability terms and conditions 
contained in a number of the Group’s Partnerships contracts; and 
 – the assumption that the Group will be able to effectively mitigate risks 
through enacted or available actions, as described in the “Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties” section of this report. 
The sensitivity analysis is performed based on assumptions modelled on 
the 2007 to 2009 period, adjusted for changes in Countryside’s business 
divisions, during which the housebuilding sector saw significant reductions 
in sales rates and average selling prices and illiquidity in the land market 
during a prolonged economic recession. It considers all of our principal 
risks, although our assumption that we will be able to effectively mitigate 
some of our risks leads to a greater emphasis on those risks that are 
beyond our control (such as external macroeconomic factors). 
Having had due regard to the sensitivity analysis, the Directors have 
concluded that we do not face a risk to our viability except in the event 
of highly improbable combinations of material events within the 
three-year window. 
Based on this conclusion, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due over the period of the assessment.

REFERENDUM ON 23 JUNE 2016 ON THE UK’S 
CONTINUING MEMBERSHIP OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION
Given the considerable uncertainty in the lead up to the EU Referendum 
vote, members of the Risk Management Committee met with the 
senior management of all business divisions to ensure that appropriate 
mitigation plans were agreed, and ready for implementation if required, 
to mitigate the full range of possible Brexit vote outcomes foreseen 
by some commentators.
The uncertainty in the market leading up to the EU Referendum 
vote lasted for two to three weeks after the vote. This impacted 
customer confidence and, while visitor levels and gross reservations 
remained largely unchanged, we did experience higher levels of 
cancellations and some price renegotiation. However, this period 
was relatively short-lived and we have experienced good trading 
conditions from August onwards.
The wider economic impacts of the EU Referendum vote may also 
be felt by the housebuilding industry in future, such as a slowdown 
in economic growth, higher imported material costs and possible 
restrictions on foreign labour. However, all of these risks are 
monitored and will be mitigated where possible by the Risk 
Management and Executive Committees with the appropriate 
action being taken in a timely manner. countryside-properties.com

CONTINUED
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES FACING THE GROUP
The Group’s principal risks are monitored by the Risk Management Committee, the Audit Committee and the Board. 
The table below sets out the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties.
Principal risks Risk mitigation Change over year
Adverse macroeconomic conditions
A decline in macroeconomic conditions, or conditions in the 
UK residential property market, can reduce the propensity 
to buy homes. Higher unemployment and/or interest rates 
affect consumer confidence and can reduce demand for new 
homes. Constraints on mortgage availability, or higher costs 
of mortgage funding, may make it more difficult to sell homes.
Funds are allocated between the Housebuilding and 
Partnerships divisions. In Housebuilding, land is purchased 
based on planning prospects, forecast demand and market 
resilience. In Partnerships, contracts are phased and, where 
possible, subject to viability testing. In all cases, forward sales, 
cash flow and work in progress are carefully monitored to 
give the Group time to react to changing market conditions. 
Increase
Adverse changes to Government policy and regulation
Adverse changes to Government policy in areas such as tax, 
housing and the environment may result in increased costs 
and/or delays. The discontinuation of Government-backed 
purchase assistance programmes may adversely affect the 
Group’s sales.
The potential impact of changes in Government policy and 
new laws and regulations are monitored and communicated 
throughout the business.
No change
Build cost inflation
Build costs may increase beyond budget due to the 
reduced availability of skilled labour, increases in 
sub-contractor or material costs, errors, omissions 
or unforeseen technical conditions.
Use of standard house types is optimised and designed 
to maximise buying power. Use of strategic suppliers to 
leverage volume price reductions and minimise unforeseen 
disruption. Robust contract terms to control costs.
No change
Programme delay (including rising project complexity)
Poor project forecasting, unforeseen operational delays due 
to technical issues, disputes with third party contractors or 
suppliers, bad weather or changes in purchaser requirements 
may cause delay or potentially termination of a project.
The budgeted programme for each site is approved by 
the divisional board before acquisition. Sites are managed 
as a portfolio to control overall Group delivery risk. 
Weekly monitoring at both divisional and Group level. 
No change
Inability to source and develop suitable land
Competition or poor planning may result in a failure to 
procure land in the right location, at the right price and 
at the right time.
A robust land appraisal process ensures each project is 
financially viable and consistent with the Group’s strategy.

Principal risks Risk mitigation Change over year
Poor sales performance
Poor forecasting of market demand, or inability to react 
quickly enough to changes in market demand, in terms of 
product, location, time and price will impact the Group’s 
competitiveness and reduce sales or sales prices. 
Market demand for design, product type and price is assessed 
for each potential site prior to acquisition. Forward sales are 
monitored closely to react to changing market conditions. 
No change
Product quality declines
Failure to deliver high quality product and customer service 
may reduce sales, adversely affect the Group’s brand and 
reputation and potentially lead to third party liabilities. 
Standard house types and strategic suppliers are used to 
maximise maintenance of Group standards. Regular quality 
reviews are performed at each stage of construction. 
Customer surveys are conducted on handover of homes 
and results are analysed to improve product quality.
No change
Inability to attract and retain talented employees
Inability to attract and retain highly skilled, competent 
people at all levels could adversely affect the Group’s 
results, prospects and financial condition.
Remuneration packages are regularly benchmarked against 
industry standards to ensure competitiveness. Succession 
plans are in place for all key roles within the Group. Exit 
interviews are used to identify any areas for improvement.
No change
Delays or refusals in planning
Failure to secure timely planning permission on economically 
viable terms is critical to the value of the Group’s land bank. 
A planning and risk assessment is conducted prior to any 
land purchase. Strong relations are maintained with local 
communities, the local authority and planning officers to 
best understand underlying policy and planning prospects.
No change
Inadequate health, safety and environmental procedures
A deterioration in the Group’s health, safety and 
environmental standards could put the Group’s employees 
and contractors or the general public at risk of injury or 
death and could lead to litigation or penalties or damage 
the Group’s reputation. 
Procedures, training and reporting are all carefully monitored 
to ensure that high standards are maintained. An environmental 
risk assessment is carried out prior to any land acquisition. 
Appropriate insurance is in place to cover the risks 
associated with housebuilding.

GOOD GOVERNANCE
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO GOVERNANCE
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
Countryside is committed to the highest standards 
of corporate governance. We believe that strong 
governance is a necessary component for delivering 
long-term performance to our shareholders. This 
report sets out our approach to governance, and 
how our governance framework supports our 
wider strategy (which is set out in the Strategic 
Report on pages 12 and 13).
In 2016 our main areas of focus at Board level were: 
to ensure robust systems of corporate governance 
for a listed company were in place; to design a detailed 
succession plan, with the support of the Nomination 
Committee (see page 51); and to run a competitive 
tender for external auditors (see page 47).
In accordance with the Code, we have set out 
a review of our compliance with the Code in 
the Corporate Governance Report (see page 44), 
including an overview of the role and responsibilities 
of the Board, its Committees and the 
Executive Committee.

BOARD AND COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS 
In 2016 a Board and Committee evaluation was carried out. Given it is 
the Group’s first year since listing, the decision was made to conduct an 
internal review, led by me and assisted by the Company Secretary. I am 
delighted to confirm that no significant issues were raised and the view 
of the Board is that the governance structure, together with the Board 
and its Committees, all continue to operate effectively, with a positive and 
open culture. The review process is described in more detail on page 45.
I am satisfied that the Non-Executive Directors, all of whom are standing 
for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, continue to be 
effective and show a high level of commitment to their roles. 
INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS
The Board reviewed the independence of all Non-Executive Directors 
(excluding the Chairman) at the Board meeting on 26 July 2016 and 
determined that they all continue to be independent, with the exception 
of Federico Canciani and James van Steenkiste, who both hold the position 
of Managing Director at Oaktree Capital Management L.P., a substantial 
shareholder of the Company. The Board is satisfied that I, as Chairman, 
was independent upon appointment.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE
From the date of admission to the premium list of the London Stock 
Exchange (“LSE”), Countryside has complied with all the provisions of 
the Code, save that, excluding the independent Non-Executive Chairman, 
the Board currently has only three Non-Executive Directors who it considers 
to be independent. This constitutes non-compliance with Code provision 
B.1.2, which recommends at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, 
comprise Independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board believes that 
the current composition of the Board, comprising two Executive Directors 
and six Non-Executive Directors, brings to the Board a desirable range 
of skills and experience in light of the Company’s challenges and opportunities 
following admission to the LSE, while at the same time ensuring that 
no individual (or small group of individuals) can dominate the Board’s 
decision making. 
Oaktree currently have two Non-Executive Directors appointed to 
the Board, neither of whom are independent. Oaktree’s right to make 
such appointments are set out in the Relationship Agreement, as 
described on page 45. As and when Oaktree reduces its shareholding 
in Countryside, their right to make appointments shall reduce to one 
Director (below 25 per cent shareholding) or no Directors (below 
10 per cent). Countryside shall be compliant with provision B.1.2 as 
soon as Oaktree has only one Director appointed to the Board.
“I am delighted to confirm that no significant issues were raised and the 
view of the Board is that the governance structure, together with the Board 
and its Committees, all continue to operate effectively, with a positive 
and open culture.”

REVIEW OF BOARD EFFECTIVENESS
The 2016 Board and Committee evaluation process 
started with a written questionnaire for all Directors, 
followed by individual interviews during which Board 
members were invited to evaluate and comment on 
the operation of the Board and its Committees. 
The Chairman and the Company Secretary met 
to discuss the results of the process and a report 
was submitted to the Board setting out the 
principal issues raised and suggesting appropriate 
action points. The principal issues raised in the 
2016 performance evaluation were discussed at 
the September 2016 Board meeting. Based on 
the feedback received, the Board concluded that 
the Board and its Committees continue to operate 
effectively. A list of specific actions was agreed to 
address the comments made by Directors, including 
the continued development of the Non-Executive 
Directors’ detailed knowledge of the businesses 
operated by the Group through a programme of 
regular business reviews. During the 2016 evaluation 
process, the Non-Executive Directors (in the absence 
of the Chairman) met with Richard Adam, as Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director, to review 
the performance of David Howell during 2016. 
Richard Adam later debriefed the Chairman. All 
Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman then 
met to evaluate the performance of the Group 
Chief Executive, Ian Sutcliffe. Finally, the Group 
Chief Executive joined the meeting to brief the 
Board on the performance of the Group Chief 
Financial Officer, Rebecca Worthington. The 
performance of the Non-Executive Directors during 
2016 was reviewed by David Howell, taking into 
account the views of the other Directors.

required by the Takeover Directive, and information

Governance Report.
THE BOARD
Board composition
The Board consists of eight Directors, comprising

are available to shareholders who have concerns 
that cannot be addressed through the normal 
channels. For further information about 
communication between the Board and shareholders, 
please refer to communication with shareholders 
on page 46. The Board has recruited Non-Executive 
Directors of a high calibre with broad commercial 
and other relevant experience. Non-Executive 
Directors are expected to bring objectivity and 
independence of view to the Board’s discussions, 
and to help provide the Board with effective 
leadership in relation to the Company’s strategy, 
performance, management risk and people 
management as well as ensuring high standards 
of financial probity and corporate governance. 
Countryside believes that the Board has the 
appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Group to 
support the long-term success of the Company.

shareholder” according to the Listing Rules (LR 
6.1.4D), the Company is required to have in place

intended to ensure that Oaktree complies with 
the independence provisions set out in LR 6.1.4D. 
Details of the Relationship Agreement entered 
into with Oaktree are set out in the Directors’ 
Report on page 70.

of the Audit Committee, ensures that Executive 
Management maintains a system of internal

Tenure, election and 
re‑appointment of Directors
All Non-Executive Directors, including the 
Chairman, have three-year appointments from 
17 December 2015. All Non-Executive Director 
appointments may be terminated by either party 
upon three months’ (or in the case of David Howell, 
six months’) written notice, or by shareholder 
vote at an AGM. The Non-Executive Directors 
do not have any entitlement to compensation 
if their office is terminated. Full details of the 
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors can 
be found on page 63 of the Remuneration Report. 
Under the Articles of Association, all Directors 
are subject to re-election at the AGM at intervals 
of no more than three years. At its meeting on 
25 October 2016, the Board agreed that all 
Directors will be put forward for election at 
the 2017 AGM. The Board believes that each 
of the Directors makes a valuable contribution 
to Countryside and supports their election 
in each case. 
THE BOARD CONTINUED
The roles of the Chairman 
and Group Chief Executive continued
The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the 
Board, and ensuring its effectiveness by facilitating 
debate and the contribution of Non-Executive 
Directors. Meeting agendas are set by collaboration 
between the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive 
and the Company Secretary. The Group Chief 
Executive is responsible for running Countryside’s 
business and providing strategic leadership to the 
Group, in consultation with the Board.
Directors’ induction,  
training and development
Countryside has a structured induction 
programme for all newly appointed 
Non-Executive Directors which includes visits 
to the business divisions and their respective 
management teams in each of Countryside’s 
business sectors and meetings with members 
of the Executive Committee. Newly appointed 
Directors have access to the Company Secretary’s 
assistance both in orientation and guidance around 
the Countryside Group, in addition to the exposure 
gained at regular Board meetings.
All Directors receive ongoing updates on the 
Company’s projects and activities and on legal 
and regulatory changes. In 2016 this included 
briefings on the requirements (and implementation) 
of the Modern Slavery Act, the Market Abuse 
Regime and compliance obligations of a listed 
company, and monitoring the Company’s 
risk management framework. 
Details of proxy voting by shareholders, 
including votes withheld, will be made 
available on request and will be placed on 
the Company’s website following the AGM. 
www.countryside-properties.com
Formal papers are circulated to the Directors 
before each Board meeting, which enable them 
to make an informed decision on the issues under 
consideration. In addition to formal Board meetings, 
during 2016 the Chairman maintained regular 
contact with the Group Chief Executive, the 
Group Chief Financial Officer and other members 
of Executive Committee to discuss specific issues. 
The Company Secretary acts as an advisor to the 
Board on matters concerning governance and 
ensures compliance with Board procedures. All 
Directors had access to the Company Secretary’s 
advice and during 2016 this was sought from 
time to time. Directors may also take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
In the event that any Director has concerns about 
the running of the Company, or a proposed action, 
which cannot be resolved within the Board forum, 
such concerns may be reflected in the Board minutes. 
Minutes of each Board meeting are circulated by 
the Company Secretary following the meeting 
to allow such comments to be raised.
Communications with shareholders
The Board places importance on communication 
with shareholders and gives them the opportunity 
to meet the Chairman and Directors as appropriate. 
Shareholders will continue to be given the 
opportunity to meet the Chairman and Directors 
in the coming 12 months. Arrangements can be 
made for major shareholders to meet with any 
newly appointed Directors. The Company’s 
investor relations team organises an ongoing 
programme of dialogue and meetings between 
the Group Chief Executive and the Group 
Chief Financial Officer and institutional investors, 
fund managers and analysts. Brokers’ reports 
and investors’ feedback are circulated regularly 
to the Board, which discusses these and any other 
key matters relating to investors. In each case the 
Board, in conjunction with advisors where 
appropriate, determines the strategy to 
address significant issues raised.
The Company’s Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”) on 26 January 2017 will provide a valuable 
opportunity for the Board to communicate with 
private investors. We encourage shareholders to 
attend the meeting and to ask questions of any 
of the Directors following the conclusion of the 
formal part of the meeting.
Directors’ interests
Under Countryside’s Articles of Association, the 
Board may authorise any actual or potential conflicts 
of interest for Directors. Each Director provides 
the Company Secretary with information regarding 
any actual or potential interests that may conflict 
with those of Countryside, such as other 
directorships, and any other potential interests 
that each thinks may cause a conflict requiring 
prior Board authorisation on an annual basis. 
If the circumstances of any of these disclosed 
interests change, the relevant Director is required 
to update the Company Secretary promptly. 
The register setting out each Director’s current 
disclosures (where relevant) was last reviewed 
and approved by the Board at its meeting on 
25 October 2016. In each such situation, the 
Director under consideration did not vote on 
the matter. The Board will continue to review 
the register of interests regularly to ensure the 
authorisations, and any conditions attached to 
them, are appropriate for the relevant matter 
to remain authorised. The Company Secretary 
maintains a list of all authorisations granted to 
Directors, setting out the date of authorisation 
and its expiry, scope and any limitations imposed 
(as applicable).
INVESTOR 
ENGAGEMENT TIMELINE
The investor relations team, at the direction 
of the Board, has primary responsibility for 
managing the day-to-day communications 
with our investors and market analysts. This 
year, the team has supported the Chairman, 
the Group Chief Executive, the Group Chief 
Financial Officer and other members of the 
Board and senior management to conduct

accounting and taxation matters, review the forecasts and 
sensitivity tests related to the Group’s Viability Statement, 
overseeing the tender for the provision of external auditor 
services and review the Group’s risk management 
framework and key internal controls. 
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
I am pleased to present Countryside’s first report since 
flotation in February 2016 as Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee’s role is to protect the interests of 
shareholders by ensuring sound control of the Group, the 
integrity of published financial information and an effective 
audit process.
As required by the Code, and to ensure the Company receives 
the best audit service, we ran a competitive tender for the 
external audit during the year. The Audit Committee reviewed 
three high quality proposals from Ernst & Young, KPMG 
and PwC, deciding ultimately to recommend the 
re-appointment of PwC. This decision will be put to 
shareholders for approval at the AGM in January 2017. 
During 2016 the Audit Committee focused on the financial 
policies and procedures of the Group prior to the IPO. Post 
IPO, the Audit Committee continued to focus on areas of key 
accounting judgement, particularly the valuation of inventory 
and shared equity, the presentation of non-underlying items 
and taxation matters and the recognition of gross profit. 
We have also worked on the identification and management of 
risks for the Group, and the work of the internal and external 
auditors in giving assurance over the Group’s internal control 
environment. Further details about these activities can be 
found in the report overleaf.

consider their likelihood and impact, both on an 
inherent and a residual basis, after taking account 
of mitigating controls. This allows us to determine 
how we should manage each risk in order to 
achieve our strategic objectives. 
At the quarterly meetings of the Risk Management 
Committee, management discusses the key risks 
along with the mitigating action plans. Following 
sign off by the Executive Committee, the output 
of this review is presented to the Audit Committee. 
The Group’s key risk management procedures 
have been in place throughout 2016 and up to 
the date of approval of this Annual Report.
OVERVIEW OF RISK 
MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Internal control 
The Group’s key internal control procedures 
include the following:
 – Review of the Group’s strategy and the 
performance of principal subsidiaries, through 
a comprehensive system of reporting based 
on variances to annual budgets, key performance 
indicators and regular forecasting.
 – A quarterly business review for each business 
division. This covers financial performance, a 
detailed range of strategic risks, opportunities 
and KPI metrics which measure the overall 
performance of the business sector. This process 
also identifies the key operational issues and 
actions required to address any deficiencies.
 – Well defined Group policies and processes, 
communicated through the Group Financial 
Reporting Procedures Manual and the intranet, 
and a defined process governing the approval of 
sales opportunities and capital expenditure.
 – A defined organisational structure with 
appropriate delegation of authority across 
all levels of the organisation.
 – Formal authorisation procedures for all 
investments with clear guidelines on appraisal 
techniques and success criteria.
 – Formal authorisation procedures for all 
significant sales opportunities and bid 
management, with clear guidelines on success 
criteria and contracting practices.
The Audit Committee has, on behalf of the Board, 
conducted an annual review of the effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal control systems for 2016 and 
the period prior to approval of this Annual Report. 
The Audit Committee reported its findings to the 
Board at the November 2016 Board meeting. It 
considered all material controls in accordance with 
the T urnbull guidance. Following this review no 
significant weaknesses or failings were identified and 
noted improvement areas are being addressed by 
management. The internal control environment will 
COMPOSITION 
During 2016, the composition of the Audit Committee 
complied with the Code and comprised three 
Independent Non-Executive Directors: Richard 
Adam, Amanda Burton and Sally Morgan. The 
Board considers Richard Adam, the Chairman, 
to have recent and relevant financial experience 
working with financial and accounting matters. 
The Audit Committee maintains a formal agenda 
for each year to ensure compliance with the 
requirements of the Code, and met three times since 
17 December 2015 when the Audit Committee 
for the Group parent was established in advance 
of the listing of Countryside Properties PLC. 
Details of attendance at the Audit Committee 
meetings during the 2016 financial year are set 
out on page 49.
INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board, assisted by the Audit Committee, is 
responsible for regularly reviewing the operation 
and effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls. 
The internal control system is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable, 
and not absolute, assurance against material 
errors, losses or fraud. The Board is also responsible 
for ensuring that appropriate systems are in place 
to enable it to identify, assess and manage key 
risks. The financial reporting process and control 
system (which includes the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements) is monitored 
and maintained through the use of internal control 
frameworks which address key financial reporting 
risks, including risks arising from changes in the 
business or accounting standards. Effectiveness is 
assessed through self-certification and independent 
testing of the controls. 
WHISTLEBLOWING
The Group’s whistleblowing policy is supported 
by an external helpline. All cases of whistleblowing 
are investigated by the Company Secretary and the 
results of any investigations are reported to the 
Audit Committee. The Committee is satisfied that 
the policy and its administration remain effective.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The successful management of risk is critical to 
achieve Countryside’s strategic objectives. The 
Board has delegated responsibility for reviewing 
and maintaining effective risk management systems 
and internal controls to the Audit Committee. 
Day-to-day management of the Group’s risk 
management framework is conducted by the Risk 
Management Committee. Its membership and 
role are detailed on page 44. The Board reviews 
the Group risk register annually, with the last 
review occurring on 26 July 2016. In managing 
risk we analyse the nature and extent of risks and 
continue to be monitored and reviewed by the 
Board and the Audit Committee.
FAIR, BALANCED AND 
UNDERSTANDABLE
At the request of the Board, the Audit Committee 
considered whether the 2016 Annual Report was 
fair, balanced and understandable and whether 
it provided the necessary information for the 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy. The Audit Committee 
took into account its own knowledge of the Group, 
its strategy and performance in the year and 
comprehensive reviews undertaken at different 
levels in the Group to ensure consistency and 
overall balance. A similar detailed review undertaken 
by the senior management and the external 
auditors was also taken into account by the 
Audit Committee. 
Prior to the publication of both the half and 
full-year results for the Group, the Audit 
Committee undertook a detailed assessment of the 
appropriateness of the adoption by the Group of 
the going concern basis in the preparation of the 
financial statements. For further information in 
respect of the going concern, please refer to the 
Directors’ Report on page 72.
Shortly before publication of the full-year financial 
results for 2016, the Audit Committee undertook 
a detailed assessment of the Viability Statement 
and recommended to the Board that the Directors 
can believe that they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the three-year period of their assessment. 
For the detailed Viability Statement, please refer to 
our risk section on page 37 of the Strategic Report. 
INTERNAL AUDIT
The work performed by Deloitte, which performs 
the service of the Group’s Internal Audit department , 
focuses on areas of greatest risk to the Group, 
including those matters identified through the 
risk management framework and any significant 
change projects occurring within the business. The 
objective of Internal Audit is to provide independent 
assurance to the Audit Committee over the financial, 
operational and compliance controls and to assist 
the Audit Committee in its assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal controls. Internal Audit 
reports directly to the Group Chief Financial Officer, 
but has the right to report to the Audit Committee 
Chairman independently of the Executive Directors. 
All significant Internal Audit reports are reviewed by 
the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee 
and all reports are made available to the external 
auditors. During the year the Audit Committee 
approved the internal audit plan, reviewed the 
findings from audits and monitored the follow-up 
of actions identified in audits.
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
CONTINUED GOVERNANCE
 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 49
OVERSIGHT OF THE EXTERNAL AUDIT
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) has been 
the auditor of the Company since its incorporation 
in November 2015 and of the Group for more 
than 20 years.
The Committee’s oversight of the external auditor 
includes reviewing and approving the annual 
audit plan. In reviewing the plan, the Committee 
discusses and challenges the auditor’s assessment 
of materiality and financial reporting risk areas 
most likely to give rise to material error.
PwC reported to the Board and confirmed its 
independence in accordance with ethical 
standards and that it had maintained appropriate 
internal safeguards to ensure its independence 
and objectivity.
EXTERNAL AUDIT TENDER PROCESS
The Company confirms that it complied with 
the provisions of the Competition and Markets 
Authority’s Order for the financial year 
under review.
In accordance with the requirements of the Audit 
Directive (2014/56/EU), the Audit Committee 
published a request for proposal to provide external 
audit and audit-related services to Countryside 
and its Group subsidiaries for the financial year 
commencing on 1 October 2016. 
The applicant firms participating in the tender 
process were required to submit their written 
proposals against the following criteria:
 – team competence and rapport;
 – audit quality;
 – transition planning;
 – service approach;
 – communication; and
 – fees.
As Deloitte are engaged to provide internal audit 
services, they were excluded from the tender, 
with Ernst & Y oung, KPMG and PwC responding to 
the tender request following the public invitation 
posted on the Group’s website. 
The tender process involved a review of the 
Company’s financial data (set up in a data room), 
visits to key sites in each business region and meetings 
with Executive Committee members, the Chairman, 
the Audit Committee Chairman and other senior 
management leading the finance, tax, treasury 
and legal functions. Each firm presented to a 
sub-committee of the Audit Committee consisting 
of the Audit Committee Chairman, the Chairman, 
the Group CFO and the Group Financial Controller. 
The sub-committee also reviewed the written 
proposals and feedback from all of the meetings 
described above. The sub-committee unanimously

agreed to recommend the re-appointment of PwC 
as the Group’s external auditors for the 2017 audit. 
The sub-committee presented their recommendation 
to the Audit Committee meeting on 26 July 2016. 
Factors which the Audit Committee took into 
account when approving the proposal to re-appoint 
PwC included that the lead audit partner was very 
experienced and had worked with other companies 
in the sector, that the lead partner would be new 
to the Company following the rotation of the existing 
audit partner, and the depth and quality of PwC’s 
proposed service, including communication and 
audit strategy. 
The Board approved this recommendation at its 
meeting on 26 July 2016 and a resolution will be 
put to the 2017 AGM for approval by shareholders.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES POLICY
The total of non-audit fees paid to PwC during 
the year is set out in the table opposite. In order 
to maintain its independence and objectivity, PwC 
undertook its standard independence procedures 
in relation to each of these assignments. The Audit 
Committee has received a report at each meeting 
describing the extent of such services provided 
by PwC.
The award of non-audit services to the Company’s 
external auditors is subject to controls agreed by 
the Audit Committee to monitor and maintain 
the objectivity and independence of the external 
auditors. In order to comply with the Ethical Standard 
for Auditors, issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council on 17 June 2016, the Audit Committee 
considered, and approved, a revised policy for auditor 
independence and the provision of non-audit 
services at its meeting on 4 October 2016. The 
policy provides details of permitted, prohibited 
and audit-related services in accordance with the 
Ethical Standards and requires further Audit 
Committee approval when non-audit fees reach 
70 per cent of the anticipated audit fees over the 
next three years, although this limit will not formally 
apply to the Group until 1 October 2019. 
ANNUAL EVALUATION OF AUDIT

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
CONTINUED
AREAS OF SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT CONSIDERED  
BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE IN 2016
In addition to the IPO and non-underlying items, the Audit Committee considered the following matters in respect of the Group’s financial statements, 
based upon its interaction with both management and the external auditors during the year.
SIGNIFICANT MATTERS CONSIDERED OUR RESPONSE TO THESE MATTERS
Gross profit recognition
As disclosed in Note 1 to the financial statements, gross profit is recognised 
as homes are sold based on a profit margin for the development taken 
as a whole. Calculating this margin includes forecasting revenue and 
costs for the development as well as allocating land and infrastructure 
costs on a pro-rata basis.
Profit recognition in relation to commercial land transactions can be 
subjective and dependent on contractual terms.
The accuracy of allocation is monitored at Board level via the monthly 
management accounts and quarterly forecasts, with any judgements 
being discussed with the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the Group’s accounting 
policy in relation to profit recognition.
The external auditors regularly examine the allocation of revenue and costs 
as a routine part of the external audit and no significant issues have been 
identified in this regard.
Carrying value of inventory
Inventory is material to the Group’s balance sheet and there is a risk that  
the carrying value will exceed its net realisable value, particularly 
in challenging market conditions.
Management regularly reviews the carrying value of all sites under development 
and other inventory such as undeveloped land. These reviews have 
regard to the latest cash flow forecasts for the relevant development or 
land parcel and comparable market valuations for land where applicable.
The Audit Committee considered management’s review of the carrying 
value of inventory and the appropriateness of the level of provisions held.
The external auditors reported on this matter to the Audit Committee 
at the half-year review and again for the final audit.
The Audit Committee was satisfied that the carrying value of inventory 
is appropriate.
Carrying value of shared equity loans
The Group’s shared equity loan portfolio is held at fair value as an  
available for sale financial asset. The fair value is calculated using a 
discounted cash flow forecast based on likely future redemptions and 
defaults, taking into account future house price inflation and discounted 
using an interest rate equivalent to a second charge mortgage.
Management reviews the carrying value regularly and takes into account 
third party evidence where available.
The Audit Committee reviewed the fair value methodology and the assumptions 
applied in determining the fair value of the shared equity portfolio and has 
agreed that the carrying value is appropriate.
The valuation methodology has also been audited by the external auditors.
Viability Statement testing
The Viability Statement testing performed by management was based 
on the latest available three-year forecast. To ensure that the financial 
position of the Group was robust, downside sensitivity testing was 
performed by applying a range of overlays including reduced sales rates 
and average selling prices, a reduction in land sales and reduced affordable 
housing sales. We also included operational inefficiency downsides 
including delays to the delivery of key sites and enhanced cost inflation.
Each of the above assumptions was based on management’s assumption  
of a reasonable downside outcome.
The Audit Committee reviewed the assumptions applied by management 
in arriving at the conclusion on the Group’s viability and agreed that they 
were reasonable. GOVERNANCE

REPORT OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
The report below describes the main responsibilities of the 
Nomination Committee and how it achieved these in 2016. I would 
like to draw your attention to what we achieved in 2016 and what 
we will focus on in 2017. 
Following the Company’s listing on the London Stock Exchange in 
February 2016, the Nomination Committee’s main focus in 2016 was 
to monitor the functioning of the Board and to satisfy itself that 
the Board had the right balance of skills and experience to enable 
it to provide leadership and accountability. It was therefore 
pleasing to see that the feedback from the Board effectiveness 
evaluation process (which you can read about on page 45) 
provided confirmation that the Board, and the Board Committees, 
continue to operate effectively. The Board is responsible for 
succession generally, but the Nomination Committee will advise 
the Board on appropriate succession planning in the year ahead.

Chairman of the Nomination Committee

REVIEW OF BOARD COMPOSITION
The Nomination Committee leads the process for all Board 
appointments and is responsible for reviewing candidates and 
making a final recommendation to the Board, in compliance with 
the Code. The Nomination Committee also reviews the structure, 
size and membership of the Board itself, as well as Board 
Committees from time to time, to ensure an appropriate mix of 
experience and skills, as well as the orderly refreshing as required. 
During 2016, the composition of the Nomination Committee 
complied with the Code, comprising a majority of independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
The Nomination Committee recognises that diversity, in all its 
dimensions, across an organisation, including at Board level, is 
important to support innovation, strategic development and 
operational efficiency. The Nomination Committee will consider 
candidates for appointment as Non-Executive Directors from a 
wider pool, including those with limited (or no) listed company 
experience. It is not the Board’s policy to have specific voluntary 
targets, but it will continue to recruit Board members based on 
skills and experience, having regard to the requirements of the Code 
in respect of diversity, including gender. 
The Nomination Committee meets at least once a year. During 
2016 it met three times, to agree a succession plan strategy for 
the Directors and senior management, and to review the findings 
of the 2016 Board and Committee evaluation. The Nomination 
Committee also reviewed the composition of the Audit Committee 
and reviewed the Board diversity policy for submission to the Board. 
While no new appointments were made during 2016, there is a 
rigorous and transparent procedure for appointments to the Board 
and its Committees, involving undertaking an assessment of the 
skills and capabilities required, drafting a description of the role, 
and carrying out an assessment of potential candidates, before 
making a recommendation to the Board.

On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present 
the first Directors’ Remuneration Report of the 
Remuneration Committee (“Committee”) 
following the IPO on 17 February 2016.
THE WORK OF THE 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The year ended 30 September 2016 was a major 
milestone in Countryside’s history. In anticipation 
of the IPO, the Committee undertook a detailed 
review of the Company’s remuneration policy. 
A key driver in the review was to determine 
an appropriate remuneration policy for a listed 
company whilst ensuring continued emphasis 
on those values which have been fundamental 
to the Company’s success.

OBJECTIVES OF THE 
REMUNERATION POLICY
The Company’s aim is to attract, retain and motivate 
the best talent to help ensure continued growth 
and success as it enters the next stage of its 
development. The proposed policy is designed to:
 – align the interests of the Executive Directors, 
senior executives and employees with the 
long-term interests of shareholders and 
strategic objectives of the Company;
 – support a high performance culture with 
appropriate reward for superior performance 
without creating incentives that will encourage 
excessive risk taking or unsustainable 
Company performance;
 – enable the Company to recruit and retain 
individuals with the ability to lead the Group 
on its ambitious growth path; and
 – ensure that our remuneration structures are 
transparent and easily understood.
THE STRATEGIC CONTEXT
2016 has been a momentous year for Countryside, 
seeing its return to the London Stock Exchange in 
an IPO in February 2016. The Group has continued 
to perform strongly during the year, delivering a 
12 per cent increase in completions together with 
a 34 per cent increase in adjusted operating profit 
to £122.5m (2015: £91.2m) and a 210bps increase 
in return on capital employed to 26.8 per cent 
(2015: 24.7 per cent). The Group remains firmly 
on track to deliver its medium-term growth targets. 
The Group’s remuneration policy reflects a 
desire to attract and retain high calibre talent 
to enable the Group to achieve its growth plans, 
whilst rewarding management in a way which 
ensures the alignment of interests with the 
Group’s shareholders.
INTRODUCTION 
TO THE DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION REPORT
KEY PAY OUTCOMES DURING 2015/16
The post-IPO remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors were agreed during the review 
detailed above and consist of:
 – salaries set at a broadly mid-market rate, taking into consideration experience and performance;
 – competitive pension and benefits provision;
 – an annual bonus plan with deferral of a proportion in shares;
 – a performance share plan with the ability to impose a two-year post-vesting holding period;
 – the opportunity to participate in all-employee share plans; and
 – share ownership guidelines.
Countryside has had an incredibly successful year, reflected in the Group’s strong growth in completions, 
adjusted operating profit and return on capital employed. As a result of this strong performance, 
100 per cent of the maximum annual bonus has been awarded to the Executive Directors.

REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2016/17 
Summary of remuneration policy
Element Policy summary
Base salary Base salaries will be set based on the market value of the role and the experience and performance of the individual.
Pension The Company will provide either contributions to the Company defined contribution pension scheme or a pension salary supplement.
Annual bonus A maximum award of 150 per cent of salary.
The annual bonus is paid annually and is dependent on achievement of financial and other strategic performance metrics 
over the financial year.
T wo-thirds of amounts earned are paid in cash, with one-third deferred as shares for a period of three years.
Long Term Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
A maximum award of 200 per cent of salary.
LTIP awards will vest subject to stretching targets which may include relative TSR, ROCE and TNAV.
The Committee has discretion to introduce a post-vest holding period and whilst it is not anticipated that this will be 
used in the first or second years following IPO, the Committee reserves the right to exercise discretion in future years.
The Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors in September 2016 and awarded salary increases of 3 per cent with effect from 1 October 2016, 
in line with the wider employee base. In addition, Executive Directors will be awarded the maximum bonus opportunity of 150 per cent and LTIP of 200 per cent 
of base salary. The structure of the annual bonus and LTIP will remain unchanged in 2017. The annual bonus targets will be based on adjusted operating profit, 
Group return on capital employed and personal performance. LTIP targets will continue to be based on return on capital employed, tangible net asset value 
and relative total shareholder return.
CONCLUSION 
The Committee recognises the importance of developing a close relationship with shareholders in facilitating the work of the Committee in developing 
the remuneration policy. In September 2016, we communicated the terms of the remuneration policy to our major shareholders in order to obtain 
their comments. We will continue to ensure that our remuneration policy is both aligned with shareholders’ interests, and attracts and retains executives 
of the required calibre to ensure the Company’s continued success. On behalf of the Committee, I welcome your feedback and ask for your support at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
SUMMARY OF REMUNERATION FOR 2015/16 – 
ALIGNMENT BETWEEN PERFORMANCE AND PAY
In 2016, the meetings of the Committee covered the following key areas: 
 – benchmarking of senior management remuneration;
 – consideration and approval of the 2016 LTIP and 2016 Save As You Earn 
(“SAYE”) plan;
 – determination of LTIP recipients, grant level and targets;
 – determination of bonus targets and awards;
 – determination of annual salary increases for the Group; and
 – consideration of structures and measures for the 2016/17 annual bonus.
OVERVIEW OF REMUNERATION POLICY
The Company’s remuneration policy was reviewed fully prior to listing, in 
accordance with current regulation and guidance, in order to ensure the 
remuneration policy in place was appropriate for a listed company.
The Company’s aim is to attract, retain and motivate the best talent to help 
drive continued growth and success as it enters the next stage of its development 
operating as a listed company.
Our remuneration policy aims to align the interests of the Executive Directors, 
senior executives and employees with the long-term interests of 
shareholders. It aims to support a high performance culture with 
appropriate reward for superior performance without creating incentives 
that will encourage excessive risk taking or unsustainable Company performance.
Overall remuneration levels have been set at a level that are considered by 
the Committee to be appropriate for the size and nature of the business. 
All variable pay awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions in 
accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
The following table summarises the key components of the Executive Director 
and Non-Executive Director remuneration arrangements, which will form part 
of the remuneration policy subject to formal approval by shareholders at the 
first AGM of the Company following Admission in accordance with the 
regulations set out in the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Report) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. It is intended that this 
policy will apply for three years from that date, and that it will continue to be 
operated for the period from admission to that meeting.
The details of the Group’s Executive Director and Non-Executive Director 
remuneration for the financial year, including the operation of the Group’s 
incentive plans and payments made under them, will be set out each year in 
an Annual Report on Remuneration contained in the Group’s Annual Report, 
as required by the Regulations.
The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for Executive 
Directors, including the rationale for their use and details of their operation:
EXECUTIVE  
DIRECTORS
Objective and link  
to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity
Performance measures 
and assessment
Base salary
Recognises the market 
value of an Executive 
Director’s role, skill, 
responsibilities, 
performance and 
experience.
Salaries are normally reviewed annually, with any changes 
effective as of 1 October each year.
Current salaries, effective from 1 October 2016, are as follows:
Chief Executive: £515,000
Group Chief Financial Officer: £309,000
Salaries are set by reference to a market benchmark based on 
companies of a comparable size operating in a similar sector. 
Salary reviews will also take into consideration an individual’s 
performance, responsibility levels and internal relativities.
There is no formal 
maximum salary other 
than where there is 
a change of role or 
responsibility and 
increases will normally 
be only for inflation  
and/or in line with the 
wider workforce.
Not applicable.
Other benefits
Provides a  
market-competitive 
package.
Reviewed periodically to ensure benefits remain 
market competitive.
The main benefits currently provided include:
 – car or car allowance;
 – life, personal accident, disability and health insurance;
 – Directors’ and officers’ insurance; and
 – other benefits, including flexible benefits, as provided from 
time to time, for example where a Director relocates.
Executive Directors are eligible for other benefits which are 
introduced for the wider workforce on broadly similar terms.
In addition, reasonable business expenses and any tax 
thereon may be reimbursed by the Company.
Benefit values vary 
year on year depending 
on premiums and the 
maximum potential value 
is the cost of the provision 
of these benefits.

EXECUTIVE

Objective and link

Performance measures 
and assessment
Annual bonus 
scheme
The annual bonus is 
designed to incentivise 
the Executive Directors 
to deliver against 
goals linked to the 
Company’s strategy.
Long-term alignment 
with shareholder 
interests is ensured 
through the 
deferral element.
Bonus awards will be granted annually.
The performance period is one financial year with  
pay-outs determined by the Committee following the 
year end, based on achievement against a range of 
performance targets.
Up to two-thirds of the bonus award will be paid out in 
cash with the remainder deferred into shares for a period 
of three years (subject to continued employment). Bonuses 
relating entirely to periods prior to admission will not be 
subject to deferral.
Malus and clawback arrangements will apply to annual 
bonus awards enabling the reduction in vesting or recovery 
of amounts paid in certain circumstances.
Maximum opportunity:  
150 per cent of salary.
Participants may be 
entitled to dividends 
or dividend equivalents 
on the deferred shares 
representing the value 
of dividends paid during 
the deferral period.
Performance targets will be set 
by the Committee annually 
based on a range of financial 
and strategic measures selected 
to reflect the in-year goals of 
the business and its longer-term 
strategy and KPIs. At least 
50 per cent of the bonus will 
be based on financial measures 
in any year.
Targets are normally set on a 
sliding scale, with no more than 
25 per cent of the maximum 
typically payable at threshold 
performance and 50 per cent of 
the maximum typically payable 
for on-target performance.
Long Term 
Incentive Plan 
(“LTIP”)
The LTIP is designed 
to incentivise Executive 
Directors to successfully 
deliver the Company’s 
objectives over the 
longer term and 
to create alignment 
with investors over 
this period.
Awards of shares that vest three years from the date 
of grant subject to achievement against performance 
measures, measured over a three-year period. Awards 
are subject to malus and clawback provisions enabling 
the reduction in vesting or recovery of amounts paid 
in certain circumstances.
The Committee retains the flexibility to incorporate 
a two-year post-vest holding period as part of the LTIP 
in which Executive Directors will not be permitted to sell 
vested shares. This would take the total period from grant 
to release of LTIP shares to five years. The Committee does 
not anticipate operating this period in the first or second 
cycle of awards under the plan.
The maximum LTIP award 
level is 200 per cent of 
base salary. 
Participants may at the 
Committee’s discretion 
receive dividends or 
dividend equivalents 
representing the value 
of dividends paid during 
the performance period 
on LTIP awards.
LTIP performance will be 
assessed against a mix of 
metrics that will include a 
balance between financial and 
shareholder metrics. For the 
awards granted on IPO and 
2017 awards these are:
 – TSR measured against 
a broad-based 
comparator group;
 – TNAV; and
 – ROCE.
Targets are set on a sliding scale 
with no more than 25 per cent 
of each element vesting at 
threshold performance. 
The Committee will review 
and set weightings for 
measures and appropriate 
targets before each grant. 
The Committee may change 
the balance of the measures, 
or use different measures 
for subsequent awards 
as appropriate.

Executive Directors are able to participate in  
HMRC-approved savings-based share plans available 
to all employees of the Company.

NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ remuneration policy, 
authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered 
into previously with Directors.
Malus and clawback
The circumstances in which malus and clawback may apply include a material 
misstatement of the Company’s accounts, error in assessment of performance 
or calculation of the number of awards, individual gross misconduct or 
conduct resulting in reputational damage to the Group.
Performance measures and targets
The short and long-term incentive plans have a number of different financial 
performance measures aligned to the performance of the Company. Targets 
will be set with reference to prior year performance, budget and brokers’ 
forecasts (and other external market expectations). Performance targets will 
be set so as to be achievable but representing stretching performance for 
the business.
Annual bonus performance metrics are determined at the start of each 
financial year based on the key business priorities for the year ahead. 
The majority will be linked to a profit metric as this is the primary indicator 
of our sustainable growth. The target ranges for the measures used in the 
annual bonus scheme are considered to be commercially sensitive at the 
start of the financial year and prospective disclosure is not in the interest 
of shareholders. Other than in exceptional circumstances where elements 
remain commercially sensitive, actual targets, performance achieved and 
awards made will be published at the end of the performance periods so 
shareholders can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs.
LTIP metrics are determined at the time of grant. Performance measures 
for the initial awards were selected to support the Company’s long-term 
strategy. Future metrics will align our long-term goal of value creation 
for shareholders through strong underlying financial growth. The metrics for 
the first awards were relative TSR, TNAV and ROCE. It is intended that the 
targets for the 2017 LTIP awards will be based on the same metrics. 
Discretion
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion over certain elements of 
the policy as set out in the report including the operation of the variable 
incentive schemes. The Committee may adjust elements of the plans 
including, but not limited to:
 – participation;
 – the timing of the grant of award and/or payment;
 – the size of an award (up to plan limits) and/or payment;
 – in exceptional circumstances, to grant and/or settle an LTIP award in cash; 
 – discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a 
change of control;
 – determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) 
for incentive plan purposes;
 – adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, 
corporate restructuring and special dividends); and
 – the ability to recognise exceptional events within existing 
performance conditions.
Should any such discretion be exercised, an explanation would be provided 
in the following Annual Report on Remuneration and may be subject to 
shareholder consultation as appropriate.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION POLICY
The Board as a whole is responsible for setting the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, other than the Chairman, whose remuneration is 
determined by the Committee and recommended to the Board. The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for Non-Executive Directors:
Objective and link to strategy Operation Maximum potential value
Fees
Core element of 
remuneration, set at a level 
sufficient to attract and retain 
individuals with appropriate 
knowledge and experience in 
organisations of broadly similar 
size and complexity.
Fee levels are sufficient to attract 
individuals with appropriate 
knowledge and experience.
Non-Executive Directors are paid 
a base fee and additional fees for 
chairmanship of Committees and 
the role of Senior Independent 
Director. In exceptional 
circumstances, fees may also be 
paid for additional time spent on 
the Company’s business outside of 
normal duties.
Fees are reviewed each year, with any increases normally effective from 
1 October.
Any increases in fees will be determined based on time commitment and 
will take into consideration the level of responsibility and fees paid in other 
companies of comparable size and complexity, e.g. median fee levels of 
comparable companies within the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts).
Non-Executive Directors do not receive any variable remuneration element 
or receive any other benefits, other than being covered for disability benefits 
under the Company’s insurance whilst travelling on Company business.
The Company will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors. The Company may also provide limited hospitality 
and selected benefits and settle any tax thereon provided that this is in 
connection with the performance of their role. GOVERNANCE
 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 59
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience 
needed for the role. The remuneration package for any new recruit would be assessed following the same principles as for the Executive Directors, as set 
out in the remuneration policy table.
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the Executive Director policy would apply. Historic entitlements would continue to be honoured 
and allowed to pay out on their original terms, and will be fully disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration at the relevant time.
The table below summarises our key policies with respect to recruitment remuneration:
Remuneration element Recruitment policy
Base salary and benefits The salary level will be set taking into account a number of factors, including market practice, the individual’s 
experience and responsibilities and other pay structures within Countryside and will be consistent with the 
salary policy for existing Executive Directors. Starting salaries may therefore be set below the market level 
and, subject to performance, increased by more than inflation as the employee gains experience over time.
The Executive Director will be eligible to receive benefits in line with Countryside’s benefits policy as set out 
in the remuneration policy table.
Pension An Executive Director will be able to participate in Countryside’s defined contribution pension scheme, 
or receive cash allowance in lieu of pension benefits in line with policy for existing Directors.
Annual bonus An Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme as set out in the 
remuneration policy table.
The maximum opportunity will be no more than 150 per cent of salary, as per the policy for existing 
Executive Directors.
Depending on the timing of the appointment, the Committee may deem it appropriate to set different annual 
bonus performance conditions for Executive Directors for the first year of appointment.
Long-term incentives An Executive Director will be eligible to participate in Countryside’s Long Term Incentive Plan as set out 
in the remuneration policy table.
The maximum opportunity offered may be up to 200 per cent of salary, as per the policy for existing 
Executive Directors.
An LTIP award can be made shortly following an appointment (assuming the Company is not in a closed period).
Share buy-outs/replacement awards The Committee’s policy is to not provide buy-outs as a matter of course. However, should the Committee 
believe it necessary to grant awards to replace awards from a previous employer, the Committee will seek 
to structure any replacement awards such that overall they are no more favourable than the awards due to 
be forfeited.
In determining the quantum and structure of any buy-out, the Committee will take into account the fair 
value and, as far as practicable, the timing and performance requirements of remuneration foregone.
Where possible, existing arrangements will be used, although the Committee may also make use of the flexibility 
provided by the Listing Rules to make awards without prior shareholder approval in unusual circumstances.
Relocation policies Should relocation of a newly recruited Executive Director be required, reasonable costs associated with 
this relocation will be met by the Company. Such relocation support could include but not be limited to 
payment of legal fees, removal costs, temporary accommodation/hotel costs, a contribution to Stamp Duty, 
replacement of non-transferable household items and related taxes incurred. In addition, and in appropriate 
circumstances, the Committee may grant additional support in relation to the payment of school fees.
The Company’s policy when setting fees for the appointment of new Non-Executive Directors is to apply the policy which applies to current 
Non-Executive Directors. countryside-properties.com

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT

SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
When setting notice periods, the Committee has regard to market practice and corporate governance best practice. Our policy is that notice periods for 
Executive Directors should be no greater than 12 months. Both the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer have contracts with 
notice periods of 12 months from either side. The notice period for Non-Executive Directors is three months, save in the case of the Chairman whose 
notice period is six months.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but are appointed under letters of appointment which provide for a review after an initial 
three-year term with the possibility of annual renewal. All service contracts and letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Company’s registered 
office and at the AGM.
When approving any termination payments for a departing director the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the Company whilst complying 
with the contractual terms and seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time. 
The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation 
(or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination 
of an Executive Director’s office or employment and may provide assistance with outplacement costs.
The table below sets out, for each element of total remuneration, the Company’s policy on payment for loss of office in respect of Executive Directors and 
any discretion available to the Committee. Broadly, treatment will depend on the circumstances of departure and in particular whether a leaver is a “good 
leaver”. For a “good leaver” the following will normally apply:
Remuneration element Treatment on cessation
Salary, benefits and pension Received for the notice period or payment in lieu of notice. Statutory redundancy payments as appropriate. 
Annual bonus No entitlement to a bonus; however, a pro-rata bonus may be paid following the end of the financial year 
in which they leave. 
Deferred bonus Vesting of deferred bonus shares on cessation.
LTIP The rules of the LTIP set out the treatment of good leavers. In summary, awards will normally vest on the 
normal vesting date and be subject to pro-rating, although the Committee has discretion to allow awards 
to vest on cessation and to waive pro-rating where it feels it is appropriate to do so.
The Committee may pay any statutory entitlements or settle compromise claims in connection with a termination of employment, where considered in the 
best interests of the Company.
CHANGE OF CONTROL
On a change of control of the Group, the following provisions would apply to Executive Directors:
Remuneration element Treatment on change of control
Salary, benefits and pension Received for the notice period or payment in lieu of notice if notice is given. Statutory redundancy payments 
as appropriate. 
Annual bonus No entitlement to a bonus; however, a pro-rata bonus may be paid following the end of the financial year 
in which they leave. 
Deferred bonus Vesting of deferred bonus shares.
LTIP The rules of the LTIP set out the treatment on a change of control. However, in summary, awards will normally 
vest at the date of change of control and normally be subject to pro-rating, although the Committee has 
discretion to waive pro-rating where it feels it is appropriate to do so. GOVERNANCE

notice is served. They are not entitled to participate in the Company’s share, bonus or pension schemes. The notice period for Non-Executive Directors is 
three months, save in the case of the Chairman whose notice period is six months.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP
Whilst the Committee does not consult directly with employees on Executive Directors’ remuneration, the Committee does receive updates regarding 
remuneration for employees across the Company. This is considered when determining the remuneration for the Directors.
DIFFERENCES IN REMUNERATION POLICY BETWEEN EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES 
The policy described above applies to the Group’s Executive Directors. The principles of the policy are designed with due regard to employees across 
the Group. Variable remuneration, particularly the LTIP, is restricted to the most senior employees in the Company who may directly influence Company 
performance. However, the Committee is committed to promoting a culture of widespread share ownership, including the provision of an all-employee 
share scheme.
POLICY IN RESPECT OF EXTERNAL BOARD APPOINTMENTS FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
It is recognised that external non-executive directorships may be beneficial for both the Company and the Executive Director concerned. At the discretion 
of the Board, Executive Directors are permitted to retain fees received in respect of any such non-executive directorship.
STATEMENT OF CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Committee is committed to maintaining a dialogue with our shareholders and we welcome their feedback. Any feedback received will be considered 
as part of the Committee’s annual review of remuneration policy. Dialogue with prospective shareholders in the lead-up to the Group’s IPO was an intrinsic 
part of its success and underpinned our remuneration policy. The share incentive and bonus schemes were designed with simplicity and shareholder preference 
in mind, and we received no adverse comment from shareholders about our proposed plans/schemes. We have continued our dialogue with shareholders 
during the year and have had no adverse comments from shareholders about our policy or remuneration payments.  countryside-properties.com

ANNUAL BONUS TARGETS AND OUTCOMES (AUDITED) CONTINUED
During 2016 the Board took the strategic decision to rephase a number of sites, which included sites that are now to be built out, rather than sold. 
This had the effect of deferring £5m of profit in relation to those sites from 2016 to 2017. The Board believed that this change was in the best interests 
of shareholders and, accordingly, the Remuneration Committee decided to adjust the threshold, target and maximum bonus targets downwards by £5m 
for the year. The Committee further decided that an equivalent upward adjustment should be made in the 2017 bonus scheme. The Board believes that the 
revised targets are no less challenging than the original targets.
The personal performance targets and out-turn for each Director are summarised in the table below:

The Group’s share plans comply with the Investment Association’s guidelines on dilution limits of 5 per cent in ten years for discretionary schemes 
and 10 per cent in ten years for all schemes. As at 30 September 2016, the Group has utilised 2.7 per cent of the 10 per cent in ten years limit and 
1.8 per cent of the 5 per cent in ten years limit.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee assists the Board in determining its responsibilities in relation to remuneration, including making recommendations 
to the Board on the Company’s policy on executive remuneration, setting the overarching principles, parameters and governance framework of the 
Group’s remuneration policy and determining the individual remuneration and benefits package of each of the Company’s Executive Directors and its 
Company Secretary. 
The Remuneration Committee will also ensure compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to remuneration. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code provides that a remuneration committee should comprise at least three members who are Independent Non-Executive Directors 
(other than the Chairman).
ADVISORS
During the financial year PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) and New Bridge Street (“NBS”), part of Aon Hewitt plc, provided independent advice 
to the Committee; NBS was appointed by the Committee following Admission. Neither NBS nor Aon provide any other services to the Company. The 
Committee is satisfied that the advice received by NBS in relation to executive remuneration matters during the year was objective and independent. Terms 
of engagement are available on request from the Company Secretary. Both PwC and NBS are members of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and abide 
by the Remuneration Consultants’ Group Code of Conduct, which requires its advice to be objective and impartial. The fees paid to PwC for advice during 
the year were £109,000 (excluding VAT). There were no fees paid to NBS for providing advice in relation to executive remuneration during this financial 
year. The advice provided primarily related to assisting with the Directors’ Remuneration Report and communication of the post-IPO remuneration 
practices.
STATEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER VOTING
As Countryside has not held an AGM since Admission no voting outcomes are available. Details of remuneration-related voting outcomes will be published 
in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.

SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL 
AGREEMENTS
The Strategic Report describes the most 
important customer and supplier contracts 
and other arrangements essential to the Group. 
We do not consider ourselves to be dependent 
on any single contractual agreement. Countryside 
entered into a new £300m revolving credit facility 
on 12 May 2016. The facility will expire in May 2021 
and has the potential to be extended by a further 
year on each of the first and second anniversaries 
of signing with the banks’ consent.
RELATIONSHIP AGREEMENT WITH 
CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS
Where a listed company has a controlling 
shareholder, it is required to have in place at all 
times a written and legally binding agreement 
which is intended to ensure that the controlling 
shareholder complies with the independence 
provisions set out in LR 6.1.4D. A “controlling 
shareholder” is defined as any person who 
exercises or controls on their own, or together 
with any person with whom they are acting in 
concert, 30 per cent or more of the votes able 
to be cast on all or substantially all matters 
at general meetings of a company. LR 6.1.4D 
requires that the agreement must contain 
undertakings that:
(a)  transactions and arrangements with the 
controlling shareholder (and/or any of its 
associates) will be conducted at arm’s length 
and on normal commercial terms;
(b)  neither the controlling shareholder nor any of 
its associates will take any action that would 
have the effect of preventing the listed company 
from complying with its obligations under the 
Listing Rules; and
(c)  neither the controlling shareholder nor any of 
its associates will propose or procure the proposal 
of a shareholder resolution which is intended 
or appears to be intended to circumvent the 
proper application of the Listing Rules.
The Board confirms that, in accordance with the 
Listing Rules, on 29 January 2016, the Company 
entered into such an agreement (the “Relationship 
Agreement”) with, among others, OCM Luxembourg 
Coppice T opco S.Á R.L. and various Oaktree 
funds* (together, the “Oaktree Shareholders”) 
who currently have a combined total holding 
of approximately 56 per cent of the Company’s 
voting rights. Under the terms of the Relationship 
Agreement, the Oaktree Shareholders have agreed 
to the independence obligations contained in the 
Relationship Agreement.
The Directors present their report and the audited ﬁnancial statements 
of Countryside Properties PLC (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(together the “Group”) for the year ended 30 September 2016.
The Directors’ Report comprises pages 70 to 72 of this report, in addition to the sections of 
the Annual Report incorporated by reference, including the Board biographies, the Corporate 
Governance Report, the Audit Committee Report, the Nomination Committee Report and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
In accordance with the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules (LR 9.8.4C), the information 
to be included in the Annual Report and Accounts, where applicable, under LR 9.8.4, is set out in 
this Directors’ Report, with the exception of the information set out in the table below, which can

 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 71
The Board confirms that, since the entry into the 
Relationship Agreement on 29 January 2016 until 
14 November 2016, being the latest practicable 
date prior to the publication of this Annual Report:
(i)  the Company has complied with the 
independence provisions included in the 
Relationship Agreement; and
(ii)  so far as the Company is aware, the 
independence provisions included in the 
Relationship Agreement have been complied 
with by the Oaktree Shareholders and 
their associates.
As there are no controlling shareholders of the 
Company other than the Oaktree Shareholders 
(if and when they have an interest exceeding 
30 per cent), there is no need for the Relationship 
Agreement to require the Oaktree Shareholders 
to procure compliance by any third parties with 
the independence provisions of the 
Relationship Agreement.
SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS – 
CHANGE OF CONTROL
Upon a change of control of Countryside 
Properties PLC, a number of signiﬁcant 
agreements take effect, alter or terminate 
as follows:
 – Revolving credit facility: Under the terms of 
the £300m revolving credit facility, entered 
into on 12 May 2016, and provided by a syndicate 
of banks to Countryside Properties PLC, the 
lenders may, following such change in control, 
elect to continue to provide such facility, or 
alternatively cancel it and require all monies 
borrowed under such facility to be repaid.
 – Directors and employees: There are no 
agreements between the Company and 
its Directors or employees providing for 
compensation for loss of ofﬁce or employment 
that occur because of a takeover bid or 
change of control.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
The Group is committed to employment policies 
which follow best practice based on equal 
opportunities for all employees, irrespective of 
gender, race, nationality, colour, disability, marital 
status, sexual orientation, age or religion. All 
decisions relating to employment practices are 
objective, free from bias and based upon work 
criteria and individual merit. The Group’s policy 
is to offer appropriate training and career 
development to disabled persons that are, as far 
as possible, identical to other employees and in 
line with best practice. In the event of a member 
of staff becoming disabled, the Group makes 
every effort to continue employment, arrange 
appropriate retraining and offer opportunities for 
promotion. For more information on our diversity 
statistics, please refer to the “Our People” 
section on page 30.
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT
The Group systematically provides employees 
with information on matters of concern to them, 
consulting them or their representatives regularly, 
so that their views can be taken into account when 
making decisions that are likely to affect their 
interests. Employee involvement in the Group is 
encouraged, a common awareness on the part of 
all employees of the financial and economic factors 
affecting the Group plays a major role in maintaining 
the Group’s customer-focused approach. For more 
information on how the Group engages its 
employees, refer to page 30 of the report. For 
more information on how employees can participate 
in the Group’s performance through membership 
of the LTIP and SAYE employee share schemes, 
refer to page 114 of the report. 
POLICY ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The policy with respect to ﬁnancial instruments is 
covered in the accounting policy (Note 3) to the 
ﬁnancial statements. The notes to the financial 
statements include the Company’s policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board is satisfied that PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP (“PwC”) remained independent for the purpose 
of the 2016 audit. During 2016 the Company 
initiated a competitive tender process for the 
audit contract. A number of contending candidates 
were invited to tender for the role of auditors 
of the Company. After a thorough review of 
the potential candidates, the Audit Committee 
concluded that PwC was the most suitable 
provider. Upon the Audit Committee’s 
recommendation, the Board approved the 
recommendation and the re-appointment 
of PwC will be presented to shareholders for 
approval as the Company’s auditors at the 2017 
Annual General Meeting. Information about 
non-audit services obtained from PwC can be 
found in the Audit Committee Report on page 47.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
A report on Countryside’s corporate governance 
framework, together with its compliance with the 
principles and provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, can be found in the Corporate 
Governance Report on page 44. The Corporate 
Governance Report forms part of this Directors’ 
Report and is incorporated into it by cross-reference.

which may exercise all powers of the Company. 
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES
By means of a Deed of Indemnity entered into 
separately by the Company and each Director, 
there is a qualifying third party indemnity provision 
(as per the Companies Act 2006) that provides, 
for the ﬁnancial year ended 30 September 2016 
and as at the date of this document, that the Company 
may pay for Directors’ indemnities out of its own 
assets. The Company has obtained directors’ 
and ofﬁcers’ insurance for this purpose.
SHARE CAPITAL
At the date of this report, 450,000,000 ordinary 
shares (the same number as at Admission to the 
London Stock Exchange) of £0.01 each have been 
issued, are fully paid up and are admitted to trading 
on the London Stock Exchange. The Company’s 
Articles of Association, copies of which can be 
obtained from the Company’s website, set 
out the rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company’s ordinary shares, as well as the powers 
of the Company’s Directors.
Details of employee share schemes are provided 
in Note 30 to the Group financial statements. 
PURCHASE OF THE COMPANY’S 
OWN SHARES
During the course of the reporting period, the 
Company made no purchases of its own shares in 
accordance with the authority granted at Admission.
STATEMENT OF DISCLOSURE OF 
INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
Each Director of the Company confirms that, as 
far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditors 
are unaware and that each of the Directors has 
taken all the steps they ought to have taken individually 
as a Director in order to make themselves aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information.
GOING CONCERN
The Directors have reviewed the liquidity 
position of the Group for the 12-month period 
from 28 November 2016. The cash ﬂows of the 
Group have been assessed against the Group’s 
available sources of ﬁnance on a monthly basis to 
determine the minimum and maximum expected 
levels of headroom. Based on this analysis and 
an assessment of the potential cash risks, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for at least 12 months 
from the date of this report. The Group 
therefore continues to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing its consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements. The Directors’ Viability Statement 
can be found in the Strategic Report on page 37. 
An outlook statement can be found in the Group 
Chief Executive’s Review on page 7.
CARBON EMISSIONS
Details of the Group’s approach to the environment, 
including information in relation to its carbon 
emissions, are set out in the section headed 
“Environment” on page 33, forming part of the 
Sustainability Report of the Annual Report on 
page 32.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Annual General Meeting of the Company 
will be held at Linklaters LLP, One Silk Street, 
London EC2Y 8HQ at 2.30 pm on 26 January 2017.

 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 73
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the Directors have prepared the Group 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted 
by the European Union, and the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with Financial 
Reporting Standard 102 (FRS 102) the financial 
reporting standard applicable in the UK and 
Republic of Ireland (FRS 102). 
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
 – make judgements and accounting estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and FRS 102 have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Group and parent company 
financial statements respectively;
 – notify its shareholders in writing about the 
use of disclosure exemptions, if any, of FRS 
102 used in the preparation of the parent 
financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient to 
show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group 
and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions 
are listed on page 42 to 43 of the Annual Report, 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 – the Group financial statements, which have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Group; and
 – the Directors’ Report contained on page 70 
of the Annual Report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces.

REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our opinion
In our opinion, Countryside Properties PLC’s Group financial statements (the ‘financial statements’):
 – Give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 September 2016 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
 – Have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union; and
 – Have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Financial Statements (the ‘Annual Report’), comprise:
 – The consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2016;
 – The consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
 – The consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
 – The consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
 – The notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are 
cross‑referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and applicable law.
Our audit approach
Context
Countryside Properties PLC is a British housebuilder and urban regeneration company listed on the London Stock Exchange. The Group is wholly 
UK based, operating in London and the South East of England, and with a presence in the North West of England through its Partnerships division. 
The Group is dependent on macroeconomic factors as well as the conditions of the UK residential property market. The Group may be particularly adversely 
affected by any factor that reduces sales prices or transaction volumes or presents constraints in the supply chain in the UK residential property market. This 
was particularly relevant for our work in the areas of margin forecasting and the valuation of inventory.
Overview
 – Overall Group materiality: £4.6m, which represents 5 per cent of profit before tax, adjusted for 
non‑underlying items.
 – The Group operates in two business segments, Partnerships and Housebuilding, as set out in the 
Annual Report (refer to pages 18 to 25). Each of the operating segments is broken down into 
a number of reporting units which are consolidated into the Group financial statements along 
with central reporting entities.
 – Reporting units from both segments were included in the scope of our work and the Group 
audit team performed an audit of the financial information at each of these locations.
 – In both segments we focused on auditing the complete financial information of the larger 
reporting units to give us appropriate coverage. We performed audit work over the complete 
financial information of reporting units which accounted for approximately 99.7 per cent of 
the Group’s revenues and 98.8 per cent of the Group’s profit before tax.
 – Included in the coverage above, the central reporting entities and group functions, together 
with the parent company, were subject to a full scope audit.
 – Cost forecast and margin estimates.
 – Land and stock valuation.
 – Commercial transactions (land).
 – Accounting for the IPO & related non‑underlying items.
 – Shared equity valuation.

REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Our audit approach continued
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked 
at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of Management override of internal controls, 
including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as ‘areas 
of focus’ in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks 
identified by our audit.
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Cost forecast and margin estimates
Refer to Note 3 (Accounting policies) and Note 2 (Critical accounting policies).
The Group’s margin recognition framework is based on the margin forecast for each 
site. These margins, which drive the recognition of costs as each unit is sold, reflect 
estimated selling prices and costs for each development. This process is effectively 
a method of allocating the total forecast costs, representing both land and build 
costs of a development over each individual unit.
There is a risk that the margin forecast for the site and the margin subsequently 
recognised on each unit sale is not appropriate and reflective of the actual final 
profit margin that will be recognised on a development.
We consider the appropriate margin recognition across the life of the site to be 
the most significant financial reporting risk for the Group, principally due to the 
high level of Management judgement involved in the accounting for the Group’s 
developments given that sales prices and build costs are inherently uncertain 
and are influenced by changes in external market factors, such as the availability 
of mortgages or build cost inflation.
We evaluated and tested Management’s forecasting and monitoring controls for the sites 
(including the margin), noting that Management’s forecasts are prepared, monitored and 
updated in accordance with the documented controls. 
We held discussions with Management to understand the status and progress of a sample of sites.
We assessed the appropriateness of certain underlying assumptions within the forecasts, 
including sales prices, land costs and build costs and assessed Management’s historic forecasting 
accuracy. We did not identify any sites where we considered the underlying assumptions 
in the forecast to be inappropriate. 
We assessed the historical accuracy of Management’s forecasting through review of actual 
margins achieved on completed sites compared to initial expected margins, noting no 
significant adverse trends. 
We checked the consistent application of the margin recognition framework through 
analysing the margins recognised on different phases within the same sites. We obtained 
evidence for any variances. 
We tested a sample of sales prices to cash receipts to support the revenue recognised 
noting no material exceptions. 
We tested a sample of costs incurred to third party supplier invoices noting no material exceptions.
Land and stock valuation
Refer to Note 3 (Accounting policies) and Note 2 (Critical accounting policies).
Inventory is comprised of land held for development, work in progress, raw 
materials and completed units/part‑exchanged properties.
Inventory is the most significant balance in the consolidated statement of financial 
position and is held at the lower of cost and net realisable value (‘NRV’). The NRV 
of each development is forecast and monitored as described in the area of focus 
above and is therefore subject to the same key assumptions. Due to the influence of 
the same external factors and the cyclical nature of the housing industry, with 
periodic downturns in customer demand, there is a risk that the calculation of the 
development’s NRV, being the margin the development is forecast to make over its 
lifecycle based upon forecast sales prices and build costs, may be subject to 
estimation error leading to inventory being held at an incorrect value and an 
unrecorded impairment charge.
We obtained an understanding of Management’s process for preparing a site forecast, 
consistent with the risk associated with the margin forecasting and recognition process. 
The site forecast, which is used to recognise margin in the consolidated income statement, 
also calculates the NRV of the site. Consistent with the risk associated with the margin 
forecasting and recognition, we evaluated Management’s controls over the approval of the 
initial forecasts and the monitoring of updates required to the forecasts over the course of 
the site’s life, noting no significant instances where controls were not operating as stated. 
We considered margins for all major sites to identify those with low or eroding margins, due 
to specific issues or underperformance. We discussed the identified sites with Management, 
including considering the level of provisions, if any, held against these sites and corroborated 
the explanations with available external evidence in respect of the carrying value of inventory. 
We also assessed the historical accuracy of Management’s forecasting as set out in the 
area of focus on cost forecasts and margin estimates. 
We discussed the planning status and strategic plans for sites with Management. We 
confirmed the composition of the inventory balance, specifically the level and ageing 
of completed but unreserved units, to understand if completed stock is held at the 
appropriate NRV. We did not note a significant number of aged, completed but 
unreserved units which needed further follow up. 
Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify any sites where we determined that 
additional impairments were required in the year, above those already booked by Management.
Commercial land transactions
Refer to Note 3 (Accounting policies).
The Group enters into commercial land transactions from time to time. The nature 
of these transactions can be complex and bespoke. The format of the agreements 
introduces potential accounting complexities in order to appropriately reflect the 
terms of the agreements.
Due to their complex nature, we focused on them to ensure that the accounting 
reflected the underlying agreements.
We held discussions with Management to understand the substance of material 
commercial land transactions.
Where applicable, we reviewed Management’s papers on the proposed accounting 
treatment of the transactions.
We substantively tested material or complex land acquisitions through examination of 
contracts and agreements to check that the acquisition and subsequent overage terms 
have been identified and accounted for appropriately, and that all the related liabilities have 
been properly recorded in the financial statements.
Where relevant we agreed cash payments and receipts to completion statements and 
bank statements.
We assessed the accounting treatment of the transactions against relevant accounting 
standards.
We were satisfied that Management had appropriately accounted for these transactions. countryside-properties.com

Accounting for the IPO and related non-underlying items
Refer to Note 3 (Accounting policies).
As a result of the flotation of the business in February 2016, a number of changes 
to the Group structure occurred. As the associated accounting entries arising are 
material in size and outside the ordinary course of business, we considered there to 
be a risk around the accounting for these transactions.
As part of the flotation process, significant costs were incurred by the Group. 
Separately identifying and disclosing items as non‑underlying on the face of the 
consolidated income statement requires judgement as such presentation could be 
misleading to investors.
There is the potential for Management bias, as well as the inappropriate inclusion of 
inconsistent transactions or those that should be deemed part of ordinary ongoing 
Group activity.
In auditing the accounting treatment of the flotation, we:
 – discussed the accounting transactions with Management and assessed them for 
reasonableness;
 – corroborated the accounting entries posted by Management to those arising from the 
transaction; and
 – traced significant monetary transactions to bank statements and contractual 
agreements.
We were satisfied that the significant transactions associated with the restructuring as a 
result of the IPO has been appropriately accounted for.
In auditing the appropriateness of the classification of items as non‑underlying items for 
external reporting purposes, we:
 – gained an understanding from Management of the nature of the transactions and 
amounts presented as non underlying items to understand Management’s rationale;
 – discussed the rationale behind Management’s classification and assessed the 
appropriateness of the transactions recognised as non‑underlying items using our 
knowledge of the business, inquiries of Management, examination of documents 
supporting the strategic change and related reorganisation, and through consideration 
of expenses that are typically connected with restructuring activities. 
 – assessed the completeness and balance of non‑underlying items through identifying 
other large or unusual items in underlying profit, considering potential disclosure 
where significant. 
 – agreed a sample of expenses invoices, and verified payments made to bank statements 
to conclude on the existence and accuracy of classification. 
Inspected the consistency with which items are classified as non‑underlying as presented 
by Management. We were satisfied that the classification, judgements and disclosures 
made by Management are appropriate and in line with the Group accounting policy 
on non‑underlying items.
Shared equity valuation (available for sale financial assets)
Refer to Note 3 (Accounting policies) and Note 2 (Critical accounting policies).
The Group has advanced loans to homebuyers to assist them in the purchase 
of their property under shared equity schemes. These loans are held as available 
for sale financial assets in the balance sheet and are held at fair value. 
The valuation method for these assets is not capable of being based on observable 
market data and therefore the valuation model is highly subjective to Management 
judgement and estimates, including expected house price movements, credit risk of 
borrowers, discount rates (which incorporate purchaser default rates), recoverability 
and expected timing of receipt.
Changes in the assumptions used can have a material impact on the fair value of 
these assets.
We evaluated and tested the mechanics of the calculation to check the correct application 
of the underlying assumptions and accuracy of the calculation, noting no material exceptions.
We tested movements in the underlying loans during the year, such as redemptions and obtained 
examples of the original loan agreements to verify terms of the loans used within the calculation.
Through discussion with Management and review of the calculation we understood 
the key assumptions included within the calculation including expected house price 
movements, discount rates, recoverability and expected timing of receipt. 
We corroborated these assumptions by comparing those selected by Management to 
comparable discount rates used by similar companies, and our own independent research 
on house prices and redemption rates.
In addition to re‑performing Management’s sensitivities we performed our own 
sensitivities based upon our own independent research to ascertain the extent to which 
reasonable adverse changes would, either individually or in aggregate, materially change 
the valuation of the assets. Our sensitivities noted no reasonable likely scenario that 
would result in a material change to the valuation. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Our audit approach continued
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking 
into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls and the industry in which the Group operates. 
The Group is structured into two segments, Housebuilding and Partnerships. These are then further structured into seven operating divisions, five for 
Housebuilding and two for Partnerships. Each of the divisions is broken down into a number of reporting units (which also include joint ventures) that are 
consolidated into the Group financial statements, along with the centralised functions.
The reporting units vary in size and we identified 17 reporting units which required an audit of their complete financial information due to their individual 
size. These 17 reporting units were all audited by the Group engagement team and, where applicable, included the audit of the joint ventures. In some of the 
divisions we audited complete financial information of all the reporting units and in some we focused on the larger reporting units to give us appropriate 
coverage. The reporting units where we performed an audit of the complete financial information accounted for 98.8 per cent of the Group’s profit before 
tax and 99.7 per cent of the Group’s revenue.
Our audit work at these reporting units, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level on the consolidation, joint venture adjustments, 
tax, share based payments and the ‘available for sale financial assets’, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group and Company financial 
statements as a whole.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £4.6m.
How we determined it 5 per cent of profit before tax, adjusted for non‑underlying items.
Rationale for benchmark applied Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality by applying a benchmark of 5% of profit before tax 
excluding non‑underlying items. We believe that underlying profit before tax is the most appropriate measure as it 
eliminates any disproportionate effect of non‑underlying charges and credits and provides a consistent year‑on‑year 
basis for our work.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.2m as well as misstatements below 
that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 72, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report 
having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the directors’ 
statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for 
at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – Information in the Annual Report is: 
 – Materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or 
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired 
in the course of performing our audit; or 
 – otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions  
to report.
 – The statement given by the directors on page 73, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Code’), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for members to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions  
to report.
 – The section of the Annual Report on page 47, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.

OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING CONTINUED
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity 
of the Group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
 – The directors’ confirmation on page 36 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, that 
they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material to  
add or to draw attention to.
 – The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated. We have nothing material to  
add or to draw attention to.
 – The directors’ explanation on page 37 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, as to how 
they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period 
to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to  
add or to draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer‑term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only 
consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the 
relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further provisions of the Code. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibility statement set out on page 73, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 – Whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
 – The reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
 – The overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating 
the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for 
us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non‑financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 30 September 2016
1. GENERAL INFORMATION 
Countryside Properties PLC is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are publicly traded on the 
London Stock Exchange. The Company’s registered office is Countryside House, The Drive, Brentwood, Essex CM13 3AT.
The Group’s principal activities are building new homes and regeneration of public sector land.
The parent company financial statements are on pages 117 to 124.
Initial Public Offering (“IPO”)
The Company listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange on 17 February 2016.
These are the first full set of consolidated financial statements of Countryside Properties PLC following the reorganisation of the Group to facilitate the IPO. 
The reorganisation is described below.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the merger method of accounting because the transaction under which the Company became 
the holding company of OCM Luxembourg Coppice Midco S.à r.l. (“Midco”) was a Group reconstruction with no change in the ultimate ownership of the 
Group. All the shareholdings in Midco were exchanged via a share‑for‑share transfer on 11 February 2016. The Company did not actively trade at the time. 
The result of the application of the capital reorganisation is to present the financial statements as if the Company had always owned the Group – the 
financial statements, including comparatives, have been presented as a continuation of Midco. The prior year financial statements for Midco are available in 
the Prospectus, prepared for the purpose of the IPO, which is available on the Group’s website: investors.countryside‑properties.com.
Group reorganisation
The principal steps of the Group reorganisation were as follows:
The Company was incorporated on 18 November 2015 as a public company limited by shares in the United Kingdom, with share capital of £1, consisting of 
one ordinary share with a £1 nominal value. On 19 November 2015, the Company issued a further nine ordinary shares and 50,000 redeemable preference 
shares, each of £1.
The Company became the ultimate holding company of the Group with Midco becoming the Company’s direct subsidiary on 11 February 2016 by way of a 
share‑for‑share exchange. The insertion of the Company as a new holding company constitutes a Group reorganisation and the transaction is accounted for 
as a capital reorganisation and merger relief applied in accordance with Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
The balance of outstanding mandatory redeemable preference shares of £287m and the associated accrued return of £111m as of 16 February 2016 was 
transferred from the holders (being OCM Luxembourg Coppice T opco S.à r.l., being an entity controlled by Oaktree Capital Management L.P., and certain 
members of the Group’s management) to the Company in exchange for 392 million ordinary shares in the Company, each of £1. 
Under merger relief the shares issued in this transaction were recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position at the nominal value of the shares 
issued plus the fair value of any additional consideration, which was recorded as a merger reserve in the Group financial statements. The assets and liabilities 
of the subsidiaries are consolidated at book value in the Group financial statements and the consolidated reserves of the Group are adjusted to reflect the 
statutory share capital, share premium and merger reserve of the Company as if it had always existed.
On 17 February 2016 the Company issued 57,777,778 additional shares, each of £1, for consideration of £130m, the balance being recorded as share 
premium, in an IPO. As permitted by Section 610(2b) of the Companies Act 2006, £4.6m of the IPO costs have been charged to the share premium 
account. The mandatory redeemable preference shares were redeemed on IPO. 
On 9 March 2016, the Company undertook a court‑approved capital reduction, in which the nominal value of the ordinary shares was reduced to £0.01 
each, which had the effect of reducing the merger reserve and share premium arising on IPO to £Nil.
2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) requires the Directors to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and related disclosures. 
Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, the Directors have made no individual judgements that have 
a significant impact on the financial statements, apart from those involving estimates which are described below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Estimates and underlying assumptions affecting the financial statements are based on historical experience and other relevant factors and are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. This approach forms the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based or as a result of new 
information. Such changes are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised. 
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value 
of assets and liabilities are described below.
Estimation of site profitability
In order to determine the profit or loss that the Group recognises on its developments and construction contracts in a specific period, the Group allocates 
the total cost of each development, and construction contract between the proportion completing in the period and the proportion to complete in a future 
period. The assessment of the total costs to be incurred requires a degree of estimation due to the long‑term nature of the Group’s activities and because 
actual costs are subject to market fluctuations. Group management has established internal controls to review and ensure the appropriateness of estimates 
made on an individual contract basis. countryside-properties.com

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 30 September 2016
2. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES CONTINUED
Key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Carrying value of inventory
Inventory generated through the normal course of business is recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. A financial appraisal is prepared and 
updated monthly for each development, which records an estimate of future revenues and expenditure. As both future cost and sales prices fluctuate in line 
with local market conditions, significant adverse variances in either costs or sales prices estimates could lead to an impairment of inventory. In circumstances 
where forecast revenues are lower than anticipated expenditure, an inventory provision is made. This inventory provision may be reversed in future periods 
when there is evidence of improved selling prices or reduced expenditure forecast on a development.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available‑for‑sale financial assets comprise loans that have been advanced to homebuyers to assist in their purchase of property under historical shared 
equity schemes. The loans are secured by either a first or second charge over the property and are either interest free or have interest chargeable from 
the fifth year onwards.
The loans are held at fair value, which is based on an estimate of the future cash flows from the loans. The estimate considers the value of the property 
based upon market conditions, including potential future house price increases, and possible borrower default. The loans are discounted at an interest rate 
equivalent to that which would be payable for loans made against property by a third party.
3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
These financial statements for the year to 30 September 2016 are those of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. It has been prepared in accordance with 
the IFRS as endorsed by the European Union, IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRS IC”) interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, in Sterling and rounded to the nearest thousand pounds under the historical cost 
convention, except for available‑for‑sale financial assets and share‑based payments.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 39. 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described on pages 26 to 29 of the Strategic Report. 
Further disclosures regarding borrowings are provided in Note 23. 
As described in the Viability Statement, the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the Company over a three ‑year period to September 2019. 
The Board has performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including those risks that would threaten Countryside’s business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
Having considered these forecasts, the Directors are satisfied the Group has sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom to enable the Group to conduct 
its business and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly these financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
New standards, amendments and interpretations
With the exception of the above, no new standards, amendments or interpretations effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 October 2015 
have had a material impact on the financial statements.
During the IFRS period the Interpretations Committee received a request to clarify an issue related to IAS 32: Financial Statements: Presentation in connection 
with whether particular cash pooling arrangements meet the requirement for off‑setting in accordance with IAS 32. Following the observations published by the 
Interpretations Committee the Group has reassessed the treatment of its cash pooling arrangements and concluded that the comparative financial information 
should be represented compared to the financial information for the year ended 30 September 2015 and 30 September 2014 as disclosed in the Prospectus. 
The impact of this change is that the amount of cash previously reported at 30 September 2015 of £354,000 (2014: £172,000) has increased by £80,481,000 
(2014: £67,338,000) to £80,835,000 (2014: £67,510,000) and borrowings which were previously reported at £343,361,000 (£2014: 433,746,000) have increased 
by a corresponding amount to £423,842,000 (2014: £366,408,000). This also had the impact of increasing the amount of cash and cash equivalents reported 
in the cash flow statement from £354,000 to £80,835,000. There was no impact on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 85
3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
New standards, amendments and interpretations continued
The following amendments to standards and interpretations which will be relevant to the preparation of the Group’s financial statements have been issued, 
but are not effective and have not been early adopted for the financial year beginning 1 October 2016:
 – IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, on ‘Classification and Measurement’ (effective 1 October 2018). This is the first part of a new standard on classification 
and measurement of financial assets that will replace IAS 39. IFRS 9 has two measurement categories: amortised cost and fair value. All equity instruments 
are measured at fair value. A debt instrument is at amortised cost only if the entity is holding it to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows 
represent principal and interest. Otherwise it is at fair value through profit or loss. Amortised cost accounting will also be applicable for most financial 
liabilities, with bifurcation of embedded derivatives. The main change is that in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part 
of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates 
an accounting mismatch. 
 – IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (effective 1 October 2018). This standard will replace both IAS 18, which covers contracts 
for goods and services, and IAS 11, which covers construction contracts. The basis for IFRS 15 is revenue is now recognised when control of a good 
or service is transferred to a customer, which replaces the existing treatment of risks and rewards. Under the new standard, revenue is also allocated 
to separate performance obligations under a contract and revenue is recognised once the performance obligations are met. 
 – IFRS 16 'Leases' (effective 1 October 2019) redefines how an entity will recognise, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard requires lessees 
to recognise all leases as assets, unless the underlying asset has a low value, or the lease term is one year or less. IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17.
 – Amendments to IAS 7 and IAS 12 (effective 1 October 2018). These amendments require additional disclosures in the statement of cash flows 
and recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses respectively.
 – Amendment to IFRS 2 (effective 1 October 2018). This amendment clarifies the measurement for cash‑settled, share‑based payments and the 
accounting for modifications that change an award from cash settled to equity settled. It also introduces an exception to the principles in IFRS 2 
that will require an award to be treated as if it was wholly equity settled, where an employer is obliged to withhold an amount for the employee's 
tax obligations associated with a share‑based payment and pay that amount to the tax authority.
 – Amendment to IFRS 15 (effective 1 October 2018). These amendments comprise clarifications of the guidance on identifying performance obligations, 
accounting for licences of intellectual property and the principal versus agent assessment (gross versus net revenue presentation).
There are no IFRSs or IFRS IC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group for the financial 
year beginning 1 October 2016.
The Group has not applied the following amendments to standards which are EU endorsed but not yet effective:
 – Amendments to IFRS 11: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interest in Joint Operations
 – Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative 
 – Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
 – Amendments to IAS 27: Separate Financial Statements on the Equity Method
 – Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 Cycle 
The Group is currently considering the impact of these amendments on the Group; however, it is anticipated they will be minimal and effects will principally 
relate to the amendment of current disclosures.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities which the Group has the power to control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated in the financial statements using the acquisition method of accounting from the date on which 
control is obtained up until the date that control ceases. 
Non‑controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the income statement, the statement of changes in equity and 
statement of financial position. 
Where the accounting policies of a subsidiary or equity‑accounted investee do not conform in all material respects to those of the Group, adjustments 
are made on consolidation to reflect the accounting policies of the Group.
Intragroup transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in preparing the financial 
statements. Gains arising from transactions with joint arrangements and associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. countryside-properties.com

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 30 September 2016
3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Associate and joint ventures
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence but does not exercise control or joint control. Investments in 
associates are accounted for using the equity method. 
The Group has applied IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint 
ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. 
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in the associate and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the 
Group’s share of the post‑acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate or 
joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations 
or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. 
Unrealised losses arising on transactions between the Group and its associate and joint ventures are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence 
of an impairment of the asset transferred. 
The Group funds its associate and joint ventures through a combination of equity investment and shareholder loans. The Directors review the recoverability 
of investments and shareholder loans for impairment annually. Where an investment is held in an associate which has net liabilities, the investment is held at 
£Nil and other long‑term interests, such as shareholder loans, are reduced by the value equal to the net liabilities, unless it has incurred legal or constructive 
obligations or made payments on behalf of its associate or joint ventures. 
Business combinations
All acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of an acquisition is the aggregate of the fair values of the assets 
transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued at the date of acquisition. The consideration transferred includes the fair value 
of the asset or liability resulting from a deferred and contingent consideration arrangement.
Costs directly relating to an acquisition are expensed to the income statement. The identified assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at 
their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of cost of acquisition over the aggregate fair value of the Group’s share of the net identified assets plus 
identified intangible assets is recorded as goodwill.
Intangible assets 
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration on acquisition of a subsidiary over the interest in net fair value of the identifiable net assets and 
contingent liabilities acquired. If the total consideration transferred is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly 
in the income statement. 
An impairment review is carried out annually or when circumstances arise that may indicate an impairment is likely. The carrying value of goodwill is compared 
to its recoverable amount being the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is charged immediately to the income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units (“CGUs”), or groups 
of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the 
lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
Brands
The Group carries assets on the balance sheet for brands that have been acquired. Internally generated brands are not recognised. Cost is determined at 
acquisition as being directly attributable cost or, where relevant, by using an appropriate valuation method. Acquired brands are tested for impairment when 
a triggering event is identified. Acquired brands are amortised over a period of 20 years.
Software
Computer software that generates an economic benefit of greater than one year is recognised as an intangible asset and carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Computer software costs that are recognised as assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their economic useful life of four years. 
These are reviewed for impairment at such time as there is a change in circumstances by which the carrying value may no longer be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any applicable impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged at rates to write off the cost of the asset on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The applicable annual 
rates are:
 – Plant and machinery 20 per cent to 25 per cent
 – Fixtures and fittings 10 per cent
The Group does not own any land or buildings considered to be non‑trade related.
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. 
Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: 
 – loans and receivables; and 
 – available for sale. 
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at 
initial recognition. Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the Group transfers 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 87
3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Financial assets continued
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non‑derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included 
in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non‑current assets. 
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise “trade and other receivables” and “cash and cash equivalents” in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available‑for‑sale financial assets are non‑derivative assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are 
included in non‑current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period. 
Equity share scheme loans are classified as available‑for‑sale financial assets and are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs. Fair value is assessed 
annually with gains and losses being recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income until the loan is repaid. The loans 
are discounted at an interest rate equivalent to market rate. On repayment the accumulated fair value, which had been recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, is recognised in the Income Statement. If a loan is determined to be impaired, any impairment loss is recognised immediately 
in the Income Statement.
Increases in the fair value of available‑for‑sale assets are initially deferred and recorded within reserves. Reductions in the fair value of available‑for‑sale assets 
are recorded as a reduction in reserves, to the extent available, with any additional reduction recorded in the Income Statement. The net deferral of 
increases in fair value are disclosed in the available‑for‑sale reserve.
Inventories
Inventories are normally stated at cost (or fair value if acquired as part of a business combination) and held at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Costs comprise direct materials, applicable direct labour and those overheads incurred to bring the inventories to their present location and condition. 
Net realisable value represents estimated selling price less all estimated costs to sell, including sales and marketing costs.
Land options purchased are initially stated at cost. Option costs are written off over the remaining life of the option and are also subject to impairment review. 
Impairment reviews are performed when circumstances arise which indicate an impairment is likely, such as a refusal of planning permission. Any impairments 
are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Land inventory is recognised when the substantial risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the Group after unconditional exchange of contracts. 
Where land is purchased with deferred payment terms, a corresponding liability is recognised within trade and other payables.
Pre‑contract expenditure is capitalised where it is probable that a contract will be signed or otherwise is recognised as an expense within costs of sales 
in the Income Statement.
Provisions for inventories are made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of inventories and work in progress to their net realisable value.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment. A provision for impairment 
is established when the carrying value of the receivable exceeds the present value of the future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest 
rate. The carrying value of the receivable is reduced and any impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement. If collection is expected in one year 
or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), receivables are classified as current assets. If not, they are classified as non‑current assets. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and other short‑term deposits held by the Group with maturities of three months or less. 
Bank overdrafts are classified within current liabilities.
Trade payables 
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated initially at their fair value and subsequently amortised cost. 
Where land is purchased on deferred settlement terms the land and associated liability are discounted to their fair value. The discount to fair value is amortised 
over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method. Changes in estimates of the final payment due are 
capitalised into inventory and, in due course, to cost of sales in the Income Statement.
Trade payables also include liabilities in respect of land overage where the Group is committed to make contractual payments to land vendors related to 
the performance of the development in the future. Land overage is estimated based on expected future cash flows in relation to relevant developments and, 
where payment will take place in more than one year, is discounted.
Deposits received from customers relating to sales of new properties are classified within current trade payables. 
Trade payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are classified as non‑current liabilities. 
Borrowings
Interest‑bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at their fair value and bank loans are reported net of direct transaction costs to the extent 
that borrowings are available for offset. Such instruments are subsequently carried at their amortised cost and finance charges, including premiums payable 
on settlement or redemption, are amortised over the term of the instrument using the effective interest rate method. The excess of unamortised borrowing 
costs is disclosed within prepayments.
Bank loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the 
date of the statement of financial position. Overdrafts are classified as current liabilities.
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of economic 
benefits that can be reliably estimated. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is discounted at the pre‑tax discount rate that 
reflects the risks specific to the liability. Provisions for onerous leases are recognised when the foreseeable net cash outflows on a lease exceed the benefits 
derived from the lease which has more than one year before expiring or option to exercise a break. countryside-properties.com

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 30 September 2016
3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in share premium as a deduction from 
the proceeds.
Where any Group company holds shares in the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, 
is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Mandatory redeemable preference shares 
Mandatory redeemable preferred shares were interest‑bearing financial liabilities which were recorded at their fair value. Such instruments are carried at their 
amortised cost with returns recognised over the term of the instrument using the effective interest rate method. The Mandatory Redeemable Preference 
Shares were all settled as part of the pre‑IPO reorganisation as described in Note 1.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Statement of Financial Position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of applicable value added tax, Stamp Duty Land Tax, rebates and discounts 
and after eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue and profit are recognised as set out below.
Private housing 
Revenue is recognised in the income statement on legal completion at the fair value of the consideration received. 
Part exchange 
In certain instances, property may be accepted in part consideration for a sale of a residential property. The fair value is established by independent surveyors, 
reduced for cost to sell. Net proceeds generated from the subsequent sale of part‑exchange properties are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. 
The original sale is recorded in the normal way, with the fair value of the exchanged property replacing cash receipts.
Cash incentives
Cash incentives are considered to be a discount from the purchase price offered to the acquirer and are therefore accounted for as a reduction to revenue.
Land and commercial sales
Revenue is recognised when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the land or commercial property transfer to the buyer, generally 
when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts. Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable.
Affordable housing contracts and design and build contracting
Contract revenue and costs are recognised in accordance with IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’. 
Where the outcome of a long‑term contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the 
contract activity at the balance sheet date. This is normally measured by surveys of work performed to date. Variations in contract work, claims and 
incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue and they are capable of being reliably measured.
Where the outcome of a long‑term contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it 
is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. When it is probable that total contract 
costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately in the income statement within cost of sales.
Project management services
Revenue earned for the provision of project management services, typically to the Group’s joint ventures and associate, are recognised on an accruals 
basis in line with the underlying contract.
Cost of sales
For sales of private housing, the Group determines the value of inventory charged to cost of sales based on the total budgeted cost of developing a site. 
Once the total expected costs of development are established they are allocated to individual plots to achieve a build cost per plot. These costs are recognised 
within cost of sales when the related revenue is recognised in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy.
To the extent that additional costs or savings are identified as the site progresses, these are recognised over the remaining plots unless they are specific 
to a particular plot, in which case they are recognised in the income statement at the point of sale.
For land and commercial property sales, cost of sales represents the carrying value of the related inventory on the Group’s balance sheet and this is recognised 
within cost of sales when revenue is recognised in accordance with the Group’s revenue recognition policy.
As outlined above, costs in relation to the sale of affordable housing and design and build contracts are recognised in accordance with IAS 11. 
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Rentals payable and incentives receivable under operating leases are recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Finance costs and finance income
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs in relation to the Group’s debt facility are recognised on an accruals basis. Also included in borrowing costs is the amortisation of fees 
associated with the arrangement of the financing. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are 
accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument 
to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Group does not capitalise borrowing costs into developments.
Unwind of discounting
The finance cost associated with the time value of money on discounted receivables and payables is recognised within finance costs as the discount unwinds 
over the life of the relevant item. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 89
3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Current and deferred income taxation 
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. 
Current taxation 
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the period which differs from accounting profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and those items never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax 
is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax rates used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in 
a transaction which affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the substantively enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled 
based upon tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in comprehensive income, 
except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity, or items charged or credited 
directly to other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when the Group intends to settle the balances on a net basis.
Segment reporting 
Segment reporting is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Group’s business segments. Segmental reporting reflects the Group’s 
management structure and primary basis of internal reporting. 
Segmental results include items directly attributable to the segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
The chief operating decision‑maker (“CODM”) has been identified as the Group’s Executive Committee. The CODM reviews the Group’s internal reporting 
in order to assess performance and allocate resources. The CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments based on underlying operating 
profit and tangible net operating asset values (“TNOAV”).
Pension obligations 
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions 
to a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all 
employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. 
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when 
they fall due.
Share-based payments
The Group provides benefits to employees (including Directors) of the Group in the form of equity‑settled and cash‑settled share‑based payment 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for rights over shares. For equity‑settled share‑based payments, the fair value of the employee 
services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares awarded or options granted, excluding the impact of any non‑market vesting 
conditions. All share options are valued using an option‑pricing model (Black Scholes or Monte Carlo). This fair value is charged to the income statement 
over the vesting period of the share‑based payment scheme. 
For cash‑settled share‑based payments, the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined at each balance sheet date and the charge recognised 
through the income statement over the vesting period of the share‑based payment scheme, with the corresponding increase in accruals. The value of the charge 
is adjusted in the income statement over the remainder of the vesting period to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting, with the corresponding 
adjustments made in equity and accruals. 
Countryside Properties PLC invoices its subsidiary undertakings an amount equivalent to the fair value of the grant by the Company of options over its 
equity instruments to the employees of subsidiaries. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is 
recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
Adjusted measures
Certain items which do not relate to the Group’s underlying performance are presented separately in the Income Statement as non‑underlying items where, 
in the judgement of the Directors, they need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size or incidence in order to obtain a clear and consistent 
presentation of the Group’s underlying business performance. As these non‑underlying items can vary significantly from year to year they create volatility 
in reported earnings. In addition, the Directors believe that in discussing the performance of the Group, the results of joint ventures and associate should 
be proportionally consolidated, including the Group’s share of revenue, operating profit and TNOAV given their importance to the Group’s operations.
As such, the Directors believe that the “adjusted revenue”, “adjusted Group operating profit” and “adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share” measures 
presented provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of the Group’s ongoing business for shareholders. Adjusted Group 
operating profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the “adjusted” or “underlying” profit measures of other companies.
Examples of material and non‑recurring items which may give rise to disclosure as non‑underlying items are:
 – fees incurred in relation to business combinations or capital market transactions; 
 – adjustments to the statement of financial position that do not relate to trading activity such as the recognition and reversal of non‑trade impairments; and
 – accelerated write‑off of unamortised issue costs on the re‑financing of borrowings. countryside-properties.com

3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Adjusted measures continued
Share‑based payment charges in respect of the pre‑IPO Management Incentive Plan established during the year ended 30 September 2013 in connection 
with the acquisition of Copthorn Holdings Limited and its subsidiary companies by Oaktree Capital Management LLC are also treated as a non‑underlying 
item. This allows the underlying performance of the Group to be measured from period to period, due to that fact the full benefits of owning these shares 
are crystallised only following an exit event, such as the IPO.
Adjusted Group operating profit is one of the key measures used by the Board to monitor Group’s performance.
Dividends
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Dividends payable are recorded in the period in which they are approved or paid, whichever is earliest.
4. SEGMENTAL REPORTING
Segmental reporting is presented in respect of the Group’s business segments reflecting the Group’s management and internal reporting structure and is on 
the basis on which strategic operating decisions are made by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision‑Maker (“CODM”). The Group’s two business segments 
are Housebuilding and Partnerships. 
The Housebuilding division develops large‑scale sites, providing private and affordable housing on land owned or controlled by the Group, primarily around 
London and in the South and East of England, operating under both the Countryside and Millgate brands.
The Partnerships division specialises in medium to large‑scale housing regeneration schemes delivering private and affordable homes in partnership with 
public sector land owners and operates primarily in and around London, the North West of England and the West Midlands.
Segmental adjusted operating profit and segmental operating profit includes items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated 
on a reasonable basis. Central head office costs have been allocated between the segments using a percentage of revenue basis. Items below Group 
operating profit have not been allocated.
Segmental net assets and tangible net operating asset value includes items directly attributable to the segment as well as those that can be allocated on a 
reasonable basis with the exception of intangibles, mandatory redeemable preference share (including the return) and net bank loans (excluding unamortised 
bank loan and arrangement fees).
Countryside operates entirely within the United Kingdom.

Advisory fees
During the years ended 30 September 2016 and 2015, the Group engaged in corporate activity in relation to the listing of its ordinary shares on the London Stock 
Exchange. Advisory costs of £10,561,000 (2015: £1,698,000) were charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in relation to this activity. 
Additionally, as disclosed in Note 1, £4,610,000 of IPO ‑related costs were charged to the share premium account. These costs primarily relate to the fees of 
professional advisors.
Impairment of non-trade receivable 
The non‑recurring charge of £2,677,000 relates to the impairment of a receivable during the prior year which management believed to be irrecoverable. 
During the year £2,590,000 has been received in cash resulting in partial reversal of the impairment.
Share-based payments – pre-IPO
In the year ended 30 September 2013, a Management Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) was approved by the Board in which certain senior employees 
of Countryside Properties (UK) Limited, a subsidiary company, were invited to acquire shares issued by OCM Luxembourg Midco S.à r.l. The Directors 
believe that this Plan should be treated as a non‑underlying item, as this allows the underlying performance of the Group to be measured from period 
to period. No awards under the Plan have been made since the IPO.
£1,910,000 was charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the year ended 30 September 2016 (2015: £1,310,000) in respect 
of charges related to the Plan. countryside-properties.com

Impairment of unamortised loan arrangement fees
As described in Note 23, the Group refinanced in May 2016. As a result, unamortised debt finance costs in relation to the previous facility as at the refinancing 
date of £3,177,000 were expensed as a non‑underlying finance cost.
Change of Board Director 
During the year ended 30 September 2015, £870,000 of costs were incurred in relation to the resignation and appointment of Chief Financial Officers 
of Copthorn Holdings Limited. This amount includes compensation for loss of office of £750,000 and £120,000 of recruitment costs.
Taxation
A total tax credit of £969,000 (2015: £1,419,000) in relation to all of the above non‑recurring items was included within taxation in the income statement.

Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were substantively enacted as part of the Finance Bill 2015 on 26 October 2015. These include reductions to the 
main rate to 19 per cent from 1 April 2017 and to 18 per cent from 1 April 2020. Deferred taxes at the balance sheet date have been measured using these 
enacted rates and reflected in these financial statements.
The tax assessed for the year is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom, which is 20 per cent (2015: 29.22 per cent being 
the statutory rate in Luxembourg).

These items in both years largely relate to disallowable costs incurred in relation to the IPO, principally legal and advisory fees.
Transfer pricing adjustments
These adjustments in both years relate to the disallowable portion of interest costs in relation to loans from the Group’s previous parent entity which 
was based in Luxembourg. These loans were repaid in full on IPO.
Income tax charged directly to equity
Income tax of £154,000 (2015: £Nil) was charged directly to equity in relation to share based payments. countryside-properties.com

10. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue from the date of the IPO to 30 September 2016. The weighted average number of shares for both the current and preceding years has been 
stated as if the Group reorganisation had occurred at the beginning of the comparative year. When calculating diluted earnings per share, the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of 0.2 million of potentially dilutive ordinary shares. These represent share options 
granted to employees under the Group’s Save As You Earn plan.

(b) Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share 
Adjusted Group operating profit represents a key measure for the Group. Adjusted earnings per share excludes non‑underlying items from Group profit as follows:

Diluted weighted average number of shares (millions) 450.2 450.2
Diluted adjusted earnings per share (pence per share) 16.3 5.5
Non‑underlying items net of tax include costs of £13,058,000, net of tax of £969,000 (2015: costs of £6,555,000, net of tax of £1,419,000).
The above analysis represents a non‑GAAP measure which has been included to assist understanding of the Group’s business.

Goodwill
Goodwill relates to the acquisition of the Copthorn Holdings Group in April 2013 (£19,297,000) and Millgate Developments in February 2014 (£18,527,000). 
Both entities are considered to be cash generating units (“CGUs”). The goodwill balance is tested annually for impairment. The recoverable amount has been 
determined as the value in use of the business assessed on the current five‑year cash flow forecasts. These forecasts are based on achieving the Group’s 
medium term targets of 17 per cent operating margin and 28 per cent ROCE with appropriate growth rates applied in following years. Cash flow beyond 
the five‑year period is extrapolated using a growth rate of 2 per cent. Cash flows generated by both CGUs are discounted using a pre ‑tax discount rate of 
12.5 per cent, approved by the Board of Directors. The cash flow forecasts are also sensitised for a slowdown in sales and a reduction in selling prices. 
Significant headroom exists on all sensitised forecasts given the relative size of goodwill compared to annual operating profits and cash flows.
Brand
Brand relates to both the Countryside brand (£13,500,000), acquired as part of the Copthorn Holdings Group in 2013, and the Millgate brand (£10,700,000), 
acquired as part of Millgate Developments Limited in 2014. Both brands have been valued using the income method and are considered to have a useful 
economic life of 20 years.
Amortisation expense in respect of the Group’s brands of £1,201,000 (2015: £1,201,000) has been charged to administrative expenses.

At 30 September 8,665 10,535
The available‑for‑sale financial assets comprise loans advanced to homebuyers to assist in the purchase of their property under shared equity schemes. 
The loans are secured by either a first or second legal charge over the property and are either interest free or have interest chargeable from the fifth year 
onwards or tenth year onwards, dependent upon the scheme under which the loans were issued.
The assets are held at fair value, which represents the current market value of the properties held discounted to fair value, based on the redemption date of 
the loan. These loans are subject to credit risk, where loans may potentially not be repaid if the borrower defaults on repayment. An adjustment for credit 
risk is built into the calculation by using a discount rate equivalent for home loans, which rank behind mortgages. None of these financial assets are either 
past due or impaired. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 101
15. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS CONTINUED
The estimated value takes into consideration movements in house prices, the anticipated timing of the repayment of the asset and associated credit risk. 
As the precise valuation and timing of the redemption of these assets remains uncertain, the Group applies assumptions based upon current market 
conditions and the Group’s experience of actual cash flows resulting from these transactions. These assumptions are reviewed at the end of each financial 
year as part of the impairment review conducted by the Directors. The difference between the estimated future value and the initial fair value is credited 
to finance income over the term of the loan. 
Future house price inflation is assumed to be zero (2015: zero). The discount rate applied is 8.5 per cent (2015: 8.5 per cent) which the Directors believe 
approximates the cost of a second charge mortgage on similar properties. 
If UK house price inflation had been one per cent higher or lower, with all other variables held constant and excluding any effect of current or deferred tax, 
the value of shared equity would increase or decrease by £139,000 (2015: £90,000) respectively, whilst if the discount rate used had been one per cent 
higher or lower, the value of these financial instruments would decrease or increase by £453,000 (2015: £492,000) and £506,000 (2015: £524,000), 
respectively. Changes in economic conditions will change the estimates made, therefore impacting the fair value of these loans.
The inputs used are by nature estimated and the resultant fair value has been classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy.

A deferred tax asset of £2,456,000 (2015: £5,638,000) has been recognised in respect of unutilised losses where realisation of the related tax benefit through 
future taxable profits is probable. A deferred tax asset of £862,000 (2015: £32,000 liability) in respect of other short ‑term timing differences and share‑based 
payments has also been recognised. Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associate and joint ventures are not significant. No deferred 
tax asset has been recognised in relation to losses where it is considered that they are not recoverable in the near future. The Group has unrecognised 
deferred tax assets of £1,260,000 on historical losses of £7,413,000 (2015: £1,483,000 on losses of £7,413,000).

The value of inventories expensed during the period and included in cost of sales was £523,674,000 (2015: £423,881,000). During the year inventories were 
written down through cost of sales by £1,235,000 (2015: £300,000). During the year impairment of inventories, which in previous years amounted to £600,000 
(2015: £652,000), has been reversed, due to improved market conditions. During the year provisions of £1,119,000 (2015: £5,546,000) were utilised as 
inventory was consumed.
Total provisions against the inventory at 30 September 2016 were £14,560,000 (2015: £15,044,000).
Interest incurred on deferred land purchases amounting to £919,000 (2015: £300,000) was capitalised during the year to inventories. countryside-properties.com

Total trade and other receivables 158,694 120,805
The Directors are of the opinion that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk (Note 29). The fair value of the financial assets is not considered 
to be materially different from their carrying value. The fair values are based on discounted cash flows and are within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Trade receivables at year end have been assessed for recoverability. A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence of impairment, 
which is usually indicated by a delay in the expected cash flows or non‑payment from customers. Trade receivables remaining outstanding past their due 
date are £480,000 (2015: £219,000); however, none were impaired.
A provision of £8,000,000 (2015: £8,000,000) has been made against amounts due from Countryside Neptune LLP, a joint venture, to reflect the Directors’

Bank loans
In May 2016, the Group signed a new £300,000,000 revolving credit facility with Lloyds Bank plc, Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc and Santander UK plc. 
The agreement has a variable interest rate based on LIBOR and expires in May 2021, although the Group has the opportunity to extend the term of the 
facility by a further two years. Subject to obtaining credit approval from the syndicate banks, the Group also has the option to extend the facility by a 
further £100,000,000. This facility is subject to both financial and non‑financial covenants and is secured by floating charges over all the Group’s assets.
At 30 September 2015, the Group had a committed bank loan facility of £215,000,000 made available by Lloyds Bank plc, Barclays Bank PLC and Santander UK plc. 
This facility was originally £200,000,000 but was extended during 2015. The facility was further extended during 2016 to £265,000,000 and £273,000 of debt 
arrangement fees were incurred. This facility was subject to both financial and non‑financial covenants and was secured by fixed charges over the Group’s 
property interests and fixed assets and a floating charge over all other assets.
The carrying value of the loans drawn under both the old and new facilities is equal to their fair value. As the impact of discounting is not significant, 
the fair values are based on discounted cash flows and are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
Bank loan arrangement fees are amortised over the term of the facility. As a result of the signing of the new facility agreement, the unamortised loan arrangement 
fee for the previous facility of £3,177,000 was expensed to the income statement as a non‑underlying finance cost (Note 6b). £2,776,000 of debt finance costs 
were capitalised in relation to the new facility. Of these £241,000 were expensed during the year. At 30 September 2016, unamortised loan arrangement 
fees were £2,535,000 (2015: £3,487,000) and £824,000 (2015: £1,113,000) of debt finance costs are included in finance costs (Note 7). As the Group did 
not have any debt at 30 September 2016, the unamortised loan arrangement fees are disclosed as a prepayment.
The Group has the following undrawn facilities:

Mandatory redeemable preference shares were issued as follows:
 – 16 April 2013 – £207,404,865 to OCM Luxembourg Coppice T opco S.à r.l. and £19,944,135 to management
 – 3 February 2014 – £54,546,493 to OCM Luxembourg Coppice T opco S.à r.l. and £3,230,558 to management 
 – 3 November 2014 – £2,203,321 to management
The characteristics of these instruments have determined that they are classed as financial liabilities rather than equity.
These shares were redeemable on a date to be determined by the issuer, upon liquidation of Midco or on the tenth anniversary of the date of issue, 
the mandatory redemption date. Interest on the shares issued on 16 April 2013 accrues annually at 14.5 per cent for the first 12 months from issue, 
then 12.0 per cent thereon which is payable on a date determined by the issuer or on the mandatory redemption date. Interest on the shares issued 
on 3 February 2014 accrues annually at 15 per cent for the first 12 months from issue, then 12.0 per cent thereon which is payable on a date determined 
by the issuer or on the mandatory redemption date.
Redemption of MRPS
As described in Note 1, as part of the reorganisation and prior to IPO, the balance of the mandatory redeemable preference shares of £287.3m and the 
associated accrued return of £111.2m as of 16 February 2016 were transferred from the current holders to the Company in exchange for 392,222,212 
ordinary shares in the Company.
The fair value of the financial liability is not considered to be materially different from its current value, as the impact of the discount is not significant. 
The fair values are based on discounted cash flows and are within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

28. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Fair value estimation
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows: 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly 
(that is, derived from prices).
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs). 
The following table presents the Group’s assets that are measured at fair value at 30 September:

2015
Assets 
Available‑for‑sale financial assets — — 10,535 10,535 
There were no transfers between levels during the period. 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over‑the‑counter derivatives) is determined by using valuation 
techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity‑specific 
estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. If one or more of the significant 
inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.
Level 1: None of the Group’s financial instruments are categorised as Level 1.
Level 2: None of the Group’s financial instruments are categorised as Level 2.
Level 3: The key assumptions used in Level 3 valuations include house price movements, the expected timing of receipts, credit risk and discount rates. 
Future house price inflation is assumed to be zero (2015: zero). The discount rate applied was 8.5 per cent (2015: 8.5 per cent) which Directors believe 
approximates the cost of a second charge mortgage on similar properties. Techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, have been used to determine 
fair value for the Level 3 financial instruments.
The fair values of the financial instruments that are measured at amortised cost is not shown, because the difference is not material.
29. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The main financial risks associated with the Group have been identified as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, housing market risk and credit risk. The Directors 
are responsible for managing these risks and the policies adopted are set out below.
Liquidity risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity (Company share capital, reserves and retained earnings) and debt (bank loan facilities and, in 
2015, mandatory redeemable preference shares). The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring its existing facilities for both financial covenant and 
funding headroom against forecast requirements based on short‑term and long‑term cash flow forecasts.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

29. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk reflects the Group’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in the market. This risk arises from bank loans that are drawn under the Group’s 
loan facilities with variable interest rates based upon UK LIBOR. For the year ended 30 September 2016 it is estimated that an increase by 0.5 per cent 
in interest rates would have decreased the Group’s profit before tax by £650,000 (2015: £575,000).

The financial assets of the Group amounting to £191,888,000 (2015: £203,670,000) with the exception of cash and cash equivalents amounting to 
£38,301,000 (2015: £80,835,000) are all non‑interest bearing.
The Group has no exposure to foreign currency risk.
Housing market risk
The Group is affected by price fluctuations in the UK housing market. These are in turn affected by the wider economic conditions such as mortgage 
availability and associated interest rates, employment and consumer confidence. Whilst these risks are beyond the Group’s ultimate control, risk is spread 
across business activities undertaken by the Group and the geographic regions in which it operates. We have considered the sensitivity in relation to 
available‑for‑sale financial assets, which is detailed in Note 15.
Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited solely to the United Kingdom for housebuilding activities and by the fact that the Group receives cash at the 
point of legal completion of its sales.
The Group’s remaining credit risk predominantly arises from trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans receivable from financial assets held for sale are those advanced to homebuyers to assist in their purchase of property under the shared equity 
schemes. The loans are secured by either a first or second charge over the property and are held at fair value.
Trade receivables on deferred terms arise from land sales. The amount deferred is secured by a charge over the land until such time payment is received.
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly the amounts receivable from the Homes and Communities Agency in relation to the Help‑to‑Buy scheme, 
housing associations, joint ventures and the associate. The Directors consider the credit rating of the various debtors is good in respect of the amounts 
outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low.
Cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments are held with UK clearing banks which are either A or A‑ rated. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

29. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
Capital management
The Group’s policies seek to protect returns to shareholders by ensuring the Group will continue to trade profitably in the foreseeable future. The Group 
also aims to optimise its capital structure of debt and equity so as to minimise its cost of capital. The Group manages its capital with regard to the risks 
inherent in the business and the sector within which it operates by monitoring its actual cash flows against bank loan facilities, financial covenants and the 
cash flow forecasts approved by the Directors.

30. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group recognised £3,034,000 (2015: £1,310,000) of employee costs related to share‑based payment transactions made during the financial year 
comprising the pre‑IPO Management Incentive Plan of £1,910,000 and the post‑IPO incentive plan of £1,124,000. Of these, £Nil (2015: £Nil) were cash settled. 
A deferred tax asset of £358,000 (2015: £Nil) was recognised in relation to the plan, of which £205,000 was credited to the income statement and £154,000 
was credited directly to equity. National Insurance contributions are payable in respect of certain share‑based payment transactions and are treated as 
cash‑settled transactions. At 30 September 2016, the carrying amount of National Insurance contributions payable was £218,000 (2015: £Nil). 
The Group operates a number of share‑based payment schemes as set out below: 
(a) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 
The Group operates a Savings‑Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all employees with more than three months’ continuous service. This is an 
approved HMRC scheme and the first savings contracts were issued during the year.
Under the scheme, participants remaining in the Group’s employment at the end of the three‑year savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase 
shares in the Company at a stated exercise price. Employees leaving for certain reasons are able to use their savings to purchase shares within six months 
of their leaving. At 30 September 2016, employees held 650 three‑year savings contracts (2015: nil) in respect of options over 3.0 million shares (2015: nil). 
691 employees subscribed to the original offer, representing a participation rate of 70 per cent of eligible employees (2015: nil). A reconciliation of option 
movements is shown below.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 30 September 2016
30. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED
(a) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme continued
Options granted during the year were valued using the Black Scholes option‑pricing model. No performance conditions were included in the fair value 
calculations. The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
2016
Share price at date of grant (p) 240
Exercise price (p) 192
Volatility (%) 29
Option life (years) 3
Expected dividend yield (%) 3
Risk‑free rate (%) 1
Fair value per option (p) 57
As the Company had no share price history prior to the grant of the options, the expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the share prices 
of other listed housebuilders for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award. 
The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three years, on the assumption that 45 per cent of options will be cancelled over the service 
period as employees leave the Sharesave scheme based on the Group’s experience of employee attrition rates.
(b) Long Term Incentive Plan 2016
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan 2016, shares are conditionally awarded to the senior managers in the Company. The core awards are calculated 
as a percentage of the participants’ salaries and scaled according to grades. The award granted in 2016 is assessed against ROCE, TNAV and relative total 
shareholder return. Straight line vesting will apply if performance falls between two points. Awards are structured as nil‑cost options. Performance will 
be measured at the end of the three‑year performance period. If the required level of performance has been reached, the awards vest and the award will 
be released. Options granted to acquire the award of shares will expire two years from the vesting date. Dividends will not accrue on the shares that vest. 
A reconciliation of the number of shares conditionally allocated is shown below:

of the future vesting of the options based on current performance expectations; and
 – for the relative TSR element of the award, a Monte Carlo simulation. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(c) Legacy Management Incentive Plan
Prior to IPO, Ian Sutcliffe and Rebecca Worthington participated in a Management Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) under which participants were awarded shares 
in OCM Luxembourg Coppice Midco S.à r.l. (“Midco”). These interests were purchased at fair value, determined by a third party.
Immediately prior to IPO, any shares in Midco held by the participants were exchanged for new shares in Countryside Properties PLC. On 17 February 2016, 
the awards vested when the Company was admitted to the London Stock Exchange. No further performance or employment conditions are attached to 
these shares, save for a requirement not to sell for a period of one year following the IPO. The number of shares which vested under the awards are 
detailed in the table below. The residual shareholding for Ian Sutcliffe and Rebecca Worthington at 30 September 2016 is disclosed as part of the total 
shareholding in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Number
 of shares
Ian Sutcliffe 7,795,068
Rebecca Worthington 724,253

On IPO, as set out in the Prospectus published by the Company, Ian Sutcliffe sold 2,338,520 shares and Rebecca Worthington sold 217,276 shares at the 
offer price of 225 pence.
31. ACQUISITION 
On 15 April 2016, the Group purchased 50 per cent of the issued share capital of Countryside Properties (Springhead) Limited (“Springhead”), a joint 
venture company that it did not already own. This transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, under which the Group 
is deemed to have disposed of its 50 per cent holding in the company and immediately to have acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital. 
Springhead is developing land at Springhead Park at Northfleet in Kent. The book value of net assets acquired was also considered to be the fair value of the 
net assets acquired, and also equal to the cash consideration paid. As a result no goodwill arose as a result of the transaction.
An analysis of the net assets acquired is set out below:
Fair value

32. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Operating lease commitments
The Group has various leases under non‑cancellable operating lease agreements. The lease terms are between one and 20 years, and the majority of lease 
agreements are renewable at the end of the lease period at market rate.
The Group also leases various vehicles, under cancellable lease agreements. The Group is required to give a six‑month notice for termination of these 
agreements. The lease expenditure charged to the income statement during the year is disclosed in Note 6.
At 30 September the future aggregate minimum lease payments under non‑cancellable operating leases were as follows:

  14,082 13,871
Capital commitments
The Group was not committed to the purchase of any property, plant and equipment or software intangible assets at 30 September 2016 (2015: £Nil).
Parent company guarantees
The Group has made parent company guarantees to its joint ventures and associate in the ordinary course of business.
The Group has entered into counter indemnities to banks, insurance companies, statutory undertakings and the National House Building Council in the 
ordinary course of business, including those in respect of joint venture partners from which it is anticipated that no material liabilities will arise.
Litigation and claims 
The Group is subject to various claims, audits and investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. These matters include but are not 
limited to employment and commercial matters. The outcome of all of these matters is subject to future resolution, including the uncertainties of litigation. 
Based on information currently known to the Group and after consultation with external lawyers, the Directors believe that the ultimate resolution of these 
matters, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on the Group’s financial condition.
33. DIVIDEND
The Board of Directors recommend a final dividend of 3.4 pence per share (2015: Nil pence), amounting to a total dividend of £15.3m (2015: £Nil), which 
will be paid on 3 February 2017 to shareholders on the register on 13 January 2017, subject to shareholder approval. The expense has not been recognised 
in these financial statements as the shareholders’ right to receive the dividend had not been established at 30 September 2016.  COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 117

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibility statement set out on page 73, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any 
other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: 
 – whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
 – the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
 – the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating 
the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to 
draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non‑financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
OTHER MATTER
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Countryside Properties PLC for the period ended 30 September 2016.

PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Company information
Countryside Properties PLC was incorporated on 18 November 2015 to serve as a holding company for the purposes of listing on the London Stock Exchange. 
Countryside Properties PLC was admitted to the premium segment of the London Stock Exchange on 17 February 2016.
These are the Company’s first financial statements and the first as ultimate holding Company for the Group following the share‑for‑share exchange when 
the Company was inserted as the new holding Company of the Group. Further details of the Group reorganisation can be found in Note 1 of the Group 
financial statements on page 83. Countryside Properties PLC is a limited company domiciled and incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office 
is Countryside House, The Drive, Brentwood, Essex CM13 3AT.
1.1 Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ 
and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. As the Company has not previously prepared financial statements, no comparatives have been presented, 
no transition exemptions or exceptions have been applied and no reconciliations are presented.
FRS 102 allows a qualifying entity certain disclosure exemptions, subject to certain conditions which have been complied with, including notification of, 
and no objection to, the use of exemptions by the Company’s shareholders.
The Company has taken advantage of the following exemptions:
i. from preparing a statement of cash flows, on the basis that it is a qualifying entity and the consolidated statement of cash flows, included in these financial 
statements, includes the Company’s cash flows;
ii. from the financial instrument disclosures, required under FRS 102 paragraphs 11.39 to 11.48A and paragraphs 12.26 to 12.29, as the information is 
provided in the consolidated financial statement disclosures;
iii. from disclosing share‑based payment arrangements, required under FRS 102 paragraphs 26.18(c), 26.19 to 26.21 and 26.23, concerning its own equity 
instruments. The Company financial statements are presented with the consolidated financial statements and the relevant disclosures are included therein; and
iv. from disclosing the Company key management personnel compensation, as required by FRS 102 paragraph 33.7.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the parent company’s profit and loss account has not been presented in these financial statements. 
The loss for the period since incorporation was £11,231,000.
The financial statements are prepared in Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Company has not disclosed the information required by regulation 5(1)(b) of the Companies (Disclosure of Auditor Remuneration and Liability 
Limitation Agreements) Regulations 2008 as the Group accounts of the Company are required to comply with regulation 5(1)(b) as if the undertakings 
included in the consolidation were a single group.
1.2 Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 39. 
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officer’s Review on pages 
26 to 29 of the Strategic Report. Further disclosures regarding borrowings are provided in Note 23 of the Group financial statements including the impact 
of certain sensitivities.
As described in the Viability Statement, the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the Group over a three‑year period to September 2019. 
The Board has performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including those risks that would threaten Countryside’s business 
model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
Having considered these forecasts, the Directors are satisfied the Group has sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom to enable the Group to conduct 
its business and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next 12 months. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is inextricably linked 
to the results of the Group as a whole. As such, the Directors consider the Company to be a going concern and these financial statements are prepared on 
this basis.
1.3 Fixed asset investments
The value of the investment in each subsidiary held by the Company is recorded at cost less any impairment in the Company’s Statement of Financial Position.
A subsidiary is an entity that the Company has the power to control.
1.4 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and other short‑term deposits held by the Company with maturities of three months or less. 
Bank overdrafts are classified within current liabilities.

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 30 September 2016
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
1.5 Financial instruments
Fair value measurement of financial instruments
The Company has adopted IAS 39 ‘Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments’.
Financial assets
Financial assets which primarily represent loans to subsidiary companies and cash are initially recognised at fair value.
Borrowings
Interest‑bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at their fair value, net of direct transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently carried at 
their amortised cost and loan arrangement fees are amortised over the term of the instrument. Finance costs associated with each individual drawdown are 
expensed over the period of that drawdown.
Borrowings are classified as non‑current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability until the end of the term 
of the agreement. Further details of the Company’s bank loans can be found in Note 23 of the Group financial statements.
1.6 Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Dividends payable on equity instruments are 
recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
1.7 Taxation
Current taxation
Income tax for the years presented comprises current and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the period which differs from accounting profit as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and those items never taxable or deductible. 
The Group’s liability for current tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
1.8 Dividend
Dividend distributions to Countryside Properties PLC shareholders are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the periods in which the final 
dividends are approved in the annual general meeting, or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.
1.9 Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, from the proceeds.
1.10 Related parties
The Group discloses transactions with related parties which are not wholly owned within the same Group. Where appropriate, transactions of a similar 
nature are aggregated unless, in the opinion of the Directors, separate disclosure is necessary to understand the effect of the transactions on the Group 
financial statements.
2. JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The preparation of the financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and related disclosures.
Critical accounting judgements
In the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors have made no individual judgements that have had 
significant impact upon the financial information, apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and other relevant factors and are reviewed on an ongoing basis. This 
approach forms the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in 
accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information. Such 
changes are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value 
of assets and liabilities are described below.
IPO costs
As permitted by section 610(2b) of the Companies Act 2006, £4.6m of transaction costs in relation to the Group’s IPO were offset against the share 
premium of £293.6m created on the issue of new ordinary shares. Management has exercised judgement in assessing the allocation of costs incurred 
between share premium and the current period income statement.
Impairment of fixed asset investments
Determining whether fixed asset investments are impaired requires judgement and estimation. The Directors periodically review fixed asset investments 
for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management’s judgement, that the carrying amount of an asset may not be 
recoverable. Such indicating events would include a significant planned restructuring, a major change in market conditions or technology and expectations 
of future operating losses or negative cash flows. The Company did not record any impairment charges during the period ended 30 September 2016.  COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 123

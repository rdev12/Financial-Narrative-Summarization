Who We Are
Our Strategy
EnCore Oil plc is a UK-based oil and gas exploration 
and production (E&P) company quoted on AIM in 
London under the ticker ‘EO.’. We hold a balanced 
portfolio of licences, primarily focused on offshore 
UKCS and own just under 30 per cent. equity in AIM 
listed Egdon Resources plc (LSE: EDR), a focused 
onshore E&P company.
Our principal strategy is to create shareholder 
value through the successful exploration, 
appraisal and development of prospects and 
discoveries. Since our inception in 2005, we 
have drilled 26 wells and side-tracks. These 
have resulted in a number of discoveries 
including Breagh in the UK Southern North 
Sea, Catcher, Varadero and Burgman in the 
UK Central North Sea, and Cladhan in the UK 
Northern North Sea. 
We believe in monetising or exchanging of 
assets at the right stage in their lifecycle to 
best maximise value: this can either be before 
development sanction, especially where the 
development costs are significant, such as the 
Breagh gas discovery which we sold in 2009, or 
it may be once the field has been developed, for 
example the Ceres gas field which was part of 
the package of assets which were divested to 
Egdon Resources in 2010.

Chairman’s Review
Few companies will look back on 2011 as a successful 
and satisfying year. Prior to the announcement made 
on 5 October 2011 of the recommended acquisition by 
Premier to acquire EnCore, I had written my Chairman’s 
statement and, in that draft, had reported that within 
EnCore we could look at 2011 with some pleasure 
because of our continuing exploration success but, like 
every other company in the UK upstream oil sector, we 
have been affected by the worldwide funding crisis which 
has in turn affected oil prices, prompted fiscal changes 
and dampened investor confidence. Of course I had also 
outlined our plans for further work on the Catcher area, 
Cladhan and the planned well on Tudor Rose.
All this has been overtaken by recent events and it is likely 
that we will now remember 2011 as the year EnCore 
satisfied its aim of delivering value to its shareholders. As 
a Board we have considered the Acquisition very carefully. 
There are differing views in the industry about how to 
risk assess UK exploration assets not just for oil price, 
geological and development risk, but fiscal uncertainty 
and funding risk. Bearing all factors in mind, the Board 
unanimously determined that the terms of the Acquisition 
are fair and reasonable to EnCore shareholders.
I thank the EnCore team, many of whom have been 
with the company since its inception in 2005 and the 
contractors with whom we have worked inter alia 
during our drilling programmes, for demonstrating their 
high levels of expertise and hard work. The EnCore 
Executive management and staff have an enviable 
reputation which is well deserved. I thank my fellow 
Non-Executive Directors Keith Hughes, who left the 
Board during the year, and Vivien Gibney who joined 
us, for their valuable contributions.
I also thank our shareholders for their continued 
support over the last six years. Since EnCore started 
in 2005, we have sought to maintain a balanced risk 
profile and to conserve our equity for the appraisal of 
areas where we made discoveries like Catcher and 
Cladhan. I hope our shareholders share our pride 
in being involved with a company responsible for a 
number of the more important discoveries in the UK 
North Sea in recent years.
Our prime aim has been to create and deliver value to 
EnCore shareholders, and I am pleased that having 
created that value we can now deliver it.

Chief Executive’s Review
Before I comment on the recent announcement 
regarding the acquisition of the Company, I would  
like to review the year.
I believe that 2011 has amply demonstrated that 
exploration and production is a business where risk  
and uncertainty are ever present, both above and below 
ground. Whilst we would like to think we understand 
the nature and range of potential outcomes of the 
subsurface and the operational risks that we take, the 
“above ground” risks are often less predictable and can 
have, and have had material impacts on both the value 
and risk profile of the business. 
A successful drilling campaign in the Catcher area  
delivered greater certainty on the extent and potential  
within the licence, with two new discoveries at Varadero  
and Burgman and a number of now highly attractive undrilled 
prospects high graded for future drilling, demonstrating 
the discovery of a material new hydrocarbon fairway in this 
part of the UKCS. These discoveries are now progressing 
towards development and we would expect to see the first 
Field Development Plan (FDP) approvals by the Department 
of Energy & Climate Change (DECC) in 2012, followed by 
first oil a few years later.
Our recent drilling campaign at Cladhan was less 
successful than we had initially hoped. Although we  
were pleased to see a significantly increased hydrocarbon 
column from the results of the first well, it also 
demonstrated that there was likely to be higher variability 
in reservoir quality, in part, we believe, relating to depth, 
and in part relating to the depositional nature of the 
sandstones. The second well of the campaign in the 
deepest parts of the structure, some 2,500 feet from the 
mapped crest, and some 1,000 feet or more below the 
lowest established oil, encountered a reservoir sequence 
without any effective porosity and permeability. The third 
and fourth wells established an area to the south of 
Cladhan with a different pressure regime, where we believe 
we may have intersected a potential oil water contact in a 
separate accumulation. We also expect that Cladhan will 
now progress towards FDP approval, possibly in 2012, 
likely as a sub-sea tie back to established infrastructure.
Recognising the fact that our development assets, and 
in particular the Catcher area, were ultimately likely to be 
of greater strategic value to a larger, more established 
UK producer, we set about positioning the Company to 
try and maximise the value of our remaining exploration 
portfolio by attempting to demerge these into a newly 
formed and listed subsidiary, XEO Exploration plc. A 
change in market sentiment with respect to exploration 
and production risk, and in particular with respect to the 
UK offshore sector following unexpected, rather blunt and 
frankly ill-considered tax changes, meant that this avenue 
was no longer available to us. We were disappointed with 
this outcome, as we believe the portfolio had, and indeed 
still has, significant merit, although not without risk. 
As we entered the second half of 2011, the Board 
recognised that we needed to evaluate our near-term 
strategy and balance our risk exposure to mitigate the 
effects of a new and uncertain external investment 
environment, and safeguard, to the maximum extent 
possible, the value we had already created for our 
shareholders in a turbulent and unforgiving market. 
Following a number of informal and broad ranging 
discussions with third parties, the Board concluded that 
the best route would likely be the outright sale of EnCore 
to a larger, well capitalised company, ideally with the option 
to allow our shareholders to continue to participate in the 
upside contained within the asset base should they so 
wish. Following receipt of an approach from Premier, our 
co-venturer in Catcher, the Board agreed that on balance, 
and considering the future risks and uncertainties, this route 
was likely the best option for retaining much of the value 
we had created. The market will of course determine if this 
is indeed the case. On a personal level, I would particularly 
like to thank my fellow Directors and staff for their invaluable 
contribution towards the successes we have achieved 
over the past six years. I would also like to thank our 
shareholders, many of whom participated in our original 
$6 million friends and family fundraising in 2005, for their 
patience and understanding over the years.

Operational Review
UKCS Block 28/9 – Catcher, Varadero, Burgman
We began the period under review part-way through the 
drilling of the side-track appraisal well at Catcher South 
West, well 28/9-1y, which we covered in our 2010 Annual 
Report. This well found oil with a net vertical sand thickness 
of 121 feet and a hydrocarbon column of 173 feet.
During July and August 2010 following the completion of 
the Catcher South West well, site surveys were carried 
out over Block 28/9 to identify safe drilling locations for 
the second phase of drilling. A rig contract was signed in 
late September 2010 for the Transocean Galaxy II heavy 
duty jack-up rig to carry out this drilling. After an extended 
period of waiting on weather to exit Dundee Harbour, the 
second phase of drilling commenced in mid-December 
2010 with the spud of the Varadero exploration well 
28/9-2. Well 28/9-2 discovered oil and gas within the 
Tertiary age Tay Formation and had a net pay of 106 feet 
with an average porosity of 33 per cent., over a gross 
hydrocarbon bearing interval of 400 feet. Wireline samples 
indicated an oil gravity of 26 degrees API. The well was 
plugged and abandoned as an oil and gas discovery. 
January 2011 saw the commencement of drilling of the 
Catcher North appraisal well. Well 28/9-3 appraised 
the Tay and Cromarty reservoirs to the North of the 
original Catcher discovery, and discovered 34 feet of net 
hydrocarbon pay with average porosity of 31 per cent.; 
14 feet of 29.8 degree API oil within the Cromarty level 
and 20 feet of gas within the Tay section. The gross 
hydrocarbon column for the Catcher area was extended 
to 410 feet, comprising a gas column of 75 feet and an oil 
column of 335 feet. The well was plugged and abandoned 
as an oil and gas well.
Well 28/9-4, to evaluate the Burgman prospect, 
commenced at the beginning of March 2011. The 
well location was selected to intersect four potential 
reservoir horizons (the Upper Tay, Lower Tay, Cromarty 
and Fulmar reservoirs) which had been identified from 
the seismic data. The well encountered 12 feet of gas in 
the Upper Tay sandstones and 10 feet of 24 degree API 
oil in the Lower Tay sandstones. The gross gas column 
encountered was a minimum of 78 feet and the gross oil 
column was estimated to be 420 feet. The Cromarty  
and Fulmar sections were not hydrocarbon bearing.
Although oil bearing in well 28/9-4, the Lower Tay was not 
particularly well developed at the well location, appearing 
more thickly developed over a large proportion of the 
remainder of the Burgman prospect. Therefore, the group 
decided to side-track to an area prognosed to contain 
better developed Lower Tay sands to the south east of 
well 28/9-4. The side-track well 28/9-4z encountered 64 
feet True vertical thickness (TVT) of net oil pay with average 
porosity of 38 per cent. over a gross interval of 64 feet 
TVT. This result confirmed the geophysical model for the 
identification of Tay sands over the Burgman structure. The 
well was plugged and abandoned as an oil and gas well.
Following completion of the Burgman side-track at the 
end of March 2011, work has continued on development 
planning studies for the development of the discoveries on 
Block 28/9 and a dedicated development team is now in 
place. On the exploration side, a high density 3D seismic 
survey has just been acquired over the Block. The data, 
expected to be delivered during Q4 2011, will be fully 
analysed alongside the existing data. Additionally, a site 
Work has continued on development

survey has been commissioned to survey the Carnaby 
prospect on Block 28/9 during the second half of 2011, 
with a view to drilling in H1 2012. 
UKCS Blocks 210/29a & 210/30a – Cladhan
During the year under review, one well and five side-
track wells were drilled on the Cladhan discovery. The 
first well was a side-track from the original Cladhan 
discovery made in November 2008. Well 210/29a-
4z commenced in August 2010 with the objective of 
targeting a southerly extension up-dip of the original 
Cladhan discovery. This well discovered a gross 
hydrocarbon column of 159 feet TVT with 102 feet 
TVT of net hydrocarbon pay. When tested, the 34 
degree API light oil flowed at a restricted 5,900 bopd 
for over 13 hours through a 28/64 inch choke, with 
a final wellhead pressure of 1,874 psi. The Operator, 
Sterling Resources, indicated that with larger 4.5 inch 
completion tubing, they estimated that the well is 
capable of producing over 15,000 bopd.
A second side-track, well 210/29a-4y, was then drilled 
to test an area down dip and to the South East of the 
original discovery well. The well encountered a 169 feet 
TVT gross hydrocarbon column, with a net pay of 71 feet 
TVT. This took the total oil column from the three wells 
drilled to date to in excess of 425 feet, with no Oil Water 
Contact established at that time. 
In October 2010, the Operator, Sterling Resources, 
published a Competent Persons Report (CPR) which gave 
a range of oil in place estimates. However, it remained 
our opinion at that time that until further drilling was done, 
an Oil Water Contact was established and connectivity 
to other areas in the broader Cladhan structure was 
confirmed, the potential size of the Cladhan discovery 
remained uncertain, though likely commercial. 
The second phase of drilling commenced in March 2011 
using the Transocean Prospect semi-submersible rig. 
Appraisal well 210/30a-4 was drilled to the south east 
of the original Cladhan discovery to a Total Measured 
Depth of 12,252 feet. This well encountered oil bearing 
Upper Jurassic sandstones in two separate reservoir 
intervals. In the lower reservoir, the well encountered 
a gross interval of 256 feet TVT with a net sand of 21 
feet TVT. Pressure data indicated that this sand was in 
pressure communication with, and therefore part of, the 
original Cladhan discovery. Average porosity of this sand 
was 16 per cent. and hydrocarbon saturation was 75 per 
cent. The well proved an Oil Down To of 10,447 feet True 
Vertical Depth SubSea (TVDSS), giving a hydrocarbon 
column of over 1,200 feet. The well also encountered 13 
feet TVT of net sand over an 18 feet TVT gross interval 
in the upper reservoir sequence, with average porosity 
of 16 per cent. and hydrocarbon saturation of 82 per 
cent. The pressure data for this upper reservoir sequence 
suggested it was not in communication with the original 
Cladhan discovery. No Oil Water Contact was established 
in either reservoir sequence.
In April 2011, the well was side-tracked to the East, 
1,000 feet deeper and out to the eastern fan area of 
the prognosed Cladhan structure. Well 210/30a-4z 
encountered two separate Upper Jurassic reservoir 
All indications point to a possible new 
accumulation, separate from Cladhan, up  
dip of 210/30a-4x and 210/30a-4y but further 
drilling would be required to prove this
UKCS Block 210/29a and 210/30a 08
EnCore Oil plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2011
intervals with gross sands of 12 feet TVT and 169 feet 
TVT respectively. Hydrocarbon shows were encountered 
in both reservoirs but with average porosity of less 
than 10 per cent., it was not possible to confirm if 
the sands were hydrocarbon bearing and in pressure 
communication with the original Cladhan discovery. 
A second planned side-track well, 210/30a-4y, 
commenced in May 2011. This well targeted the Central 
Channel area to the south of the original Cladhan discovery 
and encountered gross sands of 191 feet TVT with net 
sands of 40 feet TVT. Log and pressure data indicated 
that the sands were water wet, and that the Central 
Channel was in a separate pressure regime from the main 
Cladhan discovery. The sands in this location were still 
over pressured which suggests there may be remaining 
prospectivity up dip from the 210/30a-4y well location. 
The final well of the programme, well 210/30a-4x was 
drilled as a side-track to evaluate another channel to 
the south of the Cladhan discovery. The well discovered 
171 feet TVT of gross sands, with 105 feet TVT of net 
sand. Log data indicated that the uppermost five feet 
of reservoir was hydrocarbon bearing, resulting in an 
Oil Down To at 10,177 feet TVDSS and a calculated Oil 
Water Contact of 10,200 feet TVDSS. Pressure data 
indicated that the sands were over pressured in this 
location, similar to the pressure trend encountered in well 
210/30a-4y which evaluated the Central Channel, and 
therefore in a separate pressure regime to the original 
Cladhan discovery. All indications point to a possible 
new accumulation, separate from Cladhan, up dip of 
210/30a-4x and 210/30a-4y but further drilling would  
be required to prove this. 
Infield surveys and a pipeline survey have taken place since 
the period end through July and August 2011, and subsea 
pre-FEED work was recently commissioned. Planning 
continues on the best development scenarios for the 
Cladhan field. 
Other Portfolio Activity
During the period under review, EnCore was awarded two 
traditional licences containing six Blocks and part-Blocks 
in the UK Seaward 26th Licensing Round. The first of 
these Licences, P .1812 contains Blocks 28/5, 28/10a 
and 29/1d (split) and lies to the east and north east of the 
Catcher oil discovery in EnCore’s existing Blocks 28/9 and 
28/10c. EnCore owns 100 per cent. of this licence and 
since reprocessing 3D seismic data over the area, initial 
observations have highlighted a potentially interesting new 
Tay prospect, Coaster, which has similarities to the Tay 
structures found in the Catcher Blocks 28/9 and 28/10c 
to the West. Further technical work is being undertaken to 
establish prospective locations for potential drilling in 2012.
The second licence award, P .1769 containing Blocks 
14/29e, 20/4c and 20/5f lies to the south west of the 
Tudor Rose heavy oil discovery and the Buffalo prospect 
in EnCore’s existing Block 14/30a. EnCore was awarded 
50 per cent. of the Licence, with the remaining equity 
and operatorship awarded to Endeavour Energy UK Ltd. 
The blocks contain the Hoylake gas discovery that was 
drilled by Shell in 1998. The partnership is reprocessing 
3D seismic data over this Licence to further evaluate the 
Hoylake discovery in the near term. 
The 26th Licensing Round also saw the award of three 
Licences; P .1870, P .1866 and P .1876 containing Blocks 
15/21d, 13/28b and 22/5 respectively to Echo Exploration, 
owned by North Sea Energy Inc., in which EnCore had the 
option to acquire 50 per cent. of the equity, for a nominal 
consideration. This option was exercised at the end of 
June 2011, subject to the usual regulatory approvals. 
Block 15/21d contains the Beehive oil discovery, which 
was drilled by Amerada Hess in 1993 and flowed 5,700 
bbls/day of 28 degree API oil when tested. The forward 
work programme on these Blocks is expected to include 
reprocessing of seismic data over the area. 
Towards the end of the period under review, talks took 
place regarding the acquisition (subject to the usual 
regulatory approvals) of part of UK Central North Sea 
Licence P .218, which neighbours EnCore’s Licence 
P .1655. The area of Licence P .218 to be acquired includes 
the 15/21a-38z Spaniards / Gamma discovery well, drilled 
in 1989 by Amerada Hess, and which flowed 2,600 bbls/
day of 26 degree API oil on test. EnCore and its P .1655

partners have agreed to acquire a total of 70 per cent. 
of licence P .218 in return for 30 per cent. of the P .1655 
licence and funding the cost of the first well to evaluate 
the Spaniards / Gamma discovery. Upon receiving 
regulatory approval, EnCore’s equity in the two licences, 
P .1655 and P .218 will be 28 per cent. 
Other licence activity which took place during the period 
under review included extensions granted by DECC to 
licence P .1463, containing the Tudor Rose discovery 
and Buffalo prospect, and licence P .1475 containing the 
Merrow prospect. A Letter of Award, and since the period 
end, a full rig contract, was signed with ADTI for use of the 
Sedco 704 rig to drill an appraisal well on the Tudor Rose 
discovery to establish the gravity and viscosity of the oil in 
place. The drilling of the well is expected to commence in 
October 2011 and the results will help determine if Tudor 
Rose can be commercially exploited. Under the licence 
terms agreed with DECC on award, our interest in licences 
P .1689 and P .1674 lapsed and were relinquished and in 
addition, we elected to relinquish licence P .1687. 
In Ireland, we are still awaiting a decision from the Irish 
Petroleum Affairs Division over the lease undertakings 
application in order to allow EnCore and its partners, 
San Leon Energy (Operator) and Valhalla Oil and Gas to 
continue work on the licences. As a consequence of this 
delay, little work was done on the Irish licences during 
the period. 
Finally, our Gas Storage project on UK Southern North 
Sea Block 43/13a remains for sale but has received no 
acceptable offers to date. 
Corporate activity 
At the time of our Interim Results in March 2011, we 
announced that the Board were considering options for 
how best to maximise the potential of our exploration 
portfolio without any undue dilution of the value created 
for shareholders in our two main assets, Catcher and 
Cladhan. The Board concluded that floating a newly 
formed company containing the exploration assets, in 
which EnCore would retain a significant shareholding, 
would be the best way to fund an extended, high impact 
exploration drilling programme with the associated risks. 
On top of EnCore retaining a significant shareholding, an 
offer was to be made to existing EnCore shareholders to 
subscribe for shares in the new exploration company at 
the institutional placing price. 
However, in part due to the unexpected announcement 
of the North Sea taxation reforms in the 2011 Budget, the 
market appetite for high impact exploration with its inherent 
risks all but evaporated overnight. While encouraged by the 
indicated support we had received at the time, the decision 
was taken to cancel the flotation of the new company 
rather than have a continual need for further fundraising to 
complete the proposed drilling programme. 
In April 2011, the resignation of L. Keith Hughes, a 
Non-Executive Director was announced. Keith had 
joined a new law firm which prohibited partners holding 
non-executive directorships with for-profit companies. 
On Keith’s resignation, Vivien Gibney, a barrister and 
executive, now retired, with over 25 years’ oil industry 
experience, joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director.
Since the period end, it was announced on 5 October 
2011 that EnCore had reached agreement on the terms 
of a recommended acquisition by Premier of the entire 
issued and to be issued share capital of EnCore at 70p 
per ordinary share in cash, with a full share alternative. 
The Board of EnCore considers the terms of the 
Acquisition to be fair and reasonable and as such, intend 
to recommend unanimously that EnCore shareholders 
vote in favour of the Scheme. Further information can be 
found in the announcement dated 5 October 2011 on  
the EnCore website www.encoreoil.co.uk.

Financial Review
Gain for the Financial Year
The net loss for the year to 30 June 2011 is £2.5 million 
(30 June 2010: profit of £11.4 million). The movement to a 
loss in 2011 reflects the one off gains associated with the 
sale of the Breagh gas asset in the previous financial year. 
The normalised result for 30 June 2010, excluding the 
Breagh gains, was a loss of £11.5 million.
The operating loss is £3.7 million (2010: loss £15.1 million) 
comprising administrative expenses of £3.3 million (2010: 
£2.7 million) and exploration costs of £0.4 million (2010: 
£12.4 million).
The gain from our share in our associate company  
Egdon Resources plc is £1.2 million. 
Net financial income in 2011 was £0.4 million  
(2010: £0.3 million). Foreign currency losses were  
£0.6 million in the year (2010: gain of £1.5 million).
Gross administrative expenses, before capitalisation and 
recharges to joint venture partners, were £4.5 million 
(2010: £3.5 million). The increase reflects the costs of 
the aborted Xeo Exploration plc flotation which are not 
capitalised or recharged to partners.
The gross administrative costs can be further analysed 
as follows:
2011
£ million
2010
£ million
Staff costs 2.6 3.0
Legal and professional 1.4 0.2
Office costs 0.3 0.1
Other 0.2 0.2
4.5 3.5
Capitalisation and recharge to joint venture partners of 
administration costs during the current year amounted 
to £1.2 million (2010: £0.8 million) reflecting the increase 
in work on operated projects, principally Catcher. 
Consequently, net administration costs in the profit and 
loss account were £3.3 million (2010: £2.7 million).
Staff costs include £0.1 million (2010: £0.3 million) of IFRS 
2 charges related to share options granted to Directors, 
staff and third parties.
Exploration costs of £0.4 million principally relate to the 
write down of certain UK Offshore assets. Exploration costs 
in the year ended 30 June 2010 of £12.4 million reflected 
the write down of UK Onshore assets which were ultimately 
sold to Egdon Resources Plc and our Irish assets.
Tax
The tax credit of £0.3 million in the year ended 30 June 2011 
largely reflects the restatement of deferred tax balances 
arising on fair value adjustments to intangible oil and gas 
assets to current tax rates. This deferred tax movement is a 
non-cash item.
The tax credit arising in the year to 30 June 2010 reflected 
the reversal of deferred tax balances created on the fair 
value adjustments to intangible oil and gas assets resulting 
from acquisitions in the year to 30 June 2008 and the 
period to 30 June 2007. These deferred tax balances 
reverse via the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income when the asset is subsequently sold, as was the 
case with Breagh, or the asset is impaired, as was the case 
with the impairment of certain UK Onshore licences. This 
deferred tax movement is a non-cash item.
Associate Company
During the year the Company acquired an interest of 
just under 30% in Egdon Resources plc through the 
sale of its onshore assets and Ceres gas field. Egdon is 
an associate company of EnCore and as such we are 
required to account for our share of its trading results.
Egdon announced their result for the six months ended 
31 January 2011 on the 19 April 2011. The result was a 
profit for the period of £4.4 million. As of the date of these 
accounts Egdon have not released their results for the 
year ended 31 July 2011 nor given any indication of when 
the results announcement will be made.  11
EnCore Oil plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Business Profile The Year in Review Governance Financial Statements Company Information
Despite Egdon being an associate company of EnCore 
Oil plc they are under no obligation to provide us with 
trading and financial data. To date no such data has 
been received by us. In the interests of the timely 
announcement of our year end results, the Directors of 
EnCore Oil plc decided to estimate Egdon’s results for the 
year ended 31 July 2011 based on publicly available data 
and our knowledge of their assets.
We have estimated that the full year profit for the year 
ended 31 July 2011 for Egdon will be approximately 
£4 million. An amount of £1.2 million, based on our 
30% shareholding in Egdon, has been included in our 
consolidated income statement in the current year.
The actual result for Egdon for this period may be different 
to our estimate and consequently an adjustment may be 
required in our future accounts.
Our auditors, PKF (UK) LLP, have not had access to  
the management of Egdon nor to their financial 
documents nor Egdons auditors’ working papers. 
Consequently, PKF (UK) LLP have been unable to 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support 
our estimates of the carrying value of the investment 
in Egdon at 30 June 2011 and the Group’s share of 
the result for the year. They were therefore unable to 
determine whether any adjustments to these amounts 
were necessary. As a consequence PKF (UK) LLP have 
qualified their report to the members of EnCore Oil plc 
to draw attention to the limitation that has been placed 
on the scope of their audit work.
Statement of financial position
At 30 June 2011 the Group had net assets of 
£56.8 million (30 June 2010: £58.4 million). The most 
significant balances are intangible exploration and 
evaluation assets of £34.2 million (2010: £15.0 million)  
and cash of £18.3 million (2010: £41.9 million).
The exploration and evaluation assets can be further 
analysed as follows:
2011
£ million
2010
£ million
UK offshore licences 31.7 12.5
Other 2.5 2.5
34.2 15.0
During the year to 30 June 2011, the Company incurred 
expenditure of £19.6 million (2010: £2.7 million) on its oil 
and gas properties principally in respect of the extensive 
drilling campaigns on Cladhan (£12.5 million) and Catcher 
(£6.5 million). Costs in 2010 reflected exploration drilling 
on Catcher together with Ceres development costs. Ceres 
was sold to Egdon Resources plc during the course of the 
financial year.
Other exploration and evaluation assets include interests 
in Ireland. 
Financing
The Group ended the year with £15.3 million of cash and 
cash equivalents (2010: £31.2 million) and a further £3.0 
million of restricted cash (2010: £10.7 million). The Group 
remains debt free.
Restricted cash at 30 June 2011 includes £1.5 million 
held in escrow accounts under arrangements with drilling 
contractors relating to the Company’s share of the cost 
of drilling the Cladhan well and a further £0.3 million in 
respect of Catcher drilling and £1.2 million in respect of 
the forthcoming Tudor Rose well.
At 30 June 2011 approximately half of our cash is held 
on deposit with The Royal Bank of Scotland and attracts 
floating rate interest. The balance is on deposit with 
Scottish Widows in a fixed rate account. 
At 30 June 2011 all of the cash was held in GB Pounds. 
The Group from time to time holds US Dollars and 
is therefore exposed to some extent to the risk that 
movements in exchange rates with GB Pounds will  
impact the value of cash and cash equivalents.
EnCore anticipates that investing activities on its oil and 
gas properties can be financed through operating cash 
flows and existing cash resources and as a result it will 
have adequate liquidity to fund its present commitments 
for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing 
these accounts.
However, EnCore is currently pursuing projects that 
will likely require additional financing. Such additional 
sources may include debt and equity financing as needs 
arise. However, factors affecting project timing and 
outcomes and market conditions could affect EnCore’s 
ability to fully finance all its investment opportunities on 
the optimal schedules.

Corporate Governance Statement
The EnCore Oil Board is committed to business integrity and high ethical values across the Group’s activities. The 
Directors are committed, where practicable for a Company of this size, to applying the requirements of the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance.
This statement explains how the Directors applied the principles of the Code during the year ended 30 June 2011.
The Board
The Board comprises four Executive Directors Alan Booth, Eugene Whyms, James Clark and Graham Doré and two 
Non-Executive Directors who are Christine M.K. Wheeler OBE and Vivien Gibney.
Each of the Directors has extensive knowledge of the oil and gas industry. Biographies of the Directors are set out on 
pages 12 and 13 of this annual report.
The Board is accountable to shareholders for the formulation and delivery of the Group’s strategy. To achieve this, the 
Board directs and monitors the Group’s affairs within a framework of controls which enable risk to be assessed and 
managed effectively. The Board sets the Group’s strategy, ensures that sufficient resources are in place to achieve the 
strategy, and reviews management and financial performance. The Board also has responsibility for setting the Group’s 
core values and standards of business conduct and for ensuring that these, together with the Group’s obligations to its 
stakeholders, are understood by all employees.
The Board meets at least six times a year and as issues arise which require Board attention. The Board has a formal 
schedule of matters specifically referred to it for decision. In addition to those formal matters the Board will also consider 
strategy and policy, acquisition and divestment proposals, approval of major capital investments, risk management 
policy, significant financing matters and statutory shareholder reporting.
A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the accounts is set out on page 22.
The Company has established Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees which are further discussed below.
Audit Committee
An Audit Committee has been established and currently comprises Christine M.K. Wheeler OBE and Vivien Gibney. 
It meets at least twice a year and is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly 
reported on and monitored. This includes reviewing significant financial reporting issues and accounting policies 
and disclosures in financial reports. It liaises with the auditors and reviews the reports from the auditors relating to 
the accounts and internal control systems. If required, meetings are attended by appropriate members of senior 
management. The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing the requirement for an internal audit function.
Remuneration Committee
A Remuneration Committee has been established and currently comprises Christine M.K. Wheeler OBE and Vivien 
Gibney. It reviews the performance of the Executive Directors and sets the scale and structure of their remuneration on 
the basis of their service agreements with due regard to the interests of shareholders and the performance of the Group.

the allocation of share options to employees. Directors of the Group are not permitted to participate in discussions or 
decisions of the Committee concerning their own remuneration.

Relations with Shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority and there is regular dialogue with institutional investors, as 
well as general presentations to analysts at the time of the release of the annual and interim results. The Company 
maintains a website (www.encoreoil.co.uk) for the purpose of improving information flow to shareholders as well as 
potential investors. It contains all press releases, reports and accounts and extensive information about the Group’s 
activities. Enquiries from individual shareholders on matters relating to their shareholdings and the business of the Group 
are welcomed. Shareholders are also encouraged to attend the Annual General Meeting at which they are given the 
opportunity to put questions to the Chairman and other members of the Board.
Internal Controls
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal controls and for reviewing 
its effectiveness. They are designed to safeguard the assets of the Group and to ensure the reliability of financial 
information for both internal use and external publication. The controls which include inter alia financial, operational 
and compliance matters and management are reviewed on an ongoing basis. A system of internal control can provide 
only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities will be detected or that risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives is eliminated. The Board has considered the need for an internal audit function but 
because of the size and nature of its operations does not consider it necessary at the current time.
Risk
The Directors are responsible for the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management activities and internal control processes. 
The Group is exposed to a range of technical, geological, operational, political, environmental, health and safety and 
financial risks in the conduct of its operations. The Group seeks to manage and mitigate these risks by maintaining a 
balanced portfolio and, through compliance with the terms of its licences, the application of policies and procedures 
appropriate for a small international oil and gas company and the recruitment and retention of highly skilled personnel.
The Group’s principal risks are considered to fall into four main categories. These risks are not presented in any 
assumed order of priority. Any of the risks, as well as the other risks and uncertainties discussed in this document, could 
have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the risks set out below may not be exhaustive and additional 
risks and uncertainties, not presently known to the Company, or which the Company deems immaterial, may arise or 
become material in the future.

Remuneration Report
Information not subject to audit
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Christine M.K. Wheeler OBE and Vivien Gibney. The Committee met 
twice during the year.
The main responsibilities of the Committee include:
•	 determining	and	agr eeing	with	the	Boar d	the	r emuneration	policy	for	the	Chief	Executive,	Executive	Dir ectors	and	
senior executives;
•	 r eviewing 	 the 	 design 	 of 	 shar e 	 incentive 	 plans 	 for 	 appr oval 	 by	th e	Bo a r d	a n d	s h a r e h o l de rs	a n d	de te rm i n i n g	th e	a n n u a l	
award policy to Executive Directors and senior executives under existing plans; and
•	 within	the	terms	of	the	agr eed	policy ,	determining	the	r emainder	of	the	r emuneration	packages	(principally	comprising	
salary and pension) for each Executive Director and senior executive.
The Chief Executive and other relevant Executive Directors are invited to attend meetings of the Committee but do not take 
part in any decision affecting their own remuneration.
The Group’s policy is to maintain levels of remuneration so as to attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors and 
senior executives of the calibre required to grow the business and enhance shareholder value.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior executives:
•	 Basic	annual	salary
•	 Benefits	in	kind
•	 Pension	arrangements
•	 Incentive	schemes	including	shar e	options	 
and performance incentive plan
Executive Directors’ Remuneration
Basic Salary
The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually with regard given to personal performance, Company 
performance, changes in responsibilities and competitive market practices. The base salary of each Executive Director, 
prior to any salary sacrifice election, is:
Alan Booth £175,000
Eugene Whyms £175,000
Graham Doré £150,000
James Clark £150,000
Benefits in Kind
The Executive Directors and senior executives receive benefits in kind, principally private medical insurance, life 
assurance and critical illness cover.
Pension Arrangements
The Company does not operate a pension plan. Each Executive Director is entitled to receive a payment equivalent  
to 15 per cent. of his annual basic salary into his private pension scheme.
Incentive Schemes
The Group has put in place two performance schemes to incentivise all employees of the Company, aid recruitment to 
the Company and enable all staff to benefit from the successful growth of the Company. The Group believes that the 
remuneration policy followed to date supports the achievement of EnCore’s strategic goals. Factors of this policy include 
a high proportion of the compensation package being performance-linked and a significant element of incentive pay being 
directly related to EnCore’s share price performance; both of which create a very strong alignment with shareholders.
The first scheme, the ‘EnCore Option Scheme,’ has been in place since the reverse takeover of Oil Quest Resources plc 
in March 2006; the second scheme, the ‘Performance Incentive Plan,’ was put in place in July 2008. 19
EnCore Oil plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Business Profile The Year in Review Governance Financial Statements Company Information
Share Options
The EnCore Option Scheme is comprised of two parts: the basic share option scheme and a part which constitutes 
an Enterprise Management Incentive Plan under rules set out by HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom. 
Options granted under the EnCore Option Scheme can be granted, at the discretion of the Board, under one or other 
of the two parts. Apart from certain tax benefits which can accrue to the Company and its UK employees, if options are 
granted under the part relating to the EnCore EMI Plan all other terms under which options can be awarded under either 
part are substantially identical.
The Company’s policy permits the granting of options in the 42 day period following the announcement of the 
Company’s interim or final results.
The share options vest in equal amounts on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant and must be 
exercised within five years of the grant date or forfeited.
The total number of options outstanding at any point in time cannot exceed 10 per cent. of the issued Ordinary Shares 
of the Company.
Performance Incentive Plan
In July 2008 the Company put in place the EnCore Performance Incentive Plan (EPIP) and made an award of 9,350,000 
Performance Units (PUs) to plan participants. Individual awards of EPIP PUs were broadly consistent with past awards 
of share options with the principal exception of the Executive Directors who received a smaller proportion of the overall 
allocation. The EPIP provides a vehicle to retain and motivate key staff members who will play a key role in helping 
deliver this value.
The PUs will not achieve any value under the EPIP until certain performance hurdles and value creation criteria are 
met. These include a minimum share price hurdle of 60 pence combined with the completion of a significant asset or 
corporate sale. The share price on the date that the EPIP was introduced was 40 pence per share.
Once all appropriate share price hurdles and triggers have been met the amount paid will be calculated by reference to 
the increase in share price over the base share price of 40 pence per share. The amount of excess over the base share 
price will then be subject to a pro-ration factor of between 0.75 to 1.75, depending on the magnitude of  
the excess over the 60 pence hurdle price.
The resulting award will then be further pro-rated to reflect the proportion that any asset sales proceeds relate to 
EnCore’s total market capitalisation. In the event of a change of control or sale of the Company this further pro-ration  
will not be made. 
Following an asset or partial sale of the business the hurdle and base share prices will be rebased for the purposes  
of calculating any future performance related payments. Any awards are subject to the discretion of the  
Remuneration Committee.
Service Contracts and Letters of Appointment
Executive Directors enter into a service agreement with the Company with effect from the date of appointment. Each 
service agreement is on similar terms. Each agreement is terminable by either party on twelve months’ notice. There 
are no specific provisions under which any person is entitled to receive compensation upon the early termination of his 
service agreement other than in accordance with these notice periods.
Non-Executive Directors’ Fees
Christine M.K. Wheeler OBE is paid a basic annual fee of £37,500 and Vivien Gibney receives a basic annual fee of 
£30,000. The appointment is terminable on six months notice served by either party. The Non-Executive Directors are 
both paid a fee of £7,500 in recognition of their services on the Committees.
Material Contracts
There have been no other contracts or arrangements during the period in which a Director of the Company was 
materially interested and which were significant in relation to the Group’s business. 20

5 October 2011 22
EnCore Oil plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2011
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
have, as required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange, elected to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and have elected to 
prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom accounting standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements the Directors are required to:
•	 select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	apply	them	consistently;
•	 make	judgments	and	accounting	estimates	that	ar e	r easonable	and	prudent;
•	 state	whether	the	Gr oup	financial	statements	have	been	pr epar ed	in	accor dance	with	IFRSs	as	adopted	by	the	
European Union;
•	 state,	with	r egar d	to	the	par ent	company	financial	statements,	whether	applicable	UK	accounting	standar ds	have	
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
•	 pr epar e	the	financial	statements	on	the	going	concer n	basis	unless	it	is	inappr opriate	to	pr esume	that	the	Company	
and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions, to disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and to 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of the 
financial statements and other information included in annual reports may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
 
Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 23
EnCore Oil plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Business Profile The Year in Review Governance Financial Statements Company Information
We have audited the financial statements of EnCore Oil plc (“EnCore”) for the year ended 30 June 2011 which comprise 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows, the Company balance sheet, and the related 
notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent Company financial statements is applicable law 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.
Basis for qualified opinion on financial statements 
The Group’s investment in Egdon Resources PLC (“Egdon”), an AIM listed associate acquired in the year and 
accounted for by the equity method, is carried at £7.55m on the consolidated statement of financial position and an 
amount of £1.2m is included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of the Group’s share 
of Egdon’s result for the year ended 30 June 2011. 
Due to the timing of EnCore’s year end and proposed date of publication of the financial statements of Egdon, published 
audited financial information in respect of Egdon is not available. Egdon have not made trading and financial data 
available to EnCore ahead of its publication and therefore the Directors of EnCore have estimated the result for the 
period and the net assets of Egdon as described in note 15.
We were unable to gain access to the management, financial information and auditor’s working papers of Egdon to 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support the EnCore Directors’ estimates of the carrying value of the 
investment at 30 June 2011 and the Group’s share of the result for the year. Consequently we were unable to determine 
whether any adjustments to these amounts were necessary.
Qualified opinion on financial statements
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraph:
•	 the	financial	statements	give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	state	of	the	gr oup’ s	and	the	par ent	Company’ s	af fairs	as	at	 
30 June 2011 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
•	 the 	 group 	 financial 	 statements 	 have 	 been 	 properly 	 prepared 	 in 	 accordance 	 with 	 IFRSs 	 as 	 adopted 	 by 	 the 	
European Union;
•	 the	par ent	Company	financial	statements	have	been	pr operly	pr epar ed	in	accor dance	with	United	Kingdom	Generally	
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•	 the	financial	statements	have	been	pr epar ed	in	accor dance	with	the	r equir ements	of	the	Companies	Act	2006.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of EnCore Oil plc continued
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements  
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In respect solely of the limitation on our work relating to the investment in associate Egdon Resources plc,  
described above:
•	 we	have	not	obtained	all	the	information	and	explanations	that	we	consider ed	necessary	for	the	purpose	of	our	audit.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
•	 adequate	accounting	r ecor ds	have	not	been	kept	by	the	par ent	Company ,	or	r etur ns	adequate	for	our	audit	have	not	
been received from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the	par ent	Company	financial	statements	ar e	not	in	agr eement	with	the	accounting	r ecor ds	and	r etur ns;	or
•	 certain	disclosur es	of	dir ectors’	r emuneration	specified	by	law	ar e	not	made.

The foreign currency translation reserve was used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of 
the financial statements of subsidiaries that were denominated in currencies other than GB Pounds. One of these 
subsidiaries has been sold and the other has changed to a functional currency of GB Pounds.
The Other reserve arose on the reverse acquisition of Oil Quest Resources plc by the EnCore Group in March 2006.

Group Accounting Policies
Basis of preparation and statement of compliance with IFRS
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  
(IFRS) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. IFRS comprises 
the Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Interpretations issued by the 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) that have been endorsed by the European Union (EU).
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group where applicable are set out below.
Accounting standards
There have been no changes to accounting policies through the application of new standards that are effective and 
there have been no standards adopted in advance of the effective date. At the date of authorisation of these financial 
statements, the following relevant standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial 
statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS 9  Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements
IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material 
impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Going concern basis
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The Group’s net cash used in investing activities of some £11.6 million in the year under review is substantially in excess 
of the cash generated from operations. Although significant progress has been made in developing the Group’s assets 
base, it is probable that the business will remain a net consumer of cash over the coming year.
The Directors have prepared financial forecasts for the period through to 31 December 2012 based on the assumption 
of no further external funds being raised. After due consideration of these forecasts, current cash resources (year end 
some £18.3 million available cash) and present level of commitments the Directors are of the view that the Group has 
adequate financial resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future and for a period of at least  
12 months from the date of authorisation of these financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of EnCore Oil plc and the entities it controls (its 
subsidiaries) drawn up to 30 June each year.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group, where control is the power to govern the financial and operating 
policies of the entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured 
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at 
the acquisition date. Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being 
the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis. The cost 
of business acquisitions are written off when incurred.
The results of Group undertakings acquired during the year are included from the date of acquisition of a controlling 
interest. The results of Group undertakings that have been sold during the year are included up to the date of disposal. 
The profit or loss on sale is calculated by reference to the net asset value at the date of disposal, adjusted for purchased 
goodwill previously consolidated in the balance sheet. 30
EnCore Oil plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Basis of consolidation continued
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using 
consistent accounting policies. All inter-Company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from 
them, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Investment in associates
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise significant influence through participation 
in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but which is not a subsidiary or a jointly controlled 
entity. The results, assets and liabilities of an associate are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity 
method of accounting.
Expenditure on the discovery, appraisal, development and utilisation of oil and gas reserves
The Group accounts for oil and gas expenditure under the successful efforts method of accounting.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to profit or loss.
All licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised in cost centres by well, field or exploration 
area, as appropriate. Directly attributable administration costs are capitalised insofar as they relate to specific exploration 
and development activities.
These costs are written off unless commercial reserves have been established or the determination process has not 
been completed and there are no indications of impairment. IFRS 6 defines examples of triggering events that might 
lead management to conclude that impairment of an exploration and evaluation asset has occurred. Any identified 
impairment is charged immediately to profit or loss.
If a project is deemed commercial all of the attributable costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within 
property, plant and equipment. These costs are then amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of 
production basis.
Decommissioning
Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full as an asset and liability when the obligation arises. The asset is 
included within exploration and evaluation assets or property, plant and equipment as is appropriate. The liability is 
included within provisions. The amount recognised is the estimated cost of decommissioning, discounted where 
appropriate to its net present value, and is reassessed each year in accordance with local conditions and requirements. 
Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions required are also reflected in 
adjustments to the decommissioning asset.
Property, plant and equipment – excluding development and producing assets
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment categories at rates calculated to write off the cost, less 
estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date of the statement of financial position, of each asset 
evenly over its expected useful life as detailed below:
Leasehold improvements over life of lease
Vehicles over three years
Fixtures and equipment over three years
Computer hardware and software over three years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Group Accounting Policies continued 31
EnCore Oil plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Business Profile The Year in Review Governance Financial Statements Company Information
Asset held for resale
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather than continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when a sale is 
highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management 
must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year 
from the date of classification. Disposal groups are groups of assets, and liabilities directly associated with those assets, 
that are to be disposed of together as a group in a single transaction.
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are initially measured at the lower of carrying value 
and fair value less costs to sell.
Financial instruments
Financial assets
Investments
Unlisted investments are stated at the lower of cost and likely realisable value.
Amounts owed from Joint Venture Partners and associates
Amounts owed from Joint Venture Partners and associates are measured at initial recognition at their fair value. 
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective 
evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the Statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and in hand and short-term 
deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The cash and cash equivalent amount in the Cash Flow Statement includes overdraft facilities.
Financial liabilities
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially stated at their fair value and subsequently accounted for at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of 
direct issue costs.
Leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as 
operating leases and rentals payable are charged in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Joint ventures
The Group is engaged in oil and gas exploration and appraisal through unincorporated joint ventures. The Group 
accounts for its share of the results and net assets of these joint ventures as jointly controlled assets. In addition, where 
EnCore acts as operator to the joint venture, the gross liabilities and receivables (including amounts due to or from non-
operating partners) of the joint venture are included in the Group Statement of financial position. 32
EnCore Oil plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Group Accounting Policies continued
Taxation
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the date of the 
Statement of financial position.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxation and is 
accounted for using the Statement of financial position liability method.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is 
realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the date of the statement 
of financial position.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on acquisitions that are categorised as Business 
Combinations. Deferred tax is recognised at acquisition as part of the assessment of the fair value of assets and liabilities 
acquired. Any deferred tax is charged or credited in profit or loss as the underlying temporary difference is reversed.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
The Group does not operate any pension plans. The Group makes contributions to employees’ private pension plans of 
15 per cent. of the employee’s gross salary. These contributions are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments
The Company has both equity-settled and cash settled transactions as defined by IFRS 2.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which 
they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant 
employees become fully entitled to the award. Fair value is determined using an appropriate pricing model. The only 
vesting condition is that employees remain in employment of the Group during the vesting period.
The Company is liable for Employer’s National Insurance on the difference between the market value at date of exercise 
and the exercise price. The expense is accrued by reference to the share price of the Company at the date of the 
statement of financial position.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous date of the statement of financial position is recognised in profit 
or loss, with a corresponding entry in equity.
The cost of cash settled share-based payment transactions is measured by reference to the goods and services 
acquired and the liability incurred at the fair value of the liability. Until the liability is settled, the Group measures the fair 
value of the liability at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with any changes in value recognised in profit 
or loss for the year. Integral to this measurement exercise is the need for management to make assumptions about the 
likelihood of an event occurring that will give rise to a liability and this includes amongst other things the probability of a 
significant asset or corporate sale occurring.
Foreign currency translation
Operating companies
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the exchange rate ruling 
at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the date of the statement of financial position. All differences are taken to 
profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. 33
EnCore Oil plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Business Profile The Year in Review Governance Financial Statements Company Information
Consolidation
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the statement of 
financial position. Income and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the period. The resulting 
exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred 
cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss.
Use of estimates when preparing the annual financial statements
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions affecting recognition and measurement in the consolidated statement of financial position and 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Future 
events may lead to these estimates being changed. In particular, estimates are required when:
•	 Estimating	the	r esult	of	the	associate
•	 Assessing	the	need	for	and	measur ement	of	impairment	of	intangible	fixed	assets
•	 Determining	the	fair	value	of	shar e-based	payments
•	 Estimating	decommissioning	liabilities
•	 Financial	risk	management
Estimating result of associate
Due to the timing of the year end of the associate, Egdon Resources plc, audited financial information has not been 
made available to the Group. As a result an estimate has been made of the result for the period based on historic 
publicly released financial information and updates on individual projects. The carrying value of the individual projects 
has also been assessed based on publicly available information. The need to make such an estimate increases the 
uncertainty in our accounts and adjustment may therefore be required in a future period.
Intangible assets
The Group determines whether intangible assets are impaired at least on an annual basis. If there is an indication of 
impairment, an estimate of the value in use of the asset is required. Estimating the value in use requires the Group to 
make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the asset and also to choose a suitable pre-tax discount rate 
in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Share-based payments
Determining the fair value and measurements of share-based payments requires assumptions in respect of the inputs 
used in the option pricing model. The measurement of cash settled share-based payments also requires management to 
make estimates of the likelihood of certain events occurring. 
Details can be found in note 3.
Decommissioning 
The Group determines decommissioning liabilities by making assumptions, based on the current economic environment, 
which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability. These estimates are 
reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to assumptions. However, the actual decommissioning 
cost will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will 
reflect market conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, actual costs will also reflect the extent of decommissioning 
work required to be performed, whether the decommissioning works can be performed as part of a multi well 
programme or in isolation and progress in decommissioning technologies.
Financial risk management
In respect of financial risk management, at the date of the statement of financial position, the Group’s principal financial 
assets are cash and cash equivalents, amounts due from Joint Venture Partners and other receivables.
The Group manages liquidity risk by ensuring that sufficient funds are available to meet its commitments as they fall due. 
The Group uses projected cash flows to monitor funding requirements for the Group’s activities.
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates is mitigated by regular reviews of available fixed and 
variable rate deposits. Management also monitor bank credit risk. 34

3. Share-based remuneration charges 
All Employee Share-option Plan
The all employee share option plan is a grant of share options to all eligible employees on appointment and periodically 
thereafter. The share options are issued at market price on the grant date. The share options vest in equal amounts on the 
first, second and third anniversaries after the grant date and must be exercised within 5 years of the grant date or forfeited.
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year to 
30 June 2011 is £134,194 (year to 30 June 2010: £275,515). At 30 June 2011 the provision for employer social  
security costs that would arise on the exercise of share options is £1,244,627 (30 June 2010: £760,937).

(2010: 2.26 years). At 30 June 2011 19,711,882 (2010: 18,113,816) of the total number of share options outstanding 
could be exercised and these options had a weighted average exercise of 18.97 pence (2010: 21.20 pence).
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was between 8.5 pence and 94.625 pence. 
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option 
pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The following table

The expected life of the options is based on management’s assumption of behavioural patterns and is not necessarily

No other features of options grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
All employee cash settled share-based plan
The all employee cash settled share-based EnCore Performance Incentive Plan (EPIP) is an award of 9,350,000 
Performance units made to employees. The Performance Units will not achieve any value under the EPIP until certain 
performance hurdles and value creation criteria are met. These include a minimum share price hurdle of 60 pence 
combined with the completion of a significant asset or corporate sale. 
Once all appropriate share price hurdles and triggers have been met the amount paid will be calculated by reference to 
the increase in share price over the base share price of 40 pence per share. The amount of excess over the base share 
price will then be subject to a pro-ration factor of between 0.75 to 1.75, depending on the magnitude of the excess over 
the 60 pence hurdle price.
The resulting award will then be further pro-rated to reflect the proportion that any significant asset sales proceeds relate 
to EnCore’s total market capitalisation. In the event of a change of control or sale of the Company no further pro-ration 
will take place.
In accordance with IFRS 2 management are required to measure the fair value of any potential liability at each reporting 
date. This process includes making assumptions about a number of matters including the likelihood of a significant asset 
or corporate sale occurring. At the grant date management determined that no material liability existed as the chance 
of the plan paying out was remote. At the 30 June 2011 management considered whether a pay out under the plan 
was probable and again concluded that any potential liability was immaterial. In light of the events described in note 25 
management reviewed this decision and concluded that the sequence of events that led to the Offer to acquire EnCore 
Oil plc by Premier Oil plc occurred after 30 June 2011 and the judgement made not to recognise any charge in the 
accounts at that date was still correct.
Assuming the scheme becomes effective and all performance units issued under the terms of the EnCore Performance 
Incentive Plan are paid out using the price of 70 pence per EnCore Share in the calculation required under the terms of 
the plan, a cash payment of £3.3 million will become due together with £0.4 million of Employers’ National Insurance.

from the value of our Irish offshore assets and £0.7 million from the value of other assets. The Irish assets were 
measured through value in use. Value is use is based on, amongst other things, estimates of reserves, capex and 
operating expenditure together with the use of a pre-tax discount rate of 10%.

In August 2010 the Company completed the sale of its interest in EnCore (E&P) Limited to Egdon Resources plc. 
EnCore (E&P) Limited held certain onshore French licences. This sale was the final part of a larger transaction signed in 
March 2010 and completed in July 2010 which involved the sale of assets in return for a material equity stake in Egdon.
In August 2009 the Company sold its interest in the Breagh field offshore UK. The interest was held in two wholly owned 
subsidiaries of the Company. The transaction was effected through the sale of the wholly owned EnCore (SNS) Limited, 
which was contained a 14 per cent. interest in the Breagh field offshore UK for a consideration of £39.2 million and 
the sale of a one percent. interest by the other subsidiary for a consideration of £2.7 million (see note 7 below). The 
purchaser of both parts was RWE Dea UK SNS Limited.

The tax credit arising in the year to 30 June 2011 reflects the revaluation of the deferred tax balance to reflect changes 
in corporation tax rates and the reversal of deferred tax balances on UK Onshore assets sold to Egdon Resources (see 
note 15). The deferred tax on the UK Onshore assets was created on the fair value adjustments to intangible oil and gas 
assets resulting from acquisitions in the year to 30 June 2008 and the period to 30 June 2007.
The tax credit arising in the year to 30 June 2010 reflected the reversal of deferred tax balances created on the fair value 
adjustments to intangible oil and gas assets following the sale of Breagh (see note 6), and the impairment of certain UK 
Onshore licences (see note 5).  40 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued

Deferred tax assets in respect of losses have not been recognised as their future recovery is uncertain or not currently 
anticipated. Ring fence losses of £31.3 million are included within the potential deferred tax asset at the rate considered 
likely to apply when the groups upstream assets are developed.
The Supplementary Corporation Tax rate of 62% (2010 50%) has been applied to ring-fence losses and capital 
allowances, while the normal Corporation Tax rate of 26% (2010: 28%) has been applied to the non ring-fence losses 
and capital allowances.
12. (Loss)/earnings per ordinary share
Basic (loss)/earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net (loss)/earnings for the year by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted (loss)/earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net (loss)/earnings for the year by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive ordinary shares into ordinary shares. 
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

As there is a loss in the year ended 30 June 2011, there is no difference between the basic and diluted earnings per share. 41

The amounts for intangible exploration and evaluation assets represent active exploration projects. These amounts will 
be written off to profit or loss as exploration costs unless commercial reserves are established or the determination 
process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment. The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore 
whether the carrying value of Exploration and Evaluation assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.

also been assessed based on publicly available information.
The actual result for Egdon for this period may be different to our estimate and consequently an adjustment may be

25. Post balance sheet events
On 5 October 2011 EnCore announced the details of a recommended acquisition by Premier for the entire issued and 
to be issued share capital of EnCore, to be effected by Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the 
Companies Act 2006 (“Scheme”). 
Premier has received irrevocable undertakings from the EnCore directors to vote in favour of the Scheme in respect of 
their entire beneficial holdings totalling 21,692,984 EnCore shares, representing approximately 7.4% of EnCore’s issued 
share capital. In addition, EnCore’s largest shareholder, BlackRock Investment Management (UK) limited (“BlackRock”), has 
confirmed its current intention to vote in favour of the Scheme. As at 3 October 2011, BlackRock controlled voting rights in 
respect of 17,049,983 EnCore Shares, representing approximately 5.8 per cent. of EnCore’s issued share capital.
The undertakings will cease to be binding if (i) a Scheme document is issued and the Scheme has not become 
effective by the long stop date of 28 February 2012 and prior to that time Premier has not issued an offer document; 
or (ii) an offer document is issued before the long stop date and the offer lapses or is withdrawn without having 
become wholly unconditional. 
The Acquisition will extend to all EnCore Shares issued (whether upon the exercise of the options and/or the vesting 
of awards or otherwise) under the EnCore Share Option Plans before the Scheme becomes effective. Appropriate 
proposals will be made in due course by Premier to participants in the EnCore Share Option Plans. 
Assuming the Scheme becomes effective and all options issued under the terms of the All Employee Share Option Plan 
become exercisable, and assuming that all option shares that are in the money are exercised for cash at the price of 70 
pence per EnCore Share (other than the option shares held by the Executive Directors who have irrevocably undertaken 
to elect for the share alternative), new EnCore Shares will be issued generating approximately £1.4 million in cash receipts. 
Employers National Insurance will become payable on the realised gains and would amount to approximately £0.6 million. 
Assuming the Scheme becomes effective and all performance units issued under the terms of the EnCore Performance 
Incentive Plan are paid out using the price of 70 pence per EnCore Share in the calculation required under the terms of 
the plan, a cash payment of £3.3 million will become due together with £0.4 million of Employers’ National Insurance.
26. Related party transactions
The transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation.
At 30 June 2011 the Group had outstanding a loan receivable of £1 million from Egdon Resources plc, an associate 
Company. Interest receivable on this loan during the year was £78,082 and is included in finance income for the year. 
The remuneration of the Directors, who are the key management personnel of the Group, is set out in the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report described as having been audited, on page 19 of these accounts and form part of 
these financial statements.

28. Financial instruments and risk management
Categorisation and fair value of financial instruments
The Group’s financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, other receivables and unlisted investments. The 
Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables. All of these are measured at amortised cost other than 
unlisted investments which are held at cost as no ready market value is available.
It is the Directors’ opinion that the carrying value of all of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities approximates 
their fair value.
Fair values

Financial risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to a number of financial risks. A risk management programme has been established to 
protect the Group against the potential adverse effects of these financial risks. There has been no significant change in 
these financial risks in the year.
(a) Foreign currency risk
A portion of the Group’s assets, liabilities, expenses and commitments are located overseas and therefore denominated 
in foreign currencies. However, these assets are not seen to represent a significant portion of any of these categories. As 
such the Group is not currently materially exposed to the risk of fluctuating exchange rates. At 30 June 2011 the Group 
held £0.1 million of cash in US Dollars and an immaterial amount in Euros. The Group does not use hedging instruments 
to protect itself against the risk that exchange rates will move and therefore the Group is exposed to translation 
exposure on these cash balances. 51
EnCore Oil plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Business Profile The Year in Review Governance Financial Statements Company Information
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the Group runs in its relations with financial counterparties in the case of deposits of surplus 
funds, bank account balances and joint venture partner balances within other receivables.
The Group endeavours to limit the number of financial counterparties, which must possess a strong credit rating at 
least equivalent to BBB+ at Standard & Poor’s or the equivalent rating at Moody’s. The permitted exposure volume 
per counterparty is dependent on the counterparty’s credit rating and the maturity of the exposure. At the date of the 
statement of financial position £6.3 million is deposited with The Royal Bank of Scotland and £9.0 million with Scottish 
Widows. Restricted cash at the same date of £3.1 million with The Royal Bank of Scotland.
The Group’s accounts receivable are with joint venture partners in the oil and gas industry and associate Company and 
are subject to normal industry credit risks. The maximum exposure at the date of the statement of financial position is 
£1,321,302 (2010: £258,584).
(c) Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that changes in market interest rates impact the Group’s cash 
and cash equivalents that have a floating interest rate. At 30 June 2010 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of 
£15.3 million. A one per cent increase or decrease in the interest rate would increase or decrease finance income by 
£0.2 million per annum. The Company had no interest rate swaps or hedges at 30 June 2011.
(d) Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it remains sufficiently funded to support its business strategy and maximise 
shareholder value. The Group’s funding needs have historically been met through a combination of equity and portfolio 
management. Capital includes share capital, share premium, other reserves and retained earnings. The Group remains 
debt free at 30 June 2011, future funding needs may be met through debt or equity or a combination of the two. 52

Company Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the parent Company have been prepared under the historical cost convention in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principals (UK GAAP). The 
following paragraphs describe the main accounting policies under UK GAAP, which have been applied consistently.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 408 of the Companies Act the Profit and Loss Account of the Company is 
not presented separately. 
Expenditure on the discovery, appraisal, development and utilisation of oil and gas reserves
The Company accounts for oil and gas expenditure under the successful efforts method of accounting.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Profit and loss 
account.
All licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised in cost centres by well, field or exploration 
area, as appropriate. Directly attributable administration costs are capitalised insofar as they relate to specific exploration 
and development activities.
These costs are written off unless commercial reserves have been established or the determination process has not been 
completed and there are no indications of impairment.
If a project is deemed commercial all of the attributable costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within 
property, plant and equipment. These costs are then amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of 
production basis.
Tangible assets
Tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 
Depreciation is provided on all tangible assets categories at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated 
residual value based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, of each asset evenly over its expected useful life 
as detailed below:
Leasehold improvements over life of lease
Vehicles over three years
Fixtures and equipment over three years
Computer hardware and software over three years
The carrying values of tangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments
Fixed asset investments, including investments in subsidiaries and associate, are stated at cost and reviewed for 
impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Foreign Currencies
Sterling is the reporting currency of the Company. Transactions in foreign currency are translated at rates of exchange 
ruling at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, with a corresponding charge or credit to the profit and 
loss account.
Share Issue Expenses and Share Premium Account
Costs of share issues are written off against the premium arising on the issues of share capital. 54
EnCore Oil plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Company Accounting policies continued
Share-based Payments
The fair value of these awards has been determined at the date of grant of the award. This fair value, adjusted by the 
Company’s estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest as a result of non-market conditions, is expensed 
uniformly over the vesting period.
The fair values were calculated using an appropriate option pricing model with suitable modifications to allow for 
employee turnover after vesting and early exercise. The inputs to the model include: the share price at date of 
grant; exercise price; expected volatility; expected dividends; risk free rate of interest; and patterns of exercise  
of the plan participants. 
The cost of cash settled share-based payment transactions is measured by reference to the goods and services acquired 
and the liability incurred at the fair value of the liability. Until the liability is settled, the Company measures the fair value of the 
liability at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with any changes in value recognised in profit or loss for the 
period. Integral to this measurement exercise is the need for management to make assumptions about the likelihood of an 
event occurring that will give rise to a liability and this includes amongst other things the probability of a significant asset or 
corporate sale occurring.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise 
required by FRS19.
Deferred taxation assets are only recognised if recovery without replacement by equivalent debit balances is considered 
more likely than not. Deferred tax balances  
are not discounted.
1. All Employee Share-option Plan
The all employee share option plan is a grant of share options to all eligible employees on appointment and 
periodically thereafter. The share options are issued at market price on the grant date. The share options vest in equal 
amounts on the first, second and third anniversaries after the grant date and must be exercised within five years of 
the grant date or forfeited.
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year to  
30 June 2011 is £134,194 (2010: £275,515). At 30 June 2011 a provision of £1,244,627 (2010: £760,937) was  
made for employer social security costs that would arise on the exercise of the options. 
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share 
options during the year.

EnCore Oil plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Business Profile The Year in Review Governance Financial Statements Company Information
Share options outstanding as at 30 June 2011 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.79 years  
(2010: 2.26 years). At 30 June 2011 19,711,882 (2010: 18,113,816) of the total number of share options outstanding 
could be exercised and these options had a weighted average exercise of 18.97 pence (2010: 21.20 pence).
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was 8.5 pence to 94.625 pence. 
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes 
option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The 
following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 30 June 2011. No new options were issued in  
the year ended 30 June 2010.
 2011
Dividend yield (%) –
Expected share price volatility (%) 81
Risk-free interest rate (%) 0.6
Expected life of option (years) 2
The expected life of the options is based on management’s assumption of behavioural patterns and is not necessarily 
indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
No other features of options grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
All employee cash settled share-based plan
The all employee cash settled share-based EnCore Performance Incentive Plan (EPIP) is an award of 9,350,000 
Performance units made to employees. The Performance Units will not achieve any value under the EPIP until certain 
performance hurdles and value creation criteria are met. These include a minimum share price hurdle of 60 pence 
combined with the completion of a significant asset or corporate sale. 
Once all appropriate share price hurdles and triggers have been met the amount paid will be calculated by reference to 
the increase in share price over the base share price of 40 pence per share. The amount of excess over the base share 
price will then be subject to a pro-ration factor of between 0.75 to 1.75, depending on the magnitude of the excess over 
the 60 pence hurdle price.
The resulting award will then be further pro-rated to reflect the proportion that any significant asset sales proceeds relate 
to EnCore’s total market capitalisation. In the event of a change of control or sale of the Company no further pro-ration 
will take place.
Management measure the fair value of any potential liability at each reporting date. This process includes making 
assumptions about a number of matters including the likelihood of a significant asset or corporate sale occurring. At the 
grant date management determined that no material liability existed as the chance of the plan paying out was remote. 
At the 30 June 2011 management considered whether a pay out under the plan was probable and again concluded that 
any potential liability was immaterial. In light of the events described in note 12 management reviewed this decision and 
concluded that the sequence of events that led to the Offer to acquire EnCore Oil plc by Premier Oil plc occurred after 
30 June 2011 and the judgement made not to recognise any charge in the accounts at that date was still correct.
Assuming the scheme becomes effective and all performance units issued under the terms of the EnCore Performance 
Incentive Plan are paid out using the price of 70 pence per EnCore Share in the calculation required under the terms of 
the plan, a cash payment of £3.3 million will become due together with £0.4 million of Employers’ National Insurance.

12. Post balance sheet events
On 5 October 2011 EnCore announced the details of a recommended acquisition by Premier for the entire issued and 
to be issued share capital of EnCore, to be effected by Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the 
Companies Act 2006 (“Scheme”). 
Premier has received irrevocable undertakings from the EnCore directors to vote in favour of the Scheme in respect of 
their entire beneficial holdings totalling 21,692,984 EnCore shares, representing approximately 7.4% of EnCore’s issued 
share capital. In addition, EnCore’s largest shareholder, BlackRock Investment Management (UK) limited (“BlackRock”), has 
confirmed its current intention to vote in favour of the Scheme. As at 3 October 2011, BlackRock controlled voting rights in 
respect of 17,049,983 EnCore Shares, representing approximately 5.8 per cent. of EnCore’s issued share capital.
The undertakings will cease to be binding if (i) a Scheme document is issued and the Scheme has not become 
effective by the long stop date of 28 February 2012 and prior to that time Premier has not issued an offer document; 
or (ii) an offer document is issued before the long stop date and the offer lapses or is withdrawn without having 
become wholly unconditional. 
The Acquisition will extend to all EnCore Shares issued (whether upon the exercise of the options and/or the vesting 
of awards or otherwise) under the EnCore Share Option Plans before the Scheme becomes effective. Appropriate 
proposals will be made in due course by Premier to participants in the EnCore Share Option Plans. 
Assuming the Scheme becomes effective and all options issued under the terms of the All Employee Share Option Plan 
become exercisable, and assuming that all option shares that are in the money are exercised for cash at the price 
of 70 pence per EnCore Share (other than the option shares held by the Executive Directors who have irrevocably 
undertaken to elect for the share alternative), new EnCore Shares will be issued generating approximately £1.4 million 
in cash receipts. Employers National Insurance will become payable on the realised gains and would amount to 
approximately £0.6 million. 
Assuming the Scheme becomes effective and all performance units issued under the terms of the EnCore Performance 
Incentive Plan are paid out using the price of 70 pence per EnCore Share in the calculation required under the terms of 
the plan, a cash payment of £3.3 million will become due together with £0.4 million of Employers’ National Insurance. 62

EnCore Oil plc   Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Notes
1. In accordance with Articles 107 and 108 of the Articles of the 
Company one-third of Directors must retire from office and 
are eligible for re-appointment. These retiring Directors must 
be those who have been in office the longest since their last 
appointment or re-appointment. 
2. In accordance with Article 111 of the Articles of the 
Company no person unless recommended by the Directors 
or a Director retiring at the meeting shall be eligible for 
appointment to the office of Director at any general meeting 
unless notice has been given previously.
3. In accordance with Article 113 of the Articles of the 
Company, Vivien Murray Gibney must retire from office and 
is eligible for reappointment, having been appointed as a 
Director since the last Annual General Meeting.
4. Biographical details of the Directors and particulars of their 
service contracts with the Company are set out in the report 
and accounts.
5. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that only those 
shareholders registered in the register of members of the 
Company as at 6.00 p.m. on 12 December 2011 and, if this 
Meeting is adjourned, at 6.00 pm on the day two days prior 
to the adjourned meeting, shall be entitled to attend or vote 
at the AGM in respect of the number of shares registered in 
their name at that time. Changes to entries on the relevant 
register of securities after that time shall be disregarded in 
determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the 
Meeting or adjourned Meeting. 
6. Resolution 7, which is an ordinary resolution, authorises the 
Directors to allot unissued shares up to a maximum aggregate 
nominal value of £4,878,258.13. This authority expires at the 
conclusion of the 2012 Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, on 
the date falling 15 months after the date of the passing of the 
resolution unless previously renewed, varied or revoked by the 
Company in general meeting. 
7. If the shares are to be allotted using the authority under 
Resolution 7 and are to be paid for in cash, Section 561 of the 
Companies Act 2006 requires that those shares are offered 
first to existing shareholders in proportion to the number of 
ordinary shares they each hold at the time. An offer of this kind 
is called a ‘rights issue’ and the entitlement to be offered the 
shares first is known as a ‘pre-emption right’.
8. In certain circumstances however, it may be in the interests of 
the Company for the Directors to be able to allot some of the 
shares for cash other than by way of a rights issue. Resolution 
8, which is a special resolution, asks shareholders to waive 
their pre-emption rights, but only for equity securities having a 
maximum aggregate nominal value of £4,878,258.13, which 
represents one third in nominal value of the ordinary share 
capital of the Company. This authority will expire on at the 
conclusion of the 2012 Annual General Meeting or, if earlier, on 
the date falling 15 months after the date of the passing of the 
resolution unless previously renewed, varied or revoked by the 
Company in general meeting.
9. The Directors have no present intention of utilising the 
authorities in resolutions 7 and 8. The Directors, however, 
consider it desirable to have the flexibility to respond, in 
the interests of promoting the success of the Company, to 
market developments and appropriate opportunities as they 
arise and recommend resolutions 7 and 8 accordingly. 
10. A holder of ordinary shares or their duly appointed 
representatives are entitled to attend, vote and speak at the 
Meeting. A member so entitled may appoint (a) prox(ies), 
who need not be (a) member(s), to attend, vote and speak 
on his/her behalf. 
11. A form of proxy which may be used to make such 
appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this 
notice. A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company. 
It should be completed and returned as soon as possible. 
To be valid, a completed proxy must be received by the 
Company’s registrar, Capita Registrars Limited, The Registry, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU, at least 
48 hours before the Annual General Meeting. Completion 
and return of the relevant proxy enclosed herewith will not 
prevent a shareholder from attending and voting in person. 
12. Members are entitled to appoint a proxy in respect of some 
or all of their shares. Members are also entitled to appoint 
more than one proxy. A space has been included on the 
form of proxy to allow members to specify the number of 
shares in respect of which that proxy has been appointed. 
Members who return the form of proxy duly executed but 
leave this space blank will be deemed to have appointed the 
proxy in respect of all of their shares. 
13. Any person receiving a copy of this Notice as a person 
nominated by a member to enjoy information rights under 
Section 146 of the 2006 Act (a ‘Nominated Person’) should 
note that the provisions in Notes 10-12 above concerning 
the appointment of a proxy or proxies to attend the meeting 
in place of a member do not apply to a Nominated Person, 
as only shareholders have the right to appoint a proxy. 
However, a Nominated Person may have a right under an 
agreement between the Nominated Person and the member 
by whom he or she was nominated to be appointed, or to 
have someone else appointed, as a proxy for the meeting. If 
a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or 
does not wish to exercise it, he/she may have a right under 
such an agreement to give instructions to the member as 
to the exercise of voting rights at the meeting. Nominated 
Persons should also remember that their main point of 
contact in terms of their investment in the Company remains 
the member who nominated the Nominated Person to 
enjoy information rights, or perhaps the custodian or broker 
who administers the investment on their behalf. Nominated 
Persons should continue to contact that member, custodian 
or broker (and not the Company) regarding any changes or 
queries relating to the Nominated Person’s personal details 
and interest in the Company, including any administrative 
matter. The only exception to this is where the Company 
expressly requests a response from a Nominated Person.

Notes continued
14. Members or those who do not have a form of proxy and 
believe that you should have one and wish to appoint 
more then one proxy and require additional forms should 
photocopy the form of proxy as required. 
15. A vote ‘withheld’ option is provided on the form of proxy 
to enable you to instruct your proxy not to vote on any 
particular resolution. However, it should be noted that a 
vote withheld in this way is not a ‘vote’ in law and will not be 
counted in the calculation of the proportion of the votes ‘For’ 
and ‘Against’ a resolution. 
16. Electronic proxy appointment through CREST:  
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies 
through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so for the AGM and any adjournments thereof by 
using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. 
CREST Personal Members of other CREST sponsored 
members, and those CREST members who have appointed 
a voting service providers, should refer to their CREST 
sponsor or voting service providers, who will be able to take 
the appropriate action on their behalf. 
17. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the 
CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message 
(a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated 
in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s 
specifications and must contain the information required for 
such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The 
message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment 
of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a 
previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be 
transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID 
RA10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments 
specified in the notice of meeting. For this purpose, the time 
of receipt will be taken to be the time as determined by the 
timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications 
Host from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the 
message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by 
CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies 
appointed through CREST should be communicated to the 
appointee through other means. CREST members and, where 
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting services providers 
should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular 
messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore 
apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. 
It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to 
take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member 
or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service 
provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting 
service providers take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to 
ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST 
system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST 
members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or 
voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those 
sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations 
of the CREST system and timings. 
18. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy 
Instruction in the circumstances set out In Regulation 35(5)(a) 
of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. 
19. If the Chairman, as a result of any proxy appointments, is 
given discretion as to how the votes the subject of those 
proxies are cast and the voting rights in respect of those 
discretionary proxies, when added to the interests in the 
Company’s securities already held by the Chairman, result 
in the Chairman holding such number of voting rights that 
he has a notifiable obligation under the FSA’s Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules, the Chairman will make the necessary 
notifications to the Company and the FSA. As a result, any 
member holding 3 per cent. or more of the voting rights in 
the Company who grants the Chairman a discretionary proxy 
in respect of some or all of those voting rights and so would 
otherwise have a notification obligation under the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules, need not make a separate 
notification to the Company and the FSA.
20. As at 5 October 2011, being the last practicable date prior to 
publication of this notice, the Company’s issued share capital 
consists of 292,695,488 ordinary shares with a nominal 
value of 5 pence each with voting rights. The Company does 
not hold any ordinary shares in Treasury. 
21. Documents on Display:
 The following documents are available for inspection during 
normal business hours at the Company’s registered office 
up to the date of the Annual General Meeting and will be 
available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting from 
15 minutes prior to its commencement until its conclusion:
 a)  A copy of the Memorandum and Articles of Association;
 b)  A statement of the interests and transactions of the 
Directors and their families in the share capital of the 
Company; and
 c) Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment. 66

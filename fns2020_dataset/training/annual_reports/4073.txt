before amortisation of goodwill       All comparatives have been restated
Country & Metropolitan is a leading
developer of urban regeneration projects
throughout the UK. Over 95% of our homes
are built on brownfield sites comfortably
exceeding the government’s target of 60%.
The Group has a highly skilled team
dedicated to maximising returns whilst
creating developments which add real value
to communities and the environment.

Country & Metropolitan Homes Northern Region
This landmark development next to Leeds Station
overlooking the River Aire is now nearing completion.
Forty Two units are contracted for sale. The prime upper
level apartments, duplexes and penthouses will soon be
released. Building works are due to be completed prior
to December 2005.

35.95 Country & Metropolitan has produced yet another outstanding set of
results with record profit before amortisation of goodwill and tax of
£10.9m. This record result has been achieved by developing a
portfolio of homes that are affordable to a large cross section of the
UK market.
There has been a significant slowing down of the housing market in
the south of England over the last six months, with signs that the
north is also “cooling down”. Having re-positioned the Group to
become a major provider of lower priced homes, we are now taking
advantage of the strong demand for our homes which had an
average price of £121,000 during the last financial year.
Results and dividend 
The Group has increased its pre tax profit before amortisation of
goodwill by 91% to £10.9m (2003: £5.7m) from 759 (2003: 598)
units. This has translated into basic earnings per share before
amortisation of goodwill of 33.41p (2003: 21.07p) taking account of
approximately 5m shares issued in November 2003 that raised
£7.9m.  Following the introduction of FRS 5 Application Note G
“Revenue Recognition”, the Group has changed the point of income
recognition from exchange of contracts and substantially built to
exchange of contracts and build complete. The comparatives have
been restated in accordance with the new policy.
In line with my interim statement I am pleased to report that the
Board is proposing to increase the total dividend by 25% to 4.125p
(2003: 3.30p) per share resulting in a final dividend of 3.025p (2003:
2.60p) per share. The Board intends to increase the total dividend at
this rate over the next two years subject to matters beyond the
Group’s control. The final dividend will be paid on 7 January 2005 to
shareholders on the register on 3 December 2004.
Operating review
House price inflation in the UK over the last few years has been
excessive and clearly not sustainable. After five increases in interest
rates over the past ten months the housing market is gradually
settling down to more sustainable levels and we should see a return
to more normal trading conditions.
The Group completed its withdrawal from the premium homes
market in the south of England some time ago and our new
production in this market is focused on studio, one and two bedroom
apartments with prices starting from £87,500.
The markets in which NorthCountry Homes (“NCH”) operate have
been extremely buoyant and have experienced a strong level of
sales during the year, which has accelerated since 1 July 2004. NCH 
is now focused on an aggressive land acquisition programme and 
we intend to substantially increase the number of outlets to exploit
its position in the market place. I am particularly proud to inform 
you that NCH won the Derbyshire Business of the Year Award in 
June 2004.
A particular development of note is the 250 unit scheme at Havelock
Park near Sunderland which was launched a number of weeks ago.
Over three hundred people visited the development on the first day
and the demand was so strong that a ticketing system had to be
introduced to enable an organised entry to the Show Homes. A
substantial number of the units on this site have now been reserved.
Chairman’s Statement
2 Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2004
“The Group is now a major provider of lower cost homes for sale in the UK and it
is well placed to significantly increase unit production.”
David Laing
Chairman Another development of note was Abacus, comprising 178 units
close to Birmingham city centre, where 25% of the development
has been sold since the launch in July 2004 for £6.9m. 
The legal agreement in connection with our planning application
for High Royds Hospital in Menston, Leeds is expected to be
concluded shortly and the purchase of this major urban village is
expected in the early part of the second half of the current
financial year. The Group has a 50% interest in this project via a
joint venture company.
The Group is continuing to expand its land bank and currently owns
or controls 2,800 plots with planning consent and a further 3,150
plots where planning has been applied for or where terms have
been agreed.
The overall planning scenario in the UK is still very unsatisfactory.
The time it now takes to obtain planning permissions is an ever-
growing problem but we do have an extremely good track record
of obtaining consents on appeal.
Corporate activity
We sold our interest in Headway Plc in this current financial year at
a profit realising £2.7m of cash.
Prospects
Despite the doom and gloom in the media on house prices and the
market, Country & Metropolitan has commenced the new financial
year with the strongest ever order book, with contracted sales of
£38.3m and forward reservations of £43.4m at 30 September 2004.
There is tremendous pent up demand for housing in the UK
providing it is affordable and Country & Metropolitan is focused on
satisfying this need. The Group has been quick to react to the
changing market place and it would be a great shame if negative
comments in the press undermined house buyers’ confidence, as
the fundamentals are sound.
We believe that Country & Metropolitan will maintain its record of
increasing shareholder value over the forthcoming years.
David Laing
Chairman
22 October 2004
Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2004 3 Country & Metropolitan continues to go from strength to strength and
once more I am delighted to report on another record set of results.
Turnover was up by 35% to £81.4m with pre tax profit before
amortisation of goodwill up by 91% to £10.9m. We have achieved
our seventh consecutive year of growth in profits and our stature
continues to grow within the house building industry.
During the last 12 months the Group has carefully repositioned
itself to become a major provider of lower priced homes which are
affordable to working people and in doing so we have successfully
anticipated the slow down in the market which is now taking place.
The market has, as expected, moderated over recent months and
we welcome that. The house price inflation over the last few years
was excessive and not sustainable and we are now seeing a return
to more normal conditions. We expect house price inflation to be
minimal which will help affordability.
The number of homes sold increased by 27% to 759 in the last
year at an average price of £121,000 and we traded from 38
outlets. 92% of completions were in the North of the country with
8% in the South.
During the year the Southern Division was refocused and
strengthened with a new Managing Director appointed and I am
pleased to report that we now have 290 (2003: 64) units under
construction in the South, with a Southern forward order book of
£10.6m.
The Group currently has forward orders (contracted and reserved
properties) in excess of £81m, comprising 599 units, which is an
extremely satisfactory position.
NorthCountry Homes (NCH), the low cost home provider based in
the north of England which we acquired some two years ago, has
been a major contributor to profit, based on its philosophy of
building in areas of deprivation where substantial regeneration is
required. NCH led by the original founder and Chairman, Jolyon
Harrison has a unique business model, providing aspirational homes
for working people, many of whom did not believe it would be
possible to become a home owner.
The change in communities when people “take ownership” is quite
dramatic, with our developments becoming the catalyst for change
in the wider areas of the community.
Commercial property income remained approximately static at
£861,000 and we are currently reviewing our portfolio with a view
to selling a number of properties and reinvesting the proceeds into
our core business.
A great deal of effort has gone into increasing the size of our land
holdings and despite working within a planning system that in
many parts of the country has become a complete farce, we have
made considerable progress against all the odds.
We now own or control 2,800 plots with planning consent, together
with a further 3,150 plots where planning has been applied for or
where contractual terms have been agreed. The Group also owns or
controls 195 acres of “strategic land” where we believe there is a
reasonable possibility of obtaining consent in due course.
Chief Executive’s Review
4 Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2004
“The Group has proved with these results its ability to anticipate changing market
conditions and we are confident we will continue to grow our business for the
benefit of our shareholders.”
Stephen Wicks
Chief Executive Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2004 5
Despite the Government making “the right noises” and seeming to
encourage more home building, there is little sign that this
enthusiasm has filtered down to local planning authorities, who
continue to be pitifully under resourced and suffer ongoing
interference from local politicians who are pressured by anti
development groups and the nimby fraternity.
Notwithstanding the planning issues, the fundamentals of the
housing market remain attractive with demand for affordable
homes outstripping supply. The upward trend in interest rates has
moderated house price inflation and with a substantial number of
sites in place we anticipate a significant increase in our unit
production.  
The Group has proved with these results its ability to anticipate a
changing market and to grow all aspects of the business and I
remain confident that this can be continued in the future.

NorthCountry Homes was named in the Barker
Report as the only house builder offering submarket
housing without any grant subsidy. The Deputy Prime
Minister states 90% of the population would like to
become homeowners and NorthCountry Homes is
almost exclusively addressing the needs of 23% of
the market. NorthCountry Homes purchase sites in
areas in need of regeneration, selling homes to
people predominantly in rented accommodation and
providing an opportunity of stepping onto the
housing ladder for first time buyers.

Arundale Homes
The Buttershaw estate had a very poor reputation with drug
dealing, crime and prostitution being rife. The area became
infamous as the location for the film Rita, Sue & Bob Too
which highlighted the problems in the locality. The entire
site has been demolished and Arundale Homes are in the
process of regenerating the area with a mix of two and
three bedroom terraced, semi and detached homes with
prices starting from £74,500. The transformation of the
estate is quite remarkable, now that a large number of
former council tenants have taken ownership and a new
pride in the area is emerging. This area is made up of three
developments, Beaumont Park, Nursery Court and Arundale
Park and comprises a total number of 235 homes. Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2004 9

Country & Metropolitan are

this single storey classroom

Country & Metropolitan Plc are dealing, on a daily basis, with issues
that have an impact on our environment. It is, therefore, incumbent
upon us to adopt a responsible approach to matters such as
remediation of contaminated land and to our construction process.
It is important that we strive to minimise the impact on the
environment by the prevention of pollution as we carry out our
construction process. The preparation of a planning application for a
project has assessments carried out to analyse its environmental
impact and its sustainability.
Our approach to an environmentally friendly process includes the
following:
• Carry out as many developments as possible on brownfield sites.
The Group currently carries out over 95% of its developments on
such land.
• We are committed to ensuring that protected trees and protected
species are properly looked after.
• We strive to make our new houses as energy efficient as possible.
We build some sites using timber frame technology.
• We ensure that building materials are recycled on site as far as
possible.
• Our objective is to ensure our developments realise the desired
financial returns within an environmentally responsible and
sustainable manner.
The Group supports a number of local and national charities. Charitable donations during the year were £37,000 (2003: £9,000). Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2004 17
Country & Metropolitan have always recognised that the success of
the company has been based on a sound land acquisition strategy.
This strategy needs to be able to respond to changes in market
conditions, changes in the Group’s strategy and to the requirements
placed upon it by central and local government; the latter point is
even more relevant today due to the appalling level of service that
we receive from some local authority planning departments.
Whilst central government, through various reports such as the
“Review of Housing Supply” by Kate Barker (for which NCH are the
only named contributor) have recognised that the UK is desperately
short of new housing, it appears to be adopting few, if any, practical
measures to increase our ability as an industry to provide a much
larger volume of much needed housing.
In recognition of this we have taken the initiative to restructure the
central land buying function and create a new much larger
department which will enable us to focus on our two main priority
areas of large scale urban regeneration and the acquisition of sites
to provide new housing for first time buyers and for purchasers
within the £100,000 to £300,000 range.
We firmly believe that our land acquisition strategy is a key driver
of the business and consequently we are confident that our new
approach will enable us to build upon the successes that we have
had in the past on large scale urban regeneration sites such as
Highlands Hospital, Royal Earlswood Hospital and now High Royds
Hospital near Leeds. It will also enable us to look at bringing the
low cost model down into the south east.
More time and effort will need to be expended on dealing with
difficult planning authorities, but we are confident that our
approach and attitude to these will produce results.
With the Planning Inspectorate now talking about delays of 14
months before a planning enquiry is likely to be heard, then a
strategy of constant communication with these planning authorities
needs to be established and should ultimately bear fruit.
We intend to take a very tenacious and proactive approach to
planning applications with a new progress chasing system being
put in place to monitor our applications daily.
I would like to think that our new department might be seen as the
SAS of the house building sector! Whilst we will stop short of
scaling local Town Halls, we intend to make our dissatisfaction
known at a very early stage by a process of intense lobbying at
every level.
To underline our commitment to this revised approach the entire
Land Department in the South has moved into a separate office in
Rickmansworth, as we believe that this will enable the land team
to communicate closely and ensure that all avenues are covered
and all potential acquisitions are identified very early on and
thoroughly assessed.
As we have been able to prove in the past, an acquisition strategy
such as this is likely to produce the plots required to meet our
targets for growth, together with a surplus which will enable our
growth strategy to be “pump primed” by the sale of surplus land.

Land Acquisition Strategy
“Building homes for 
the next generation.” Country & Metropolitan has had another excellent year with pre-tax
profit before amortisation of goodwill increasing by 91% to £10.9m.
These results demonstrate a fifth consecutive year of growth since the
Company floated onto the London Stock Exchange with significant
increases in dividends, which have grown by a compound rate of
19.1% per annum since the year ended 31 August 2000.
Accounting Policies
Following the introduction of FRS 5 Application Note G “Revenue
Recognition”, the Group has changed its accounting policy relating to
the recognition of income on the sale of residential properties to a
more prudent basis. Income is now determined at exchange of
contracts and completion of build. Previously income was determined
by exchange of contracts and the property being substantially built
with legal completion having taken place by the date of approval of
the accounts. The effect of this change is shown at Note 12 to the
accounts.
Profit and loss account
The Group’s turnover for the year ended 30 June 2004 increased by
34.7% from £60.5m to £81.4m. Operating profit before amortisation
of goodwill has increased from £7.8m to £13.9m and profit on
ordinary activities before tax and amortisation of goodwill has
increased from £5.7m to £10.9m being an increase of 91%. 
Basic earnings per share before amortisation of goodwill has risen by
58.6% to 33.41p (2003: 21.07p). The interim dividend was increased
by 57% over the previous period in order to rebalance the payout
between the interim and final dividends. The confidence placed by
the Board in the Group’s earnings has enabled it to increase the total
dividend by 25% to 4.125p (2003: 3.30p) per share resulting in a final
dividend of 3.025p (2003: 2.60p) per share. This provides dividend
cover of 6.1 times based on post tax profits and the total dividend.
Capital structure and treasury policy
In November 2003 the Company issued 5,050,521 ordinary shares
under the terms of a Placing and Open Offer for a cash consideration
of £7.9m net of expenses. The Group also issued 92,025 ordinary
shares for a cash consideration of £58,250 as a result of the exercise
of share options. In June 2004 the Company repurchased 50,000
ordinary shares at £1.76 per share for cancellation.
The Group’s overall policy is to finance its operations through a
combination of shareholders’ funds, long term bank loans, medium
term bank loans, short term bank overdrafts and cash in hand and at
bank. Wherever possible the Group also tries to secure deferred terms
on acquisition of land.
The Group’s facilities with its principal bankers, The Royal Bank of
Scotland, were reviewed in September 2004 and it currently has one
year committed revolving credit facilities totalling £50m and an
overdraft facility of £2.0m primarily for core borrowing requirements
and working capital. The Group also has an acquisition facility of
£6.0m which was fully utilised upon the acquisition of NorthCountry
Homes and expires in July 2005. Further details of the Group’s
borrowings are set out in Note 19 to the accounts.
An overall offset arrangement between any cash and loan balances
exists for the calculation of interest. Interest rates are either linked to
LIBOR or base rates. The Group’s policy, which is reviewed and agreed
by the Board, is to be in a position to take advantage of floating rates
on part of the debt but also to be protected against significant
increases in interest rates by the use of fixed rate loans or suitable
hedging instruments. In accordance with this policy the Group has a
mixture of floating rate debt and fixed rate hedging as shown in note

The Group does not have any foreign exchange exposure.
Cash flows 
The Group has reduced its net gearing at the end of the year from
145% to 93%. Net borrowings increased from £32.5m to £33.5m 
at the year end. Against this the Group has forward reservations 
and contracted sales of £81.7 (2003: £45.3m) at the end of
September 2004. 
The net cash outflow from operations was £4.6m after an increase
of stocks and work in progress of £27m, an increase in debtors of
£4.7m and a corresponding increase in creditors of £12.7m. 
Balance Sheet
The increase in freehold and investment properties relates to further
expenditure incurred on existing properties. Freehold and investment
properties valued by the directors amount to £13.2m.
The Group’s net current assets have increased from £15.7m to
£32.9m and shareholders’ funds have risen from £22.4m to £35.9m
resulting in net asset value per share of 150p compared to 118p at
30 June 2003.
The Group established two Limited Liability Partnerships (“LLPs”)
during the year, and the contractual arrangements are such that
they have been identified as quasi-subsidiaries under FRS 5 and are
therefore consolidated. The minority interests represent the capital
introduced by third parties into the LLPs.
Annual General Meeting
Notice convening the Company’s annual general meeting is set out
at the back of this document. In addition to ordinary business and
the renewal of authorities to allot shares, a resolution will be
proposed at the annual general meeting to authorise the Company
to repurchase up to 2,399,387 shares at a price of not less than
nominal value and not greater than 105 per cent of the average
market quotation for such shares over the five days preceding the
purchase. The authority will replace the existing share repurchase
authority and will expire at the next annual general meeting of the
Company or (if later) fifteen months after the date on which it is
passed. The authority will only be exercised where the Directors
consider that such exercise is in the best interests of the Company
having regard to market conditions from time to time and shares
repurchased may either be cancelled or put into treasury.
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”)
The Group will adopt IFRS for the year commencing 1 July 2005.
The implementation of IFRS is a major change and we have
members of staff addressing the issues involved. The impact of the
change to IFRS to our reported capital and reserves and on our net
profit will be assessed during the current financial year. Our
accounting policies for the recognition of revenue and the value of
land and work in progress should be unaffected. However, IFRS may
impact accounting policies, in particular for retirement benefits,
goodwill, financial instruments, deferred tax and long term share
based incentives. We will continue to keep our shareholders
informed as significant issues arise.

Directors and Advisors Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2004 22
The Directors present their report and audited accounts for the 
year ended 30 June 2004. All comparitives are for the 10 months
ended 30 June 2003.
Business activities and business review
The principal activities of the Group during the period under
review covered various property projects primarily in the
residential property field. These included land acquisition and the
promotion of urban villages together with the construction of new
homes for open market sale. A detailed report is given in the
Operational Review on pages 6 to 14.
Results
The audited accounts for the year ended 30 June 2004 are set out
on pages 26 to 46. The Group achieved a profit before taxation
and amortisation of goodwill of £10.9 million (2003: £5.7 million).
The retained profit of £5.7 million (2003: £2.9 million) will be
transferred to reserves.
Dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 3.025p per ordinary
share to be paid on 7 January 2005 to ordinary shareholders on
the register on 3 December 2004 which, together with the interim
dividend of 1.10p paid on 9 July 2004 makes a total of 4.125p for
the year (2003: 3.3p).
Fixed assets
In the opinion of the Directors the current open market value of
the Group’s fixed asset interests in land and buildings amounts to
£13.2 million. There is no material difference between the book
and the current open market value of fixed asset interests in land
and buildings.
Directors and their interests in the share capital
of the Company
The Directors who served during the year are listed together with
their biographical details on page 20. The Directors’ beneficial
interests in the ordinary shares of the Company are given in the
Remuneration Report on pages 24 to 25.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Mr D E Laing and 
Mr J M Van Gelder will retire by rotation at the next Annual
General Meeting and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-
election. 
Substantial shareholdings
As at 22 October 2004 the Company had been notified of the
following interests that represent 3% or more of the issued share
capital of the Company excluding directors whose shareholdings
remain unchanged from the date of the accounts:
Number of Percentage
Ordinary shares held
Jupiter Asset Management Limited 1,782,918 7.43
Allied Commercial Exporters Limited 1,665,000 6.94
J Harrison 1,195,363 4.98
J P Morgan Fleming Investment

Employees
The Group is an equal opportunities employer and the importance
of good communications with employees is recognised by the
Directors. Various benefit schemes are available to employees all
of whom are encouraged to participate subject to eligibility. Equal
opportunities for training, career development and promotion are
available to all employees regardless of disability, age, sex, race,
religion, colour, nationality or sexual orientation.
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully
and fairly considered with appropriate regard to the aptitudes and
abilities of the applicant concerned. In the event of a person
becoming disabled during their employment, the Group will
endeavour to continue their employment and arrange appropriate
training and or adjustments to the working environment where
possible.
The Directors recognise the importance of good communications
and relations with employees and these are maintained at Head
Office and local operational level through team briefing,
management meetings, internal company statements and
newsletters.
Policy for payment of creditors
It is the Company’s payment policy to negotiate the best possible
terms for all business and therefore there is no consistent policy
as to the terms used. We make sure that suppliers know the terms
on which business will take place and it is our policy to abide by
the terms. At 30 June 2004, the trade creditors of the Company
represented 48 days (2003: 27 days) of purchases made by the
Company.
Charitable donations
During the period the Group made various charitable donations
totalling £37,000 (2003: £9,000). No political donations were
made in either period.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint Nexia Audit Limited will be proposed at
the next Annual General Meeting.

Responsibilities of the Directors
in respect of the preparation of the accounts
Company law requires directors to prepare accounts for each
financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of
the Group for that period. In preparing those accounts, the
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the accounts; and
• prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in
business.
The Directors of Country & Metropolitan PLC are responsible for
keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the Company and
the Group and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other
irregularities.
Directors’ Report for the year ended 30 June 2004 Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2004 23
The Board has considered the requirements of the Combined Code
adopted by the London Stock Exchange in performing the
Corporate Governance of the Group. The Company has complied,
except where noted, throughout the year ended 30 June 2004,
with the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code which
relate to the principles of Good Governance and Code of Best
Practice.
The Board comprises of three Executive Directors and three Non-
Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors are considered to
be totally independent within the meaning of provision A.3.2 of
the Combined Code. In view of the size and composition of the
Board it is considered to be inappropriate to recognise a senior
independent Director as required by provision A.2.1 and for a
Nomination Committee to be established under provision A.5.1.
Under the Articles of Association of the Company at least one third
of the Board is required to retire by rotation and offer for re-
election.
Mr D E Laing and Mr J M Van Gelder have a letter of appointment
which is terminable upon not less than six months written notice
by either party. Mr T R Roydon has a contract for services between
his company, Hansom Property Company Limited and Country &
Metropolitan PLC which is terminable by either party giving three
months notice.
Board and Committees
All members of the Board are equally accountable under the law
for the proper stewardship of the Company’s affairs. The roles of
the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and clearly defined.
The Chairman is primarily responsible for the running of the Board
and the Chief Executive is responsible for the running of the
business of the Group.
The Board meets regularly on a formal basis and is supplied with
appropriate information to enable it to discharge its duties. There
is an agreed schedule of matters reserved for the Board for
collective decision. The Executive Directors meet informally between
formal Board meetings to focus on strategy, cash management,
financial performance, major transactions and control of operations
generally.  
The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to the Audit and
Remuneration Committees.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Mr D E Laing, Mr J M Van Gelder
and Mr T R Roydon. It meets twice a year with the auditors and is
responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the
Group is properly reported on and monitored. In particular it
focuses on accounting policies, compliance and internal control. It
also reviews the scope and results of the audit and its cost
effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the
auditors.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Mr D E Laing, Mr J M Van
Gelder and Mr T R Roydon. The Committee meets at least once
each year and reviews remuneration and terms of employment of
Executive Directors and certain senior employees. In particular, the
Committee determines specific remuneration packages for each
Executive Director. The fees for the Non-Executive Directors are
decided by a committee of the Board comprising all the Executive
Directors. The Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on pages
24 to 25.
Investor Relations
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders as
appropriate. All shareholders are kept up to date with the affairs
of the Group through the Annual and Interim Reports. Save in
exceptional circumstances, all members of the Board attend the
Annual General Meeting ("AGM") which is used to communicate
with private and institutional shareholders. The chairmen of the
Audit and Remuneration Committees are also available at the AGM
to answer questions.
Internal Control
In applying the principle that the Board should maintain a sound
system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment
and the assets of the Group, the Directors recognise that they have
overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a
system of internal control to provide them with reasonable
assurance regarding effective and efficient operations, internal
financial control and compliance with laws and regulations. The
Group has a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks the Group faces. The Board reviews this process on
an ongoing basis, which has been in place throughout the period
and up to the date of approval of the accounts and which is in
accordance with Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the
Combined Code published in September 1999. Such a system is
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key features of the control system that operated throughout
the period covered by the accounts are described below.  
- The Group has a defined organisation and management
structure to ensure a proper division of responsibility and
authority.
- The Board has identified areas of risk which are reviewed on a
regular basis for their relevance and appropriateness to the
business.
- Control procedures are in place to address key areas of risk.
These include authorisation procedures over land purchases
which are considered and approved by the Board before
contracts are entered into. Controls are also in place to cover
other areas such as payment of invoices, cash control and
expansion of the business.   
- Monthly Board and Management meetings are held with all
Regions of the Group, where key aspects of the business are
discussed.
- The Group’s systems provide regular updates on key statistics in
relation to sales and production. Detailed short term and two
year cash flow forecasts are also used by the Board and the
Executive Directors to control the cash requirements of the
Group.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the accounts.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises the three Non-Executive
Directors, Mr D E Laing, Mr J M Van Gelder and Mr T R Roydon.
Remuneration Policy
The Remuneration Committee has overall responsibility for
remuneration policy in respect of Executive Directors and certain
senior employees. The Group provides competitive remuneration
packages at all levels in order to attract, retain and motivate staff.
Basic salaries and benefits are reviewed annually and bonuses are
awarded for achieving high levels of performance. 
The principal terms of reference of the Committee are as follows:
- To determine the basic salary of the Executive Directors and
certain senior employees.
- To determine, after the end of the financial period, the amounts
that should be awarded as bonuses taking account of the
Group’s targets and individual performance.
- To agree the Executive Directors and senior employees to whom
share options should be granted in order to align their interests
with those of shareholders.
- To agree the annual targets for the Group which would be
applicable for incentive schemes.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, who are
members of the Committee, is a matter reserved for the Executive
Directors who take account of practices in other companies.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors have service contracts with the Company
which may be terminated by the Company upon 24 months notice
and by the Director upon 6 months notice. The service contracts do
not include provision for pre-determined compensation for early
termination.
Incentive schemes - audited information
Annual bonuses are subject to achieving Group performance
targets and the Committee has the right to award discretionary
bonuses based on individual performance.
The Company has in place the Country & Metropolitan PLC 1999
Approved Share Option Scheme and the Country & Metropolitan
PLC 1999 Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
At 30 June 2004, options had been granted over 1,577,463 shares
to the Executive Directors and over 592,661 shares to senior
employees and staff. The exercise of the options granted to the
Executive Directors is subject to objective performance conditions
determined by the Remuneration Committee prior to the grant of
an option. The current performance criterion is that, over a three
year period, the Company’s performance in respect of earnings per
share growth, must exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by
an average of 2% per annum.

Performance graphs
The Remuneration Report Regulations provide that the Company
must provide a graph comparing the total shareholder return
(“TSR“) performance of a hypothetical holding of shares in the
Company with a broad equity market index over a five year period
- the ‘Compliance Graph’. In this context, the Directors have chosen
to illustrate the performance of TSR against the FTSE Actuaries
Fledgling Index over a period commencing on 9 December 1999,
being the date on which the Company’s ordinary shares were listed
on the London Stock Exchange. In the opinion of the Directors, the
FTSE Actuaries Fledgling Index is the most appropriate index against
which TSR should be measured because it is a widely used and
understood index of broadly similar sized UK companies to the
Company. The Compliance Graph is shown below.

Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies of the Group which have been consistently applied in dealing with items which are considered material
in relation to the Group’s accounts are as follows:-
(a) Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost basis of
accounting as modified by the revaluation of certain fixed assets.
Following the introduction of Financial Reporting Standard No 5, Application Note G ‘Revenue Recognition’, the Group has reviewed
and decided to amend its accounting policy regarding the recognition of income on residential property sales. This is explained in (d)
below and in Note 12 to the accounts. The comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings from the date on which control of each
undertaking passes to the Group. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
In accordance with Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has not presented a separate profit and loss account.
Undertakings, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of the voting
rights and over which it exerts significant influence are treated as associated undertakings. The Group accounts include the appropriate
share of these undertakings’ results, on an equity accounting basis in accordance with FRS9.
The group has two quasi-subsidiaries which are consolidated in the accounts and further details are included in Note 15.
(c) Turnover
Turnover comprises amounts receivable from house sales, the total value of contracting work executed during the period, amounts
receivable and related fees from project management services, proceeds from disposal of sites assembled for resale, rental income
and amounts invoiced by the Group in respect of other services rendered during the period excluding value added tax.
(d) Recognition of income on property activities
As disclosed above the Group has changed its policy on the recognition of income on residential property sales. Disposals of
residential properties are now accounted for at the date of exchange, where there is a legally binding, unconditional, irrevocable
contract and where the property is build complete. Previously income was recognised at the date of exchange, where there was a
legally binding, unconditional, irrevocable contract and where the property was substantially built and legal completion took place by
the date of approval of the accounts.
Income is recognised on land sales when contracts are exchanged. Where the Group undertakes developments with other investors
and profits are shared and paid by way of a development fee, income is recognised when individual units within the development
are sold.
(e) Cost of letting new developments
All costs incurred in the initial letting of development properties are capitalised. Any subsequent costs expended on re-letting the
properties are charged to the profit and loss account in the year they are incurred.
(f) Investments
Investments are valued at cost less provision for impairment in value.
(g) Investment properties
Investment properties are stated at their open market value at the balance sheet date. Surpluses or deficits on individual properties are
transferred to the investment revaluation reserve, except that a deficit which is expected to be permanent and which is in excess of
any previously recognised surplus over cost relating to the same property, or the reversal of such a deficit, is charged (or credited) to
the profit and loss account. Other deficits on revaluation not expected to be permanent are taken to the statement of total
recognised gains and losses.
In accordance with SSAP 19, no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold and leasehold investment properties
where the unexpired term of the lease is more than 20 years. This treatment for certain of the Group’s investment properties is a
departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 concerning depreciation of fixed assets. However, these properties are
not held for consumption but for investment and the Directors consider that systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view. Depreciation or amortisation is
only one of the factors reflected in the annual valuation, and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be
separately identified or quantified.
Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2004 Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2004 30
Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2004 continued
(h) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets on a straight line
basis over their useful economic lives at the following annual rates:
Plant and equipment 25%
Furniture, fixtures and fittings 20% - 25%
Motor Vehicles 25%
Freehold properties are not depreciated in the accounts of the Group.  The Directors consider that freehold properties are maintained
in such a state of repair that their residual value is at least equal to their net book value. As a result the corresponding depreciation
would not be material and therefore is not charged in the profit and loss account. The Directors perform annual impairment reviews
in accordance with the requirements of FRS15 and FRS11 to ensure that the carrying value is not lower than the recoverable amount.
(i) Intangible assets - goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given
over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised and written off on a straight line basis over its
useful economic life. The useful economic life of goodwill is assessed separately for each acquisition and is currently 10 years.
Provision is made for any impairment.
(j) Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises all expenditure directly related to
development or land assembly projects. Net realisable value represents the Directors’ estimate of the net proceeds receivable after
taking account of market conditions prevailing at the date of approval of the accounts.
(k) Long term contracts
Profit on long term contracts is taken as the work is carried out if the outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.  The profit
included is calculated on a prudent basis to reflect the proportion of the work carried out at the period end, by recording turnover
and related costs as contract activity progresses. Turnover is calculated by reference to valuation of the work carried out to date. Full
provision is made for losses on all contracts in the period in which they are first foreseen.
(l) Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the result for the period, which takes account of taxation deferred because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for taxation purposes and the treatment under the Group’s accounting policies.  
Deferred tax is provided for on a full provision basis on all timing differences, which have arisen but not reversed at the balance
sheet date. No timing differnces are recognised in respect of gains on sale of assets where those gains have been rolled over into
replacement assets. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are recoverable, that is, on the basis of all available
evidence, it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing
differences can be deducted. Any assets and liabilities recognised have not been discounted.
(m)Leased assets
Fixed assets that are the subject of finance leases or hire purchase contracts are capitalised and included in tangible fixed assets. The
corresponding liability is included in creditors.  The finance cost element of the lease or hire purchase contracts is charged to the
profit and loss account over the period of the lease.
Expenditure on leases other than finance leases ("operating leases") is charged to the profit and loss account in the period it is incurred.
(n) Pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme and contributes into a small self administered scheme for two of its
directors. Contributions payable for the period are charged to the profit and loss account.
The Group also operates a defined benefit scheme. The expected cost of providing pensions under this scheme, as calculated
periodically by professionally qualified actuaries, is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the service
lives of employees in the scheme in such a way that the pension cost is substantially level percentage of current and expected future
pensionable payroll.
(o) Treasury instruments
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage financial risk. Interest charges and financial liabilities are stated after taking account of
these swaps. Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2004 31

12. Prior year adjustment
Following the introduction of Financial Reporting Standard No. 5 Application Note G “Revenue Recognition”, the Group has changed its
accounting policy relating to the recognition of income on the sale of residential properties. Point of sale is now determined by exchange
of contract and completion of build. Previously the point of sale was determined by exchange of contract and the property being
substantiallly built with legal completion having taken place by the date of approval of the accounts.
The effect of the change in accounting policy on the net assets at 30 June 2003 is a reduction of £953,000 which is shown as a prior year
adjustment. The results for the period to that date are reduced by £915,000 and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
The balance sheet impact of the change has been as follows:
Increase/(Decrease)
£’000
Stocks 1,989
Debtors (2,955)
Creditors 13
Reduction in net assets (953)
For the year ended 30 June 2004, it is impractical to quantify the impact of the change of policy as the build process no longer recognises
the stage of substantially built.

investments were sold at this value would be approximately £52,000 (2003: £26,000).
Quasi-subsidiaries
During the year the Group established two LLP’s, Irwell Quays Limited Liability Partnership and Birmingham (Abacus) Limited Liability
Partnership which began trading on 30 January 2004 and 30 June 2004 respectively. The principal activities of these LLP’s is to develop
two sites. The Group will provide all the necessary management services in return for the majority of the development profit. The
structure of the LLP’s and its contractual arrangements are such that they have been identified as quasi-subsidiaries under FRS 5 and are
therefore being consolidated. The combined summarised financial statements of these LLP’s are as follows:

20. Financial instruments
The Financial Review on pages 18 and 19 includes an explanation of the role that financial instruments have had during the period in
creating or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities. The explanation summarises the objectives and policies for holding or
issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategy for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the
period.
The numerical disclosures required by FRS13 are set out below.
Short term debtors together with short term creditors, and amounts due in respect of land, are excluded from the analysis.
The Group’s financial assets comprise fixed asset investments, long term debtors and cash at bank and in hand. For interest calculation
purposes there is an overall offset arrangement between cash at bank and bank loans and overdrafts. Long term debtor balances and
fixed asset investments are non-interest bearing.
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise bank and other borrowings and hire purchase creditors.
a) Interest rate risk
At 30 June 2004 the Group had total bank borrowing facilities of £53.4m, representing £40.0m committed facilities, £10.3m of term
loans, £1.1m of uncommitted facilities and £2m overdraft facility.
After taking into account interest rate swaps entered into by the Group, the interest rate profile of the Group’s financial liabilities, all
denominated in sterling was as follows:
2004 2003
£’000 £’000
Fixed rate 10,572 11,505
Floating rate 35,373 26,455
45,945 37,960
Floating rate liabilities relate to certain bank loans and bank overdrafts which attract interest at floating rates between 1.5% and 3.5%
above the relevant bank’s base rate or in some cases LIBOR.
Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2004 continued Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2004 41
20. Financial instruments continued
The fixed rate borrowings have a weighted average fixed rate of 7.38% (2003: 7.61%) and weighted average period to maturity of 
3.79 years (2003: 4.35 years). The weighted average period for which the rates are fixed is 3.79 years (2003: 4.35 years).
The Company has entered into a £10m 7 year interest rate swap fixing the base rate at 5.66%. The swap expires on 4 June 2008 but
could be extended to 4 June 2011 at the bank’s option.
b) Maturity of financial liabilities
The maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 30 June 2004 is as follows:
2004 2003
£’000 £’000
Within one year or on demand 33,294 23,917
Between one and two years 7,226 1,981
Between two and five years 4,986 7,281
In more than five years 439 4,781
45,945 37,960
At 30 June 2004, the Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of £6.2m expiring between one and two years (2003: £13.2m
expiring between two and five years).
c) Fair values of financial assets and liabilities
In the opinion of the directors there is no material difference between the amounts at which the Group’s financial assets and liabilities
are included in the accounts and their fair values.

As the Group has no intention to sell its freehold and investment properties it is not expected that the deferred tax liability will crystallise
in the foreseeable future. In accordance with FRS19, no provision has been made for deferred tax on gains on property revalued to its
market value.
The deferred tax asset at 30 June 2004 is £76,000 (2003: £55,000) and has been recognised in other debtors.

31. Pensions
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for some of its Directors and employees. The assets of the schemes are held separately
from those of the Company in independently administered funds. The contributions made during the year amounted to £377,000 (2003: £196,000).
NorthCountry Homes Group Ltd (“NCH”) also operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme. The scheme was closed to new members on 15
October 2001. The assets are all held in separate trustee administered funds. The scheme is subject to triennial valuation by independent actuaries
using the projected unit method. The most recent valuation was conducted at 1 July 2001, assuming that the real valuation rate of investment return
would be 6.5% per annum and that the real rate of salary increases would average 5% per annum. The rate of contribution by NCH is 12.9% 
(2003: 12.9%). The contribution by NCH for the year was £130,000 (2003: £107,000).
The valuation at 1 July 2001 showed that the market value of the scheme assets amounted to £272,000 and the actuarial value of these assets
represented 88% of the benefits that had accrued to members. The actuarial valuation at 1 July 2001 showed a deficit of £38,000 after allowing for
future increases in earnings. 
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 1 July 2001 and updated by Scottish Life to take
account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 30 June 2004. Scheme assets are stated at their market
value at 30 June 2004. The financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are:  Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2004 45

has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the accounts in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the accounts and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal
and regulatory requirements, United Kingdom Auditing Standards and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the accounts give a true and fair view and whether the accounts and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in
our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the accounts, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if the information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions with the company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statements reflect the company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited accounts. This other
information comprises only the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s
Review, Operational Review, Financial Review and the Corporate Governance Statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the accounts. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other
information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the accounts and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the
preparation of the accounts, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s and the Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the accounts and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the accounts and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the accounts give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 30 June 2004 and of the profit of the
Group for the year then ended; and
• the accounts and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

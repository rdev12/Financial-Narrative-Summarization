sophistication of mobile phones and users,
these are exciting times for iTouch.
Ivan Fallon Chairman
focus has been to acquire and integrate
Jippii, leverage our international presence
and develop our consumer brands to
secure a strong position as one of the
leading providers of mobile content in 
the world. We believe we are extremely
well positioned to take advantage of the

well as 3G know-how as European
operators begin to roll-out their 3G services.
For-side also made a strategic investment
in the Company purchasing 18.25m shares
at 29p each, representing 4.5% of the
enlarged share capital.
On 14 May 2004, Roland Denning joined
the Board of iTouch as a Non-Executive
Director. He brings an exceptional range of
experience and knowledge to the Group
which will be invaluable to us as iTouch
continues on its rapid expansion path.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to
welcome him to the Group. 
On 14 March 2005, we agreed to dispose
of iTouch Business Mobility, the corporate
PDA business, to continue our focus on
the consumer data market.
On the same date Avi Azulai resigned from
the Board. On behalf of the Board I would
like to thank Avi for his tremendous efforts
in helping establish iTouch as one of the
leading companies in the mobile data
market and wish him luck and every
success in his new ventures.
This has been a landmark year for the
Group which is reflected in another
excellent set of financial results. Our main
I am delighted to report on yet another
year of impressive growth for iTouch.
2004 saw the successful acquisition
and integration of Jippii, the Finnish
mobile services provider, for £8m and
the enhancement of the Group’s global
content offering through a strategic
agreement with the Japanese company,
For-side. Furthermore, the direct
channel model was rolled out into five
new territories proving that we have
a strong and scalable business model. 
In September, we announced our first
quarter of positive operating cash flow
since IPO. At the end of the year, the
Group had £13.1m cash. 
The final quarter produced an EBITDA
profit (before exceptionals) of £2.3m, an
increase of 142% on the previous year.
Following the acquisition of Jippii, the
Group now has a market presence in
25 countries and is connected to 95
network operators. Jippii alone has
European Premium SMS connectivity with
74 operators and, with a similar business
model to iTouch, the transaction reinforces
the Group’s position as a market leader
in Europe.

I am pleased to report that the past
year has been a period of significant
progress for iTouch, both from a
financial and an operational
perspective. Strong performance
across all financial metrics was
achieved and our position as one
of the leading mobile value added
service providers in Europe was
consolidated.
Excellent financials
iTouch achieved significant financial
milestones during 2004. Group revenue
increased by 29% to £78.0m from
£60.3m in 2003 and EBITDA progressed
to £8.1m up from a loss of £0.1m last
year. We achieved positive cash flow at the
operating level for the first time and profit
before tax (before exceptionals) for the
full year was £3.7m. This strong financial
performance reflects the important
corporate progress iTouch has achieved
during 2004 by scaling the direct channel
model, so successfully pioneered by
Movilisto in Spain, into all iTouch territories.
Strategy for growth
Our overriding aim is to facilitate and
maximise the number of transactions
generated by mobile users through the
iTouch global offering. This will be
achievable through a strategy for growth
underpinned by five key themes:
Extending our distribution into
new territories
In 2004, we launched the direct channel
model in five new territories – Morocco,
Australia, France, Romania and Poland –
taking the total to nine countries before
our acquisition of Jippii Mobile
Entertainment in September. Jippii extends
our distribution to 25 markets, adding
Russia, Switzerland, Belgium and a
number of Eastern European territories. 
In addition, iTouch will pursue further
corporate activity to complement and
enhance our position both in Europe and
in developing markets further afield
such as India, China and South America
where handset penetration is growing
significantly.
Developing the direct channel model
Our direct channel model utilises direct
response television and print advertising
to drive the end user purchase of mobile
content. In 2005, we will invest in
strengthening the Jippii web and mobile
portal offerings as an extension of this
strategy to more firmly establish our own
marketing channels. The web portal, which
is currently live in 21 countries and
localised in 14 languages, allows us to
showcase our wide range of mobile
products. 
Establishing a global youth portal
Jippii is being introduced as the Group’s
youth brand in 2005 to leverage the
advertising spend and encourage users to
regularly visit the community driven web
portal. Our goal is to expand further Jippii’s
market position as one of the leading
youth portals and extend it into new
territories with partners where we do not
already have a presence.
Enhancing our product offering
Although the majority of iTouch’s revenues
in 2004 were still generated from 2G
products and services, we already have
an extensive range of products compatible
with 2.5G handsets. In 2005, we expect
to make rapid progress in providing the
next generation of products and services
to scale into iTouch territories. We will pay
particular attention to key product verticals
such as music, games, gambling, chat
and dating.
Extending our content relationships
During the year, deals were signed with
Dreamworks for Shrek 2, Eurofun for
Shark Tale, Elkware and Mobile2Win for
Java games and Zingy for original hip hop
A-list voice tones. Our customers can now
access an extensive database of items. 
This year we will be looking to build on 
our core relationships and seek out 
2005 will see strong growth in multimedia
data services as we reach critical mass in 
2.5G handset penetration and operators begin
to push 3G services.

original content to leverage our extensive
distribution network.
Staff dedication and commitment
Where 2003 was a year of transformation,
2004 has seen iTouch deliver its maiden
year of profitability. This is testament to the
dedication and commitment of our staff
and, on behalf of myself and the Board,
I would like to thank them all.
Outlook
The mobile data market is set to grow
exponentially in the next few years driven
by penetration of 2.5G handsets and the
launch of 3G. 
By 2008, mobile gaming alone is forecast
to generate $8.4bn, whilst ringtones and 
iTouch licenses content and creates
propositions that we then distribute 
to mobile users by marketing directly 
to end users (e.g. using the shortcode
8181 in the UK), via operator portals 
(e.g. Vodafone Live), or via affiliate
partners (e.g. Siemens).

Big Brother
iTouch managed the IVR phone voting for the 5th Big
Brother series with calls soaring to 7.5 million telephone
votes representing a 10% increase on the previous year.
iTouch also collated the vote totals from the various
sources during the shows. The record for the number of
calls taken in one minute (previously held by iTouch for
Pop Idol 2003) was broken on the final night when the
new record was set at 153,000. Siemens
Jippii signed a mobile entertainment solutions agreement with
Siemens Communications to deliver mobile entertainment
content to its handset owners. Siemens’ handset owners gain
access to Jippii’s mobile content such as monophonic and
polyphonic ringtones, black and white logos, colour wallpapers,
Java-games as well as Siemens exclusive content. The content 
is available in 16 European countries including the UK, 
Germany, Spain and Russia and is accessed via the Siemens
Communications web-sites, WAP-sites and embedded
applications in new Siemens mobile phones.
Pepsi 
Jippii ran an ‘on pack’ promotion on over 7 million Pepsi
bottles in Russia. Customers were able to send a text
message and receive a free ringtone and a Pepsi logo for
their phone. The Jippii logo appeared on all 7 million
bottles, thus contributing to the Jippii brand building
campaign at no cost. New CRM data was provided to
Pepsi based on the time of day that people drink 
Pepsi, determined from time of downloads.
Russia Review of the year
Shrek 2 
iTouch signed an important global licensing and
distribution agreement with Eurofun Mobile
Entertainment Channels and Dreamworks for
Shrek 2. iTouch distributes Shrek 2 mobile phone
content through its own direct channels in UK,
Spain, Ireland, Portugal and South Africa.
Content includes games, wallpapers, SMS
greetings and ringtones. This agreement follows
the success of iTouch’s contract with Universal

Zone4Play 
iTouch signed an agreement with Zone4Play, who
specialise in the development of interactive games
applications, to distribute its extensive database of
gaming, gambling and betting services to iTouch
customers. iTouch provide the latest technology platform
to distribute the products directly to its customers through
its direct mobile channel model and also via its media,
telco and broadcast partners in the UK.
Zone4Play’s extensive range of products include betting
services such as ‘fixed odd’ games, casino games (poker,
blackjack and roulette), a variety of lottery services, instant
tickets, sports book and horse racing services. These
products will be promoted through the traditional iTouch
marketing channels such as web portals and direct
response television advertisements. 
Jippii Portal
iTouch gained ownership of  the Jippii youth
portal through the acquisition in August 2004.
The portal is designed to provide teenagers
with a ‘cool place’ to visit online where 
they can meet likeminded users, chat with
each other and play online games. The 
portal is visited by up to 4.3 million visitors
monthly and is live in 21 countries and
localised in 14 languages. Visitors play
up to 30 million games against each other
online every month.

Finland Ladbrokes
iTouch UK launched a new 10p/min racing
service with its long standing client, Ladbrokes,
a major UK betting group. The new service
replaced the previous 60p/min premium rate
service which offered customers racing
commentary on horses and greyhounds.  
In addition to the commentary, the 10p/min
service provides improved interactivity
allowing customers to out dial directly to the
Ladbrokes call centre for bet placement.

Review of the year
10 The impact of 3G 
Over the next few years, increased activity in 
the 3G services market is envisaged following
3G roll-outs from Vodafone, Orange and
3 networks in the UK. 3G technology allows users
to download data at a faster rate than before
enabling customers to access video calls, full track
music downloads and enhanced gaming products.
It is iTouch’s intention to prepare for 3G by building
capability in new product verticals such as music
and gaming.
Telstra Online SMS
iTouch Australia developed and managed Telstra’s corporate 
SMS messaging platform, Online SMS. The product allows Telstra
corporate customers to send and receive SMS messages to and
from their PC or email application, providing a low cost solution to
contact large volumes of recipients. This development has assisted
the growth of the product to a user base of 20,000 corporate users,
generating over 700,000 messages per month. Development of a
consumer version is near completion which will allow customers
access to SMS from their home PC.

Australia Financial Review
12
Set out below is the financial review
of iTouch’s results for the year to
31 December 2004. The purpose of
this review is to outline key aspects of
the Group’s performance over the last
year and its financial position.
Turnover
Revenue in 2004 increased 29% to
£78.0m from £60.3m in 2003. 
Growth in the European operations has
been driven by a full year of Movilisto
together with four months of Jippii and
the roll-out of the direct channel model
into other territories. Revenue in this
segment increased 23% to £57.7m from
£46.8m. Jippii contributed £3.4m in
turnover since acquisition.
In the Rest of the World segment growth
has been driven by the launch of the direct
channel model in Australia and South
Africa. Revenues have increased by 51%
in the year to £20.4m.
The success of the direct channel model
within our single business segment resulted
in consumer data revenues growing 229%
from £14.8m in 2003 to £48.6m in 2004.
Consumer data comprises information,
entertainment and messaging products
provided to consumers via iTouch brands
and affiliate partners. Other data revenues
declined slightly from £14.4m to £14.2m
whilst IVR revenues decreased from
£31.1m to £15.2m reflecting our strategy
of focusing on consumer data.
Gross margin
Gross margin has improved from 43% in
2003 to 57% in 2004 as a result of the
increased proportion of higher margin
consumer data revenues arising from the
direct channel model. We expect further
progression in gross margin as the revenue
mix evolves in line with our strategy.
Marketing costs
The Group continues to invest in its brands
and market position with selling expenses
increasing to £18.4m in 2004 from £7.3m
in 2003. Advertising comprised 24% of
revenue in 2004 compared to 12% in 2003.
Administrative costs
General administration costs were
down 4% on the prior year, despite
the acquisitions of Movilisto and Jippii, as
the Group continues to make significant
efficiencies in its cost base. The Group is
currently integrating Jippii and reviewing
a number of other areas where further
efficiencies can be made. 
EBITDA 
EBITDA profit (before exceptionals) of
£8.1m was a significant improvement
on the loss of £0.1m in 2003. This was
despite significant investment in launches
into new territories and in the territories
acquired with Jippii as we continue to roll
-out our direct channel model. Investment
in new territories has been considerable,
especially in France and Russia, which are
expected to be areas of strong growth in
future years. The Russian team is currently
increasing the brand awareness of Jippii
and testing new marketing channels in the
region. Organic launches into territories
such as France and Poland generated
£1.9m in revenues but incurred a total
loss of £0.4m in the year. Excluding France,
Poland, Jippii and the disposal of the iTBM
business (note 30), the Group EBITDA
(before exceptionals) was £9.2m,
amargin of 13%.
iTouch has achieved its maiden year
of positive EBITDA, Profit Before Tax
and Operating Cash Flow.

Exceptional and non-cash items
An impairment charge of £1.4m was 
made in the year against goodwill on the
disposed iTBM business (note 30). Other
exceptional items, totalling £0.6m, arose
due to restructuring of Jippii and the
Australian business after the introduction
of the direct channel model and deal costs
for aborted transactions.
Goodwill amortisation increased 5%
to £3.5m in 2004 due to a full year
of Movilisto and four months of Jippii
amortisation offset by a reduction due
to the impairment charge taken at the
end of 2003.
Depreciation and loss on disposal reduced
to £1.1m in 2004 from £1.9m in 2003
reflecting consolidation of the Group’s data
platforms and leverage of the technology
infrastructure.
Profit before tax 
The Group achieved a maiden profit before
tax of £1.8m improving from a loss of
£13.5m in 2003. After removing exceptional
items the profit increased to £3.7m in
2004 from a loss of £4.9m in 2003.
Net interest income in the Group has
decreased in the year to £0.2m. This is
due to lower average cash holdings in
2004 and a full year of invoice discounting
costs in Movilisto, where debtor payment
terms are particularly long.
Taxation
Tax has increased to £1.9m from £1.6m
in 2003, largely due to good profitability
in Spain offset by the cost of new territory
launches. Taxation elsewhere in the Group
is minimal due to utilisation of brought
forward losses.
Earnings/(Loss) per share
The group recorded a negligible loss
per share in 2004 an improvement from
(4.5p) in 2003. The adjusted earnings per
share from continuing operations, before
depreciation, amortisation, share incentive
scheme charge, business to be disposed
and exceptional items was 1.7p, up 2.2p
from a loss of (0.5p) in 2003.
Cash flows
Cash at 31 December 2004 was £13.1m,
down from £16.3m at the beginning of
the year, due largely to acquisitions.
The Group achieved its first full year of
operating cash inflows of £3.5m (2003:
outflow of £2.6m). Taxation payments
were £2.3m (2003: £2.8m) and capital
expenditure was £0.9m (2003: £0.9m).
Net outflow relating to acquisitions was
£9.5m (2003: £6.5m) which included
Jippii and a small amount paid in relation
to the Movilisto transaction.
A share placing to For-side.com raised a
net £5.3m and was used to partially fund
the Jippii acquisition. Interest receipts fell
to £0.2m from £0.4m in 2003.
Corporate activity
On 4 August 2004, For-Side.com made
a strategic investment of £5.3 million in
iTouch, subscribing for 18.25 million shares
at 29p each, representing 4.5% of the
Company’s enlarged share capital. As
noted above, the funds were used to
acquire Jippii.
On 31 August 2004, iTouch completed the
acquisition of Jippii Mobile Entertainment
Oy. Initial consideration was £8.0m and
fees relating to the acquisition, including
Finnish transfer tax, totalled £1.3m. Net
assets, after revaluations and alignment 
of accounting policies, totalled £0.4m
resulting in goodwill of £8.9m, which
is being amortised over 10 years.
Treasury Policy
Foreign currency
As a large proportion of the Group’s
operations are outside of the UK,
translation of results and net assets into
Sterling could have a significant effect on
the Group’s reported results and balance
sheet. The main exposures are to the Euro,
South African Rand, Australian Dollar,
United States Dollar, Russian Rouble and
the New Zealand Dollar. The Group does
not externally hedge this exposure as it is
an accounting rather than cash exposure.
However, it does mitigate the risk by
ensuring inter-company trading balances
are settled regularly and also funding
balances are treated as hedges against
net investment wherever possible.
Investment in cash
The Group has an agreed policy for the
investment of surplus cash. The majority
of funds are held in the UK in Sterling or
in Spain in Euros. All overseas balances are
held in approved local banks. Investments
may be made, subject to agreed limits, in
bank deposits, gilts, certificates of deposit
and cash management funds. The maturity
profile of investments is managed taking
into account the Group’s future cash
requirements. The Group does not
undertake speculative transactions.

The sale of iTouch Business Mobility
(‘iTBM’) was signed on 14 March 2005.

The Directors present their report and audited financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Principal activities
iTouch plc (’the Company’) and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’)
primarily provide information, entertainment and messaging
services to customers via short message services and premium
rate telephone calls.
The Group operates in 25 countries across the world, with
principal focus on Europe.
During the year the Company purchased the Jippii group of
companies operating in 20 countries in Europe. The acquisition
increased the Group’s scale, reach and volume of transactions
(see note 22).
A more detailed review of the business of the Group and an
indication of likely future developments are contained in the
Chairman’s Statement on page 2, the Chief Executive’s Statement
on pages 4 and 5 and the Financial Review on pages 12 and 13.
Results and dividends 
The consolidated profit and loss account is set out on page 25
of the financial statements. The loss for the year was £0.2m
(2003: £15.1m).
The Directors do not propose a dividend for the year (2003: £nil).
Impact of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
The Company, in conjunction with external advisors, is undertaking
a review of the impact that the adoption of IFRS will have on its
results. This includes the training of key personnel and updating
of the internal financial systems. As the review is not yet
complete, it is not possible to quantify the differences.

The names of the Directors at the date of this report, together
with their biographical details, are set out on page 14. The
interests of Directors in the Ordinary Shares of the Company
and share options are given in the Remuneration Report on

year other than Roland Denning who was appointed as a Director
on 14 May 2004. Avi Azulai resigned on 14 March 2005.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Roland Denning

The number of days outstanding between receipt of invoices and
date of payment, calculated by reference to the amount owed
to trade creditors at 31 December 2004 as a proportion of the
amounts invoiced by suppliers during the period, was 70 days
(2003: 79 days) in aggregate for the Group, and 12 days
(2003: 30 days) for the Company.
Environmental policy
The Group is aware that it impacts the environment both directly
through the consumption of energy and other resources used
throughout its business operations and indirectly through its
supply chain. However, where the Group can, it acts responsibly
and is aware of its obligations at all times. 
The key areas relevant to the Group include electronic
communication and recycling. Every Group employee is
connected via email and all local operating offices must comply
with local environmental regulations. The Group aims to reduce
its effect on the environment by reducing waste and using energy
more efficiently. Promotion of recycling programmes are
encouraged and will be developed further in the future.
Employee policy and involvement
The Group encourages employee involvement in the business
at all levels with the human capital of iTouch being the key to
continuing success. Managers are remunerated according to
results wherever possible.
Employees are kept informed of issues affecting the Group
through formal and informal meetings. Members of the
management team regularly visit all Group locations and discuss
matters of current interest and concern with employees.
A monthly newsletter, highlighting key operational achievements,
is produced and sent to all employees. Staff are updated on the
Group’s financial results and operational highlights every quarter.
It is the Group’s policy to consider fully application for employment
from disabled people and to assist with their training and career
development, having regard to particular aptitudes and abilities.
Every endeavour is made to find suitable alternative employment
and to re-train any employee who becomes disabled while
serving the Group.
Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have indicated their willingness to
continue in office and a resolution reappointing them as auditors
and authorising the Directors to determine their remuneration will
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Notice describing the ordinary and special business to be
dealt with at the Company’s Annual General Meeting to be held
on 13 May 2005 is set out at the end of this Annual Report on
page 50. 
The special business of the meeting includes Resolution 7 to
receive and adopt the Report of the Remuneration Committee
and Resolution 8 to authorise Directors to allot pursuant to
Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 (‘the Act’) up to
135,850,459 shares amounting to £1,358,504.59 of share capital
representing one third of the Company’s issued ordinary share
capital as at 29 March 2005. The Directors have no present
intention to exercise this authority to allot shares. If approved, this
authority will expire at the earlier of the conclusion of the next
Annual General Meeting when the Directors intend to seek
renewal of the authority or 12 August 2006.
Resolution 9 is a special resolution and refers to the proposed
disapplication of shareholders’ pre-emption rights in the instance
of allotments for cash of up to 20,377,569 shares being
£203,775.69 of share capital representing 5% of the issued
ordinary share capital at 29 March 2004. Resolution 9 also
enables the Company, in the event of a rights issue or open offer,
to meet certain practical difficulties which may arise in connection
with fractional entitlements or in respect of overseas shareholders
as a result of local laws and which prevent shares from being
issued strictly pro rata. If approved, the authority will expire at
the conclusion of the earlier of the next Annual General Meeting
when the Directors intend to seek renewal of the authority or
12 August 2006.
Details of Proxy voting will be disclosed at the AGM.

This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced statutory
requirements for the disclosure of Directors’ remuneration in
respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002. The
Report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority. As required by the Regulations,
a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual
General Meeting.
The Regulations require the Auditors to report to the Company’s
members on the ‘auditable part’ (indicated *) of this Report and
to state, in their opinion, that part of the Report has been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as
amended by the Regulations).
Membership and role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for making
recommendations to the Board on the remuneration of Executive
Directors. The Remuneration Committee of the Board consists
only of independent Non-Executive Directors of the Company.
The Committee is chaired by Roger Parry. The other members
during the year were David Sculley and Christopher Rowlands.
None of the members of the Committee has any personal
financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to
be decided by the Committee.
Remuneration policy
The general policy of the Committee is to ensure that the
remuneration aligns the interests of management and shareholders.
The objectives of the executive remuneration programme are to
provide competitive rewards, which will attract and retain high
calibre management and which reflect individual responsibilities
and experience; and to provide incentive arrangements which
are subject to challenging performance targets that reflect the
Company’s objectives and which motivate executives to focus
on both annual and longer-term performance.
When appropriate, the Remuneration Committee invites the
views of the Executive Directors and will commission reports
from expert remuneration consultants. No material external
advice was sought in 2004. The results of market surveys and
other analyses from external sources are also made available
to the Remuneration Committee, which has resolved to review
its policy with the Board on a regular basis to ensure it continues
to meet the Company’s requirements and to comply with
best practice.
Directors’ remuneration
The main components of the Executive Directors’ remuneration are:
Salaries and benefits
The base salaries are reviewed annually to take into account
the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the
individuals and information obtained from published market data
on the salary rates for similar positions. Executive Directors also
receive relocation and overseas living allowances. No pension or
other benefits are provided.
Bonuses
All senior executives are eligible for an annual performance-
related bonus. The bonus is designed to provide an incentive to
achieve and exceed targets set by the Board and to ensure that
annual remuneration is aligned to the Group’s performance.
Wayne Pitout, Avi Azulai and Michael Le Houx were entitled to
receive an annual targeted bonus dependent upon the performance
of the Company in the year to 31 December 2004. The bonus
for 2004 was limited to 100% of base salary and was payable on
achievement of an EBITDA target. The structure was that 40% of
the bonus would be by way of cash and 60% by way of share
options. As the Company did not meet the target in the year to
31 December 2004, no bonuses were paid to any Director in
respect of 2004. However the Remuneration Committee did
approve a special bonus to Wayne Pitout and Michael Le Houx
of £25,000 each relating to the acquisition of Jippii Mobile
Entertainment Oy.
Remuneration Report Remuneration Report continued

Share options*
The Remuneration Committee believes that share ownership by
the Executive Directors increases the link between the interests
of the Company’s shareholders and the Directors.
In most cases, share options that are exercisable will vest at the
rate of 25% per annum. All grants post flotation are subject to a
performance condition approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Share options lapse on resignation.
The performance condition applicable to all Directors’ and
employees’ share options requires that the Company’s share
price should increase by the Harmonised Index of Consumer
Prices (‘HICP’) plus 10% each year before the options vest.
The Committee considers that a share price increase of HICP
plus 10% should be expected and that if, and only if, this is
achieved, the Executive Directors should have the option of
participating in the increase.
If the share price performance condition is met the composition
of each Director’s remuneration for 2004 from salary, benefits
and options granted will be as follows:
Non-performance Performance
related related
Wayne Pitout 89% 11%
Avi Azulai 100% 0%
Michael Le Houx 74% 26%
Roland Denning 100% 0%
Ivan Fallon 100% 0%
Brendan Hopkins 100% 0%
Gavin O’Reilly 100% 0%
Roger Parry 100% 0%
Christopher Rowlands 100% 0%
David Sculley 100% 0%
Non-Executive Directors*
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is established
by the Board of Directors as a whole and details of each
individual Non-Executive Director’s remuneration are included
in the table above. With the exception of Ivan Fallon, the Non-
Executive Directors do not participate in the Company’s share
option schemes. Details of Ivan Fallon’s participation are given
on page 19. Roland Denning was appointed as a Non-Executive
Director on 14 May 2004 and is paid £25,000 per annum.
The appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are on one year
terms, except for Gavin O’Reilly and Christopher Rowlands who
are on three year terms, and the terms of their engagement are
set out in letters of appointment which set out their duties and
responsibilities and confirm their remuneration. Each of these
appointments may be terminated at any time by the Company
without payment of compensation.

Service contracts*
Contracts of service are negotiated on an individual basis as part of the overall remuneration package and their length is inevitably
conditioned by external competitive pressures. For this reason, the contracts of the Directors may exceed the one year recommended
in the Combined Code.

Total Shareholder return on Company shares*
In the opinion of the Committee, the FTSE Media and Entertainment Index is the most appropriate index against which the total
shareholder return (TSR) of iTouch plc should be measured against because it is the sector in which iTouch plc trades and comprises
a mix of large as well as small capitalisation companies similar to iTouch plc.
Performance against this index since the Company’s Initial Public Offering in August 2000, is shown below:
Since listing on 20 August 2000, there has been a significant decline in the FTSE Media and Entertainment Index. In 2004, iTouch
performed slightly better than the index. This was largely due to the strengthening of the Group’s position as a leading European player.
Directors’ interests in the issued share capital of the Company*
The Directors at 31 December 2004 and their beneficial interests and those of their families in the share capital of the Company were

Introduction
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate
governance and throughout the year has complied with the
2003 FRC Combined Code (‘the Code’) with the exception of
Provision B.1.6 where the Board regards it as appropriate that
certain Directors have contractual arrangements in excess of one
year in order to meet external competitive pressures in attracting
senior executives of sufficient talent.  
This statement describes how the principles of good corporate
governance set out in the Code have been applied within
the Company.
Directors and Organisation
The Board consists of nine Directors comprising the Non-Executive
Chairman, who is responsible for running the Board, the Chief
Executive who has overall responsibility for running the Company’s
business, the Finance Director and six further Non-Executive
members. Details of their tenure are presented on page 19. 
Roland Denning was appointed to the Board on 14 May 2004
and Avi Azulai resigned from the Board on 14 March 2005.
Roland Denning, Christopher Rowlands, Roger Parry, David Sculley
are considered by the Board to be independent under the terms
of the Code. Roger Parry is the Senior Independent Non-Executive
Director. Ivan Fallon, Brendan Hopkins and Gavin O’Reilly are
members of the Board of Independent News & Media PLC, which
is a significant shareholder of the Company. Each Director is
required to retire at the Annual General Meeting following their
appointment and at the Annual General Meeting falling no later
than the third anniversary of their appointment or reappointment.
The Board, which met on seven occasions during 2004, provides
leadership and manages overall control of the Group’s affairs via
a schedule of matters reserved for its decision. These include
the approval of the annual budget, major capital expenditure,
significant acquisitions and disposals, risk management policies
and the approval of the financial statements. The Company
regularly reviews the need for an internal audit function. This was
last considered in March 2005. At present, the Directors believe
the existing control frame work, for which the Finance Director is
responsible, is sufficient for the Group.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary and independent professional advice, if
required, and receive appropriate training as necessary on an
ongoing basis. The Board is supplied in a timely manner with
information in a form and of a quality to enable it to discharge its
duties. The Board delegates certain of its responsibilities to Board
committees with clearly defined authority and written terms of
reference. The composition and function of these committees are
described below:
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises three Non-Executive Directors:
Christopher Rowlands as its Chairman and the other members
are Roger Parry and David Sculley. The Committee, which meets
at least four times a year, has terms of reference (available on the
Company’s website) covering the Company’s annual, interim and
quarterly reporting, and the auditor’s involvement in that process,
focusing particularly on compliance with legal requirements,
accounting standards and areas of internal control.
The Nomination Committee
The Committee is chaired by David Sculley and meets when
necessary to consider Board composition and Board appointments.
The other members are Brendan Hopkins and Ivan Fallon. It provides
a formal and transparent procedure for the appointment of new
Directors to the Board which was followed in the case of the
appointment of Roland Denning.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Roger Parry. Other
members are Christopher Rowlands and David Sculley. The
principal function of the Committee is to determine, on behalf of
the Board and shareholders, the Company’s policy for executive
remuneration and the remuneration packages of the Directors
and other senior executives. The Remuneration report can be
found on pages 17 to 20.
General Purposes Committee
The General Purposes Committee comprises any two Directors,
for the approval or otherwise of commercial contracts, share
option exercises, share allotments and matters relating to the
listing of shares. Copies of minutes of the General Purposes
Committee are made available to all Directors.
Corporate Governance Corporate Governance continued
22
Internal Control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the system of internal
control and also for reviewing its effectiveness. The Chief
Executive has day-to-day control over the Group’s operations
within the guidelines adopted by the Board. Whilst the internal
control system is designed to meet the risks to which the Group
is exposed, any system of internal control can provide only
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The business has defined targets, which are agreed by the Board
at the beginning of each fiscal year, against which performance
is monitored on a monthly basis. The Group’s management
operates a risk management process that identifies the key risks
facing the Group as well as the risks facing individual operating
units. This is overseen by senior management on behalf of the
Board. There is a continuous process for identifying, evaluating
and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. This has
been in place for the year under review and up to the date of
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts.
A programme of reviews by the management of iTouch plc takes
place annually to monitor compliance and to perform reviews
of control activities including, financial, operating, compliance
and risk management controls. The Chief Executive reviews the
results and then presents them to the Board on an annual basis.
This process is reviewed and strengthened as appropriate.
The Group has a comprehensive system of financial reporting
which includes an annual budget process and weekly, monthly,
quarterly, interim and annual reporting to enable the Group to
meet its public financial reporting requirements.
Relations with shareholders
The Directors place a high importance on maintaining good
relationships with shareholders and, via an Investor Relations
department, ensure that shareholders are kept informed of
significant Group developments. The Group holds briefing
meetings with its major institutional shareholders usually after
the quarterly, interim and preliminary results announcements
and the Directors welcome the opportunity to meet with private
investors at the Company’s Annual General Meeting. Analysts and
journalists are also invited to the financial results presentations.
Shareholders can access the Company’s financial statements
and other up-to-date information on iTouch via the Group’s
website www.itouchplc.com. The Directors are responsible for
maintenance and integrity of the website and the legislation in
the UK concerning the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Going concern
Based on the normal business planning and control procedures
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors continue to
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibility
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view
of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the
profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed; and 
• Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose, with reasonable accuracy, at any time the
financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for the systems
of internal financial controls and for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above
requirements in preparing the financial statements. 23
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the
consolidated profit and loss account, the consolidated balance
sheet, the Company’s balance sheet, the cash flow statement,
the statement of group total recognised gains and losses, the
reconciliation in total shareholders’ funds, accounting policies and
the related notes. We have also audited the disclosures required
by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained
in the Directors’ remuneration report (‘the auditable part’).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in
the statement of Directors' responsibilities. The Directors are also
responsible for preparing the Directors’ remuneration report. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the
auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United
Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for
and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration
report have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
Directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if
the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’
remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report
and consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the financial statements. The other information comprises only the
Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration
report, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s statement,
the Review of the year, the financial review and the corporate
governance statement.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003
FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements
on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s or Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements and the auditable part
of the Directors’ remuneration report. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by
the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the auditable part
of the Directors’ remuneration report are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of
the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group at 31 December 2004
and of the loss and cash flows of the Group for the year
then ended;
• the financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and 
• those parts of the Directors’ remuneration report required by
Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of iTouch plc Accounting Policies
24
These financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention, in accordance with applicable UK
accounting standards (including Financial Reporting Standard
No. 18 ‘Accounting Policies’) and the provisions of the Companies
Act 1985. A summary of the more important Group accounting
policies is set out below:
Revenue Recognition
Turnover primarily represents revenues generated from the sale of
information, entertainment and messaging services delivered to
customers via premium rate telephone calls and short message
services. The Group’s role in a transaction is that of an agent of
the fixed line and mobile network operators and therefore turnover
is recognised net of network operator deductions. The voice and
data revenues are recognised at the point of provision of service
to the customer. Turnover is stated net of value added tax.
Cost of sales primarily relate to royalties paid to the licensor of
content, content procurement and production, affiliate partner
profit shares and delivery costs.
Consolidation and equity accounting
The Group profit and loss account, Group balance sheet and
Group cash flow statement represent a consolidation of the
financial information of the parent Company and its subsidiary
undertakings and the Group’s share of results and net assets,
including the premium on acquisition of its joint ventures.
Where subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures
have been acquired or disposed of, the financial statements
include only the proportion of the results arising since the
dates of acquisition or up to the effective dates of disposal.
Goodwill
Goodwill, arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings and
interests in associates and joint ventures, represents the excess of
the fair value of the purchase consideration paid over the fair value
of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is written-off over two to ten
years by equal annual instalments, reflecting the estimated life of
the goodwill involved, subject to acceleration of write-off where
impairment is indicated. Impairment reviews are carried out at the
end of the first financial year after acquisition and, thereafter,
where there is any indication of impairment (note 9).
When deferred contingent consideration is payable on an acquisition,
the best estimate of the future liability is provided. The cash element
is discounted using the Government bond rate at the time of
acquisition. The share element is disclosed as shares to be issued.
Tangible assets
Tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes the cost of purchased fixed assets, direct labour and
directly attributable overheads. Depreciation is calculated in order
to write-off the cost of tangible assets over their estimated useful
lives by equal annual instalments, subject to acceleration of
write-off where impairment is indicated. The annual depreciation
rates are as follows:
Office equipment and software 3-5 years
Fixtures, fittings and other 3-10 years
Stock
Stocks principally relate to prepaid telecommunication cards held
for re-sale and are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net
realisable value.
Deferred taxation
Full provision is made for deferred tax liabilities arising from
timing differences in respect of transactions or events that result
in an obligation but have not reversed by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is not recognised where recoverability of that
asset is uncertain. Deferred tax liabilities and assets which are
recognised are not discounted.
Foreign currencies
Transactions designated in foreign currencies are translated into
sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities designated in foreign currencies
are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date with
the resulting profit or loss included in the result for the year. 
The balance sheets of foreign subsidiary undertakings, joint
ventures and associates are translated into sterling using the
closing rate method and profit and loss accounts are translated
using the average rate for the period. Exchange differences arising
from translation of the opening net investment together with the
difference between the profit and loss translated at the average
rate and the closing rate, net of related foreign currency financing,
are dealt with as adjustments to reserves. 
Operating leases
Operating leases and the rentals thereunder are charged to the
profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the periods
of the leases. 
Cash and liquid resources
Cash is defined as cash on hand together with deposits repayable
on demand. Deposits repayable on demand are defined as those
which can be withdrawn at any time and without penalty or where
a maturity or period of notice of not more than 24 hours has
been agreed. 
Liquid resources are defined as stores of value which are readily
convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying
amount without curtailing or disrupting the business. They primarily
consist of deposits held with a period of notice greater than 24 hours.
Share incentive scheme
The costs of awards to employees (including Directors), which
take the form of shares or rights to shares are recognised in the
profit and loss account over the period to which the employee’s
performance relates. The amount recognised is the difference
between the fair value of the shares at the date the award is
made to the participants in the scheme and the amounts of the
consideration the participants may be required to pay for the
shares. Any such costs recognised in the profit and loss account
are credited to Other Reserves on the balance sheet. 25

During the year, the Australian and Jippii business were restructured as the Group continues to roll out the direct channel model. The resulting cost of
redundancies and restructuring was £214,000 (2003: £1,218,000). A provision of £26,000 (2003: £1,078,000) was made during the year for onerous
leases of vacant properties following the Group property rationalisation programme started in 2003.
During the year, the Group entered into negotiations with, and largely completed due diligence on two potential acquisitions. The deals were not
completed and third party advisor fees of £189,000 (2003: £244,000) have been treated as exceptional.
A legal dispute was settled with a third party for £123,000 (2003: £nil).

(b) Factors affecting current tax charge for the year
Tax charge for the year is higher (2003: higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK (30%). The difference is explained below:

Tax (charge)/credit at 30% (2003: 30%) (529) 4,043
Effects of: 
– Foreign tax at different rates (465) (249)
– Charges and expenses not deductible for tax purposes (primarily goodwill amortisation) (1,424) (2,567)
– Overstatement in prior years 235 –
– Depreciation in excess of capital allowances (106) (328)
– Timing differences (3) (145)
– Tax charge on overseas income (12) (35)
– Losses utilised/(not utilised) in year 384 (2,368)
(1,920) (1,649)
(c) Provision for deferred tax
No deferred tax asset was recognised at 31 December 2004 (2003: £nil) on the basis that there is insufficient evidence of suitable taxable profits from
which the future reversal of the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
2004 2003

Accelerated capital allowances (537) (745)
Short term timing differences (368) (598)
Tax losses carried forward (9,424) (9,895)
(10,329) (11,238)
(d) Factors that may affect the future tax charge
The Group has significant tax losses, which will reduce tax payments in future years.
6. Segmental report
The Group principally has operations in Europe and the Rest of the world and operations are attributable to one principal activity, the provision of
information, entertainment and messaging services via fixed line and mobile phones. The segmental analysis has been changed from prior years as the
Directors believe this more fairly reflects the operation of the business. The comparative numbers for 2003 have been restated.
The following is an analysis of the Group’s results by geographical market:
Operating profit/
(loss) before
Turnover exceptional charge Net assets/(liabilities)
2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003
£000 £000 £000 £000 £000 £000

Other unallocated net assets 13,211 12,880
78,042 60,371 1,565 (13,957) 43,246 39,833
Turnover by origin has been shown above and does not differ materially from turnover by destination. Turnover relates to external customers. 33
6. Segmental report continued
Goodwill and other intangible assets have not been analysed by market because the Directors consider that they relate to the development of the
business as a whole (including the development of new markets and products) and hence are not specific to particular markets or products.
Other unallocated net assets consist mainly of cash at bank and in hand and assets (net of liabilities) of non-operating Group undertakings.
The acquisition during the year has been in the Europe geographical segment. 
7. Earnings per share
Basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue
during the year.
The basic and fully diluted loss per share are the same because the Company is making losses, and accordingly, the exercise of options and shares
to be issued are anti-dilutive. 
The Group has also presented an adjusted earnings per share figure to exclude the impact of depreciation, share incentive scheme, amortisation,
business to be disposed and exceptional charges because, in the opinion of the Directors, it gives a better indication of the underlying performance of
the Group.
Reconciliation of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:
2004 2003
£000 £000
Loss attributable to shareholders (156) (15,127)
Depreciation and loss on disposal 1,141 1,911
Amortisation of goodwill (note 9) 3,454 3,285

In accordance with the principles of FRS 11 (Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill) the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its fixed assets.
The most recent review was undertaken at 31 December 2004. For continuing operations, it assessed whether the carrying value of Goodwill was
supported by the net present value of future cash flows in respect of the period over which the Goodwill is being amortised. The Directors expect that
revenue growth rates will increase in 2005 and thereafter significantly exceed the average gross domestic product growth rates and recent growth rates
as demand for mobile data services increases in a number of the key countries which the Group operates. Similarly, the Directors anticipate an
improvement in gross margins as data revenues grow. The discount rates used were based on a company specific pre-tax weighted average cost of
capital percentage of between 12.5% and 23.5%. In calculating the net present value there is considerable uncertainty as to the discounted future cash
flows. In assessing the future value of the Goodwill, assessments have been made using the best estimates available and reflect growth rates projected
up to ten years into the future, the discount rate, the marketplace and take up and pricing of new data services. The actual outcome is uncertain and
these estimates may change over time as subsequent changes in the mobile and fixed line telecommunications industry (including advances in
technology, changes in media relationships, new industry regulations and changes in the performance of our business as a result of competitive pressure
or otherwise), may in the future shorten the estimated useful economic life of the Goodwill or result in the further write-down of a portion of this asset.
For the operation disposed after the year end (note 30) the carrying value of Goodwill was assessed against net sale proceeds. Based on the review
performed, an impairment charge of £1.4m (2003: £6.1m) has been recorded. The current year impairment relates to the disposed business (note 30).

Vacant properties
The Group’s vacant leasehold properties comprised unused office space in the United Kingdom, Australia, Spain and South Africa. Full provision has been
made for the residual lease commitments, together with other outgoings for the remaining period of the leases. The remaining period of these leases is
shown in note 25. The lease in South Africa expired in 2004. It is expected that only one office space in the United Kingdom will be sub-let and the
expected rental received has been deducted from the provision.
Restructuring
The restructuring of the Group is detailed in note 3. The provision is expected to be fully utilised in 2005.
Deferred consideration
The total provision for cash deferred consideration is £nil (2003: £1,865,000), including an amount of £nil (2003: £185,000) payable within one year
(note 13). This represents the Directors’ best estimate of the deferred consideration payable in respect of the acquisitions of Movilisto in 2003 and Jippii
in 2004.
Under the terms of the Movilisto acquisition, the maximum deferred consideration is €25.0m subject to the achievement of certain EBIT targets. 
At 31 December 2004, total consideration of £28,625,000 has been recognised.
Under the terms of the Jippii acquisition the maximum deferred consideration is €18.0m subject to the achievement of certain EBITDA targets. 
At 31 December 2004 total consideration of £9,300,000 has been recognised.
Deferred consideration not recognised is shown in note 26.
Company
The provision for estimated deferred consideration recognised by the Company is £nil (2003: £1,680,000). Movements in this provision are the same as
for the Group above.

to a return of their nominal value after the holders of ordinary shares of 1p have been paid in full and no right to vote at General Meetings of the 
Company. Due to the limitation on distribution the deferred shares are considered non-equity. The deferred shares in issue were cancelled at 
an EGM on 14 May 2004.
On 3 March 2004, 1,621,660 1p ordinary shares were allotted in part settlement of the deferred consideration relating to the acquisition of Holliday
Group Limited.

– Related costs of acquisition 1,273
9,300
The book value of the asset and liabilities have been taken from the management accounts of Jippii at 31 August 2004 at the actual exchange rates 
on that date. The fair value adjustments contain some provisional amounts, as indicated below, which will be finalised in the 2005 financial statements.
The revaluation of fixed assets relate principally to the write-off of redundant assets.
Revaluations of debtors reflects principally a revision to the bad debt provision in respect of a loan to a third party.
A provisional revaluation adjustment has been made to creditors to reflect potential tax liabilities in a number of territories which are currently being
resolved. 
The fair value adjustment for alignment of accounting policies reflects the restatement of assets and liabilities in accordance with the Group’s policies
including: the removal of capitalised formation expenses and brand names (£59,000), adjustment of the bad debt provision (£8,000) and recognising
audit fees and other liabilities on an accruals basis (£52,000).
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, the goodwill arising on the acquisition is being amortised over 10 years.
In the financial year to 31 December 2003, Jippii made a profit after tax and minority interest of £492,000. Jippii’s management accounts show from 
31 December 2003 to the date of acquisition revenue of £4,168,000, an operating loss of £3,000, a profit before tax of £40,000 and a loss after tax 
of £47,000. There are no other recognised gains or losses from 31 December 2003 to date of acquisition other than those disclosed above.
Since acquisition, Jippii has contributed an outflow of £652,000 to the operating cash flows of the Group, paid £65,000 of taxation, received £1,000
in interest and purchased £50,000 of fixed assets.
23. Disposal of joint venture
On 2 July 2003, the Company sold its 50% in iTouch Israel Limited to the other joint venture partner for a nominal sum. This resulted in a net gain 
of £103,000 arising from a write-back, by the Group, of its share of iTouch Israel’s net liabilities.

29. Material shareholders, subsidiary undertakings, joint venture and associate undertaking
On 25 July 2000, the Company and Independent entered into a Relationship Agreement which governs the ongoing relationship between the Company
and Independent in order to ensure that the Company is able to operate independently of Independent following flotation in August 2000, given that
Independent will continue to be a controlling shareholder of the Company. Under the Relationship Agreement, Independent has agreed, inter alia, that for
so long as it holds 30% or more of the Company’s issued voting share capital, it will procure that, so far as it is reasonably able, not more than one-third 
of all Directors are appointed by Independent and two-thirds of the Executive Directors must be autonomous of Independent, except for their executive
directorships of the Company.
As at 31 December 2004, iTouch plc was the smallest and largest group for which consolidated financial statements have been prepared.
Details of the Group and its principal subsidiaries as at 31 December 2004 are set out below:

The Company has guaranteed the liabilities of InTouch Technologies Limited for the purpose of Section 17 of the Irish Companies (Amendment) Act 
1986 (‘the Act’) and as a result the subsidiary has been exempted from filing provisions of Section 7 of the Act. 46
30. Subsequent events
The Group agreed to dispose the trade and assets of iTouch Business Mobility (‘iTBM’) to Blackbay Limited (‘Blackbay’), a company beneficially owned by
Avi Azulai, on 14 March 2005. The disposal was made on an unconditional basis, however, in order to accord with certain provisions under New Zealand
law, the completion of the transaction will not take place until mid-April 2005. The disposal will stop the consolidation of further losses from the business
and has no effect on core operations.  
The consideration was £1.1m of loan notes which are due to be repaid by Blackbay over the next 5 years. The loan notes bear an interest rate of 4.75% 
in year one rising to 7.75% in year five. The loan notes will be repaid in 6 equal instalments every 6 months, from the third year. In the event that Blackbay
receives any equity funding from a third party then Blackbay is obliged to use a sum equivalent to 50% of any such funding to pay down the loan notes.
The loan notes become repayable on a disposal of Blackbay by its current owners. Prior to completion iTouch and Avi Azulai will each contribute up to
£200,000 in funding to Blackbay. 
In calculating the carrying value of the loan notes the Directors have used the best estimates of the future cashflows of Blackbay. These are inevitably
subject to risks and uncertainties because they relate to future events.
The assets and liabilities to be disposed totalled £1.0m. As at 31 December 2004, iTBM owed the iTouch Group of companies £0.1m.
During 2004, £1.4m of goodwill was impaired in relation to this business (note 9).
The requirements of Financial Reporting Standard No. 3 (‘FRS 3’) do not permit the disposal of iTBM to be classified as a discontinued operation in 2004.
Therefore, the analysis below provides additional information regarding the disposal. Continuing operations can be further analysed as follows:

Revenue EBITDA(i) profit/(loss)(ii)
2004 £000 £000 £000
Business to be disposed – iTBM 1,854 (321) (2,037)

Corporate Data
(4) ‘Corporate data users’ are defined as the total number, on the last day
of the month in question, of uniquely identifiable customers who had
subscribed to or used the service (whether on a fixed fee or per
message payment basis) or registered prepaid users with prepaid
messages remaining. Prepaid users are defined as customers who paid
a charge in advance for a fixed number of messages.
(5) ‘Messages’ are defined as the total number of billable messages.
Billable messages are the total number of messages sent by corporate
customers who subscribed to or used the service (whether on a fixed
fee or per message payment basis). 
(6) Corporate Data NFOD includes data on services provided to, in
conjunction with, or on behalf of, third party companies.

Mobility solution or received related consultancy or services, or
purchased relevant hardware, and who are billable in the month,

NFOD for the three months concerned divided by three, even when
a service in a particular territory started only in the second or third
month of that quarter. This has the effect of reducing the ‘monthly
average’ figure for that quarter with a consequential impact on
dependent percentage calculations.
Testing
(12) Voice and Data recorded traffic may include some minor activity
generated by testing and monitoring of services.

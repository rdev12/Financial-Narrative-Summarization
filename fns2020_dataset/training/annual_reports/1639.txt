Leadership through 
progression
AVEVA maintains its leadership by continually delivering new technologies that provide 
ever-increasing business value across the entire project lifecycle. Many of these developments 
are carried out in collaboration with AVEVA’s customers, focusing on real needs, practical 
working methods and measurable benefits.
Analysing the structural 
strength and vibration 
characteristics of a complex 
ship structure is a highly 
skilled and lengthy 
process that is often 
a critical-path activity.
To solve this problem, AVEVA 
worked with TKMS Blohm + 
Voss Nordseewerke (BVN) 
and three other leading 
German shipbuilders and 
consultants to specify and 
develop an efficient link 
between AVEVA Marine and 
third-party Finite Element 
Analysis (FEA) programs. 
The result was AVEVA Hull 
Finite Element Modeller, 
released in January 2010 
and already proven to deliver 
substantial reductions in time 
and cost while enabling 
more efficient design of 
more sophisticated vessels.
Collaborative development shortens the ship structural 
design cycle
TKMS BVN
Rafael Doig, Research & Development Department:
“Using this new tool for the analysis of a frigate, we halved 
the time needed for the whole Finite Element Analysis of the 
vessel. We expect to save from now on about 960 hours in 
the structural assessment of a vessel.”

Collaboration 
through relationships
In today’s competitive engineering industries, success frequently comes from an ability to work 
in efficient collaborative relationships. It is now common to find businesses collaborating on one 
project while competing for another. AVEVA technology enables collaborative use of all types of 
project information, so that businesses can compete on innovation and their core competencies.
JRI Ingeniería raises the benchmark in minerals processing
Large-scale minerals 
projects create considerable 
engineering challenges, 
not least because they 
often span great distances 
and complex topography. 
Chilean mining engineering 
company JRI Ingeniería has 
put itself in a leadership 
position by its innovative use 
of AVEVA Plant solutions.
JRI regards AVEVA as an 
important business partner 
for its close technical support, 
which has enabled JRI to 
train engineers ‘on-demand’ 
to meet its specific industry 
needs. JRI also developed 
an innovative means of 
mapping and integrating 
complex site topography by 
means of aerial survey data 
converted into PDMS data.
JRI
Mario Gonzalez, Chief of Integral Design Area:
“This is a real innovation for JRI. No other applications have 
given us this level of business value. We expect our continuing 
close relationship with AVEVA will enable us to deliver even 
more impressive projects in the future.”

>> Highlights
  Revenue for the year amounted to £148.3 million 
(2009 – £164.0 million). 
 The Group’s balance sheet continued to strengthen. 
  The Board is recommending a final dividend of 13.9 pence.
   Our staff remained highly focused and professional and 
have contributed to our solid performance during the year.
I am pleased to report on another set of solid results for 
AVEVA for the year ended 31 March 2010. Good levels of 
revenue and profits have been achieved in difficult world 
economic conditions.
Key financials
Revenue for the year amounted to £148.3 million 
(2009 – £164.0 million). The performance across all our 
regions was impacted by recent economic uncertainty 
and, as anticipated, this resulted in a reduction in new 
licence sales which was particularly pronounced in the 
Marine market in Asia. However, recurring revenue 
increased by 9% to £102.7 million (2009 – £94.2 million) 
and this, coupled with a fall in initial fees to £35.1 million 
(2009 – £57.7 million), has meant that recurring 
revenue as a proportion of total revenue increased 
to 69% (2009 – 57%).
Following the restructuring programme undertaken 
in the early part of the year, the Group has remained 
well positioned to respond to market conditions whilst 
maintaining the appropriate level of investment for the 
longer term. As part of the restructuring, the Group 
achieved annualised cost savings of approximately 
£5.0 million which helped to maintain solid operating 
margins that the Group has historically achieved. 
Operating margins were 33% for the year (2009 – 35%).
Adjusted profit before tax, amortisation, share-based 
payments, restructuring costs and fair value of forward 
foreign exchange contracts amounted to £50.7 million 
(2009 – £66.4 million). Adjusted basic earnings per share 
amounted to 50.92 pence (2009 – 69.99 pence), a decrease 
of 27%. Profit before tax amounted to £49.6 million 
(2009 – £59.2 million) and basic earnings per share 
were 49.36 pence (2009 – 62.27 pence).

Annual report 2010
Directors’ report
The Group’s balance sheet continued to strengthen 
during the period as the Group’s cash, including treasury 
deposits which comprise bank deposits with a maturity 
date of up to six months, increased by 19% to £149.7 million 
(2009 – £126.2 million), once again reflecting the strong 
conversion of profits into cash flow. 
Dividend
Following a number of years of high levels of profitability 
and cash generation the Board has reviewed the existing 
level of dividend payout and has decided to increase it 
from what it now considers to be a relatively low base. 
The Board is therefore recommending a final dividend 
of 13.9 pence (2009 – 6.5 pence). Combined with the 
interim dividend of 3.0 pence (2009 – 2.86 pence) this 
gives a full year dividend of 16.9 pence (2009 – 9.36 pence), 
an increase of 81%. The rebased dividend better reflects 
the established nature of our business and the strength 
and stability of our cash flows without impinging materially 
on our ability to continue to invest and grow the business.
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, 
the final dividend will be paid on 30 July 2010 to 
shareholders on the register on 25 June 2010.
People
Our people remain the principal foundation of our 
success and this continues to be one of our market 
differentiators. Our staff are highly skilled and dedicated 
to keeping the AVEVA brand synonymous with quality 
and delivery. The past twelve months have presented a 
number of challenges for the Group and its employees. 
The global economic slowdown and the subsequent 
restructuring programme created both business and 
personal challenges for many of our staff. Throughout 
this period our staff remained highly focused and 
professional and have contributed to our solid 
performance during the year, whilst building a strong 
base from which we can continue to both grow the business 
and maintain our first class reputation. On behalf of the 
Board I wish to thank all of our people for their hard 
work, commitment and contribution over this year to 
the success of the Group.
As announced earlier in May 2010, after eleven years 
of contribution to the Group, David Mann will retire from 
his role as Non-Executive Director of the Company at the 
Annual General Meeting in July of this year. I would like 
to take this opportunity to thank David for both his 
personal contribution and his help in developing the 
Group and the Board over his tenure.
I would also like to welcome Hervé Couturier who joined 
the Board in April 2010. Hervé’s experience, in particular 
at SAP AG, will no doubt prove invaluable as AVEVA continues 
to develop its products and solutions for the markets in 
which it operates.
Outlook
Despite the challenges of 2009, we have continued 
with the development of the business through product 
innovation and securing growth in new markets such as 
the CIS and Brazil. We see growth opportunities in each 
of our vertical end markets. 
The key drivers for growth remain in the Power and Oil 
and Gas markets where projects in new regions and more 
complex designs are likely to see new customer wins and 
the expansion of existing relationships. Although the 
traditional Marine market looks set to be slow for some 
time, emerging countries that are investing to develop 
local capacity afford some opportunities, as does 
offering new product functionality to existing customers. 
AVEVA NET remains a strong focus for the business as a 
growing customer base accepts the technology solution 
for managing the large volumes of data in both new 
build and brownfield assets. 
Ongoing investments in products and delivery capabilities 
across AVEVA’s entire portfolio will continue but added 
emphasis on AVEVA NET delivery capacity will help to 
accelerate our position within the market and capitalise 
on the growing opportunity.
The Group’s market leading technologies and a global 
sales infrastructure capable of benefiting from both 
improving global and local trends, mean that AVEVA 
remains well placed to continue to build on its success 
over recent years.

Chief Executive
>> Highlights
  Overall performance of most industry segments served 
by AVEVA has been in line with our expectations. 
  AVEVA managed to secure important new contracts with 
Kyokuyo Shipyard in Japan and Samsung in Korea. 
  The quality of the AVEVA products and their suitability 
for the Oil and Gas projects in Brazil has positioned AVEVA 
for strong growth in this market.
  Research and Development continued to be a key priority 
during the year.
Overview
AVEVA continued its development despite the challenges 
of the world economy, delivering a good performance 
reflecting the fundamental strengths of the business. 
Our strong base of recurring revenue and good growth 
in developing markets helped to mitigate the impact of 
global economic uncertainty, particularly on initial fees 
in Marine. As a result, overall revenue fell only 10% to 
£148.3 million (2009 – £164.0 million).
Decisive restructuring actions taken in the first half 
delivered the anticipated efficiency savings, better 
equipping the Group to address the trading environment. 
This helped to ensure that margins remained strong at 
33% (2009 – 35%), whilst also enabling us to invest 
selectively in growth opportunities, particularly in 
South America, the CIS, where we expanded local 
resources and AVEVA NET where we increased capacity 
in solutions delivery. The whole organisation showed 
great professionalism and commitment throughout 
this process and the Group was quickly able to move 
forward this year with the right cost base.
Overall performance of most industry segments served 
by AVEVA has been in line with our expectations. Funding 
constraints in the Oil and Gas sector led to some major 
new projects proceeding slowly, although the situation 
steadily improved during the year. In particular, there 
have been some areas of intense activity, notably Brazil, 
where we have expanded our presence in Rio de Janeiro.

Directors’ report
The Power industry tends to have much longer investment 
cycles and has not been as susceptible to the global 
downturn with our business in both fossil-fuelled and 
nuclear builds continuing to grow steadily. Marine did 
suffer from a dramatic decline in new build orders and 
concerns over funding for the existing ship order backlog. 
By making some hard decisions at the start of the year 
to adjust the cost base we have been able to expand the 
business during the year to exploit new opportunities. 
We have recruited high calibre people into both our office 
network and the AVEVA NET organisation, which has already 
benefited our sales. There have been a number of significant 
sales of AVEVA NET during the year and a strengthening 
business pipeline as we have built up our specialist 
business development team focused on sales into the 
owner operator market. We have already started on 
building up our service delivery capability in order 
to serve this £500 billion market.
Global performance
Providing a consistent high quality level of product 
performance and customer service has become increasingly 
important during the last year, as customers who already 
operate internationally seek to introduce further efficiencies 
into their own operations by increasing the use of 24/7 
working and high value engineering centres.
Key to the success in winning customers away from our 
competitors has been the high quality of support and 
service we can offer from our 35 locations, in addition 
to the partners who work with us in some regions.
Asia Pacific – Revenue £50.5 million 
(2009 – £67.1 million)
Whilst we have had to adjust for a rapid decline in 
Marine sales, growth was delivered in other parts of the 
business, in particular the Chinese Power market. We also 
made good progress in sales of AVEVA NET to both Plant 
and Marine customers. Asia has borne the brunt of the 
decline in initial fee licence sales, as the majority of 
Asian business tends to be based on the initial fee sales 
as opposed to the rental model, which is more prevalent 
in other regions.
Due to the very high number of sales in Marine during 
the latter part of 2008/09 and the ongoing opportunities 
of providing start up assistance to new customers, support 
levels were maintained in China Marine. However, we were 
also able to focus these resources on selling AVEVA NET 
into the rapidly growing market for Product Lifecycle 
Management (PLM) solutions within the Marine 
customer base.
Despite the downturn, AVEVA managed to secure 
important new contracts with Kyokuyo Shipyard in 
Japan and Samsung in Korea for both Marine and 
Plant divisions. 
In non-Marine markets we made good progress 
in securing important new strategic contracts. This 
included collaboration with one of the world’s largest 
companies, China National Petroleum Co Petrochemical 
Project Company (CNPC PPC).

Since the opening of our office in Rio de Janeiro last year , 
we have built a high quality team and have already 
doubled the size of our original office, with plans to 
continue hiring into our sales and customer support

suitability for the Oil and Gas projects in Brazil, along 
with the local support, has positioned AVEVA for strong 
growth in this market for the foreseeable future. We have 
secured a two year corporate agreement with Petrobras 
for the supply of design products. 
AVEVA products are already being used on many of the 
offshore projects starting to be commissioned in the 
region, with new customers joining from the Brazilian 
Engineering, Procurement and Contracting (EPC) 
community. In addition, AVEVA has the opportunity 
to sell the AVEVA Marine products into new shipyards 
which are expected to be commissioned to build Floating 
Production and Storage Offshore (FPSO) vessels and a 
fleet of Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC).
Performance in North America has remained subdued. 
As in previous years our strong and enduring relationships 
with many Oil and Gas customers have provided stability 
and some growth opportunities. We have used the 
downturn to build our business development expertise, 
with particular focus on deeper penetration of the Owner 
Operator market in the United States, with the aim of 
replicating our recent successes. We were pleased with 
the highly successful implementation of AVEVA NET at 
Mustang, one of the largest EPC firms in the US.
The market in Canada was one of the first casualties of 
the rapid oil price decline and shows little sign of recovery 
in the short term. With the oil price at circa US$80 there 
is still uncertainty surrounding the exploitation of oil 
sands reserves in Canada and the high costs of 
subsequent environmental impact.
EMEA – Revenue £70.9 million (2009 – £72.6 million, 
combined former WEMEA and CES regions)
The combined EMEA region, which was created last year 
from two business regions, has performed very well 
throughout the year. This region has a very diverse 
spread of business and a wide geographic mix with 
diverse drivers, from the Middle East, up through the CIS, 
across to Spain and down as far as South Africa.
The Oil and Gas business has performed well. Some 
notable highlights include a large rental expansion from 
Technip and our first significant sale in Iraq with AVEVA 
products installed at SIDDCO and ADMA in Abu Dhabi, 
who have mandated the use of AVEVA products on all 
future projects. The Power market is very important 
across the EMEA region, with long-term customers like 
Alstom and AREVA as key players. We have extended our 
relationship with AREVA by securing business from the 
AREVA Nuclear Fuels division. The Marine business, which 
is spread across the region, has been generally flat 
throughout the year.

Mr. Ron Bohannon, Vice President of Engineering:
“AVEVA’s technology helps us streamline our 
engineering process and contributes to Alliance 
Engineering’s ability to deliver projects at 
a lower weight (therefore, lower cost) and 
ahead of schedule.”

Directors’ report
EMEA has been the region where we have been the most 
consistently successful in winning customers away from 
our competitors. This year we have added 79 new name 
customers across the region, with many of these converting 
to AVEVA after years of using competitors’ systems. 
We are also investing in the CIS and have seen very 
strong sales in this sub region. AVEVA has won important 
new business with customers in the Oil and Gas and 
Power markets. Some of these customers will be strategic 
in winning further business as we expand in the region. 
Of particular note is the contract with OJSC TANECO, the 
operator of the new multibillion dollar refinery complex 
in Russia, who will now use AVEVA NET as the consolidation 
tool for all engineering data for this mega project. In the 
Nuclear power field we have secured KIEP as our second 
CIS nuclear design institute. 
End user market trends
We have seen differing trends in each of the main end 
user markets during the year. 
AVEVA has achieved a very strong position as a preferred 
supplier for many of the world’s power station providers, 
both fossil-fuelled and nuclear. The global span of customers 
using AVEVA products on new build power plants can be 
seen by our leading position with many of the European 
suppliers but is particularly pronounced in Asia, with 
some great successes during the past year in China. 
The market for power stations has a very long-lead cycle 
and may span a recession but there have been concerns 
over the funding of future projects, in particular large 
nuclear power projects. Although we have not yet seen 
a huge upturn in demand for products from this sector, 
we anticipate a steady increase in demand for many years 
to come, as the current global power generation capacity 
falls well short of predicted consumption even before 
taking into account all of the capacity which is due to be 
retired in the near future.
Marine presented us with the most challenges but has 
performed predictably throughout the year. We still have 
a very busy customer base in Marine as most customers 
are working on orders received over recent years and for 
the majority of customers these orders still stretch out 
over the next two or three years. Until the market for new 
ships returns we expect the market for design tools to 
remain subdued. However, efficient production is paramount 
in a modern shipyard and we plan to extend the use of 
the Marine variant of AVEVA NET to more yards, particularly 
in China and Korea.
In Oil and Gas, whilst the tar sands project in Canada 
remains slow to recover from the stoppages caused by 
uncertainty over commodity prices, most other areas 
have remained buoyant. In Brazil the market is very 
strong, as Petrobras and others rush to capitalise on the 
huge oil reserves off the Brazilian east coast. We expect 
this market to continue to grow strongly and further 
investment in Brazil is a key element of our future 
planning. We see additional opportunities in Russia 
and expect to continue to grow our team there following 
the strong performance from this region during the 
past year. With greater stability in the oil price we are 
planning further investment in those regions likely to 
benefit from consistently increased commodity prices. 
These include Malaysia and the global market for FPSO 
assets, where AVEVA is already a leader.
“AVEVA has achieved a very strong position as a preferred supplier for many 
of the world’s power station providers, both fossil-fuelled and nuclear.”

Chief Executive’ s review continued
Technology and products
Research and Development continued to be a key 
priority during the year in order to enhance our 
software applications and functionality. The high levels 
of investment in recent years ensure that we have the 
most advanced product offering in the industry. There 
has been a large investment in consolidating the 
developments of recent years and further improving 
quality. This work has been carried out across the entire 
product portfolio, with special focus on those developments 
deemed essential for deeper penetration of developing 
markets in Latin America and Eastern Europe.
Integration between applications from multiple vendors 
has been high on the agenda of many Chief Information 
Officers and AVEVA has always been a leader in providing 
open solutions and investing in global standards initiatives. 
During the last year we have provided more interfaces to 
third-party software products than ever before to enable 
customers to achieve greater value from their project 
and enterprise information.
Last year we acquired a specialist business in Australia 
to manage instrumentation data. The new version of this 
instrumentation product has been delivered and, with 
many new customers taking up this product during the 
year, we have received very positive feedback on the 
level of functionality and the competitiveness of our 
new solution.
In addition to work on consolidating the core product 
range, we have continued to expand the functionality of 
AVEVA NET with many new features added, as we gained 
further experience working with oil majors and large 
Chinese shipbuilders. The teams working on AVEVA NET 
have been increased during the year, with plans in place 
to continue the expansion of AVEVA NET and bring to 
market a novel web navigation capability within the 
coming months.
Organisation and people
The AVEVA human resources team played a key role in 
successfully transitioning the organisation into a shape 
and size which was needed as we entered the downturn. 
This was achieved by introducing a range of cost saving 
measures including a salary freeze, career breaks, 
part-time working and some redundancies, both 
voluntary and compulsory. Once again I would like to 
thank all those affected by this for their understanding 
and professionalism. 
We have continued to expand the sales and support 
network and our relatively new office in Brazil has 
doubled in size to cope with the demands of this exciting 
new market for AVEVA products and services. We have 
also increased staff numbers in Russia and the CIS, 
along with some areas within the Asia Pacific region.
“AVEVA has done very well over the last year and the core strengths in both 
our people and products have served to provide confidence to customers in 
a difficult year.”

Directors’ report
Since merging two sales regions into one to form 
EMEA last year and the rigorous examination of our 
cost base, we have made cost savings by rationalising 
some corporate functions and introduced new centralised 
systems to streamline the reporting processes of a very 
international business. 
Outlook
AVEVA has done very well over the last year and the core 
strengths in both our people and products have served 
to provide confidence to customers in a difficult year.
As the global economic outlook improves, AVEVA is 
well placed to fulfil customers’ requirements through our 
world-class products together with their increasingly 
high level of service demanded. We have taken the 
opportunity over the past year to evaluate all aspects 
of our business and have been continually strengthening 
the areas where we see the most opportunity for growth, 
in particular increasing the investment levels in AVEVA NET. 
With our design products we have invested in new 
geographies that have grown strongly and we will continue 
to invest and develop offices and people. AVEVA has the 
right products and a proven track record which appeal to 
customers seeking highly functional products backed by 
first class local support and service.
We will continue to seek to maximise organic growth 
and to complement it with acquisitions as and when 
opportunities arise which can extend the functionality 
of our products or our market reach.

Finance Director
>> Highlights
   Solid operating margins maintained at 33% (2009 – 35%).
  Ongoing investment in Research and Development was 
£20.9 million.
  Basic earnings per share were 49.36 pence 
(2009 – 62.27 pence).
  AVEVA continues to be cash generative and net cash and 
deposits were £149.7 million (2009 – £126.2 million). 
Business model
At the core of AVEVA’s business is the intellectual 
property generated in its software products. The Group 
sells its proprietary software products by licensing rights 
to use the software directly to customers through our 
network of global sales offices rather than through resellers 
or distributors. This strategy provides customers with 
local sales and support and helps AVEVA to work closely 
with the leading companies principally in the Oil and Gas, 
Power and Marine markets. AVEVA’s software products 
also provide the customer with ‘data for life’ whereby 
current versions of the software are compatible with 
previous versions allowing customers to access design 
data over a long time span, which is essential for assets 
which can have a life in excess of 20 years. This strategy 
has helped establish long-term relationships with many 
of our customers and several have been users of our 
products for over 30 years.
At the cornerstone of our business philosophy is our 
‘right to use’ licensing model. Customers license our 
software for a specified number of users by paying an 
initial licence fee followed by an obligatory annual fee 
or by paying a rental fee over a fixed period of time. 
In both cases, the customer has to continue to pay a fee 
in order to use the software. The ‘right to use’ model 
provides a strong recurring revenue base for AVEVA which 
allows us to invest in the future roadmap of our products. 
This provides visibility to the customers and allows them 
to provide input to the direction of the products. In addition, 
customers receive upgrades to software as and when they 
become available as well as support and maintenance.

Annual report 2010
Directors’ report
Key performance indicators
The Group’s key financial and non-financial performance 
indicators are total revenue, adjusted profit before tax, 
headcount and adjusted earnings per share. The financial 
results for the year ended 31 March 2010 are summarised 
below. These are discussed as part of the review below:
*  Adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share are calculated 
before amortisation of intangible assets, share-based payments, 
gain/loss on fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and 
restructuring costs in the relevant year. In addition, adjusted earnings 
per share also include the tax effects of these adjustments.
 
Revenue
Total revenue for the year fell by 10% to £148.3 million 
compared to £164.0 million last year with, as previously 
disclosed, the Group being impacted by the world recession. 
Revenue from initial licence fees in the Marine market 
was particularly affected with total fees falling 39% 
from £57 .7 million to £35.1 million. In particular, initial 
licence fees in Asia Pacific fell from £36.8 million 
to £19.7 million reflecting this trend.
However the decline in initial licence fees was partly 
offset by the robustness of our recurring revenue 
consisting of annual fees, rental licence fees and 
recurring services. Recurring revenue increased by 
9% from £94.2 million to £102.7 million reflecting the 
continued renewals of annual fees and rental fees from 
our established customer base and new customers 
preferring to rent rather than buy the software for 
more flexibility.
Services continue to remain a relatively small part of 
the business with associated revenue falling by 13% from 
£12.1 million to £10.5 million although in future this is 
expected to increase as sales of AVEVA NET software increase.
The Group’s revenue was impacted by movements in 
foreign exchange rates during the year, particularly in 
US Dollars and Euro. Revenue on a constant currency 
basis was approximately £141.0 million (reported 
£148.3 million) compared to £164.0 million in 2008/09, 
down 14%. 
Cost of sales and operating expenses 
Cost of sales consists of direct cost of selling 
(third party royalties, consultancy costs and agent’s 
commission) as well as Research and Development costs 
and associated Information Technology costs. Total cost 
of sales for the year was £30.4 million (2009 – £37 .6 million). 
Research and Development costs were £20.9 million 
(2009 – £27.3 million), a decrease of 23% which reflects 
the impact of the restructuring programme that was 
carried out in April 2009. Research and Development 
costs represented 14% of total revenue (2009 – 17%). 
The focus in Research and Development has been 
targeting our investment in key product areas such 
as AVEVA NET and to continue to improve the quality 
of AVEVA Marine and AVEVA Plant products. 
Operating expenses were £68.7 million (2009 – 
£69.8 million) for the year, a decrease of 2% on 
the prior year. Of the total operating expenses selling 
and distribution costs were £60.0 million (2009 – 
£53.2 million) and administrative expenses were 
£8.7 million (2009 – £16.5 million).

AVEVA Group plc
Annual report 2010
Directors’ report
Finance Director’ s review continued
Cost of sales and operating expenses continued
Selling and distribution costs increased by 13% during 
the year which reflected the additional investments in 
our direct sales office network. Administrative expenses 
included a gain on the fair value of forward foreign 
exchange contracts of £3.6 million (2009 – loss of £3.7 
million) and, excluding these amounts, administrative 
expenses were broadly in line.
The operating margin in 2009/10 was maintained at 33% 
(2009 – 35%) which was pleasing in light of the difficult 
trading conditions and reflects the benefits of the 
restructuring programme implemented in the year.
Headcount
Total headcount at 31 March 2010 amounted to 820 
(2009 – 843), a net decrease of 23 staff. The average 
headcount during the year was 815 (2009 – 809) of 
which 228 were in Research, Development and product 
support (2009 – 253), 417 in sales, marketing and customer 
support (2009 – 380) and 170 in administration (2009 – 176). 
As noted below, the restructuring programme 
implemented during the year largely affected Research 
and Development which resulted in the reduction in the 
average headcount. The increase in the average headcount 
in sales, marketing and customer support was due to the 
continued investment in our direct sales offices, particularly 
in South America and Eastern Europe.
Total staff costs for the year were £58.8 million compared 
with £55.5 million in 2009, an increase of 6%.
Restructuring
As announced previously, the Group implemented a 
restructuring programme at the start of the financial 
year to make sure that AVEVA was better equipped to 
address the difficult trading environment, whilst also 
selectively investing to exploit growth opportunities. 
As part of this restructuring programme, we combined 
the Central, Eastern and Southern Europe region with 
our Western Europe, Middle East and Africa region 
to form the European, Middle East and Africa region 
(EMEA). As part of this combination and restructuring 
of some of our Research and Development activities, 
a number of employees were made redundant giving rise 
to a one-off cost of £1.9 million. The cost of restructuring 
was lower than anticipated and annualised savings were 
approximately £5.0 million, which was in line with our 
initial expectations.
Finance revenue and finance costs
Finance revenue represents bank interest 
receivable on cash and cash equivalents of £1.1 million 
(2009 – £2.8 million) and the expected return on the 
UK defined benefit pension plan of £1.7 million 
(2009 – £2.0 million). Despite strong growth in cash 
and cash equivalents and treasury deposits, bank 
interest receivable fell from £2.8 million to £1.1 million 
due to the significant falls in UK and US interest rates. 
Finance costs principally relate to the interest charge 
on the pension scheme liabilities of £2.5 million 
(2009 – £2.3 million).
Presentation of adjusted profit before tax 
We have amended the calculation of adjusted profit 
before tax to include the change in the fair value of 
forward foreign exchange contracts as this is a non-cash 
item that has become more material due to the volatility 
in the underlying exchange rates. In the year ended 
31 March 2010, there was a gain on the fair value of 
forward foreign exchange rates amounting to £3.6 million 
(2009 – loss of £3.7 million). Adjusted profit before tax 
also takes into account amortisation of intangibles, 
share-based payments and restructuring costs totalling 
£4.7 million (2009 – £3.4 million). This resulted in 
adjusted profit before tax for the year of £50.7 million 
(2009 – £66.4 million). Profit before tax for the year was 
£49.6 million compared to £59.2 million in 2008/09. 
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate for the year was 32.5% 
compared to 28.8% in 2008/09. The main reasons for the 
increase were irrecoverable withholding tax suffered in Asia, 
expenses not deductable for tax purposes and adjustments 
in respect of prior years. The Group has tax losses of

£5.1 million (2009 – £3.8 million) which relate to overseas 
subsidiaries for which no deferred tax asset has been 
recognised (2009 – £0.6 million). The losses can be 
carried forward indefinitely. 
Earnings per share and dividends
Basic earnings per share were 49.36 pence (2009 – 
62.27 pence) and diluted earnings per share were 
49.08 pence (2009 – 61.98 pence).
Following the change to the presentation of adjusted 
profit before tax as noted above, adjusted earnings per 
share has also been amended to reflect the changes in 
the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts. 
Therefore adjusted basic earnings per share, which 
is calculated before amortisation of intangibles, gain 
on the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts, 
restructuring costs and share-based payments and the 
associated tax effects, were 50.92 pence (2009 – 69.99 
pence). Diluted adjusted earnings per share on the same 
basis were 50.62 pence (2009 – 69.67 pence). The Directors 
believe that adjusted earnings per share provide a more 
representative presentation of the underlying performance 
of the business.
Comparative figures in the financial statements for 
adjusted profit before tax and adjusted basic and diluted 
earnings per share have been restated accordingly to 
reflect this change in presentation.
The Board of Directors recommend payment of a 
final dividend of 13.9 pence (2009 – 6.5 pence) which, 
together with the interim dividend of 3.0 pence (2009 – 
2.86 pence), gives a total dividend for 2009/10 of 
16.9 pence (2009 – 9.36 pence), an 81% increase over 
2008/09. Subject to approval at the Annual General 
Meeting, the final dividend will be paid on 30 July 2010 
to shareholders on the register on 25 June 2010.
Balance sheet and cash flows
AVEVA’s balance sheet continued to strengthen 
during the year and at 31 March 2010 net assets were 
£169.2 million compared to net assets of £143.1 million 
at 31 March 2009 with increased cash and treasury 
deposits being the main driver behind this.
Non-current assets at 31 March 2010 were £42.1 million 
(2009 – £42.2 million) which was in line with the prior year. 
Investments in intangible assets during the year included 
software licences for components used in the suite of 
AVEVA products at a cost of £1.2 million. Investments 
in tangible assets of £1.5 million (2009 – £3.7 million) 
were for replacement computer equipment and the 
refurbishment of offices.
Current assets increased to £195.6 million from 
£183.7 million principally due to the increase in 
cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits of 
£23.5 million from £126.2 million to £149.7 million. 
AVEVA continues to be cash generative and the Group has 
continued to focus closely on cash management during 
the year particularly on the collection of customer 
receivables and repatriation of cash to the UK from 
overseas subsidiaries. Total cash and deposits held in the 
UK at 31 March 2010 represented 85% of the total cash 
and deposits balance (2009 – 69%). As noted below, 
treasury deposits represent deposits with an original 
maturity of six months following the amendment to the 
Group’s treasury policy. The Group has no debt.
Cash generated from operating activities before tax in 
the period amounted to £47 .7 million (2009 – £58.7 million). 
Cash conversion, measured by cash generated from 
operating activities before tax as a percentage of profit 
from operations, was 97% compared to 104% in 2008/09 
which continues to reflect the quality of earnings and 
results of these cash management initiatives. 
Trade and other receivables were £44.1 million 
(2009 – £56.8 million) which partly reflects the reduction 
in revenue but also continued focus on collection of 
customer receivables. Accounts receivable is also net 
of the provision for impairment of £6.6 million (2009 
– £4.8 million) which reflects the Group’s continued 
prudent view of the collectability of accounts receivable.
Current liabilities totalled £48.9 million at 31 March 2010 
(2009 – £56.6 million) which included deferred revenue 
of £26.9 million (2009 – £31.1 million), and trade payables 
and accruals of £22.0 million (2009 – £25.5 million). 
Non-current liabilities include retirement benefit 
obligations of £13.1 million (2009 – £8.8 million). This 
mainly relates to the UK defined benefit pension plan 
which had a deficit under IAS 19 of £11.7 million 
at 31 March 2010 (2009 – deficit of £7.6 million). 
“AVEVA continued to deliver strong cash generation.”

Directors’ report
Finance Director’ s review continued
Balance sheet and cash flows continued
The increase in the deficit was caused by increased 
liabilities from £36.3 million to £52.4 million due to 
the updated assumption for discount rate. This was 
partly offset by an increase in the fair value of the 
scheme assets from £28.7 million to £40.7 million 
at 31 March 2010.
Capital structure
The authorised share capital of the Company is 
120,000,000 ordinary shares of 3.33 pence each 
(2009 – 90,000,000). The issued share capital at 
31 March 2010 was 67 ,928,208 ordinary shares of 
3.33 pence each (2009 – 67 ,818,868). During the year 
the AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008 purchased 
89,016 ordinary shares in the Company in the open 
market at an average price of £7.29 per share for total 
consideration of £653,000 in order to satisfy awards 
made under the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred 
Share Scheme 2008. At 31 March 2010, the Trust owned 
122,770 ordinary shares in the Company.
Treasury policy
The Group treasury policy aims to ensure that the capital 
held is not put at risk and the treasury function is managed 
under policies and procedures approved by the Board. 
These policies are designed to reduce the financial risk 
arising from the Group’s normal trading activities, which 
primarily relate to credit, interest, liquidity and currency 
risk. Further details of these risks are contained at note 
24. The Group is, and expects to continue to be, cash 
positive and currently holds net deposits. The treasury 
policy includes counterparty limits which are adhered to. 
During the year the treasury policy was updated to enable 
deposits with an original maturity of up to six months to 
be placed with banks with a high credit rating.
During the year the Group had a bank overdraft 
facility of approximately £0.9 million (SEK 10 million) 
(2009 – £0.8 million, SEK 10 million) in Sweden, aimed at 
managing short-term fluctuations in cash of which £nil 
had been drawn down at 31 March 2010 (2009 – £nil). The 
Group has a net funding requirement in Sterling due to the 
majority of Research and Development costs being incurred 
in the UK. The revenue of the Group is predominantly in 
foreign currency, with approximately 35% in US Dollar 
and 25% in Euro. The overseas entities incur costs in their 
local functional currency, which acts as a partial net 
hedge. Any cash flows which cannot be offset against 
each other result in a net currency exposure and where 
possible these exposures are hedged. These hedges aim 
to minimise the adverse effect of exchange rate movements, 
without eliminating all upside potential. 
Review of principal risks and uncertainties
AVEVA has continued to be successful during the year, 
but as with any organisation there are a number of 
potential risks and uncertainties which could have a 
material impact on the Group’s long-term performance. 
Where possible the Group seeks to mitigate these risks 
through its system of internal controls but this can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material losses. 
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group 
are as follows:
Protection of the Group’s intellectual property rights
The Group’s success has been built upon the development 
of its substantial intellectual property rights and protection 
of this remains critical. The Group generally protects its 
proprietary software products by licensing rights to use 
the application, rather than selling or licensing the 
computer source code. Infringement of the Group’s 
intellectual property rights by third parties or its failure 
to defend infringement claims from third parties could 
cause damage to the business. The Group uses third party 
technology to encrypt, protect and restrict access to its 
products. Access limitations and rights are also defined 
within the terms of the software licence agreement and 
the Group seeks to ensure that its intellectual property 
rights are appropriately protected by law wherever possible.
Dependency on key markets
AVEVA generates a substantial amount of its income 
from customers whose main business is derived from 
capital projects driven predominantly by growth in the 
Oil and Gas, Power and Marine markets. The current world 
economic conditions may adversely affect our financial 
performance. Funding constraints may cause the delay of 
major new projects and customers who operate in the Oil 
and Gas, Marine and Power industries may reduce capital 
expenditure budgets further. Future success is dependent 
on growth and continued demand from within these markets. 
These industries are cyclical and subject to fluctuations 
in the price of oil and general economic conditions. 
Such downturns, pricing pressures and restructurings 
“The Group makes substantial investments in Research and Development 
in enhancing existing products and introducing new products.”

AVEVA Group plc
Annual report 2010
Directors’ report
may cause delays and reductions in expenditure by many of 
these companies and reduced demand for our products 
and services. A recurrence of these industry patterns, 
as well as general domestic and foreign economic conditions 
and other factors that reduce spending by companies in 
these industries, could harm our operating results in 
the future.
Competition
AVEVA operates in highly competitive markets that 
serve the Oil and Gas, Power and Marine markets. If we 
do not respond effectively we may lose market share 
and the business could suffer. We believe that there are a 
relatively small number of significant competitors serving 
our markets. However, some of these competitors could, 
in the future, pose a greater competitive threat, particularly 
if they consolidate or form strategic or commercial 
relationships among themselves or with larger, well 
capitalised companies. 
Foreign exchange risk
Exposure to foreign currency gains and losses can be 
material to the Group, with approximately 80% of the 
Group’s revenue denominated in a foreign currency, of 
which our two largest are US Dollar and Euro. The Group 
enters into forward foreign currency contracts to manage 
the currency risk where material. The overseas subsidiaries 
trade in their own currencies, which also acts as a natural 
hedge against currency movements. The Group is also 
exposed to foreign currency translation risk on the 
translation of its net investment into Sterling.
Recruitment and retention of employees
AVEVA’s success has been built on the quality and reputation 
of its products and services, which rely almost entirely 
on the quality of the people developing and delivering 
them. Managing this pool of highly skilled and motivated 
individuals across all disciplines and geographies remains 
key to our ongoing success. The Group endeavours to 
ensure that employees are motivated by their work and 
there are regular appraisals, with staff encouraged to 
develop their skills. 
Identification and successful integration 
of acquisitions 
The Group expects to continue to review acquisition 
targets as part of its strategy. The integration of any 
acquisitions also involves a number of unique risks, 
including diversion of management’s attention, failure 
to retain key personnel of the acquired business, failure 
to realise the benefits anticipated to result from the 
acquisition, system integration and risks associated 
with unanticipated events or liabilities.
Research and Development
The Group makes substantial investments in Research 
and Development in enhancing existing products and 
introducing new products. There are many risks in 
software development. This process is managed by 
developing a product roadmap that identifies the 
schedule for new products and the enhancements that 
will be made to successive versions of existing products. 
Our software products are complex and may contain 
undetected errors, failures, performance problems or 
defects. Furthermore if new products or enhancements 
are introduced which do not meet customer requirements 
or competitors introduce a rival product which better 
meets the requirements of the market, this may have a 
material impact on the long-term revenue and profit.
International operations
The Group operates in Continental Europe, the Middle 
East, the United States, South America and Asia Pacific 
and is required to comply with the local laws, regulations 
and tax legislation in each of these jurisdictions. Significant 
changes in these laws and regulations or failure to comply 
with them could lead to additional liabilities and penalties. 
The Group manages its overseas operations by employing 
locally qualified personnel who are able to provide expertise 
in the appropriate language and an understanding of 
local culture, custom and practice. Dependence on local 
management can increase the risks of Group policy not 
being correctly applied, especially where diverse languages 
and cultures exist. The Group endeavours to mitigate 
these risks through oversight by regional management in 
each of the three major zones of the Group, Asia Pacific, 
EMEA and the Americas, as well as through the use of 
local professional advisers.

Directors’ report
Corporate social responsibility report
As a Group we seek to operate responsibly and ethically 
in all areas of our business. We have a strong ethical 
belief in the way business should be conducted and how 
employees should be treated. We have integrated social, 
environmental and ethical policies into the way we do 
business and how we interact with our stakeholders 
including our shareholders, employees, customers, 
suppliers and local communities. The Chief Executive 
has Board responsibilities for matters relating to the 
Group’s culture and ethical policies, environmental 
matters and customer and employee issues. These matters 
are reviewed by the Board as part of its management of 
risk and maintenance of its core values is vital. The Board 
considers that it has sufficient information in order 
to be able to assess these risks.
Customers and suppliers
We seek to be honest and fair in our relationships with 
both customers and suppliers. AVEVA has relatively few 
preferred suppliers, and evaluates potential suppliers 
based on several factors including vendor policies, 
reputation and contractual terms and conditions.
We have a policy not to offer, pay or accept bribes 
or to accept substantial favours. We encourage our 
suppliers and customers to adopt the same principles 
to which we ourselves aspire. 
We offer the highest level of support and continue to 
enhance our product offering to ensure our customers’ 
effective use of our software thus minimising waste 
and improving efficiency. The Group is committed to 
its customers and has dedicated support staff within 
its Group Solutions Centre to handle all support calls 
and capture customer feedback. 
In addition to sponsoring a variety of industry trade 
shows, AVEVA hosted a number of customer focused 
events during the year, including the AVEVA Marine User 
Meeting (AMUM) in Shanghai, China, and the International 
Symposium for Engineering Information Technology (ISEIT), 
held in Berlin, Germany. As in previous years, these events 
provided a valuable industry forum to build relationships 
with the customer base and potential new customers, 
to obtain feedback on the product offering and to 
promote best practice in the use of our software.
Following on from the success of the ISEIT and AMUM 
conferences, AVEVA announced in 2010 an exciting change 
to their successful conference series with the introduction 
of the AVEVA World Summits. The new Summits will become 
AVEVA’s premier customer events held in multiple locations 
around the world. They will continue to focus on strategic 
business, industry and technology issues critical to the 
success of existing and future AVEVA customers.
Employees
The Group now has over 800 employees of whom 
over 500 are based overseas. 2009/10 saw a review 
of our growth strategy in the light of changes in the 
global economy and the refocusing of our investments 
which resulted in some job losses. Alternative options, 
including part-time working, retraining and career 
breaks, were offered to ensure that key skills were 
retained. Job losses were kept to a minimum so as 
not to damage the longer-term business goals.
We are dependent on the drive and commitment 
of our employees; they are our most important and 
valuable asset and key to our continuing success. We 
have continued to review the skills and experience 
needed to fill our critical roles and continue to recruit 
in certain areas. Retention and skill development is 
regularly reviewed by the Board as part of the risk 
management process. 
We recognise that we must excel in the management 
of people and support employees to develop their careers 
within the Group, which assists towards maintaining 
a high level of morale. Staff turnover remains well 
below the industry norm and positive retention 
programmes are being developed by the Group HR team. 
Staff retention rate is a KPI which is monitored regularly 
and at 31 March 2010, the retention rate was 93% 
(excluding the impact of the redundancy programme 
which was completed in 2009) (2009 – 93%). We aim 
to be an employer of choice by:
>>  aiming to recruit, train and develop high calibre 
people and helping them to subscribe to our values 
while continuing to grow the business in key areas;
>>  providing clean, healthy and safe working conditions;
“As a Group we seek to operate responsibly and ethically in all areas of 
our business. We have a strong ethical belief in the way business should 
be conducted.”

Financial statements
>>  being an equal opportunity employer and not 
tolerating any discriminatory actions or harassment 
of our employees; we are proud of the diverse nature 
of our workforce;
>>  recognising the requirement to provide facilities for 
disabled employees and taking all reasonable measures 
to meet any special needs an employee might have;
>>  encouraging fuel-efficient commuting through the 
provision of car share networks, cycle sheds, showers 
and changing facilities in the UK offices; and
>>  offering flexible benefits in the UK to allow 
employees to select benefits to suit their lifestyle, 
and an Employee Assistance Programme to provide 
independent support for a variety of both work 
and non-work related issues.
AVEVA will continue to review its benefits programme 
throughout the Group to ensure that valued and 
cost-effective benefits are offered to all employees 
whilst remaining competitive. The Group’s employment 
policies are continuously under review and are aimed at 
meeting or exceeding the legislative requirements in the 
countries in which the Group operates. Wherever possible, 
these promote a considerate and flexible approach to 
work/life balance. As part of this, the Group continues 
to review and improve communication with employees 
and has conducted surveys and held forums with 
employees to gain their views on key issues.
Training and development
E-Learning
In support of the development and retention of staff, 
this year the Group launched E-Learning to all employees 
across the Group to enable them to access technical and 
generic training material. This is particularly suited to an 
employee base so widely spread across different locations.
This initiative includes bespoke training for new 
employees and information for specific groups such 
as graduates, managers, etc.
Central Induction Programme
Our successful Central Induction Programme has 
continued to be enjoyed by new recruits and proved 
very beneficial in providing information and a welcome 
to the Company. This is now being supplemented with 
the E-Learning programme and local induction plans. 
During the year over 50 new employees attended 
the courses hosted in Cambridge.
Management development training programme
Managing employees in a changing and demanding 
organisation with such diverse cultures and numerous 
locations brings a number of challenges. AVEVA has 
developed a training programme and a learning 
framework to provide support for the management 
team. The management development course has been 
extended to include different levels of management and 
is led by our internal Training and Development Manager.
Graduate training programme
The AVEVA graduate training programme has now been 
extended to include graduates in our EMEA Sales Division 
and in 2010 will be extended further to include North America 
and non-R&D functions such as business strategy and sales. 
During the year an additional four new graduates were hired 
and will undergo a two year graduate training programme 
gaining experience from different disciplines in the Group.

Group-wide appraisal scheme
Developing skills is important to individuals and to AVEVA 
– developing people helps move the Group forward and 
helps maintain the respect and reputation of our staff 
with our customers. The appraisal process therefore:
>>  ensures staff receive regular, constructive feedback 
on their performance;
>>  links job descriptions and individual objectives with 
AVEVA’s business plans; and
>>  sets and reviews personal skill development goals.
Health and safety
We have a legal and moral responsibility to ensure 
the safety and well being of all our employees whilst 
carrying out their duties on behalf of the Group and 
also to maintain a safe environment for customers and 
other visitors whilst on our premises. Health and Safety, 
Fire Safety and Electrical Safety audits are carried out 
on a regular basis. In the last twelve months we have 
had one RIDDOR reportable accident which resulted in 
no further action. As a global business, our employees 
undertake travel to many areas of the world to visit 
customers’ sites or to assist customers in the 
deployment and testing of our products. The Group 
regularly takes advice from the UK Foreign Office, 
the World Health Organisation and similar organisations 
concerning health and safety in the various regions 
where we operate (for example we regularly updated 
employees on advice this year relating to the H1N1 virus 
and provided additional precautions in the workplace 
to prevent the spread of infection).
Environment
As a developer of software the Company has no 
manufacturing facilities and therefore the Group 
is classed as “low impact” in environmental terms. 
The majority of sales are for software which is delivered 
electronically to customers. Our software products 
are created by very knowledgeable, talented individuals 
using computers and a variety of software development 
tools. There are no harmful chemicals or anything that 
could give rise to noxious waste employed in the process. 
We purchase energy saving screens which are MPR II 
and TCO 03 compliant. We have this year also had a survey 
carried out by the Carbon Trust to give us guidance on 
further adjustments we can make to cut down on our 
carbon footprint. We use third party recycling vendors 
to assist us with the disposal of computer hardware in 
an environmentally friendly manner. The Group actively 
undertakes recycling of waste products with printer 
toner, paper, cardboard and plastic recycled in many 
locations. We encourage employees to undertake 
recycling as much as possible. 
Travel
We encourage and support environmentally considerate 
travel to work arrangements at all our principal office 
locations, according to local circumstances. At our Cambridge 
headquarters this includes encouraging employees to 
cycle to work, share car journeys or use public transport. 
There are a number of employees who take advantage of 
the excellent facilities for cyclists with staff encouraged 
to use these. International travel is important to support 
and promote our business worldwide. The level of 
international travel is monitored on a regular basis 
and ways to reduce travel investigated.

Video and web conferencing is utilised whenever practicable. 
Recent investments to our core IT infrastructure across 
the Group has enabled more effective communication/
collaboration and is expected to continue to improve 
operational efficiencies in the future.
Educational partnerships
Skills shortages continue to be a challenge in most 
engineering companies and it will take some time 
for the recent increases in the number of engineering 
students at universities and technical colleges to close 
the skills gap that currently exists. In recognition of this, 
and in addition to its own in-house graduate recruitment 
schemes, AVEVA actively supports the work of educational 
establishments and government bodies around the world 
to narrow the skills gap. The AVEVA Academic Initiative 
is a Group-wide programme whereby the Company:
>>  works with universities and technical institutes to 
promote the use of AVEVA products within undergraduate 
courses and postgraduate research projects;
>>  works with government agencies to re-skill engineers 
for employment in other disciplines; and
>>  works with engineering bodies to encourage school 
leavers to pursue careers in engineering.
The company provides both software and training support 
to enable engineering students to gain hands-on experience 
of the latest technologies and use these to undertake 
a variety of academic and practical projects directly 
applicable to the industries in which they will work.
In the 2009/10 financial year AVEVA provided support to:
Asia Pacific region:
Over 30 universities, colleges and high schools in China, 
India, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan.
EMEA:
More than 15 universities and colleges in Algeria, 
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Serbia, Spain, 
Sweden and the UK.
Americas:
Seven universities, colleges and postgraduate institutes 
in North America and Canada.
In addition, AVEVA has donated in excess of $800,000-worth 
of engineering software and provided free, special training 
courses to US initiatives aimed at re-skilling designers and 
engineers from the declining auto industry and upgrading 
the skills of piping designers re-entering the plant 
industry workforce.
AVEVA sees its Academic Initiative as a vital strategic 
investment that will bring long-term benefits to the 
engineering industries around the world.
Community involvement
The Group is involved in a number of charitable and 
good causes. The Group’s policy has been to continue 
to support local charities in the areas that we operate 
as well as a number of national and international charities. 
Employees are encouraged to participate personally in 
charitable and community activities with the Group also 
gift matching the efforts of employees who took part 
in the Chariots of Fire Charity Marathon, the Oxford 
to Cambridge Bike Ride and Red Nose Day.
During the past year we have donated £36,000 to a wide

AVEVA Group plc
Annual report 2010
Directors’ report
Other statutory information
Principal activities
The principal activities of the Group are the marketing and development of computer software and services for engineering and related solutions. 
The Company is a holding company.
Results and dividends
The Group made a profit for the year after taxation of £33.4 million (2009 – £42.2 million). Revenue was £148.3 million (2009 – £164.0 million) 
and comprised software licences, software maintenance and services.
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 13.9 pence per ordinary share (2009 – 6.5 pence). If approved at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting, the final dividend will be paid on 30 July 2010 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 25 June 2010.
Business review and future developments
A review of the Group’s operations during the year and its plans for the future is given in the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review 
and the Finance Director’s review. 
The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used by AVEVA to measure its own performance at the Group level are total revenue, adjusted profit before tax, 
adjusted earnings per share and headcount. The figures for the year ended 31 March 2010 are set out in the Finance Director’s review on pages 16 to 21, 
together with figures for the previous year and a discussion of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group.
Suppliers’ payment practice
It is the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms and conditions agreed between the Company and 
its suppliers, provided that all trading terms and conditions have been complied with by the other party.
The Company has £nil trade creditors (2009 – £nil). At 31 March 2010, the Group had an average of 18 days’ purchases owed to trade creditors 
(2009 – 18 days’).
Research and Development
The Group continues an active programme of Research and Development which covers updating of and extension to the Group’s range of products.
Intellectual property
The Group owns intellectual property both in its software tools and the products derived from them. The Directors consider such properties to be 
of significant value to the business. 
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies are discussed in note 24 to the Consolidated financial statements.
Going concern
The Group has significant financial resources, is profitable and has a strong position in the markets it serves. At 31 March 2010 the Group had bank 
and cash and treasury deposit balances of £149.7 million (2009 – £126.2 million) and no debt. As a result, the Directors believe that the Group is well 
placed to manage business risks successfully despite the uncertain economic outlook.
Therefore after making enquiries and considering the cash flow forecasts for the Group, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue its operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Directors and their interests
The Directors who served during the year under review are shown below:
Nick Prest (Chairman)
David Mann (Non-Executive Director and Senior Independent Director)
Jonathan Brooks (Non-Executive Director)

No changes took place in the interests of Directors in the shares of the Company between 31 March 2010 and 26 May 2010.
Hervé Couturier had no interests in the Company on the date of his appointment (1 April 2010).
Directors’ share options are disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 40 to 45.
No Director had a material interest in any significant contract, other than a service contract or contract for services, with the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries at any time during the year.
Resolutions will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting for the election of Hervé Couturier and the re-election of all other current Directors 
(other than David Mann). Brief biographical details of all Directors, including those who are proposed for re-election, appear on page 27. 
Conflict of interest
Throughout the year the Company has had the procedures in place to deal with conflict situations and these have been operated effectively. During 
the year no conflicts arose which would require the Board to exercise authority or discretion in relation to such conflicts. Changes to the Articles are 
proposed to be made at the Annual General Meeting and these are described in the appendix to the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Takeover Directive Disclosures
The additional information required to be disclosed under the Takeover Directive Disclosures is set out below. The disclosures below are in some cases 
a summary of the relevant provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association and the relevant full provisions can be found in the Articles, which are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. 
Share capital
The rights attaching to the Company’s shares are set out in its Articles of Association. At 31 March 2010, the Company’s issued share capital consisted 
of a single class of ordinary shares with a nominal value of 3.33 pence.
Subject to any restrictions referred to in the next section, members may attend any general meeting of the Company. Voting rights attaching to the 
ordinary shares are described in the next section.
Members can declare final dividends by passing an ordinary resolution but the amount of the dividends cannot exceed the amount recommended by 
the Board. The Board can pay interim dividends provided the distributable profits of the Company justify such payment. The Board may, if authorised 
by an ordinary resolution of the members, offer any member the right to elect to receive new shares, which will be credited as fully paid, instead of 
their cash dividend. Any dividend which has not been claimed for twelve years after it became due for payment will be forfeited and will then revert 
to the Company.
If the Company is wound up, the liquidator can, with the sanction of the members by special resolution and any other sanction required by law, divide 
among the members all or any part of the assets of the Company and he/she can value any assets and determine how the divisions shall be carried out 
as between the members or different classes of members. The liquidator can also transfer the whole or any part of the assets to trustees upon any 
trusts for the benefit of the members. No members can be compelled to accept any asset which would give them any liability.
There are no special control rights in relation to the Company’s shares.
Subject to any restrictions below, on a show of hands every member who is present at a general meeting has one vote on each resolution and, 
on a poll, every member who is present has one vote on each resolution for every share of which he/she is the registered member. 
A resolution put to the vote of a general meeting is decided on a show of hands, unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, 
a poll is demanded by the Chairman of the meeting, or by at least two members present in person (or by proxy) and having the right to vote, or by any 
member or members present in person (or by proxy) having at least one tenth of the total voting rights of all members, or by any members present in 
person (or by proxy) holding shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up of at least one tenth of the total sum paid up on all shares conferring 
that right. Under the terms of the AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008, the trustees will abstain from voting shares in the Company held by the Trust.
A member may vote personally or by proxy at a general meeting. Any form of proxy sent by the Company to members in relation to any general 
meeting must be delivered to the Company not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which 
the person named in the appointment proposes to vote. A corporation which is a member of the Company may authorise such persons as it thinks fit 
to act as its representatives at any general meeting of the Company.

Takeover Directive Disclosures continued
Share capital continued
In the case of joint holders, the vote of the senior who tenders the vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes 
of the other joint holders. For this purpose seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the register of members. No member 
shall be entitled to attend or vote, either personally or by proxy, at a general meeting in respect of any share if any call or other sum presently payable 
by him to the Company in respect of such share remains unpaid.
The Board may direct that a member shall not be entitled to attend or vote, either personally or by proxy, at a general meeting in respect of some 
or all of the shares held by him/her (the Default Shares) if he/she or any person with an interest in shares has been sent a notice under Section 793 
of the Companies Act 2006 (which confers upon public companies the power to require information with respect to interests in their voting shares) 
(a “Section 793 Notice”) and he/she or any interested person fails to supply the Company with the information requested within 14 days after 
delivery of that notice. These restrictions end seven days after receipt by the Company of all the information required by the relevant Section 793 Notice. 
The Board may refuse to register a transfer unless:
>> it is in respect of a share which is fully paid up;
>> it is in respect of only one class of share;
>> it is in favour of a single transferee or not more than four joint transferees;
>> it is duly stamped (if so required); and
>>  it is delivered for registration to the office or such other place as the Board may from time to time determine, accompanied (except in the case 
of a transfer by a recognised person where a certificate has not been issued or in the case of a renunciation) by the certificate for the shares to 
which it relates and such other evidence as the Board may reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor or person renouncing and the due 
execution of the transfer or renunciation by him/her or, if the transfer or renunciation is executed by some other person on his/her behalf, 
the authority of that person to do so; provided that the Board shall not refuse to register any transfer or renunciation of partly paid shares which 
are listed on the London Stock Exchange on the grounds that they are partly paid shares in circumstances where such refusal would prevent 
dealings in such shares from taking place on an open and proper basis.
The Board may decide to suspend the registration of transfers, for up to 30 days a year, by closing the register of members. The Board cannot suspend 
the registration of transfers of any uncertificated shares without gaining consent from CREST. 
There are no restrictions on transfer of the ordinary shares in the Company other than: certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority whereby certain 
employees of the Company require the approval of the Company to deal in the ordinary shares. 
There are no agreements between holders of securities that are known to the Company which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights.
Change of control
All of the Company’s share-based plans contain provisions relating to change of control. Outstanding awards and options normally vest and become 
exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time.
There are no significant agreements to which the Company is a party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid.
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs 
because of a takeover bid.
Other substantial shareholdings
On 26 May 2010, the Company had been notified, in accordance with Disclosure and Transparency Rule 5, of the following interests in the ordinary share 
capital of the Company:

Articles of Association
The Articles of Association of the Company may be amended by special resolution. There are no conditions contained in the Memorandum in relation 
to the alteration of the Articles of Association of the Company.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to its Articles of Association and relevant statutory law and to any direction that may be given by the Company in general meeting by special 
resolution, the business of the Company shall be managed by the Directors, who may exercise all powers of the Company which are not required to be 
exercised by the Company in general meeting. At the Annual General Meeting in 2009 the Directors were granted authority to allot (a) relevant securities 
up to an aggregate nominal amount of £753,542.97 and (b) equity securities up to an aggregate nominal amount (when added to allotments under 
(a) above of £1,507 ,085.94 where the allotment is in connection with a rights issue). A renewal of this authority is being sought at the 2010 Annual 
General Meeting.

Appointment of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that at each Annual General Meeting of the Company one third of the Directors (or if their number 
is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to but not exceeding one third) shall retire from office. Those Directors who are required to 
retire at each Annual General Meeting shall be, first, any Director who wishes to retire (and not offer himself for reappointment) and second, those 
Directors who have been longest in office since their last appointment or reappointment. Any Director who retires at an Annual General Meeting may, 
if willing to act, be reappointed. 
Additionally, new Directors may be appointed by the Board but are subject to election by members at the first opportunity after their appointment. 
The Articles of Association limit the number of Directors to not less than two and not more than ten save where members decide otherwise. Members 
may remove any Director (subject to the giving of special notice) and, if desired, replace such removed Director by ordinary resolution. 
In accordance with Corporate Governance best practice, all Directors who served during the year (with the exception of David Mann) will stand 
for re-election together with Hervé Couturier, being the first Annual General Meeting since his appointment.
Charitable and political donations
During the year the Group made charitable donations totalling £35,590 (2009 – £49,145) of which £10,000 was paid to MacMillan Cancer Support 
and £10,000 to The Prince’s Trust. The remainder was donated to local and national charities.
During the year the Group did not make any political donations (2009 – £nil).
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held on 7 July 2010 at The Trinity Centre, 24 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4 0FN. The Notice 
of the Annual General Meeting is being sent to shareholders along with this Annual Report which contains details of the resolutions proposed. 
Further details of particular resolutions are set out below.
Authority to repurchase ordinary shares
Resolution 12 set out in the Notice convening the Annual General Meeting gives authority to the Company to purchase its own ordinary shares up 
to a maximum of 6,792,820 ordinary shares until the earlier of 6 October 2011 and the date of the next Annual General Meeting. This represents 10% 
of the ordinary shares in issue at 26 May 2010 and the Company’s exercise of this authority is subject to the stated upper and lower limits on the 
price payable which reflects the requirements of the UK Listing Authority. Your Directors believe that it is advantageous for the Company to have this 
flexibility to make market purchases of its own shares. Shares will only be repurchased if earnings per share are expected to be enhanced as a result 
and the Directors believe it is in the best interests of shareholders generally. To the extent that any shares so purchased are held in treasury, earnings 
per share will be enhanced until such time, if any, as such shares are resold or transferred out of treasury.
The Company has the choice of cancelling shares which have been repurchased or holding them as treasury shares (or a combination of both). 
Treasury shares are essentially shares which have been repurchased by the Company and which it is allowed to hold pending either reselling them 
for cash, cancelling them or, if authorised, using them for the purposes of its employee share plans.
The Directors believe that it is desirable for the Company to have this choice. Holding the repurchased shares as treasury shares would give the 
Company the ability to reissue them quickly and cost effectively and would provide the Company with additional flexibility in the management 
of its capital base. No dividends will be paid on, and no voting rights will be exercised, in respect of treasury shares.
As at 26 May 2010 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the notice of the Annual General Meeting), there were 378,220 
outstanding options granted under all share option plans operated by the Company which, if exercised, would represent 0.22% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company at that date. If this authority and any existing authority were exercised in full and the shares repurchased were to be 
cancelled, such options, if exercised, would represent 0.25% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
Authorities to allot shares and disapply pre-emption rights
Resolution 13
The Directors may allot shares and grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares only if authorised to do so by shareholders. 
The authority granted at the last Annual General Meeting is due to expire at this year’s Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, resolution 13 will be 
proposed as an ordinary resolution to grant new authorities to allot shares and grant rights to subscribe for, or convert that security into, shares 
(a) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £754,757.86 and (b) in connection with a rights issue, up to an aggregate nominal amount (reduced by 
allotments under part (a) of the resolution) of £1,509,515.72.
These amounts represent approximately 33.3% and approximately 66.7% respectively of the total issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 
26 May 2010 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this notice). If given, these authorities will expire at the Annual General Meeting 
in 2011 or on 6 October 2011, whichever is the earlier. Where usage of these authorities exceeds the thresholds suggested by the Association of 
British Insurers (“the ABI”), all of the Directors will stand for re-election at the following Annual General Meeting to the extent required by the ABI.
The Directors have no present intention of issuing shares pursuant to this authority. 
As at 26 May 2010 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this notice) the Company holds no treasury shares.

Authorities to allot shares and disapply pre-emption rights continued
Resolution 14
The Directors also require a power from shareholders to allot equity securities or sell treasury shares for cash otherwise than to existing shareholders 
pro rata to their holdings. The power granted at the last Annual General Meeting is due to expire at this year’s Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, 
resolution 14 will be proposed as a special resolution to grant such a power. Apart from offers or invitations in proportion to the respective number 
of shares held, the power will be limited to the allotment of equity securities and sales of treasury shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value 
of £113,213.68 (being 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital at 26 May 2010 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the 
Notice)). If given, this power will expire on 6 October 2011 or at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2011, whichever is the earlier. 
The Directors will have due regard to institutional guidelines in relation to any exercise of this power, in particular the requirement for advance 
consultation and explanation before making any non pre-emptive cash issue pursuant to this resolution which exceeds 7.5% of the Company’s 
issued share capital in any rolling three year period. 
New Articles of Association
It is proposed in resolution 15 to adopt new Articles of Association (the “New Articles”) in order to update the Company’s current Articles of 
Association (the “Current Articles”), primarily to take account of the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 and the implementation 
of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal changes introduced in the New Articles are summarised in the appendix to the Notice of Annual General Meeting. Other changes, 
which are of a minor, technical or clarifying nature and also some more changes which merely reflect changes made by the Companies Act 2006 
and the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 have not been noted in the appendix to the Notice of Annual General Meeting. 
The New Articles and the Current Articles are available for inspection, as noted in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Notice required for shareholder meetings
The Shareholders Rights Directive was implemented in the UK in August 2009. The regulation implementing this Directive increases the notice 
period for general meetings of the Company to 21 days unless shareholders agree to a shorter notice period. On the basis of a resolution passed at 
the 2009 Annual General Meeting, the Company is currently able to call general meetings (other than an Annual General Meeting) on 14 clear days’ 
notice and would like to preserve this ability. Resolution 16 seeks such approval. The approval will be effective until the Company’s next Annual 
General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed. The Company will also need to meet the requirements for electronic 
voting under this Directive before it can call a general meeting on 14 days’ notice. The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of 
routine for general meetings. However, the flexibility offered by this resolution will be used where, taking into account the circumstances, including 
whether the business of the meeting is time-sensitive, the Directors consider this appropriate in relation to the business to be considered at the 
general meeting in question.
Employee benefit trust
The AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008 was established in 2008 to facilitate satisfying the transfer of shares to employees within the Group on 
exercise of vested options under the various share option and deferred bonus share plans of the Company. On 28 May 2009, the Trust acquired in the 
open market an aggregate of 89,016 ordinary shares in AVEVA Group plc at a price of £7.29 for total consideration of £653,000. The Trust holds a total 
of 122,770 ordinary shares in AVEVA Group plc representing 0.18% of the issued share capital at the date of this report. Under the terms of the Trust 
deed governing the Trust, the trustees of the Trust are required (unless the Company directs otherwise) to waive all dividends in respect of ordinary 
shares in AVEVA Group plc held by the Trust except where beneficial ownership of any such ordinary shares was passed to a beneficiary of the Trust. 
In the same way as other employees, the Executive Directors of the Company are potential beneficiaries under the Trust.
Disabled employees
The Group gives full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons where the candidate’s particular aptitudes and abilities are 
consistent with adequately meeting the requirements of the job. Opportunities are available to disabled employees for training, career development 
and promotion.
Where existing employees become disabled, it is the Group’s policy to provide continuing employment wherever practicable in the same or an alternative 
position and to provide appropriate training to achieve this aim as well as reasonable adjustments to the workplace and other support mechanisms.
Employee involvement
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has continued to keep them informed of matters affecting them as 
employees and on the various factors affecting the performance of the Group. This is achieved through formal and informal meetings, the Group 
intranet and presentations from senior management. There is an employee representative committee which meets on a regular basis to discuss a 
wide range of matters affecting their current and future interests. All employees are entitled to receive an annual discretionary award related to the 
overall profitability of the Group subject to the performance of the individual and the Group. The Group conducts employee wide surveys from time 
to time to gauge the success or otherwise of its policies and uses this information to improve matters as appropriate.
Directors’ qualifying third party indemnity provisions
The Company has granted an indemnity to its Directors against liability in respect of proceedings brought by third parties, subject to the conditions 
set out in the Companies Act. Such qualifying third party indemnity provision remains in force as at the date of approving the Directors’ report.

auditors are unaware; and
>>  he has taken all the steps he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any such relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Responsibility statement pursuant to FSA’ s Disclosure and Transparency Rule 4 (DTR 4)
Each Director of the Company (whose names and functions appear on page 29) confirms that (solely for the purpose of DTR 4) to the best of his knowledge:
>>  the financial statements in this document, prepared in accordance with the applicable UK law and applicable accounting standards, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company and of the Group taken as a whole; and
>>  the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review and Finance Director’s review include a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Company and Group taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.

Corporate Governance statement
Statement of compliance with the code of best practice
The Company is committed to the principles of Corporate Governance contained in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance which is appended 
to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority (the Combined Code) and for which the Board is accountable to shareholders. The Company 
has complied with the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code throughout the year except for the following:
>>  A.7.2 – One Non-Executive Director (David Mann) who served during the year does not have a contract of employment for a specific term due to 
his appointment being prior to the issue of the 2003 Combined Code. In April 2010, it was announced that Mr Mann will retire as a Director at the 
Annual General Meeting in July 2010.
The Company has applied these Principles of Good Governance set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code, including both the main principles and 
supporting principles, by complying with the Combined Code as noted above.
Further explanation of how the principles have been applied is set out below and, in connection with Directors’ remuneration, in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on page 40.
Composition of the Board
During the year the Board comprised the Chairman, three Non-Executive Directors (including the Senior Independent Director) and two Executive 
Directors (being the Chief Executive and Finance Director). 
During the year the Board considered the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and, in the light of this evaluation, prepared a 
description of the role and capabilities required for a new Non-Executive Director with a strong software technology background and experience of 
managing and delivering large scale software solution projects.
In April 2010, the Company announced the appointment of Hervé Couturier as a Non-Executive Director and the Board believes that he will bring 
significant skills and experience in these areas. Further details of the process for the appointment of Mr Couturier are contained in the Nominations 
Committee report.
In addition, in April 2010, it was announced that following eleven years of invaluable service to the Group, David Mann will retire as Non-Executive Director 
and Senior Independent Director at the Annual General Meeting in July 2010.

Operation of the Board
The AVEVA Group Board meets regularly in combination with the Board of AVEVA Solutions Limited, the main operating company in the Group which 
owns all of the Group’s trading subsidiaries. The AVEVA Solutions Limited Board includes as members the Head of Product Development and the Head 
of Group Operations as well as all the members of the Group Board. This ensures that the AVEVA Group Board is well informed on technical and market 
factors driving the Group’s performance as well as on financial outcomes.
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group. There is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for the 
Board’s decision that covers key areas of the Group’s affairs, which includes:
>>  overall responsibility for the strategy of the Group; 
>>  Corporate Governance;
>>  review of trading performance and forecasts;
>>  risk management;
>>  Board membership; 
>>  communications with shareholders;
>>  approval of major transactions, including mergers and acquisitions; and 
>>  approval of the financial statements and annual operating and capital expenditure budgets.
The Board met ten times during the year and the Board also conducted a strategy meeting and visited key locations, receiving presentations from 
senior management. The Board delegates the day to day responsibility for managing the Group to the Executive Directors. The Chairman ensures that 
the Board functions effectively, overseeing the timely and effective provision of information to the Board. To enable the Board to discharge its duties, 
all Directors receive appropriate and timely information. Briefing papers are distributed by the Company Secretary to all Directors in advance of Board 
meetings and all members of the Audit Committee, Remuneration, Nomination and Treasury Risk Management Committees respectively prior to 
meetings of such Committees.

Meetings were held between the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors during the year, without the Executives being present, to discuss 
appropriate matters as necessary. 
The Chairman ensures that the Directors take independent professional advice where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as 
Directors at the Group’s expense in the appropriate circumstances. All members of the Board have access to the advice of the Company Secretary. 
Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors are encouraged annually to undertake training in furtherance of their specific roles and general 
duties as a Director.
Performance evaluation
The Combined Code requires that the Board undertakes a formal annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its Committees and individual Directors.
In the course of the year the Chairman, in conjunction with the other members of the Nominations Committee, conducted a review of the structure 
and skills of the Board and the performance of individuals. One decision which emanated from this review was the desirability of adding to the collective 
skills of the Board a stronger Non-Executive input on technology issues and this led to the appointment of Hervé Couturier as a Non-Executive Director. 
Overall the performance of the Board and its Committees was considered to be satisfactory but some ideas for changes in the way the Board handles 
its business in relation to the provision of information and the focus of Board meetings were generated by these consultations and these will be 
introduced in the current year. As part of the Board review process the performance of the Chairman was assessed by the Senior Independent Director 
following consultation with the other Non-Executive Directors.
Indemnities to Directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, Directors are granted an indemnity from the Company to the extent permitted by law in 
respect of liabilities incurred as a result of the performance of their duties in their capacity as Directors to the Company. The indemnity would not 
provide any coverage to the extent the Director is proven to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. The Company has maintained Directors’ and 
officers’ liability insurance cover throughout the year.
Policy on appointment and re-appointment
In accordance with the Articles of Association, all Directors are required to retire and submit themselves for re-election at least every three years by 
rotation, and also following their appointment. Following his appointment in April 2010, Hervé Couturier is subject to election at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. In addition, in accordance with Corporate Governance best practice, all of the remaining Board members are offering 
themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting.
On appointment, all Directors are asked to confirm that they have sufficient time to devote to the role which is confirmed together with details 
of their duties in the letter of appointment. All Directors undergo an induction as soon as practical following their appointment. As part of the 
induction process, Directors are provided with background information on the Group and attend the Group’s headquarters in Cambridge for meetings 
and presentations from senior management. In addition, where appropriate, meetings are also arranged with the Group’s advisers. 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a term of three years with the exception of David Mann who does not have a specific term of appointment 
because he was appointed prior to the issue of the 2003 Combined Code. In April 2010, it was announced that Mr Mann will retire from the Board at 
the Annual General Meeting in July 2010. The terms and conditions of appointment of Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office during normal business hours and will be available for inspection on the day of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Independence of Non-Executive Directors and segregation of duties
The Board has considered the independence of the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors and believes that all are currently independent 
of management and free from any material business or other relationships that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent 
judgement. Their biographies on page 27 demonstrate a range of experience and sufficient calibre to bring the independent judgement on issues 
of strategy, performance, resources and standards of conduct which is vital to the Group. 
David Mann is the Senior Independent Director and he will have served eleven years as a Non-Executive Director in June 2010. In April 2010, it was 
announced that David Mann would retire as Non-Executive Director and Senior Independent Director at the Annual General Meeting in July 2010.
Notwithstanding his length of service, the Board believes that Mr Mann has remained and remains independent during the term of his appointment 
and continues to be effective in his role and demonstrates commitment to the role. He has never had any business relationship with the Group, 
has never been an employee and has never participated in any share option plan or been a member of the Group’s pension schemes.

Directors’ report
Independence of Non-Executive Directors and segregation of duties continued
Hervé Couturier was appointed to the Board in April 2010. After a formal review, the Board has concluded that Mr Couturier is independent 
in character and judgement, and that:
>>  he has never been an employee of the Group;
>>  he has never had any material business relationship with the Group;
>>  he does not receive any remuneration other than Director’s fees;
>>  he does not have any close family ties with other Directors or senior management of the Group or advisers to the Group;
>>  he has no significant links with other Directors or senior management or advisers to the Group through involvement with other companies; and
>>  he does not represent a material shareholder of the Group.
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are distinct and the division of responsibility between these roles has been clearly established, 
set out in writing and agreed by the Board. The Chairman is responsible for the effectiveness of the Board and ensuring that it meets its obligations 
and responsibilities. The Chief Executive is responsible for providing overall leadership, providing management to the Group and for the execution 
of the Group’s strategic and operating plans.
Committees of the Board
The Board has four Committees: Audit, Remuneration, Nominations and Treasury Risk Management. In accordance with the Combined Code, 
the duties of the Committees are set out in formal terms of reference. They are available on request from the Company’s registered office during 
normal business hours and are available on the Company’s website at www.aveva.com.
Nominations Committee
Committee Chairman: Nick Prest 
Committee Members: Jonathan Brooks
  Philip Dayer
The Nominations Committee was formed in April 2009. The Chief Executive is invited to attend meetings as appropriate to the business being 
considered. The activities of the Nominations Committee include nomination, selection and appointment of Non-Executive and Executive Directors, 
succession planning and the composition of the Board, particularly in relation to the diversity of skills and experience. The Nominations Committee 
meets periodically when required. In addition to the meetings there are a number of ad-hoc meetings to address specific matters.
On 1 April 2010, Hervé Couturier was appointed to the Board. An external search consultant, Russell Reynolds, was instructed by the Nominations 
Committee to assist in the identification of appropriate candidates having considered the requisite skills, knowledge and experience required for the 
position. All short listed candidates were interviewed and as a result Mr Couturier was selected and his appointment was then recommended to and 
approved by the Board. 
On 5 October 2009, Paul Taylor (Finance Director) was appointed a Non-Executive Director of Anite plc. Prior to the appointment, the Board 
considered the impact on his role as Finance Director and concluded that he could still devote sufficient time to his Finance Director role and 
therefore approved that Mr Taylor could accept the appointment.
Remuneration Committee
Committee Chairman: David Mann
Committee Members: Nick Prest
  Jonathan Brooks
  Philip Dayer
The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the Group’s policy for Executive and senior management remuneration 
and determines the individual remuneration packages on behalf of the Board for the Executive Directors of the Group. The Chief Executive attends 
meetings by invitation, except when the Chief Executive’s own remuneration package is being discussed. 
The Committee has access to professional advice, both inside and outside the Company, in the furtherance of its duties. The Directors’ remuneration 
report sets out in more detail the Remuneration Committee’s policies and practices on Executive remuneration.
Audit Committee
Committee Chairman: Jonathan Brooks
Committee Members: Philip Dayer
  David Mann
The Chairman of the Committee is deemed by the Board to have recent and relevant financial experience. He is a Chartered Management Accountant 
and has held a number of senior financial positions in his career. Hervé Couturier will join the Audit Committee from the date of the Annual General 
Meeting (7 July 2010) being the date that David Mann will retire. The Committee invites the Finance Director and senior representatives from the 
auditors to attend meetings as appropriate to the business being considered. Subsequent to the year end, an Audit Committee meeting was held to 
review the results of the audit, which was attended by all members.

Committees of the Board continued
Audit Committee continued
The Audit Committee met twice during the year to review the scope of the audit and the audit procedures, the format and content of the audited 
financial statements and interim reports, including the notes and the accounting principles applied. The Audit Committee members (as part of the 
full Board) review all proposed announcements to be made by the Group to the extent that they contain financial information. The Audit Committee 
considers compliance with legal requirements, accounting standards and the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority and also reviews any proposed change in accounting policies and any recommendations from the Group’s auditors regarding improvements 
to internal controls and the adequacy of resources within the Group’s finance function. The Audit Committee advises the Board on the appointment of 
external auditors and on their remuneration both for audit and non-audit work, and discusses the nature, scope and results of the audit with external 
auditors. The Audit Committee keeps under review the cost effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the external auditors. Controls in 
place to ensure this include monitoring of the independence and effectiveness of the audit, implementing a policy on the engagement of the external 
auditors to supply non-audit services, and a review of the scope of the audit and fee and performance of the external auditors. The Audit Committee 
monitors fees paid to the auditors for non-audit work and delegates the authority for approval of such work to the Finance Director where the level of 
fees involved are insignificant. During the year there was limited non-audit work performed by the auditors which mainly consisted of tax compliance 
work for subsidiaries of the Group and other statutory filing work. Any significant non-audit work such as reporting accountant engagements would 
require prior approval from the Audit Committee. 
The Group engages other independent firms of accountants to perform tax consulting work and other consulting engagements to ensure that the 
independence of the auditors is not compromised. Audit partners are rotated every five years and a formal statement of independence is received 
from the auditors each year. The Board and the Audit Committee are satisfied that the independence of the auditors has been maintained.
An analysis of non-audit fees is provided in note 7 to the financial statements. 
There is a formal whistle-blowing policy which has been communicated to employees. This policy provides information on the process to follow in the 
event that any employee feels it is appropriate to make a disclosure. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the policy provides an adequate basis for 
employees to make representations in confidence to the Group and for appropriate and proportionate investigations.
The Board and the Audit Committee have considered the requirement to have an internal audit function and, given the Group’s relative size, do not 
consider one necessary at this point but will continue to monitor this annually.
Treasury Risk Management Committee (TMRC)
Committee Chairman: Philip Dayer
Committee Members: Jonathan Brooks
  Paul Taylor
The TMRC was formed in April 2009 to oversee the Group’s treasury function given the increasing importance of managing the Group’s treasury 
activities and associated risks. In addition to the above members, the Head of Finance and Group Treasurer are also invited to attend the meetings. 
The TMRC reviews the Group’s overall financial risk management including:
>>  foreign exchange risk and related hedging policy;
>>  credit risk which includes monitoring the Group’s counter-party exposure to banks; and
>>  liquidity risk which includes reviewing the cash management structure in the Group.
The policies of the Group in relation to these areas are explained in note 24 to the financial statements.
During the year the TMRC met twice to discuss the above matters and provided a report to the Board after each meeting.
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given high priority by the Board. The Chief Executive and the Finance Director have meetings with representatives 
of institutional shareholders and hold analyst briefings at least twice a year, following the announcement of the interim and full year results, but also 
at other times during the year as necessary. The Chairman also met with certain shareholders during the year to discuss strategy and performance of 
the business. Senior managers from Product Development, Business Strategy and Finance also attended analyst and shareholder meetings during 
the year. All of these meetings seek to build a mutual understanding of objectives with major shareholders by discussing long-term strategy and 
obtaining feedback. The Board also receives formal feedback from analysts and institutional shareholders through the Company’s public relations 
adviser and financial adviser. The Board is also appraised of discussions with major shareholders to ensure that Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
consider any matter raised by shareholders and to enable all Directors to understand shareholder views. The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, 
David Mann, is available to shareholders if they have concerns which contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance 
Director has failed to resolve or if such contact would be inappropriate. The Chairman, Senior Independent and Non-Executive Directors are available 
for dialogue with shareholders at any time and attend (together with the other members of the Board) the Annual General Meeting, but are not routinely 
involved in investor relations or shareholder communications. Corporate information is also available on the Company’s website, www.aveva.com.

any questions.
Share capital structure
Further information on the share capital structure of the Company and the Takeover Directive Disclosures is contained on pages 30 to 32.
Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for monitoring its effectiveness. However, such a system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure and by its very nature can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board has established a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks the Group faces. The Board regularly 
reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls, which have been in place from the start of the year to the date of approval of this report 
and believes that it is in accordance with the Turnbull Guidance. 
The key elements of the systems of internal controls currently include: 
>>  an Executive Board comprising the Executive Directors, Head of Group Operations, Head of Product Development and Head of Human Resources. 
Each member has responsibility for specific aspects of the Group’s operations. They meet on a regular basis and are responsible for the operational 
strategy, reviewing operating results, identification and mitigation of risks and communication and application of the Group’s policies and 
procedures. Where appropriate, matters are reported to the Board;
>>  regular reports to the Board from the Executive Directors, Head of Group Operations, Head of Product Development, Head of Human Resources 
and Sales Division Managers on key developments, financial performance and operational issues in the business;
>>  operational and financial controls and procedures which include authorisation limits for expenditure, sales contracts and capital expenditure, 
signing authorities, organisation structure, Group policies, segregation of duties and reviews by management; 
>>  an annual budget process which is reviewed, monitored and approved by the Board; 
>>  regular meetings between the Executive Board, Sales Division managers and Product Development managers to discuss actual performance 
against forecast, budget and prior years. The operating results are reported on a monthly basis to the Board and compared to the budget and 
the latest forecast as appropriate; and
>>  maintenance of insurance cover to insure all major risk areas of the Group based on the scale of the risk and availability of the cover in the 
external market.
The Board’s monitoring covers all material controls, including financial, non-financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management. 
It is based principally on reviewing reports from management to consider whether significant risks are identified, evaluated, managed and controlled 
and whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The Board periodically carries out 
visits to the Group’s subsidiaries and during the year travelled to Asia to meet with senior management from the Asia Pacific region and receive 
presentations on their operations. 
The Board has also performed a specific assessment for the purpose of this Annual report. This involved reviewing the reports from a risk assessment 
workshop involving the Executive Board and senior members of management from Product Development, Sales and Finance/Legal. The workshop was 
conducted in January 2010 and was facilitated by a third party. This assessment considered all significant aspects of internal control arising during 
the period covered by the report. The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities.

Directors’ remuneration report
This report has been prepared in accordance with sections 420 and 421 of the Companies Act 2006 and the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Services Authority (together the Regulations). The report also describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance 
relating to Directors’ remuneration. As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
of the Company at which the financial statements of the Company will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report on the ‘auditable part’ of the Directors’ remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, 
that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The report has therefore been divided into separate 
sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Role of the Remuneration Committee 
The Board sets the remuneration policy for the Group. The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board within its agreed terms 
of reference, details of which are available at www.aveva.com.
The Remuneration Committee’s principal responsibility is to determine the remuneration package of both the Company’s Executive Directors and 
its senior management within broad policies agreed with the Board. In addition, it reviews the remuneration policy for the Company as a whole and 
administers the Company’s share incentive plans for all participants. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Executive 
Directors and the Chairman, not the Committee.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Remuneration Committee were finalised in two formal meetings during the year, but these were 
preceded by several informal discussions, including some with advisers (none of whom had any other connection with the Company). The members 
of the Committee were David Mann (Chairman), Nick Prest, Jonathan Brooks and Philip Dayer. 
The Chief Executive (Richard Longdon) is invited to submit recommendations to the Remuneration Committee and both he and the members of the 
Committee take into consideration relevant external market data as well as the reviews of remuneration for employees of the Group generally.
Remuneration policy 
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that members of the Executive management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage 
enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group. It also 
aims for a combination of fixed and variable payments, benefits and share-based awards that will achieve a balance in incentives to achieve short 
and long term goals. The Company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of remuneration of Executive Directors should be performance-related. 
The payment of bonuses and the vesting of share incentives are subject to meeting performance conditions established by the Committee at the 
beginning of each performance period reflecting what, at that time, the Committee considers demanding targets. These targets are set taking 
account of the market in which the Group operates and the expectations of investment community on the Group’s future potential performance.
The Remuneration Committee has access to detailed external research from independent consultants and during the year engaged Hewitt New Bridge 
Street to review the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior management and to benchmark their remuneration against comparable 
companies. Hewitt New Bridge Street do not provide other services to the Group. 
In 2008 the Board introduced the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme 2008 (the Deferred Share Scheme) for Executive Directors 
and selected employees to enable the bonus scheme to have a deferred component. Subject to the achievement of performance conditions relating to 
a single financial year, these incentive arrangements are intended to reward the recipient partly in cash, payable on announcement of interim and/or 
final results, and partly in ordinary shares in the Company to be delivered on a deferred basis under the Deferred Share Scheme. 
The Board believes that these incentive arrangements closely align the interests of Executive Directors and employees with shareholders’ interests.
Outside appointments
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that Board approval is sought prior to accepting the 
appointment. Whether or not the Director concerned is permitted to retain their fees is considered on a case by case basis. As noted above, 
Paul Taylor was appointed a Non-Executive Director of Anite plc during the year. His annual fee on appointment was £37 ,000. As Mr Taylor 
performs these services independently of his duties to the Company, he is thus entitled to receive such compensation.

Remuneration policy continued
The individual components of the remuneration packages offered are:
Basic salaries/fees
It is the policy of the Committee to pay base salaries to the Executive Directors taking account of the nature and scale of the business of the Group, 
the performance of the individual in achieving financial and non-financial goals within his areas of responsibility and comparable market data.
In 2009/10, the Remuneration Committee took into account the uncertain market conditions and, in seeking to ensure that remuneration policies 
remained appropriate, Directors’ salaries were frozen at 2008/09 levels in keeping with the general pay freeze adopted by the Group.
In keeping with a general review of salaries for the Group as a whole, the salaries for Executive Directors were reviewed in March 2010 with any 
adjustment to take effect from 1 April 2010. As a result the Executive Directors received salary increases of 3% set slightly below the average increase 
across the Group. As of the date of this report, the fees for the Non-Executive Directors had not been reviewed and will be reviewed during the course 
of the year. Details of the current salaries and fees are as follows:
           £
Nick Prest           85,000
David Mann          33,000
Jonathan Brooks          35,000
Philip Dayer          30,000
Hervé Couturier*          39,000
Richard Longdon          335,265
Paul Taylor          216,300
* From date of appointment (1 April 2010).
Fees for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are determined taking account of the individual’s responsibilities, time devoted to the role 
and prevalent market rates. 
Benefits
Executive Directors are provided with a Company car or a mobility allowance and a fuel allowance. Non-Executive Directors do not receive any benefits.
Bonus payments
The Executive Directors participate in annual performance-related bonus arrangements determined by the Committee. As noted above, these 
arrangements include a component using the Deferred Share Scheme. Under these incentive arrangements, depending on the extent to which 
performance conditions are achieved, an overall bonus amount is determined. Part of this overall bonus amount is payable in cash; an amount equal 
to the balance is used to calculate the number of ordinary shares which the bonus recipient is eligible to receive on a deferred basis. This is calculated 
by identifying the number of ordinary shares which could be purchased with the balance at the mid-market closing price of an ordinary share on the 
dealing day immediately preceding the preliminary announcement of the Company’s results for the financial year in which the bonus was earned.
The arrangements are based substantially or entirely on the performance of the Group as a whole geared towards exceeding internal and external 
expectations of normalised profit before tax with 10% based on achievement for the six months to 30 September and 90% based on the full year results. 
For the annual performance bonus arrangements for 2009/10, the targets were set after considering the Group’s budgeted normalised profit before 
tax and market expectations. The agreed targets were considered to be appropriate and stretching against the budgeted profit for 2009/10 and 
market conditions prevailing at that time. For 2009/10, the maximum bonus amount which an Executive Director could earn was 100% of basic salary. 
Performance targets were achieved in full resulting in a cash bonus equal to 60% (2009 – 60%) of basic salary with the remaining 40% (2009 – 40%) 
of the bonus amount being used to calculate the number of deferred shares for which each Executive Director was eligible.
Pensions
During the year, the two Executive Directors (Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor) were members of AVEVA Solutions Limited’s defined benefit pension 
scheme. It is a contributory, funded, occupational pension scheme registered with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and, since 1 October 2004, 
Career Average Revalued Earnings benefits apply. Under this scheme they are entitled to a pension on normal retirement, or on retirement due to ill 
health, equivalent to two-thirds of their pensionable salary provided they have completed (or would have completed in the case of ill health) 25 years’ 
service. A pension earnings cap (in line with historic HMRC’s earning cap) applies to Paul Taylor when calculating pensionable salary. Similarly, a 
scheme-specific earnings limit applies to the benefits earned by Richard Longdon. A lower pension is payable on earlier retirement after the age of 50 
by agreement with the Company and subject to HMRC guidelines. Pensions are payable to dependants on the Director’s death in retirement and a lump sum 
is payable if death occurs in service. No other Directors were members of a pension scheme during the year (2009 – nil).
On 31 August 2009, Mr Longdon had accrued the maximum benefits that he was entitled to under the rules of the pension scheme and as a result left 
the pension scheme. Mr Longdon was paid a one-off sum of £25,000 on leaving the pension scheme.

Remuneration policy continued
Share awards
The Remuneration Committee considers that periodic grants of share-related incentives should constitute an important element of the remuneration 
of the Company’s senior Executives, in line with common practice in comparable companies. The Company’s share schemes have therefore been used 
to provide long term incentives to assist in creating and sustaining growth in share value. 
There are four schemes in existence, the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme (the ability to grant shares under this scheme has 
now expired), the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme 2008, the AVEVA Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan and the 
AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007. No awards have been made under the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 
and the performance conditions that would apply to them remain to be determined. The Company would consult with major shareholders before 
setting any performance conditions. 
The number of shares which may be allocated on exercise of any options granted under any of the Company’s share option schemes (including 
employee schemes) shall not, when aggregated with the number of shares which have been allocated in the previous ten years under these schemes, 
exceed 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to that date. The share schemes are used to provide incentives to 
Senior Managers as well as Executive Directors. As recipients of these awards, Executive Directors and Executive Board members are required to hold 
or use the schemes to build share ownership with a value of at least 100% of their then current salary. Details of the awards made under these 
schemes are as follows: 
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The Company established the AVEVA Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which was approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting held in 
2004. Under the LTIP , options are granted to selected individuals to acquire ordinary shares at an exercise price equal to the nominal value of the 
shares; these options will be exercisable only if stringent performance criteria are met. There are no rules under the LTIP scheme which govern the 
maximum awards that can be made to participants. However in 2009/10 the market value of awards under the LTIP awarded to Richard Longdon and 
Paul Taylor amounted to 50% of basic salary (2009 – 50%). It is not expected that material changes will be made to the level of awards under the LTIP 
without consultation with shareholders.
Details of the outstanding awards under the LTIP are as follows:
2006/07 awards
In 2006/07 a total of 42,588 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP. The performance conditions were based on 
average growth in earnings per share (EPS) achieved over the three years from 2006/07 to 2008/09. If average EPS growth was greater than 15% per 
annum then all of the shares would vest. If average EPS growth was less than 7.5% per annum none of the shares would vest. If average EPS growth 
was between 7.5% and 15% then the number of shares that would vest would be determined by linear interpolation. The Remuneration Committee 
considered that these were challenging performance conditions in the context of the Company’s budget and market expectations at the time of 
the awards. 
The performance conditions were measured in accordance with the terms of the grant and all awards vested in full.
2007/08 awards
In 2007/08, a total of 18,234 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP. The performance conditions are based on 
average growth in EPS over the years from 2007/08 to 2009/10. If average EPS growth is greater than 11.5% per annum then all of the shares shall 
vest. If average EPS is less than 9% per annum then none of the shares shall vest. If average EPS growth is between 9% and 11.5% per annum then the 
number of shares that shall vest shall be determined by linear interpolation. The Remuneration Committee considered that these were challenging 
performance conditions in the context of Company’s budget and external expectations at the time of the awards.
Although the vesting date has not yet been reached, it is anticipated that the performance conditions attached to this award will be met following 
finalisation of the 2009/10 financial results. However this is still subject to the approval of the Remuneration Committee at the time of announcement 
of the results.
2008/09 awards
In 2008/09, a total of 17 ,929 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP. The performance conditions are based on average 
growth in EPS over the years from 2008/09 to 2010/11. If average EPS growth is greater than 14% per annum then all of the shares shall vest. If average 
EPS is less than 10% per annum then none of the shares shall vest. If average EPS growth is between 10% and 14% per annum then the number of 
shares that shall vest shall be determined by linear interpolation. The Remuneration Committee considered that these were challenging performance 
conditions in the context of internal and external expectations at the time of the awards.
2009/10 awards
In 2009/10, a total of 36,628 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP. In view of the general economic background, 
the Remuneration Committee gave especially careful consideration to what performance conditions would be appropriate and finally agreed that 
they should be based on average diluted EPS over the three years from 2009/10 to 2011/12. All shares under this option shall vest if average diluted 
EPS for the three years ending 31 March 2012 is equal to or above 52.14 pence. Should average diluted EPS for the period be below 52.14 pence, 
then no shares will vest and the option will lapse. The Remuneration Committee considered that these were challenging performance conditions 
in the context of internal and external expectations at the time of the awards.

Deferred annual bonus share plan
As described above, part of the annual bonus earned by Executive Directors in the year is used to determine eligibility for an award of deferred shares 
under the Deferred Share Scheme. In order to deliver shares under the Deferred Share Scheme, an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) was established following 
shareholder approval at the 2008 Annual General Meeting. Awards of deferred shares are made by the trustee of EBT using shares purchased in the 
market. The awards, which take the form of nil-cost options, will normally deliver the deferred shares to participants in three equal tranches, one in 
each of the three years following the year in which an award is made by the EBT. These awards are made solely in respect of performance in the 
financial year immediately prior to their grant. Delivery of the deferred shares is not subject to further financial performance conditions provided 
that the participant remains an employee or Director of the Group. If the participant ceases to be an employee or Director, entitlement to all 
outstanding tranches would fall away unless the cessation occurs by reason of his or her death. Following the death of a bonus participant, or on a 
takeover, reconstruction or amalgamation, or voluntary winding up of the Company, the period for which the participant must remain an employee or 
Director would be reduced below the normal three years and entitlement to delivery of the shares would be accelerated. There are no arrangements 
for the delivery of additional matching shares to a participant in any circumstances.
On 27 May 2009 the EBT awarded 22,487 and 14,508 deferred shares to Richard Longdon and Paul Taylor respectively in respect of the bonus 
arrangements for the year ended 31 March 2009. 
Following the achievement of the objectives for 2009/10, it is anticipated that 12,471 and 8,046 deferred shares will be awarded to Richard Longdon 
and Paul Taylor respectively in respect of the bonus arrangements for the year ended 31 March 2010. 
Total shareholder return performance graph
The Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 require the presentation of a performance graph of 
total shareholder return compared with a broad equity market index for a period of five years. The following graph shows the Company’s performance, 
measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the techMARK All-Share Index. Total shareholder return is the share price 
plus dividends reinvested compared against the techMARK All-Share Index, rebased to the start of the period. 
Total shareholder return v techMARK All-Share Index 2005–2010
The Directors consider the techMARK All-Share Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index includes AVEVA Group plc.
Service contracts
The service contracts and letters of appointment of the Directors include the following terms:
   Date of Date of Expiry/review Notice period 
   contract appointment date of current contract Months
Nick Prest  10 January 2006 11 January 2006 11 January 2012 3
David Mann  17 May 2000 8 June 1999 Rolling 3
Jonathan Brooks  12 July 2007 12 July 2007 12 July 2010  3

Richard Longdon  28 November 1996 28 November 1996 Rolling 12
Paul Taylor  17 October 1989 1 March 2001 Rolling 9
The Committee considers that the notice periods of the Executive Directors are in line with those in other companies of a similar size and nature 
and are in the best interests of the Group to ensure stability in senior management. 
There are no predetermined special provisions for Executive or Non-Executive Directors with regard to compensation in the event of loss of office. 
The Remuneration Committee would be responsible for considering the circumstances of the early termination of an Executive Director’s contract and 
determining whether in exceptional circumstances there should be compensation payments in excess of the Company’s contractual obligations.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the Consolidated financial statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the Consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
The Directors are required to prepare Consolidated financial statements for each financial year which present fairly the financial position of the Group 
and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that period. In preparing those Consolidated financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
>>  select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 and then apply them consistently; 
>>  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
>>  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
>>  state that the Group has complied with IFRSs, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Group and enable them to ensure that the Consolidated financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
This Annual report contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Rather, they 
are based on current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to 
differ from any future results or developments expressed or implied from the forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking statement speaks 
only as of the date of the particular statement and save to the extent required by the applicable law or regulation, we do not undertake any obligation 
to update or renew any forward-looking statement.

Independent auditor’ s report
to the members of AVEVA Group plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of AVEVA Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2010 which comprise the Consolidated income 
statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated balance sheet, the Consolidated statement of changes in 
shareholders’ equity, the Consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 30. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 46, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
>>  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2010 and of its profit for the year then ended;
>>  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
>>  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
>>  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the Group 
financial statements; and
>>  the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 35 to 39 with respect to internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
>>  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
>>  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
>>  the Directors’ statement, set out on page 29, in relation to going concern; and
>>  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 35 to 39 relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2010 and on the 
information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1 Corporate information
AVEVA Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the 
registered office is given on page 28. AVEVA Group plc’s shares are publicly traded on the Official List of the London Stock Exchange. 
2 Basis of preparation
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2010. 
The Consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (£) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£000) except when 
otherwise indicated.
The Group presents adjusted profit before tax on the face of the Consolidated income statement disclosing those material items of operating income 
and expense which materially impact the underlying performance of the business. Historically these items have included amortisation of intangible 
assets, share-based payments and restructuring costs. From 2009/10, the Group has chosen to also adjust for the gain/loss on the fair value of 
foreign currency contracts because this is a non-cash item and has become material due to the volatility of the underlying exchange rates. 
Comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The Directors believe that adjusted profit before tax allows shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, 
so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods in assessing trends in financial performance. 
a) Statement of compliance
The Consolidated financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and all its subsidiaries (the Group) have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the European Union, as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 
31 March 2010. The Group’s financial statements are also consistent with IFRSs as issued by the IASB. 
The parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc have been prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(UK GAAP) and are included on pages 82 to 86.
b) Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of AVEVA Group plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March each year. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using existing GAAP for each country of operation. Adjustments are made to translate any 
differences that may exist between the respective local GAAPs and IFRSs.
Inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-Group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control 
is transferred out of the Group.
On acquisition, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, with any excess of the cost 
of acquisition over this value being capitalised as goodwill.
c) Adoption of new and revised standards
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows:
The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year. The other pronouncements which came into 
force during the year were not relevant to the Group.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment (Revised)
The IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 2 which clarifies the definition of vesting conditions and prescribes the treatment for an award that is 
cancelled. The Group adopted this amendment as of 1 January 2009. It did not have an impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures
The amended standard requires additional disclosures about fair value measurement and liquidity risk. Fair value measurements related to items 
recorded at fair value are to be disclosed by source of inputs using a three level fair value hierarchy, by class, for all financial instruments recognised 
at fair value. In addition, a reconciliation between the beginning and ending balance for level 3 fair value measurements is now required, as well 
as significant transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy. The amendments also clarify the requirements for liquidity risk disclosures with 
respect to derivative transactions and assets used for liquidity management. The fair value measurement disclosures are presented in note 24(e). 
The liquidity risk disclosures are not significantly impacted by the amendments and are presented in note 24(c).
IFRS 8 Operating Segments
IFRS 8 replaced lAS 14 Segment Reporting upon its effective date. The Group concluded that the operating segments determined in accordance with 
IFRS 8 are the same as the business segments previously identified under lAS 14. IFRS 8 disclosures are shown in note 6, including the related revised 
comparative information.
lAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
The revised standard separates owner and non-owner changes in equity. The Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity includes 
only details of transactions with owners, with non-owner changes in equity presented in a reconciliation of each component of equity. In addition, 
the standard introduces the statement of comprehensive income: it presents all items of recognised income and expense, either in one single 
statement, or in two linked statements. The Group has elected to present two statements.

Improvements to IFRSs
In May 2008 and April 2009 the IASB issued an omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and 
clarifying wording. There are separate transitional provisions for each standard. The adoption of the following amendments resulted in changes 
to accounting policies and disclosures but did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group:
>> IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations;
>> IFRS 8 Operating Segment Information;
>> lAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements; and
>> lAS 18 Revenue.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations (Revised) and lAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (Amended)
IFRS 3 (Revised) introduces significant changes in the accounting for business combinations. The new standard is effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. However, the Group has decided to adopt this standard early. During the year the Group recognised the 
benefit of tax losses of £500,000 attributable to an acquisition completed in a previous period. The impact is included within the current income tax 
expense. Had the standard not been adopted early, an adjustment to goodwill would have been required. Changes affect the valuation of non-controlling 
interests, the accounting for transaction costs, the initial recognition and subsequent measurement of a contingent consideration and business 
combinations achieved in stages. These changes impact the amount of goodwill recognised, the reported results in the period that an acquisition 
occurs and future reported results. lAS 27 (Amended) requires that a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary (without loss of control) is 
accounted for as a transaction with owners in their capacity as owners. Therefore, such transactions no longer give rise to goodwill, nor does it give 
rise to a gain or loss. Furthermore, the amended standard changes the accounting for losses incurred by the subsidiary as well as the loss of control 
of a subsidiary. The changes by IFRS 3 (Revised) and lAS 27 (Amended) will affect future acquisitions or loss of control of subsidiaries and transactions 
with non-controlling interests. 
New standards and interpretations not yet effective
During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standard which is expected to have implications for the reporting of the financial 
position or performance of the Group or which will require additional disclosures in future financial years:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement
This is the first part of a new standard to replace IAS 39. IFRS 9 has two measurement categories: amortised cost and fair value. All equity 
instruments are measured at fair value. A debt instrument is at amortised cost only if the entity is holding it to collect contractual cash flows and 
the cash flows represent principal and interest. Otherwise it is at fair value through profit or loss. Published by the IASB in November 2009, this 
is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. This standard is not yet endorsed by the European Union.
3 Significant accounting estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:
a) Defined benefit pension schemes
The determination of the Group’s obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection, by the Board of Directors, 
of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts. The assumptions applied are described in note 26 and include, 
amongst others, the discount rate, the inflation rate, rates of increase in salaries and mortality rates. While the Directors consider that the assumptions 
are appropriate, significant differences in the actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the amount of the 
Group’s future pension obligations, actuarial gains and losses included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years 
and the future staff costs. The carrying amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 March 2010 was £13,082,000 (2009 – £8,764,000).
4 Summary of significant accounting policies
a) Revenue
The Group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to a lesser extent, 
indirectly through resellers. Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable 
for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business, net of discounts and sales taxes. It comprises of initial licence fees, annual fees 
and rental licence fees, together with income from consultancy and other related services.
For each revenue stream, revenue is not recognised unless and until:
>> a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced;
>> delivery has been made in accordance with that contract;
>> if required, contractual acceptance criteria have been met; and
>> the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable.

Financial statements – Group
4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
a) Revenue continued
Initial/annual licence agreements
Users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee, which is charged every 
year. Annual fees consist of the right to use and customer support and maintenance, which includes core product upgrades and enhancements and 
remote support services. Users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the right to use the software.
Initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met. Annual fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of 
the contract, which is typically twelve months. If annual fees are charged at a discount, an amount is allocated out of the initial licence fee at fair 
market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customers.
Rental licence agreements
As an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model, the Group also supplies its software under three different types of rental licence agreement.
Rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis.
Other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period, are non-cancellable and consist of two separate components, 
the right to use and customer support and maintenance. Revenue in respect of the customer support and maintenance element is valued at fair 
market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customer. This component is recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the contract. The residual amount representing the right to use element is recognised upfront, provided all of the above 
criteria have been met.
The Group also licenses its software using a token licensing model. Under this model, a ‘basket of tokens’ representing licences to use the software 
over a defined period is granted, which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required. Where the customer commits in advance to 
a specified number of tokens over a defined period, a proportion of revenue is recognised with an appropriate element deferred for customer support 
and maintenance obligations, subject to the above recognition conditions being met. Where the customer is charged in arrears, revenue is recognised 
based on actual number of tokens used.
Services
Services consist primarily of consultancy, implementation services and training and are performed on a time and material basis under separate 
service arrangements. Revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed. 
b) Foreign currencies
The functional and presentational currency of AVEVA Group plc is Pounds Sterling (£). Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in 
the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated 
at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the Balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the Consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of the 
initial transaction.
The subsidiaries have a number of different functional currencies. As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries 
are translated into Pounds Sterling (£) at the rate of exchange ruling at the Balance sheet date, and their Income statements are translated at the 
weighted average exchange rates for the year. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are taken directly to the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income. 
c) Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisitions is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirer’s interest in the 
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses. 
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the 
operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill 
disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating 
unit retained.
If the potential benefit of tax losses or other deferred tax assets does not satisfy the criteria in IFRS 3 for separate recognition when a business 
combination is initially accounted for but is subsequently realised, the Group recognises the deferred tax income in the Consolidated income statement.
d) Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition. 
Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to each class of intangible assets as set out below. 
Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets, excluding development costs, is taken to the Consolidated income statement in the year in 
which it is incurred. Internal software development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial 
viability can be demonstrated.

4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
d) Intangible assets continued
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. Amortisation is calculated 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the asset, which are as follows:
           Years
Developed technology          5–12
Customer relationships          20
Other software          3
Purchased software rights          5–10
e) Research expenditure
Research expenditure is written off in the year of expenditure.
f) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down the assets to their estimated residual value over the useful economic life of the asset 
as follows:
           Years
Computer equipment          3
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment         6–8
Motor vehicles          4
Leasehold improvements are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease (3 to 49 years) or useful economic life, if shorter. 
g) Impairment of assets
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination’s synergies and represents the lowest 
level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are independent of other cash-generating 
units. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually or when events 
or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other 
than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may be impaired. If any such 
indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash-generating units are written down to 
their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the 
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment losses are recognised in the Income statement in the administrative expenses line item.
h) Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any 
uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off 
when identified.
i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the Consolidated balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less. The carrying amount of these approximates their fair value. For the purpose of the Consolidated cash flow statement, cash 
and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
j) Derivative financial instruments
The only derivative financial instruments the Group holds are forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk. 
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The Group has not applied hedge accounting during 
the year and therefore all forward foreign exchange contracts have been marked-to-market and are held at fair value on the Consolidated balance 
sheet with any movements being recorded in the Consolidated income statement. Fair value is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the 
period end.
k) Leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating lease 
payments are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
l) Taxation
Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the Balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences:
>>  except where the deferred income tax liability arises from goodwill amortisation or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
>>  in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused 
tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised:
>>  except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss; and
>>  in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each Balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance sheet date.
The income tax effects of items recorded in either other comprehensive income or equity are recognised in the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income or the Consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity respectively. Otherwise, income tax is recognised in the 
Consolidated income statement. 
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales taxes except:
>>  where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax 
is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
>>  receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales taxes included.
The net amount of sales taxes recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the 
Consolidated balance sheet. 
m) Post retirement benefits
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, Sweden and Germany. The Group also provides certain post employment benefits 
to its South Korean employees. 
The UK defined benefit pension scheme, previously available to all UK employees, was closed to new applicants in 2002. UK employees are now 
offered membership of a defined contribution scheme.
The German unfunded defined benefit scheme is closed to new applicants and provides benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition 
in 1992 by Tribon. No current employees participate in the scheme. Full provision has been made for the liability on the Consolidated balance sheet. 
The Group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one German employee.
The Group provides pension arrangements to its Swedish employees through an industry-wide defined benefit scheme. It is not possible to identify 
the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme which is attributable to the Group on a fair and reasonable basis. Therefore the Group 
has applied the provisions in IAS 19 to account for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution scheme.
For the defined benefit schemes, the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually for each plan by independent actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period (to determine current service cost) and to the current and prior periods 
(to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation). The retirement benefit liability in the Consolidated balance sheet represents the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate derived from a published index of AA rated corporate bonds) as reduced by the fair value of 
plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities 
is the published bid price. The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover by 
way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions. The current service cost is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as 
an employee benefit expense. The interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in present value of scheme obligations resulting 
from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account 
material changes in the obligation during the year. The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year 
of long term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid 
during the year. The expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as finance revenue and 
finance costs respectively.

4 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
m) Post retirement benefits continued
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited in the Consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes for a number of UK and non-UK employees. Contributions to defined contribution 
plans are charged to profit before tax as they become payable.
n) Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted, further details 
of which are given in note 27. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked 
to the price of the shares of AVEVA Group plc (market conditions).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance 
conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting date). The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which 
are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. In addition, 
an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for 
the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the 
date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous 
paragraph. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share, subject to 
an estimate of whether performance conditions will be met.
o) Employee benefit trust
The Group has established an employee benefit trust (AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008) which is a separately administered trust and 
is funded by loans from Group companies. The assets of the trust comprise shares in AVEVA Group plc and cash balances. The Group recognises 
assets and liabilities of the trust in the Consolidated financial statements and shares held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction from 
shareholders’ equity.

6 Segment information
For management purposes the Group is organised into three geographical segments known as Sales divisions: Asia Pacific; Americas; and Europe, 
Middle East and Africa (EMEA). On 1 April 2009, Central, Eastern and Southern (CES) Europe Sales division and Western Europe, Middle East and 
Africa (WEMEA) Sales division were merged to form EMEA. Comparatives have been restated to reflect this change. Each segment is determined by the 
location of the Group’s operations and is organised and managed separately due to the differing local requirements in each market. Sales divisions 
are granted distribution rights to license the Group’s software to customers in their respective territories. The segments identified under IFRS 8 are 
unchanged from those previously identified under IAS 14.
The Executive Board, comprising of the Chief Executive, Finance Director, Head of Group Operations, Head of Product Development and Head of 
Human Resources, monitors the operating results of the Sales divisions for the purposes of making decisions about performance assessment and 
resource allocation. Sales division performance is evaluated based on profit before tax using the same accounting policies as adopted for the Group’s 
financial statements. There is no inter-segment revenue. Balance sheet information is not included in the information provided to the Executive Board. 
Support functions such as product development and head office departments are controlled and monitored centrally.
Information concerning the Group’s segments is set out below:

The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are based on the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent for the year of 
£33,440,000 (2009 – £42,154,000). Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the 
parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by 
dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year 
plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive share options into ordinary 
shares. Details of the terms and conditions of share options are provided in note 27.

The denominators used are the same as those detailed above for both basic and diluted earnings per share. The adjusted earnings per share 
comparative has been restated to include the gain/loss on the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The adjustment made to profit after tax in calculating adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share has been adjusted for the tax effects of the items 
adjusted in the current year. The preceding year has been restated to reflect this.
The Directors believe that adjusted earnings per share is a more representative presentation of the underlying performance of the business.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGUs as follows:

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
15 Goodwill continued
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those 
regarding discount rates and growth rates. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. 
The growth rates are based on management’s estimates of growth in those specific markets based on past experience and external market information.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the year ending 31 March 2011 
and extrapolates cash flows for future years based on an average estimated growth rate of 2% for each CGU (2009 – 2%), representing the long term 
average growth rate for the Group’s CGUs. Future cash flows are discounted in line with the weighted average cost of capital of approximately 10% 
pre-tax (2009 – 10%).
Whilst it is conceivable that a key assumption in the calculation could change, the Directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to key 
assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value.

For the purposes of the adjusted earnings per share calculation (note 14), intangible asset amortisation excludes the charge relating to other 
software of £84,000 (2009 – £56,000).
Developed technology
Developed technology includes the Realitywave developed technology which was acquired as part of the acquisition of Realitywave Inc. in 2005 and 
the Tribon Solutions AB developed technology which was acquired in 2004. The Tribon developed technology was amortised over five years using the 
straight-line method and is now full written down. The Realitywave developed technology is being amortised over twelve years using the straight-line 
method. In addition, this caption includes the developed technology intangible asset acquired as part of the acquisition of iDesign Office Pty Limited 
in March 2009 which is being amortised over five years on a straight-line basis.
Customer relationships
The customer relationships intangible asset was acquired as part of the acquisition of Tribon Solutions AB and is being amortised over twenty years 
using the straight-line method.
Other software
Other software represents third party software and is being amortised over three years using the straight-line method. 
Purchased software rights
Purchased software rights arose on the acquisition of the products ‘FOCUS’ for £1,700,000 and ‘VANTAGE’ for £1,500,000 in 1999 and OPE software 
for £323,000 in 2000. These purchased software rights were amortised on a straight-line basis over ten years and are now fully depreciated. In 2007 the 
Group acquired a source code licence for certain software from Spescom Software Inc. for the sum of £1,040,000 ($2,000,000). This software is being 
amortised on a straight-line basis over five years.
During the year the Group acquired licences for third party software components that are included in the suite of AVEVA products at a cost 
of £1,180,000. The licences have a term of five years and accordingly are being amortised on a straight-line basis over that period.

Borrowing facilities
At 31 March 2009 and 2010 the Group had no committed UK bank overdraft or loan facility. 
In addition, in both years, the Group had a committed overdraft facility of SEK 10,000,000 (£915,000) (2009 – SEK 10,000,000 (£845,000)) of which 
£nil (2009 – £nil) had been drawn down.
The bank overdraft is secured by a floating charge over certain of the Group’s assets.
23 Obligations under leases 
At 31 March 2010 the Group had the following future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as follows:

The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties, motor vehicles and items of equipment. These leases have a duration of between 
one and five years. Certain property leases contain an option for renewal.
24 Financial risk management
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, treasury deposits and forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into forward foreign currency contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Group’s operations.
It is, and has been, throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies 
for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below:
a) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the value 
of its holding of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable 
parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group holds net funds, and hence its interest rate risk is associated with short-term cash deposits and treasury deposits. The Group’s overall 
objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return. During the 
year the treasury policy was amended to enable the Group to put treasury deposits in place with a maturity of up to six months.
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables 
on profit or loss and shareholders’ equity. The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and treasury 
deposits. The Group does not have any significant borrowings. The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest rates to the cash and cash 
equivalents and treasury deposit balances.
A 1% decrease in the Sterling and US Dollar interest rate would have reduced interest income by approximately £670,000 (2009 – £1,033,000) 
and profit after tax by £480,000 (2009 – £738,000).

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
24 Financial risk management continued
a) Market risk continued
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations. 
These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the Group’s functional currency of Sterling. The majority of costs are 
denominated in the functional currency of the business unit. The main exposures relate to the US Dollar and Euro reflecting the fact that a significant 
proportion of the Group’s revenue and cash receipts are denominated in these currencies whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research and 
Development, are settled in Sterling and Swedish Krona.
The Group manages these exchange risks, where possible, by using currency exchange contracts and currency options for the sale of US Dollar 
and Euro as appropriate. During the year the Group has started to use forward exchange contracts for Japanese Yen. The Group enters into 
specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts when the timing of forecast cash flows is reasonably 
certain. In addition, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to sell US Dollars and Euro to match forecast cash flows arising from 
its recurring revenue base. These are renewed on a revolving basis as required. At 31 March 2010, the Group had outstanding currency exchange 
contracts to sell $24.5 million (2009 – $23.5 million), €12.8 million (2009 – €15.2 million) and JPY 120 million (2009 – JPY nil). In addition, 
in previous periods, the Group has utilised option instruments which included various provisions that, depending on the spot rate at maturity, give 
either the Group or the counterparty the option to exercise. At 31 March 2010, the Group had outstanding currency options under which the Group 
may, under certain circumstances, be required to sell up to $nil million (2009 – $10.5 million). 
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts have 
been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk. There is currently no requirement for 
borrowings and therefore this risk is not managed through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies. Gains and losses arising 
from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes in the foreign exchange 
rates in profit or loss or shareholder’s equity. The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate to the monetary assets 
and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency 
and being of a monetary nature; differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Group’s presentation currency are not 
taken into consideration.
A 10% change in the US Dollar against Sterling, Euro against Sterling and Swedish Krona against Sterling would have impacted equity and profit after 
tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown. In management’s opinion, this is a reasonably possible change given current market 
conditions. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant. The analysis is 
performed on the same basis for 2008/09.
         Increase/ Profit/

         (10%) (948) (948)
The movement in profit for the period is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to exchange movements in US Dollar, Swedish Krona and Euro 
denominated monetary assets and liabilities.

b) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash equivalents, treasury deposits, trade and other receivables. 
Counterparties for cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits are governed by the treasury policy, which has been approved by the Board, 
and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit rating agencies. The amount of exposure 
to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit of £50 million as set out in the Group’s treasury policy. 
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business. The amounts 
presented in the Consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is 
an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The Group has 
credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis. Credit checks are performed before credit is granted to new customers. 
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset. The exposure to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit 
or payments in advance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
Disclosures relating to the credit associated with trade receivables are in note 19.
c) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching 
the maturity of financial assets and liabilities. The Group has no significant borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is not considered 
a significant risk at this time.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities, which will be settled on a net basis, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining 
period at the Balance sheet to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows:

e) Fair values
The book values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities consist of bank and cash balances of £43,169,000 (2009 – £126,164,000) and treasury 
deposits of £106,555,000 (2009 – £nil). The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities in the Group’s financial statements 
approximates their fair values. 
In addition the Group’s financial liabilities also include forward foreign exchange contracts. Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value 
subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable. The 3 levels are defined 
as follows:
>>  Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
>>  Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset 
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
>>  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs).
At 31 March 2010 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition. 
The estimation of the fair value of the liability in respect of foreign exchange contracts is £1,033,000 at 31 March 2010 (2009 – liability of £4,643,000).
The resulting gain of £3,610,000 (2009 – loss of £3,737 ,000) on the movement of the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is recognised 
in the Consolidated income statement under administrative expenses.
f) Capital management
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor market, creditor, customer and employee confidence and to sustain 
future development of the business. The capital structure of the Group consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of AVEVA Group plc comprising 
of issued share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new 
shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2009 or 2010.
The Board monitors the capital structure on a regular basis and determines the level of annual dividend. The Group is not exposed to any externally 
imposed capital requirements.

* A deferred tax liability arises on the difference between the tax base and the accounting base of a long leasehold property that was acquired in 1994.
Other deferred tax assets consist principally of deferred tax on bad debt provision, forward foreign exchange contracts, staff bonus accrual and 
timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for financial 
reporting purposes:
          2010 2009 
          £000 £000
Deferred tax liabilities         (1,426) (1,589)
Deferred tax assets         5,016 5,514
          3,590 3,925
At the Balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £5,072,000 (2009 – £3,810,000) available for offset against future profits. Of the total 
deferred tax asset of £1,584,000 (2009 – £1,287 ,000), £nil (2009 – £580,000) has been recognised and is included in ‘other’ above. No deferred tax 
asset has been recognised in respect of the balance due to the unpredictability of future profit streams, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the Balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately £23,300,000 (2009 – £38,800,000). No liability has been recognised in respect 
of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemptions 
but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by AVEVA Group plc to its shareholders.

a) UK defined benefit scheme
The Group operates a UK defined benefit pension plan providing benefits based on final pensionable pay which is funded. This scheme was closed 
to new employees on 30 September 2002 (with the option of re-opening if required) and was converted to a Career Average Revalued Earnings basis 
on 30 September 2004. Pensions are payable to dependants on death in retirement and a lump sum is payable if death occurs in service. There is an 
insurance policy in place which covers this liability. Administration on behalf of the members is governed by a Trust Deed, and the funds are held 
and managed by professional investment managers who are independent of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are made in accordance with advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary, BDO Stoy Hayward Investment 
Management Limited, at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the scheme using the projected unit credit method. 
The employees’ contributions are fixed as a percentage of salary, the balance being made up by the employer. Scheme assets are stated at their market 
values at the respective Balance sheet dates.
To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free 
investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio 
is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. 
The principal assumptions used in determining the pension valuation were as follows:
          2010 2009 
          % %
Main assumptions:
Rate of salary increases         5.70 5.10
Rate of increase of pensions in payment        3.40 3.00
Rate of increase of pensions in deferment        3.70 3.10
Discount rate         5.50 6.60
Inflation assumption         3.70 3.10
Expected rate of return on scheme assets:
Equities         6.65 7.15
Bonds         4.00 3.70
Other         0.50 0.50
For the years ended 31 March 2010 and 2009, the following weighted average life expectancy at age 65 for mortality has been used:
          2010 2009 
          Years Years
Male pensioners         24.1 23.8
Female pensioners         26.6 26.4
Non-retired males         2 7.0 26.7
Non-retired females         28.9 28.5
Member contributions were 7.5% (2009 – 7.5%) of pensionable salary and Company contributions were £2,239,000 (2009 – £1,877 ,000). 
The total contributions in 2011 are expected to be approximately £2,069,000.
The assumed discount rate, inflation rate and mortality all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation. The following table shows the 
sensitivity of the valuation to changes in these assumptions:
         Impact on deficit 
         increase/(decrease)
          2010 2009

– discount rate         (2,227) (1,475)
– inflation (including pension increases linked to inflation)       1,332 845
Additional one year increase to life expectancy        860 586
The assets and liabilities of the scheme at 31 March 2010 and 2009 were as follows:
           2010 2009 
          £000 £000

The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses since 1 April 2004 recognised directly within other comprehensive income was a loss of 
£9,424,000 (2009 – loss of £4,630,000). The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to 
IFRSs and taken to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income of £8,500,000 in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses 
since inception of the pension schemes. Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would 
have been recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income before 1 April 2004.

b) German defined benefit schemes
There are two defined benefit pension schemes in AVEVA GmbH. Tribon Solutions GmbH operated an unfunded defined benefit scheme that provides 
benefits to three deferred members following an acquisition in 1992. No current employees participate in the scheme and it is closed to new applicants. 
Benefit payments are made as they fall due. The scheme was transferred to AVEVA GmbH when Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH merged 
in 2005.
In addition, AVEVA GmbH operates a defined benefit pension scheme for one employee. This scheme is closed to new members. 
Details of the actuarial assumptions used to value these schemes in accordance with IAS 19 are set out below: 
         2010  2009
Rate of increase of pension in payment      1.50%–2.50% 1.75%–2.50%
Discount rate       5.30%–6.20% 5.50%–6.20%
Mortality       13 years 14 years
Rate of salary increases       0%–2.50% 0%–2.50%
The retirement age for the Tribon Solutions GmbH and AVEVA GmbH schemes was 60 and 63 years of age respectively (2009 – 60 and 63 years of age).
Analysis of movements in the present value of the defined benefit pension obligations during the year are set out below:
          2010  2009 
          £000  £000

Exchange adjustment         (35) 91
At 31 March         703 624
The contributions in 2011 are expected to be approximately £80,000.
c) South Korean severance pay
South Korean employees are entitled to a lump sum on severance of their employment equal to one month’s salary for each year of service. 
An IAS 19 valuation of the liability has been carried out using the following assumptions:
          2010  2009 
          % %
Rate of salary increases         5.00 7.00
Discount rate         3.70 4.90
Inflation assumption         2.60 4.40
The retirement age for AVEVA Korea Limited employees is 60 years of age (2009 – 60 years of age). 
Analysis of movements in the present value of the obligation during the year are set out below:
           2010 2009 
          £000 £000

d) Other retirement schemes
All Swedish employees employed by AVEVA AB aged 28 or over are members of the ‘ITP’, an industry scheme for salaried employees which provides 
benefits in addition to the state pension arrangements. The ITP scheme is managed by Alecta, a Swedish insurance company. It is a multi-employer 
defined benefit scheme with a supplementary defined contribution component. AVEVA AB pays monthly premiums to the insurers which vary by age, 
service and salary of the employee. AVEVA AB is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a fair and reasonable 
basis because this information is not provided by the scheme and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution pension 
scheme. At 31 March 2010, Alecta’s surplus in the form of collective funding level was 143% (2009 – 122%) which was calculated in accordance with 
the Swedish Annual Accounts Act for Insurance Companies. The total cost charged to income was £741,000 (2009 – £545,000).
e) Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates defined contribution retirement schemes for certain UK, US, German, French, Norwegian and Asian employees. The assets of the 
schemes are held separately from those of the Group. The total cost charged to income of £1,844,000 (2009 – £2,002,000) represents contributions 
payable to these schemes by the Group at the rates specified in the rules of the plans.

27 Share-based payment plans
The Group operates four equity-settled share option schemes, the AVEVA Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP); the AVEVA Group plc Employee 
and Executive Share Option Scheme (Executive Scheme and Employee Scheme respectively); and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 
2007 (2007 scheme). The Executive and Employee schemes lapsed in 2006 and no grants have been made under the 2007 scheme which was approved 
at the Annual General Meeting on 12 July 2007. The Group also operates a deferred annual bonus share plan. Details of these plans are set out below.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share options for both plans during 
the year:

         378,220 263,399 
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding at 31 March 2010 is 5.63 years (2009 – 5.0 years).
The average fair value of options granted during the year was £6.84 (2009 – £14.13). In calculating the fair value, the expected life of the options 
is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that 
the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome. 
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was £nil to £0.03 (2009 – £nil to £2.65).
The Group recognised total expenses of £1,184,000 and £940,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the years ended 
31 March 2010 and 2009 respectively.
Details of the share option plans are as follows:
a) Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The following awards have been made under the LTIP. The exercise price is equal to the nominal value of the underlying shares, which is 3.33 pence. 
Options under the LTIP are normally exercisable in full or in part between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant.
2009/10 awards
On 7 July 2009, a total of 137 ,839 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP. The performance 
conditions are based on average diluted earnings per share over the three years from 2009/10 to 2011/12. All shares under this option shall vest 
if average diluted earnings per share for the three years ending 31 March 2012 is equal to or above 52.14 pence. Should average diluted earnings 
per share for the period be below 52.14 pence, then no shares will vest and the option will lapse. 
The fair value of these option awards is measured at grant date using the Black Scholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2010:
           Year ended

2008/09 awards
On 7 July 2008, a total of 50,033 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP. The performance 
conditions are based on average growth in earnings per share over the years from 2008/09 to 2010/11. If average earnings per share growth is 
greater than 14% per annum then all of the shares shall vest. If average earnings per share is less than 10% per annum then none of the shares shall 
vest. If average earnings per share growth is between 10% and 14% per annum then the number of shares that shall vest shall be determined by 
linear interpolation. 
The fair value of these option awards is measured at grant date using the Black Scholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and

Weighted average share price          £14.92

2007/08 awards
On 2 July 2007 , a total of 59,663 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP. This scheme was used 
because the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option and Employee Share Option schemes originally introduced in 1996 had expired and the new scheme, 
which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 12 July 2007 , had not yet been established. The performance conditions 
are based on average growth in earnings per share over the years from 2007/08 to 2009/10. If average earnings per share growth is greater than 
11.5% per annum then all of the shares shall vest. If average earnings per share growth is less than 9% per annum then none of the shares shall 
vest. If average earnings per share growth is between 9% and 11.5% per annum then the number of shares that shall vest shall be determined 
by linear interpolation.

subject to performance conditions which are based on average growth in earnings per share achieved over the three years from 2006/07 to 2008/09. 
If average earnings per share growth is greater than 15% per annum then all of the shares shall vest. If average earnings per share growth is less 
than 7.5% per annum none of the shares shall vest. If average earnings per share growth is between 7.5% and 15% then the number of shares that 
shall vest will be determined by linear interpolation.
The fair value of these option awards is measured at grant date using the Black Scholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2007:

b) Employee and executive share option plan
Options have also been granted under the AVEVA Group plc Employee Share Option Scheme and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 
(the Employee and Executive Scheme). The exercise price is equal to the market price at the time of the award. Options under this plan are normally 
exercisable in full or in part between the third and seventh anniversaries of the date of grant.
2005/06 awards
On 20 July 2005, a total of 255,531 options were awarded under the Employee and Executive Scheme. The performance conditions required to be 
achieved for the exercise of the option would be that earnings per share in the financial year ending 31 March 2008 would have grown no less than 
5% above the Retail Price Index per annum from that achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2005.
The fair value of these option awards is measured at grant date using the Black Scholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2006:

c) Deferred annual bonus share plan
In 2008 the Company established the AVEVA Group Management Bonus Deferred Share Scheme 2008 (the Deferred Share Scheme). Directors and 
senior management participate in this scheme. Subject to the achievement of performance conditions relating to a single financial year, these 
incentive arrangements are intended to reward the recipient partly in cash, and partly in ordinary shares in the Company to be delivered on a 
deferred basis. 
In May 2009, the AVEVA Group Employee Benefit Trust 2008 awarded 89,016 (2009 – 36,448) deferred shares to the Executive Directors and 
senior management in respect of the bonus earned in the year ended 31 March 2009 (2009 – bonus earned in year ended 31 March 2008).
The awards of deferred shares take the form of nil-cost options exercisable by participants in three equal tranches, one in each of the three years 
following the year in which the award is made. The option may be exercised in the 42-day period beginning on the announcement of the financial 
results of the Group in each of the three calendar years after that in which the option was granted. The last date of the exercise is the end of the 
42-day period following the announcement of the financial results of the Group in the third calendar year following that in which the option was 
granted or (if applicable) such later date as the Remuneration Committee may specify. These awards are made solely in respect of performance 
in the financial year immediately prior to their grant. Delivery of the deferred shares is not subject to further performance conditions but each 
participant is required to remain an employee or Director of the Group during the three-year vesting period in order to receive his deferred shares 
in full (except in the case of death or the occurrence of a takeover, reconstruction or amalgamation, or voluntary winding up of the Company).
The fair value of these option awards is measured at grant date using the Black Scholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the year ended 31 March 2010:
           Year ended

d) AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007
The above scheme was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2007. No awards have yet been made under this scheme and 
performance conditions will be set when awards are made under this scheme.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the Company financial statements 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare 
the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or 
loss of the Company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
>> select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
>> make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
>>  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
>> prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Independent auditor’ s report 
to the members of AVEVA Group plc
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of AVEVA Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2010 which comprise the Balance sheet 
and the related notes 1 to 11. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 80, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements:
>> give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2010;
>> have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
>> have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
>> the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
>>  the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
parent Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
>>  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
>>  the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
>> certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
>> we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of AVEVA Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2010.

Notes to the Company financial statements
1 Corporate information
AVEVA Group plc (the Company) is a limited company incorporated in England and Wales whose shares are publicly traded. The principal activity 
of the Company is that of a holding company.
2 Accounting policies
A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have all been applied consistently throughout the current and the preceding year, is set out below:
a) Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and law. 
As permitted by Financial Reporting Standard No. 1 (Revised) ‘Cash flow statements’, the Company has not included a Cash flow statement as part of its 
financial statements because the Consolidated financial statements of the Group (of which the Company is a member) include a Cash flow statement 
and are publicly available.
b) Taxation
Current tax including UK Corporation tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the Balance sheet date where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the Balance sheet date. 
Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the 
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more 
likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged 
to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the Balance sheet 
date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has been entered into by the 
subsidiary or associate. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based 
on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
c) Foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at actual exchange rates as of the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end. Any gain or loss arising from a 
change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
d) Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.

*  Both adjusted profit before tax and adjusted basic earnings per share are stated before amortisation of intangibles, share-based payments, adjustment to goodwill, restructuring costs and 
past service credit on the defined benefit pension scheme in the relevant years. In addition, the Group has chosen to adjust for the gain/loss on the fair value of forward foreign currency 
contracts together with the tax effects of the items adjusted. Comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The earnings and dividend per share amounts in prior periods have been restated to reflect the three for one share reorganisation which was 
approved at the Annual General Meeting on 14 July 2006.

Skills shortages continue to be a challenge in most engineering 
companies and it will take some time for the recent increases 
in the number of engineering students at universities and 
technical colleges to overcome the generation gap that currently 
exists in the market. 
In recognition of this, and in addition to its own in-house graduate 
recruitment schemes, AVEVA will continue to work with educational 
establishments and government bodies around the world to 
support initiatives aimed at narrowing the skills gap. 
AVEVA sees this as a vital investment that will bring long-term 
benefits to the engineering world.

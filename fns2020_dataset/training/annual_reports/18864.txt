Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement
This was an excellent year for  
JUST EAT with revenues up 58% to  
£247 .6 million and Underlying  
EBITDA up 83% to £59 .7 million.
Dr John Hughes, CBE, Hon DSc 
Chairman
These results again demonstrate 
the strength of the business model, 
our ability to deliver incremental 
Underlying EBITDA while still 
investing for growth and the 
continued opportunities we see in  
the markets in which we operate.
In our first full year since IPO, this model, and the strategy 
it serves, has not changed. We continue to create value 
for shareholders by meeting the needs of restaurants and 
requirements of consumers, in a marketplace that continues 
to grow. We have enhanced our market-leading positions 
both organically and through ten targeted transactions 
over the year. 
Our financial performance was driven by a 65% increase 
in Active Users and a 57% increase in order volumes, led 
by a continued shift toward mobile transactions, which 
accounted for 66% of Group orders. Our mobile-led strategy 
is also benefitting our restaurant partners with the launch 
during the year of our partner centre App, a dedicated 
business management tool delivered to their mobile device.
Strong governance 
As JUST EAT matures as a listed company, more of the 
values and principles that guide us are codified and 
publicly laid out. This process is central to the Company’s 
determination to do the right thing by ensuring we meet 
or exceed the expectations of our employees, partners 
and stakeholders, in governance as well as in other areas. 
During 2015, we reviewed a number of policies and codes 
to ensure they provide a positive and productive working 
environment, rolled out an enhanced Employee Code 
of Conduct and publicly disclosed our carbon footprint 
for the first time. The Board will continue to develop the 
Company’s broader environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) arrangements, explained more fully on pages 34 to 
65 of this Annual Report.
With respect to Board composition, we saw Henri Moissinac 
step down on 31 July 2015, and I would like to thank Henri 
for his invaluable contribution and service to the Company. 
Diego Oliva was appointed an Independent Non-executive 
Director and a member of the Company’s Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees on 24 September 2015, 
Mr Oliva’s extensive international experience in technology, 
digital marketing and mobile sectors will be a great asset 
to JUST EAT.
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs001-005.indd   2 06/03/2016   20:55 3
Strategic Report
As discussed in the Company’s 
prospectus from the IPO, two 
financial sponsor shareholder 
appointed directors, Benjamin Holmes 
and Michael Risman, are planning 
to step down from the Board between 
announcement of the Company’s 
annual results and its 2016 Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”), and will not 
present themselves for reappointment 
at the AGM. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to offer my warmest 
thanks to both Ben and Michael 
for their sound advice and major 
contributions to the Company over 
the period of their involvement. As a 
result of these proposed changes, the 
number of Board members will reduce, 
although a search is underway to add 
a further Independent Non-executive 
Director, to bring the Board to full 
compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code in every regard.
An outstanding team 
JUST EAT’s Executive management 
team was further strengthened this 
year in line with our ambitions to 
bring in the additional capabilities 
we need to take full advantage of 
the opportunities ahead of us. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank all of the JUST EAT team 
for their hard work and contribution 
to our continued success under 
David’s leadership.
Looking ahead
JUST EAT has much opportunity to 
continue growing: by finding and 
creating opportunities to maximise 
the benefits for our consumers, 
restaurant partners and employees, 
and in the process to create further 
shareholder value. 
We have continued to improve our 
market share, most recently through 
the strategic acquisition of four 
businesses announced in February 
2016. These acquisitions are consistent 
with our strategy to build and reinforce 
leadership positions in markets of 
scale. Nonetheless, the majority of the 
markets that we operate in remain 
underpenetrated, offering significant 
opportunity to continue shifting 
consumers to ordering online and 
especially via our Apps. The strength 
of our brands and technology, along 
with our ability to innovate, will drive 
our prospects in our core marketplace 
as well as opening adjacent markets, 
where we see additional opportunity 
for incremental revenues and profit.

Strategic Report
About Us
At JUST EA T , we 
operate the world’s 
leading digital 
marketplace for 
takeaway food delivery , 
providing consumers 
with an easy and 
secure way to order and 
pay for food from local 
takeaway restaurants.
Takeaway restaurants (“TRs”) that 
join the JUST EAT platform have 
their menus made accessible to online 
consumers, who are able to search for 
local TRs and choose to pay securely 
online at the point of ordering or with 
cash on delivery. Details of the order 
are sent to the TR via proprietary 
technology, mostly Just Connect 
Terminals (“JCTs”), which are provided 
to TRs to accept orders and send 
confirmations to the consumer. 
Once prepared, the food is delivered 
to the consumer, or the consumer 
may choose to collect the order.
Success-based revenue model
We have a simple, scalable, success-
based revenue model. Order-driven 
revenues account for 91% of Group 
revenues (2014: 89%), comprising 
commission paid by the TR on 
successfully transmitted orders and 
payment card or administration 
fees, charged to the restaurant and 
often recharged on to the consumer 
when they choose to pay online. The 
commission rates are agreed in the 
contractual terms with TRs and vary 
by country. Commission revenue 
is driven by the number of orders 
placed, the average order value 
(“AOV”) and commission rates. Thus, 
an increase in any one of these three 
variables will have a positive impact 
on revenues. The performance of 
order-driven revenues is measured 
by the Group’s Average Revenue Per 
Order (“ARPO”) KPI, which increased 
by 3% during 2015.
The remaining revenues consist of 
a one-off connection fee to join the 
JUST EAT network, which accounted 
for 3% of the Group’s revenues 
(2014: 5%). These range from nil to 
£699, depending on geography and 
market maturity.  
It is important to JUST EAT that 
when restaurants join the JUST 
EAT platform they make a conscious 
decision to treat orders sent to them 
through our platforms with at least 
the same care and attention as their 
other orders.
Restaurants may also pay for 
additional services such as 
promotional top-placement on the 
JUST EAT platform and branded 
commodity products, which together 
constituted 6% of the Group’s revenues 
(2014: 6%). Top-placement fees are 
charged to restaurants who want to be 
listed in a clearly-labelled sponsored 
slot at the top of search results in a 
particular postcode. By paying this 
fee, the TR secures a top-placement 
slot for a particular postcode for a 
period of up to 12 weeks. Our ‘organic’ 
listings below these top-placement 
slots are ordered by an algorithm 
based on consumer ratings and 
distance from the consumer, and are 
not affected by restaurant payments.
Consumer journey:
P o s t co d e
The JUST EAT Apps and  
websites enable consumers 
to search for restaurants 
in their area using their 
postcode, sorted by cuisine 
choice and preference for 
delivery or collection.
Choose restaurant
Consumers can make 
an informed choice 
by reading customer 
reviews and examining 
the full menu. There were 
13.5 million reviews on  
JUST EAT by the year end, placed 
by those who have made orders.
D el i v er y  
me t h o d
Consumers can 
choose delivery or collect 
the order themselves.
P a y m e n t  
me t h o d
The final stage in placing an 
order is for the consumer 
to choose to either pay 
securely online or pay cash 
on delivery/collection.

Strategic Report
91%
Revenue driven

orders
Beneficial cash flow cycle
When a consumer pays online, 
JUST EAT collects the full order value 
on behalf of the restaurant. As over 
60% of orders are paid online, JUST EAT  
operates with a very favourable 
working capital cycle. The funds are 
typically transferred to restaurants, 
net of our fees, twice per month, but 
will be moving to a weekly basis in 
the UK from Q2 2016. We do not use 
these amounts to fund our operations 
so it is appropriate to remit them to 
our restaurant partners more quickly. 
Where we are
Since the first JUST EAT website 
was launched in Denmark in 2001, 
we have expanded globally with 
operations in Australia, Belgium, 
Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, 
Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, 
New Zealand, Norway, Spain, 
Switzerland and the UK. 
We are clear market leader in 12 
of our 13 territories; a key success 
factor in our sector. The UK is the 
largest of JUST EAT’s operations in 
terms of number of orders, active 
customers and takeaway restaurants 
and represents 68% of total Group 
revenues (2014: 73%).
During 2015 we continued to grow 
our team and at 31 December 2015 
1,868 people (Full Time Equivalents 
“FTEs”) worked for JUST EAT globally 
(31 December 2014: 1,508 FTEs). 
While our head office is in the heart 
of London, we have strong local 
teams on the ground in every country 
of operation including dedicated  
in-house customer care teams.
M&A 
Our approach to M&A is one 
that is focused on achieving our 
strategic objectives whilst remaining 
financially disciplined. We have 
focused on building and maintaining 
our existing market leading positions 
where we have a proven track record. 
In 2015 we completed ten targeted 
transactions including the acquisition 
of the Menulog Group, the market 
leader in Australia and New Zealand, 
and the purchase of SinDelantal in 
Mexico, the largest online takeaway 
food provider in a very early stage 
market. We also increased our stake 
in IF-JE, our Brazilian associate, from 
25% to 30%; increased our share of 
our Swiss business from 64% to 100%; 
made two small acquisitions in Italy 
– Clicca e Mangia and DeliveRex; 
acquired Nifty Nosh in Northern 
Ireland; and acquired Orderit.ca, 
the number two operator in Canada.
On 5 February 2016, JUST EAT 
acquired the number two operators 
in Spain, Italy, Mexico and Brazil. The 
Spanish acquisition is due to complete 
once approval is obtained from the 
local competition commission. It is 
expected that the acquired Brazilian 
business will be sold on to IF-JE, 
our associate in that market.

People
Brand
Scalability
Technology
JUST EA T operates a simple, 
scalable, success-based business 
model that has a beneficial  
cash flow cycle, creating value 
for restaurants, consumers 
and JUST EA T .
How we generate value 
We generate value through our four key drivers, 
which underpin our three strategic initiatives. 
Technology
Our technology makes life easier for consumers 
and restaurants. The JUST EAT system enables 
restaurants to efficiently manage their order 
process by reducing communication errors that 
could be made over the telephone and reducing 
time spent on order processing. The JUST EAT 
platform enables consumers to make informed 
choices about what food to order, or simply repeat 
previous orders, in a quick and convenient way.
Scalability
When creating, developing and maintaining 
our technology, we recognise the importance of 
scalability to consumer access, particularly at peak 
times. We invest heavily to ensure our websites 
and Apps are robust, flexible and secure enough  
to meet increasing peaks of demand from 
consumers and restaurants.
Brand
Consumers have the reassurance of ordering from 
well-known, trusted brands, receiving customer 
service through JUST EAT online support or offline 
through contact centres. Brand association helps 
restaurants to drive scale in orders by enabling 
efficient entry to the online market.
People
Our people are integral to all that we do at 
JUST EAT. We have an outstanding team who 
are responsible for designing, implementing, 
maintaining, supporting and promoting our 
websites and Apps, as well as great local teams  
who lead in-country sales, marketing and 
operational functions.

Strategic Report
Informed choices
With an online menu for each 
restaurant and customer reviews, 
consumers make informed 
choices of which food to order 
and from where.
Convenience
Consumers can choose to  
place an order wherever they  
are using one of our Apps or 
mobile website. 
Trusted brand
Consumers have the 
reassurance of ordering from 
well-known, trusted brands, 
receiving customer service 
through JUST EAT online 
support or offline through our 
contact centres.
Ordering simplicity
Payment card details can  
be stored securely with  
JUST EAT, along with contact 
details, favourite restaurants  
and previous orders.
Value for consumers:
More orders with 
higher value
An online presence and access 
to JUST EAT’s 13.4 million 
Active Users, help restaurants 
generate more orders and orders 
of higher value than when 
orders are placed by telephone.
Access to brand 
and technology
JUST EAT provides SMEs  
with a brand presence, leading-
edge digital technology, and 
the ability to accept online 
payments.
More efficient 
order processing
The JUST EAT platform 
significantly reduces 
communication errors  
and restaurant order 
processing time.
Services and 
information
Restaurants have access 
to other benefits such as 
discounted menu printing, 
branded commodity products, 
and feedback on consumer 
preferences.

Value for JUST EAT:

financial value
Compound annual growth in orders of 62% over the  
past four years have driven a 65% and 394% compound 
increase in revenues and Underlying EBITDA respectively. 
This demonstrates the inherent leverage in our model and 
how it preserves value over the long term.

our people and strengthening the team.

Strategic Report
Our marketplace 
model works best 
in geographies with 
a strong culture for 
takeaway food and a 
fragmented supply side. 
Our current markets
The markets in which JUST EAT 
currently operates were estimated to 
represent a total annual takeaway order 
value (for delivery) of £23.9 billion
1
 
in 2015, of which the UK is the largest 
single market at £5.5 billion
1
. 
In the UK, one of our more developed 
markets, online ordering has grown 
faster than GDP, driven by broad 
adoption of eCommerce and increased 
smartphone/tablet penetration
2
. 
This channel shift is similar to the 
migration towards the use of the 
internet by consumers in other highly 
fragmented markets, such as holiday 
and airline bookings, insurance, 
Potential of scale
tickets for live entertainment, 
classified advertising and restaurant 
bookings. Over 60%
3
 of takeaway 
orders for delivery are still placed 
on the phone, demonstrating the 
remaining opportunity for JUST 
EAT to convert those consumers 
to ordering via our platform. 
The optimal market for JUST EAT 
is where eCommerce is established 
and where the takeaway market is 
highly fragmented, consisting of 
lots of independent outlets and few 
chains. This has been key in choosing 
those territories in which we invest 
and JUST EAT is now market leader 
in 12 of the 13 territories around 
the world in which we operate. 
The UK, Australia, Brazil, Denmark, 
France, Ireland, Italy and Spain 
are particularly strong examples  
of a highly fragmented takeaway 
market in which aggregators such 
as JUST EAT should thrive.

19.6%
Group market 
penetration
Across the 13 territories we operate in, over 
2015 our average market penetration was 
only 19.6% (2014: 12.4%), leaving substantial 
opportunities for JUST EAT to develop its 
business in the future.
Market Overview
What drives demand for our platform?
Drive towards convenience –  
people’s increasingly  
busy lives 
Reluctance to spend time 
food shopping and preparing 
food – takeaway viewed as 
part of the daily routine
Consumer desire for choice,  
over 100 cuisine categories.
Consumers want more  
information – reviews  
satisfy that demand
Restaurants want access  
to digital customers
Simplicity , speed and 
efficiency – storing of card 
details, easier to process an 
order for both consumers 
and TRs (e.g. Apple Pay)
Increasing adoption of  
eCommerce, similar to other 
highly fragmented markets 
such as holiday bookings
Increasing mobile  
penetration
Pizza is our number 
one selling cuisine 
type globally.

Strategic Report
Who are our consumers?
The biggest single demographic of 
JUST EAT consumers are families who, 
as expected, tend to place orders of 
higher value, as opposed to our student 
customers who typically order more 
cheaply and for fewer people. Lifestyles 
have shifted with consumers looking for 
convenience options that fit with their 
increasingly busy daily routines. This, 
combined with the growing variety 
of takeaway food, including healthier 
choices becoming available, has resulted 
in consumers embracing takeaway as 
a feature of their daily lives.
Who are our  
restaurant partners?
Our restaurant partners are wide 
ranging; from counter-service 
takeaways to dine-in restaurants; 
from sole proprietors and family 
run businesses to branded chains, 
and over 100 cuisine types available, 
demonstrating the breadth of choice. 
JUST EAT was pleased 
to welcome  70 YO! 
Sushi restaurants to its 
UK platform in 2015.
What is  
the future?
There is significant potential for 
JUST EAT to increase its orders, 
revenues and operating profits 
within our current markets given the 
relatively low consumer penetration 
in most countries. In time there is 
also the opportunity for JUST EAT to 
further address the collection market, 
higher end restaurants and delivery 
via third parties. The opportunities to 
utilise our significant data resources 
with both our restaurant partners 
and consumers is huge.

£1.7 billion, up 57% and 61% 
respectively on the previous year. 
Delivering this order growth to our restaurant partners  
is a key measure of JUST EAT’s success, reinforcing our 
position at the heart of the vibrant takeaway industry  
in the 13 markets in which we operate.
JUST EAT’s revenues grew 58% to £247.6 million 
(2014: £157.0 million). Underlying EBITDA increased 
by 83% to £59.7 million (2014: £32.6 million) and we 
generated £74.2 million of net operating cash flow (up 
95%). These are excellent results in a period in which we 
continued to make significant investment in our future 
growth. Results from our acquired businesses in the year, 
most notably the Australian Menulog Group which grew 
orders 81% year-on-year, have also been strong.
Strategic progress 
Our success in 2015 was driven by our continued focus 
on our consumer offering and ensuring our restaurants 
see real benefit from the channel shift to mobile and 
online ordering. We do this by delivering a continuously 
improving consumer experience and by working with 
restaurants to provide more choice and variety, giving 
independent, local businesses the tools and information 
to ensure our industry continues to develop.
Improving the consumer experience
We have made significant strides over the last 12 months, 
particularly with our Apps and mobile sites which now 
account for 66% of Group orders. We have achieved 
meaningful improvements in conversion by introducing 
‘social’ login and repeat order functionality, improving the 
algorithms and presentation of our search result pages, 
including map views of search results, expanding payment 
choices including Apple Pay and PayPal, and simplifying 
the order flow significantly. We are excited about the year 
ahead, for example using our recently introduced Customer 
Relationship Marketing (“CRM”) platform to deliver targeted, 
personalised in-App experiences, for both consumer 
and restaurant communications. With over 13.5 million 
customer reviews (31 December 2014: over 7.7 million) and 
our core platforms now processing around 2,500 orders per 
minute at peak, we have a wealth of data on our industry, 
particularly consumer preferences and behaviour that we 
are now starting to use more fully.
I would like to thank the entire  
JUST EAT team for their work  
in 2015; they have worked tirelessly  
to, yet again, deliver fantastic  
organic growth.

Strategic Report
Orderpad is our tablet-based order 
management platform that enables 
restaurants to run more efficiently and 
improves the visibility of deliveries 
for the consumer. At the end of the 
year we had this technology live in 711 
restaurants and will start the commercial 
roll-out of Orderpad to our restaurants 
in Q2 of 2016. Our target is to have 
one third of UK orders processed on 
an Orderpad within 12 months. 
Bringing greater choice
In 2015, we increased the number 
of contracted restaurant partners 
on our network by a net 15,800 to 
61,500 (31 December 2014: 45,700). 
An exercise to analyse restaurant and 
consumer activity identified a number 
of restaurants whose behaviour was 
detrimental to our consumers and 
as a result they are no longer on our 
platform. This, combined with external 
auditing of our UK price promise and 
the introduction of restaurant advisers 
to improve industry standards, helped 
increase new customer return rates 
and drive order frequency. We also 
believe this is helping to drive 
standards in the wider industry.
Choice in the takeaway delivery sector 
continues to expand, with over 100 
cuisine types available across the 
JUST EAT platforms. 
Driving channel shift
The takeaway industry continues to grow 
and is seeing a rapid shift to online and 
mobile ordering, led by JUST EAT.
In the majority of our countries this 
change is in its early stages, offering 
significant opportunity for future 
growth. The operational strategies 
that improve choice and consumer 
experience are key, as is our work to 
create a respected, destination brand 
in each of our markets. 
In the UK, our 2015 #minifistpump 
campaign successfully evolved into 
catchy musical/food adverts, whilst 
elsewhere we increased the local 
content of our marketing, including 
a hugely popular App-only TV advert 
in Italy which drove App downloads, 
further improving our already rapid 
Italian order growth.
As well as attracting new consumers, 
we have increased our focus on 
improving consumer retention 
and frequency. Shifting existing 
consumers to our Apps and ensuring 
new consumers start their journey on 
App is key to this and we are delighted 
that in 2015 our orders per Established 
User
1
 in the UK increased to 12.6 
(2014: 11.9).
Clear priorities
These three strategic initiatives are 
highly complementary, working both 
individually and collectively to drive 
the business. We have a clear, proven 
plan for each stage of development and 
there are no easy shortcuts to building 
great long-term businesses. 
We continued to work to build our 
clear leadership positions, and in 2015 
we supported strong organic growth 
with acquisitions in five existing 
markets, while entering Mexico and 
Australia & New Zealand by acquiring 
the local market leader.
Following the year end, we acquired 
businesses in Spain, Italy, Brazil and 
Mexico which bolster our existing, 
market-leading businesses there. The 
operational control of the Brazilian 
business has passed to IF-JE as the sale 
of the business to IF-JE is finalised.
Our people
Our people are critical to our success 
and we remain focused on maintaining 
a high-performance entrepreneurial 
culture at JUST EAT. During 2015, we 
strengthened our leadership team with 
the appointment of Barnaby Dawe and 
Lisa Hillier as Chief Marketing Officer 
and our first Chief People Officer 
respectively. Globally, the number of 
full time equivalent employees grew to 
1,868 by the end of the year (December 
2014: 1,508).
I would like to thank the entire 
JUST EAT team for their work in 
2015; they have worked tirelessly to, 
yet again, deliver fantastic organic 
growth, have continued to innovate 
and expand consumer choice whilst 
securing and integrating a number 
of important acquisitions.
Outlook 
JUST EAT is in a very strong position 
both operationally and financially, 
and we are again able to increase 
our forecasts compared with market 
consensus. For 2016, which will be a 
year of further investment for growth, 
we expect to achieve £350 million of 
Group revenues, at current exchange 
rates, generating £98-100 million of 
Underlying EBITDA.
We will continue to innovate, develop 
new products and bring greater 
value to more restaurant partners, 
whilst driving growth by further 
strengthening our brand; ultimately 
empowering more consumers to love 
their takeaway experience.

Strategic Report
A more informed consumer 
Once a consumer enters a postcode, 
or geolocates via the App, the Search 
Engine Results Page (“SERP”) lists the 
live restaurants that are available to 
prepare food. There are clearly labelled 
top-placement slots at the top of the 
SERP. All restaurants listed below these 
are ranked based on the consumer 
rating they have received and distance 
from the consumer, placing the higher-
rated restaurants at the top. 
Improving the  
Consumer Experience
Consumers may also choose to rank 
restaurants by review rating only, 
alphabetically or by prioritising those 
restaurants with special offers. 
Having better information is key 
to enabling consumers to make 
empowered choices. Further ways 
of displaying the search results are 
planned for release during 2016.
Consumer reviews, which can only 
be placed by those who have made 
an order, offer valuable insight into 
fellow consumers’ views on food 
quality, service and delivery. In 
addition to these reviews, which are 
updated daily, we also include a link 
to the Food Standards Agency where 
relevant, for access to restaurant 
hygiene ratings.
38%
Group orders via App
Over 2015, consumers increasingly chose to 
order via our Apps, now available for most 
major mobile operating systems (2014: 30%). 
App users are typically more loyal and order 
more frequently than non-App users.
13.5m
Reviews
At 31 December 2015, we had 7 .7m reviews 
on our UK platform (31 December 2014: 
3.7m). Outside the UK, consumers had left 
5.8m reviews (31 December 2014: 4.0m).
Key highlights
JUST EA T brings 
consumers convenience, 
restaurant choice and 
the ability to read/leave  
restaurant reviews.

get through to our restaurant 
partners on even the busiest 
of evenings. Having processed 
300,000 orders for the first time

November 2015, we broke that 
record a further two times in 
2015 before processing 371,000

Strategic Report
Investing in technology
During 2015 a total of 320 updates 
(2014: 103) were rolled out across 
our 30 Apps, mobile web and desktop 
platforms. Most of these changes 
were incremental improvements 
to enhance the consumer 
experience, while keeping it simple 
and consistent. More significant 
improvements included adding 
the ability to pay for orders using 
Apple Pay, trialling Order-on-its-
Way notification and continuing to 
develop real-time Order Tracking. 
We will continue to invest in 
technology and product, to ensure 
the stability, security and scalability 
of our system and to improve both 
our consumer offer and restaurant 
technology platforms. 
During the last quarter of the 
year, we launched a new CRM 
tool that will enable us to better 
target consumers with marketing 
messages and relevant promotions. 
We should start seeing the benefits 
of this in 2016. 
Improving the visibility of 
deliveries enables restaurants 
to run more efficiently while 
enhancing the overall takeaway 
experience for consumers.
Orderpad is the tablet-based order 
management platform, upon which 
we have built our ‘order-on-its-way’ 
notification and order tracking 
features. During 2015, we expanded 
our trials of the former, including 
developing both new hardware and 
software. At the end of the year, 
order-on-its-way notification was 
live in 711 UK restaurants.
These trials have delivered much 
real-life user case information and 
have enabled us to be in a position 
to commence the commercial roll-
out of Orderpad to our restaurants 
in Q2 of 2016. Our target is to have 
one third of UK orders processed on 
an Orderpad within 12 months. The 
rollout of Orderpad will also enable 
the expansion of full order tracking 
technology trials during 2016.
Restaurant technology
Recognising the best 
The inaugural British Takeaway 
Awards, held in 2015, recognised 
the role our restaurant partners play 
both as purveyors of food and in their 
local communities. Not only does this 
improve standards in the industry 
but it also reinforces JUST EAT as a 
champion of the takeaway industry.

Chips in Leicestershire 
was voted best 
takeaway restaurant  
in the country.

Strategic Report
Greater restaurant choice will attract 
more consumers to the JUST EAT 
platform, completing the virtuous 
circle.
Technology advances
Our vision is to be fully integrated into 
how a takeaway restaurant operates, 
moving away from traditional 
transaction methods. This means not 
just facilitating JUST EAT orders but 
enabling us to offer our restaurant 
partners the right tools to manage 
their businesses. 
In September 2015 we launched the 
JUST EAT Partner Centre App – a 
dedicated business management tool 
that enables restaurant owners to 
manage their own online presence 
(e.g. adjusting their opening hours), 
manage their business operations 
(e.g. purchasing merchandise in 
the JUST EAT shop) and obtain key 
business data such as number of each 
dish sold. Restaurants can also read 
feedback left for them and respond 
as required. Further expansion of 
this platform will take place in 2016.
Enhancing our 
restaurant offer  
drives loyalty from 
existing restaurants 
and encourages  
others to join.
Bringing  
Greater Choice
A first for the UK
We wanted to bring healthy and 
affordable food to the high street, 
and don’t believe you should have 
to compromise taste to eat well. 
We only use fresh ingredients and 
prepare everything on site daily in 
an open plan kitchen. Our menu 
offers fast, simple and healthy 
meals, broken down for those 
with an eye on their daily intakes. 
We have been with JUST EAT for 
just under three years, and have 
seen a huge benefit to our business 
over that time. We get around 20 
orders per day, equivalent to around 
60–70% of our total orders. We are 
primarily a dine-in restaurant so 
having a delivery and collection 
option is a great side-business for us, 
especially during the middle of the 
week, when restaurants are often 
less busy.

dif ferent cuisine 
types available 
on JUST EAT
You can eat from almost every 
country in the world without 
leaving your home! From 
Argentinian to Vietnamese 
and from starters to desserts, 
consumers can order a truly 
international feast through 
JUST EAT. Increasingly, 
reflecting consumer trends, 
healthier choices are being 
highlighted by restaurants.
Coverage
Collection (pick-up) has been a  
focus of the UK business since  
early 2014 and orders through this  
channel have been growing at 
around twice the rate of the broader 
business. In 2015, 4% of orders were 
collected by consumers (2014: 3%). 
Collection offers significant further 
opportunity beyond our core delivery 
business, a market estimated by 
management to be worth around an 
additional £2.6 billion, a significant 
proportion of which should be 
addressable by JUST EAT.

Strategic Report
This potential channel shift represents 
the main opportunity for JUST EAT 
as consumer migration from offline 
to mobile/online ordering remains in 
its early stages in the vast majority of 
our geographies. Even in the UK, one 
of our more developed markets, over 
60%
1
 of takeaway orders for delivery 
are still placed on the phone. During 
2015 Active Users globally grew 65% 
to 13.4 million (31 December 2014: 8.1 
million).

Our focus remains  
on shifting consumers 
to ordering through  
our digital platforms 
from ordering by 
telephone.
Driving 
Channel Shift
Global 
brands
While eight of our 13 markets 
trade as JUST EAT, the remaining 
five use well-established local 
brands that were acquired by 
JUST EAT. Marketing concepts, 
and even collateral, are shared 
within markets at similar stages 
of maturity, while less developed, 
or more unique, markets require a 
bespoke approach.
In Italy, an early stage market, the 
advertising approach was one of 
discovery that takeaway food could 
be ordered via App, as shown below. 
In Spain, a gloomy anteater was one 
character used to demonstrate the 
wide choice of cuisines available (to 
humans) on the platform. While in 
France the television adverts talked 
of eating restaurant-quality food, in 
the comfort of your own home.
In the UK, over 60% of 
takeaway orders for delivery 
are still placed on the  
phone demonstrating the 
opportunity still available  
for channel shift
Improving the consumer experience 
and maintaining strong marketing 
messaging will help drive further 
channel shift. JUST EAT’s 
spontaneous brand awareness among 
UK takeaway consumers increased to 
47% in November 2015 from 44% in 
December 2014
2
. This measures the 
percentage of consumers for whom a 
given brand is the first that comes to 
mind in a category and demonstrates 
how brand investment increases 
consumer loyalty.

Mobile-led strategy
In 2015 mobile penetration continued 
to increase due to the rise in popularity 
of smartphones and tablets with our 
consumers. In the UK, smartphone 
penetration of households has 
remained at around two-thirds
3
, while 
tablet penetration increased to 55% 
in May 2015 from 44% in Q1 2014
2
. 
Our mobile-led strategy has resulted 
in 66% of Group JUST EAT orders now 
being placed using a mobile device 
(2014: 53%), which includes 38% of 
total orders via an App (2014: 30%). 
Evidence to date shows that App users 
order more frequently than non-App 
users. In the UK, orders can be made 
T ap the App
To encourage migration of consumers 
from offline to digital ordering, and to 
reinforce our brand values to existing 
consumers, we continue to build 
JUST EAT brands through innovative 
marketing campaigns such as the 
#minifistpump campaign launched in 
October 2014, and moved into a second 
phase with this winter’s ‘I need a balti!’ 
and ‘Chicken Madras’ TV campaigns 
– supported by radio, PR, digital and 
experiential elements. 
Consumers trust well-known brands 
with which they identify, helping make 
our business model highly defensible 
as we become a more established brand 
in all of our geographies. We now 
undertake television marketing in  
all of the core markets we operate in.
through Android (tablets and phones), 
iPhone, iPad, Windows mobile, Kindle 
Fire tablets along with laptop and 
desktop computers. 
The additional benefit of orders made 
via App direct to JUST EAT is that they 
bypass search engines and avoid search 
engine fees, reduce the chance of 
competitor redirection and reduce the 
risks associated with changes in search 
provider algorithms. We will continue 
our focus on driving consumers to App 
use into 2015. JUST EAT iOS Apps have 
been downloaded more than six million 
times, while four million Android 
downloads have been made.

Organising 
the world’s 
takeaway 
food
JUST EAT helps consumers around 
the world choose what cuisine to 
eat and from which of their local 
restaurants, whether it’s a treat 
or an everyday meal. We provide 
geographic targeting, various 
search options along with genuine 
customer reviews. 
To help consumers from having 
to deal with too much choice, we 
can tailor the restaurants we sign 
up in a given postcode, and in 
future we will be able to curate 
which restaurants are shown to 
the consumer depending on their 
demographic and prior order history.

Strategic Report
The achievement of our strategic 
initiatives is analysed through 
a select set of key performance 
indicators (“KPIs”). These ensure we 
focus our resources appropriately .
At this stage of our development, the six main KPIs used 
by JUST EAT, together with their performance over the 
last five years, are shown here. 
There are a number of other performance indicators used 
to measure day-to-day operational and financial progress, 
many of which are included in our monthly management 
reports. In addition, there are many other monthly, weekly 
and daily reports that are used internally around the 
business for operational or financial reasons.

CFO Update and  
Financial Review
The performance of the Group  
for the year ended 31 December  
2015 demonstrates the ongoing 
strength of our UK business and 
the increasing importance of our 
international opportunities.
Mike Wroe 
CFO
Group revenues grew 58%  
year on year to £247 .6 million. 
The Group’s Underlying EBITDA 
margin expanded significantly 
to 24.1% from 20.8% despite 
our increasing investment in 
marketing and technology . 
In the UK, orders grew 48% year-on-year whilst Underlying 
EBITDA margins expanded to 45.8% (2014: 40.2%). The 
success of the UK demonstrates the long-term value of 
the market leadership positions we are building in our 
fast growing international markets.

The Group’s growth in 2015 was delivered alongside an 
83% increase in Underlying EBITDA to £59.7 million with 
margins improving in all segments. The increase in the 
profits generated in the UK more than offset the ongoing 
investment in the Developing Markets and the central 
costs of our Head Office.
Underlying EBITDA converts strongly to net operating 
cash flow (including tax and interest payments) due to the 
beneficial working capital cycle inherent in the business 
model. In 2015, net operating cash flow represented 124% 
of Underlying EBITDA (2014: 117%). Adjusting for the  
impact of an increase in cash due to our restaurant  
partners, net operating cash flow represented 97% of 
Underlying EBITDA (2014: 82%).
In 2016 we now expect revenues to be £350 million with 
Underlying EBITDA of £98-100 million at current exchange 
rates. We remain in investment phase for 2016.

Strategic Report
Group result 
All key trading metrics on the Group income statement  
have improved year-on-year. As highlighted in 2014, the 
£38.2 million one-off, non-cash book gain, primarily arising 
from control change in our French and Brazilian businesses, 
distorted the year-on-year profit before tax and profit after 
tax comparisons.

The income statement includes some significant fluctuations 
that are not considered part of normal business operations. 
These are removed from operating profit to arrive at 
Underlying EBITDA. This is the measure of profitability we 
use to assess our operational and segmental performance. 
We believe this Underlying EBITDA measure more 
accurately reflects the key drivers of long-term profitability 
for the Group and removes those items (both positive and 
negative) which are mainly non-cash or one-off and do not 
impact underlying trading performance. Adjusted profit  
was £40.4 million (2014: £22.4 million).

Segmental review 
Historically the Group reported its results under three 
operating segments: the UK, Denmark and Other. The UK 
and Danish operations were shown separately as they 
were, and remain, our most established markets in terms 
of market penetration and profitability. The Other segment 
contained all other controlled businesses, regardless of 
the stage of growth and development. Some markets were 
profitable, while others were at an earlier stage requiring 
significant investment.
The Group will now report four operating segments: the 
UK, Australia & New Zealand, Established Markets and 
Developing Markets. Established Markets comprise Benelux, 
Canada, Denmark, France (from July 2014), Ireland, 
Norway and Switzerland. Developing Markets comprise 
Italy, Mexico, Spain and (until November 2014) Brazil. This 
presentational change is designed to better align the Group’s 
businesses by their stage of development and give greater 
transparency to our shareholders and users of the accounts.
The results of each segment will continue to include its  
fully allocated share of central technology, product and 
Head Office costs.
The technology and product teams continue to be areas  
of significant additional investment, with head count at  
31 December 2015 increasing to 301 (31 December 2014: 
206). It is predominantly run as a single integrated team 
to improve efficiency and the internationalisation of 
products. The operating segments are allocated the full 
cost of this support and development (including all servers, 
maintenance, innovation and engineering) on a per order 
basis for those nine countries on our ‘core’ platform, 
representing 88% of orders (2014: 95%). During 2015, only 
a small proportion of specific technology costs were not 
allocated and these were either included as part of Head 
Office costs or capitalised.
1. Underlying EBITDA is defined as earnings before finance income and costs, taxation, 
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) and additionally excludes the Group’s 
share of depreciation and amortisation of associates and joint ventures, long-term 
employee incentive costs, exceptional items (see note 5), foreign exchange gains and 
losses and ‘other gains and losses’ (see note 9).

Strategic Report
United Kingdom
The UK business had another excellent year with revenue 
growth of 49% and Underlying EBITDA growth of 69%. 
Order-driven revenues (predominantly commission) 
represented 93% of total UK revenues (2014: 92%). 
Orders were up 48% to 67.3 million, driven by a number of 
factors, including:
 — an increase in UK Active Users to 7.1 million at 31 December 
2015 (31 December 2014: 5.5 million);
 — orders via Apps accounted for 41% of total 2015 UK orders 
(2014: 33%);
 — over 70% of all UK orders (2014: 60%) being made from 
mobile devices (includes App orders);
 — an increase in the frequency of ordering by Established 
Users in the UK to 12.6 from 11.9 times per year;
 — 26,700 takeaway restaurants on the platform at 
31 December 2015, up from 24,600 at the end of 2014;
 — proactive management of the consumer experience at a 
restaurant level;
 — successful marketing campaigns including the catchy 
‘I need a Balti!’ TV and radio advertisements; and
 — improvements in the App/mobile and online product 
resulting in noticeable improvements in conversion of 
traffic to orders.
Underlying EBITDA margin in the UK business expanded 
significantly to 45.8% (2014: 40.2%), partially mitigated by 
continued growth in marketing investment, (up 37%), all of 
which was expensed to the income statement. Marketing 
spend as a percentage of revenues reduced to 17% from 
18% last year. Staff costs reduced to 14% of revenues (2014: 
17%), demonstrating the dramatic leverage potential of our 
business model when scale is achieved.
The net increase in restaurants is lower year-on-year in the 
UK as we have, for the first time, actively removed those 
restaurants that were giving consumers a consistently 
bad online experience, in line with our strategic initiative 
to improve the consumer experience. This is part of our 
strategy of focusing on increasing order frequency and 
enhancing customer satisfaction.
Head Office costs include both the ongoing central costs 
of operating the Group as a whole and those functions 
required for efficiency of shared expertise, such as Search 
Engine Marketing (“SEM”), finance, legal, HR and the 
Business Insights data team. Those Head Office costs that 
can be reasonably attributed to individual segments are 
allocated on a consistent basis and therefore, the reported 
Head Office costs are the true central costs that remain 
after such allocations. 
The results from associates and the joint venture are equity 
accounted and presented separately since the Group does 
not control these operations.

Strategic Report
Australia & New Zealand
For the period of ownership from 15 June 2015, the 
Menulog Group generated £12.4 million of revenues and 
£1 million of Underlying EBITDA, which is after deducting 
£0.8 million of one-off integration related costs. Pro-
forma revenues for the full year 2015 were £20.0 million, 
representing 81% order growth year-on-year. At the 
acquisition date exchange rate, pro-forma revenues would 
have been £21.2 million, representing growth of 89%.

Our Danish business was established in 2001 and we 
estimate that over 40% of Danish delivered takeaway 
food is now ordered online, the vast majority on JUST 
EAT. Despite this high level of penetration, revenues on 
a forex neutral basis still grew 15% year-on-year. In May 
2015, a two percentage point increase in commission rates 
to 12% from 10% was implemented. This unusually large 
increase was necessary to bring Denmark in line with 
Group average rates, but proved a difficult transition for a 
number of our restaurant partners, negatively impacting 
Danish orders in the second half of 2015. Pleasingly, both 
revenues and margin improvements in Denmark are on 
track. Our experience in Denmark has reinforced our belief 
that regular, one percentage point increases in commission 
combined with continuously increasing the value 
proposition to our restaurant partners is fundamental  
to our long-term success.
In 2015, forex neutral revenues in Ireland, Switzerland 
and France (on a pro-forma basis) continued to grow above 
the Group average alongside substantial expansion of local 
Underlying EBITDA margins. Our strong market positions 
in these three territories enable us to have confidence that 
they will deliver the medium-term margins we see in the 
UK and Denmark. 
The Benelux business is the Group’s only number-two 
market position. It is receiving little investment and has the 
lowest growth rate of the Group, although has achieved 
break-even. Canada is the only loss making country within 
this segment, being at a slightly earlier stage of market 
development. Excluding Benelux and the more mature 
Denmark, revenues and Underlying EBITDA growth for 
the segment would have been 84% and 118% respectively.
Developing Markets
This segment consists of our high potential, but earlier 
stage markets of Italy, Mexico (following its acquisition in 
February 2015) and Spain. It included Brazil until November 
2014 when that business became an associate. 
On a like-for-like basis
2
, orders grew 115% in 2015.  
Revenues were up 130% on a like-for-like forex neutral  
basis (up 83% to £9.5 million on a reported basis).
This segment has seen the most significant increase in 
investment relative to its current size, with Underlying 
EBITDA losses growing to £13.9 million (2014: £9.0 million 
loss). However, Underlying EBITDA margin (losses) 
improved year-on-year, and most importantly, we increased 
our lead over our competitors in Spain and became market 
leader in Italy during the year. 
We will continue to invest in Spain, Italy and Mexico in 2016 
and the acquisition of the number two players in each of 
these markets in February 2016 supports our strategy. This 
will reduce expected losses and bring forward the break-
even dates for these countries. Ultimately, it will enable 
these businesses to join our portfolio of highly profitable 
significant market leaders of scale over the medium term.
Share of losses from associates and the joint 
venture
The 2015 losses under this heading are exclusively from 
our 30% stake in our Brazilian associate, IF-JE. The results 
of our French business moved from being classed as a joint 
venture into being a subsidiary in the Established Markets 
segment in July 2014. 
IF-JE is the clear market leader in Brazil. This business 
processed over 1.1 million orders in the month of December 
2015, up 150% year-on-year (December 2014: 0.5 million). 
Local revenue growth has exceeded order growth as ARPO 
has increased over time. Brazil has huge long-term market 
potential and the success of the local team in capturing this 
potential means we are helping to build a very valuable 
asset in Brazil, not reflected in our Group headline numbers.

156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs020-027.indd   23 06/03/2016   19:51 24
Strategic Report
Head Office costs 
Head Office costs were £9.5 million (2014: £6.0 million), 
reflecting the full year impact of being a public company 
and the increase in headcount required to build a great 
FTSE 250 technology company. We have made a number of 
important senior hires, completed significant M&A, further 
expanded the technology and product teams and invested in 
training and development, in order to meet the challenges 
of running a high growth business in a rapidly evolving 
sector. These costs are predominantly expensed as incurred 
and most technology together with a portion of Head Office 
costs are recharged to the Group’s operational businesses 
such that segmental Underlying EBITDA includes all 
appropriate costs. Total Group spend on technologies 
was £28.4 million (2014: £17.3 million) of which specific, 
identifiable development costs totalling £2.0 million were 
capitalised (2014: nil).
Items between Underlying EBITDA and  
operating profit 
Depreciation 
The depreciation charges mainly related to the JCT 
terminals that are in situ in the vast majority of the 
61,500 restaurants on the JUST EAT network. These are 
depreciated over three years. We have had a busy year 
property wise, having moved to more established, leased 
offices in a number of countries. The costs of fit-out are 
included in capital expenditure and will typically be 
depreciated over the length of the lease.
Amortisation 
The amortisation charge principally relates to the 
intangibles acquired as a result of the many acquisitions 
completed by the Group over the last five years. The main 
assets acquired are the restaurant contracts, the brand 
of the acquired business and any intellectual property, 
typically relating to the underlying technology platform. 
The total charge for 2015 included £8.9 million (2014: 
£2.1 million) relating to acquired intangible assets.
Long-term employee incentive costs 
Long-term employee incentive costs of £2.9 million  
(2014: £4.9 million) primarily relate to share awards granted 
to employees, recognised over the vesting period of the 
awards. The decreased charge in 2015 reflects the significant 
additional awards that were granted around the time of  
the IPO in 2014. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items of £6.6 million (2014: £2.7 million) 
predominantly relate to the acquisition costs of the 
Australian Menulog Group in June 2015 and the  
SinDelantal Mexico business in February 2015.
CFO Update and Financial Review continued
Net foreign exchange gain 
A net foreign exchange gain of £0.1 million (2014: £0.2 
million gain) arose due to retranslating monetary assets  
and liabilities in foreign currencies.

In January 2015, the Group recognised a gain of £3.0 million 
on the sale of its shares in Achindra Online Marketing 
Private Limited, the Group’s Indian associated undertaking, 
to foodpanda. 
The Group is committed to the future acquisition of the 
minority shareholdings of two of its subsidiaries, FBA Invest 
SaS (France) and Orogo Limited (UK). The provision in relation 
to the French business increased by £3.6 million during the 
year mainly due to an increase in our expectations of its 
growth. The Group will now acquire the minority interest 
in Orogo earlier than previously agreed and for a reduced 
consideration, which has resulted in a £3.4 million decrease 
in this provision.  
A £3.9 million net loss was recognised on foreign exchange 
hedges primarily taken out to hedge the sterling amount of 
the Menulog acquisition consideration, which was payable 
in Australian dollars. 
The fair value gain on convertible debt relates to an option 
to purchase shares in Mexico which converted to equity 
upon acquisition, as detailed within note 35. 
The 2014 gain on deemed disposal arose from accounting 
for the Group’s increased stake in the French business from 
50% to 80%. This resulted in a change in control and so the 
business was no longer treated as a joint venture, but as a 
subsidiary. The transaction resulted in a one-off, non-cash 
book gain of £32.0 million, of which £17.8 million was the gain 
on the deemed disposal of the joint venture and £14.2 million 
resulted from the fair value gains on the Group’s option to 
acquire the remaining shares. The control of the Brazilian 
business also changed in 2014. The business changed from 
being classified as a subsidiary to an associate, resulting in  
a further one-off, non-cash book gain of £5.8 million. 
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs020-027.indd   24 06/03/2016   19:51 25
Strategic Report
Net finance income 
The finance income results from interest on deposits held.  
In 2015 this was offset by the fees associated with the 
Group’s new £90 million revolving credit facility. 
Profit before tax 
Profit before tax for the year was £34.6 million (2014: 
£57.4 million), the decrease being as a result of the 
significant non-cash, one-off book gain of £38.2 million 
recognised in 2014. Excluding this item, profit before 
tax would have increased by 80%.
Taxation 
The income tax expense represents the sum of current tax 
and deferred tax. Current tax is based on taxable profits for 
the year and is calculated using tax rates prevailing in each 
respective jurisdiction. Deferred tax is the tax expected 
to be payable or recoverable on differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of the taxable profit. Deferred tax is calculated 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period 
when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
The Group’s total income tax charge has increased to 
£11.6 million (2014: £5.6 million) with an increase in the 
Effective Tax Rate (“ETR”) to 33.5% from 9.8% last year. The 
underlying ETR, after adjusting for the impact of long-term 
employee incentive costs, exceptional items, ‘other gains and 
losses’, foreign exchange gains and losses, amortisation in 
respect of acquired intangible assets and their associated tax 
impact, is 24.8% (2014: 22.6%). The lower underlying ETR in 
2014 resulted from recognition of deferred tax assets in the 
UK and Switzerland. 
The Group pays significant current tax on profits generated 
in the UK, Denmark, France and Ireland but, as losses 
generated in other jurisdictions cannot be offset against 
these profits and remain unrecognised, the Group’s ETR is 
higher than the prevailing UK corporate tax rate of 20.25% 
as we are an international business.
Earnings per share 
Adjusted earnings per share were 6.6p (2014: 4.2p), up 
57%. Adjusted EPS is calculated using the adjusted profit 
attributable to the holders of Ordinary shares as set out in 
the table to the right. This has increased year-on-year due to 
higher adjusted profits, partially offset by a 16% increase in 
the weighted average number of Ordinary shares, primarily 
following the June 2015 placing and open offer.
Stripping out the impact of the Australian acquisition, 
adjusted EPS was 6.9p, in line with guidance provided 
around the time of the acquisition. 
Basic earnings per share were 3.8p (2014: 9.8p), representing 
a 61% year-on-year decrease predominantly due to the 
impact in the prior year of the one-off, non-cash book gain 
of £38.2 million.

Strategic Report
CFO Update and Financial Review continued
In 2015, non-current assets increased by £474.7 million to 
£561.5 million. This was due to M&A activity completed in 
the year, which resulted in the recognition of goodwill, other 
intangible assets and increased interests in the associate.
Cash balances of £192.7 million (2014: £164.4 million)  
include £43.8 million (2014: £27.7 million) of cash payable  
to our restaurant partners shortly after the period end.  
The increase in these balances reflects the increase in  
order growth and the consequential increase in cash due  
to restaurants. The Group does not treat this cash as part  
of its day-to-day operational cash balances as on-time 
payment to restaurants is critical.
During the year there was a £435.6 million cash inflow (net 
of costs) from the placing and open offer which was used to 
fund the acquisition of the Menulog Group in Australia & 
New Zealand. Cash generated from trading was also used 
to fund a number of smaller acquisitions during the year.
Current liabilities increased due to growth in our operations, 
which increases trade payables and also results in higher 
balances owed to restaurants at the year end. 
Non-current liabilities increased by £16.7 million, to £30.9 
million, primarily due to deferred tax liabilities recognised 
on the acquired Menulog intangible assets. 
Cash flow 
The Group continued its’ high level of cash conversion, 
benefiting from collecting the gross value of orders made by 
card ahead of making net payments to restaurants. In 2015, 
net cash generated from operations (including payments for 
tax and interest) was £74.2 million (2014: £38.1 million).

The Group spent £465.5 million in investing activities 
during the year. Of this, £451.8 million (2014: £13.2 million) 
was spent acquiring subsidiaries and IF-JE. 
At the balance sheet date, the Group had cash balances 
totalling £192.7 million (2014: £164.4 million) and no 
borrowings (2014: £0.3 million). The Group retains a 
£90 million revolving credit facility, which was undrawn at 
the balance sheet date and at 29 February 2016. Post year 
end, £43.8 million was paid out to our restaurant partners 
and we agreed to pay £94.7 million for the acquisition of 
businesses in Italy, Brazil, Mexico and Spain, as further 
discussed in the post balance sheet events note.
The Board has not recommended a dividend since the 
IPO as, in order to deliver longer-term value, the Group 
intends to retain any earnings to invest in development 
and expansion as opportunities arise. 
Post balance sheet events 
On 5 February 2016, the Group announced the acquisition 
of four businesses from Rocket Internet and foodpanda 
for €125 million in aggregate (£94.7 million), funded from 
existing cash resources. The businesses acquired at that 
date were online takeaway food businesses trading in 
Italy (PizzaBo/hellofood Italy), Brazil (hellofood Brazil) 
and Mexico (hellofood Mexico), with the acquisition of the 
Spanish business (La Nevera Roja) subject to regulatory 
approval from the local competition authority. It is 
anticipated the Spanish acquisition will complete by  
30 June 2016.

Strategic Report
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 revision 
of the Code, the Board assessed the prospects of the 
Company over a longer period than the 12 months 
required by the ‘Going Concern’ provision. The Board 
conducted this review for a period of three years, which 
was selected for the following reasons:
 — The Group’s strategic plan covers a three-year period; 
and
 — The significant growth profile anticipated for the 
Group both organically and by acquisition means that 
forecasting beyond three years is more subjective, 
hence the Board believes a three-year period is the 
most appropriate.
The three-year strategic plan considers the Group’s 
cash flows, forecasted underlying EBITDA, investment 
in areas such as marketing and technology and other 
key financial ratios over the period. These metrics are 
subject to sensitivity analysis which involves flexing 
a number of the main assumptions Underlying the 
forecast, both individually and in aggregate. Where 
appropriate, this analysis is carried out to evaluate the 
potential impact of the Group’s principal risks actually 
occurring where relevant (refer to the Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties on page 28 for further detail). The 
three-year review also considers whether additional 
financing facilities will be required.
Based on the results of this analysis, the Board has a 
reasonable expectation that the Company will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three-year period of their assessment.
Going concern
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing 
the financial statements, the Directors have made 
appropriate enquiries and have considered the Group’s 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
and business activities as set out on page 76 and in note 
35 to the Group’s financial statements on pages 97 to 99 
and the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties as set 
out on pages 28 and 29.
Based on the Group’s forecasts, the Directors are 
satisfied that the Company, and the Group as a whole, 
have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the 
financial statements have been prepared on the going 
concern basis. 28
Strategic Report
Principal Risks  
and Uncertainties
The Board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group.
This included those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity to ensure the 
principal risks and uncertainties were properly identified, 
evaluated, prioritised and addressed. 
During the course of the year, the Board defines the risk 
appetite and monitors the management of significant risks 
to ensure that the nature and the extent of the significant 
risks taken by the Company are aligned with the overall goals 
and strategic objectives that have been communicated. The 
Group’s risk appetite influences the culture of our business 
and how we operate, and this is reflected in our management 
framework (see page 47). The Executive team supports the 
Board in monitoring the exposures through regular reviews. 
Exposures outside of our appetite are communicated to the 
Board alongside actions to reduce the risk. 
New and existing risks were identified and assessed over 
the course of the year as the Group’s overall risk profile  
continued to evolve. The Executive team and the Board 
performed further analysis to prioritise these risks, with 
a focus on those considered to pose the greatest risk to 
achieving our objectives. 
There are general business risks faced by JUST EAT, such 
as those disclosed within note 35, which are those generally 
faced by other comparable online businesses. However, 
there are also more concentrated risks and uncertainties 
that affect our business or specific industry. The principal 
risks presented below are those risks considered by the 
Board to have a potentially material impact on the Group 
not achieving its long-term strategic objectives. There are 
additional risks that the Group is exposed to, which are not 
considered material but could have an adverse impact. 
During 2015, the Board reduced the priority of two of the 
principal risks highlighted in the previous year (the risk 
of changing consumer behaviour and the risk of non-
compliance with corporate reporting regulations). Mitigating 
actions taken throughout the year have addressed the risks 
to a level that the Board no longer considers them to be 
principal risks in the current year.

Competition
The Group faces competition 
and potential new entrants 
to the industry and to 
the markets in which we 
currently operate.
All initiatives Demand for the Group’s 
services and thereby 
its prices, revenues, 
margin and ultimately 
its market share could 
be affected.
In line with our strategic initiatives, we will 
continue building on our existing market-
leading positions. This includes focusing on our 
consumers, our restaurants and new innovation. 
We monitor competition in the market and 
use data analytics to ensure we can respond 
to consumer and restaurant trends on a 
proactive basis. 
Business growth
Challenges in growing and 
scaling the business both 
organically and through 
mergers and acquisitions.
Bringing 
greater choice
Fragmentation of new 
or expanded operations, 
which are not aligned 
with the Group’s 
strategy. Loss of control 
resulting in financial or 
reputational damage.
We continue to perform extensive due diligence 
of all new acquisitions and we closely monitor 
the market and country information being 
provided. A dedicated integration team is 
established to ensure all the benefits of any 
new entity are fully maximised and they are 
integrated to the Group structure to allow the 
continued growth in that market.
A key challenging in growing organically is 
having sufficient cash resources with which 
to fund the business. The Group remains PCI 
compliant and maintains a very favourable 
working capital cycle, with net operating cash 
flow representing 97% of Underlying EBITDA 
after adjusting for the impact of restaurant cash.

Driving 
channel shift
Costs could be incurred 
in ensuring compliance 
with any new laws 
or regulations. Non-
compliance could be 
damaging to the Group’s 
reputation, and result in 
penalties and heightened 
risk in the industry.
New regulation or 
legislation could 
materially impact the 
behaviour of restaurants 
and/or consumers in our 
sector to our detriment.
Legislative changes continue to be monitored 
by our in-house legal and compliance functions 
and our strategic responses are adjusted for 
these. The compliance function works across 
the business to ensure we remain compliant 
with existing regulation and are able to highlight 
where changes may impact business processes.
In key markets, we engage with different 
regulatory authorities such as trading standards 
and other government agencies to keep abreast 
of the regulatory landscape.
Culture
The Group’s culture may 
change detrimentally as the 
business grows, affecting 
the ability to retain and 
recruit talent. 
All initiatives Loss of culture may 
cause key employees 
to leave or operate 
differently within the 
business, resulting 
in a loss of crucial 
knowledge and/or our 
competitive advantage.
We focus on reinforcing our cultural values in 
all manner of activities that staff are engaged in, 
from work to social events. Further information 
on the JUST EAT “JAM” is provided in the CSR 
section on page 31.
Employee ambassadors are engaged to ensure 
the JUST EAT culture is promoted throughout 
the business, led proactively by senior 
management where appropriate.
We recognise the importance of retaining 
and attracting our highly qualified employees 
and strive to maintain a positive working 
environment which encourages innovation.
Technology dependency
High dependency on 
technology and advanced 
information systems and the 
risk that such technology or 
systems could fail or could 
not be scaled rapidly to meet 
business needs.
In particular, any damage to, 
or failure of online systems 
and servers via external 
attack (such as DDOS), access 
to JCT terminals and other 
restaurant systems, could 
result in interruptions to 
consumer services.
Improving 
the consumer 
experience
Bringing 
greater choice
The inability to service 
consumers or TRs will 
result in reputational 
damage and financial 
loss.
We have invested and committed considerable 
resources into upgrading existing technology, 
IT infrastructure, and communication systems, 
as well as developing and acquiring new 
platforms and products.
A continuous testing programme is employed 
to ensure functionality of product offerings 
and services is maintained.
Continual monitoring of the market is 
performed by a dedicated team to ensure all 
new developments are assessed for their impact 
on our operations.
The Group has a business recovery plan to 
minimise the disruption experienced during 
any potential service interruption.
The Group carefully monitors all new products 
in development and invests in high-calibre 
support when required.

Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s letter
At JUST EA T we 
recognise our wider 
responsibility to  
manage and conduct  
our business in a  
socially responsible  
and ethical manner.
During 2015, we undertook a 
comprehensive review of the Group’s 
Corporate and Social Responsibility 
policies, and are aiming to integrate 
this as part of our broader corporate 
values and strategy. 
Developing talent
As well as bringing in great talent, 
we also look to provide multiple 
development opportunities for 
our existing team. Every year we 
create an offering of development 
activity relevant to the needs of 
each individual, as identified in their 
annual Personal Development Plan. 
These opportunities are available 
to the entire global business and 
individuals can manage their own 
development online.
We encourage individuals to reach 
their full potential. Our multi-tiered 
JUST EAT Management Stars (JEMS) 
programme identifies and develops 
high potential individuals, providing 
them with the skills, knowledge and 
experience they need to become 
leaders. The ‘Manager Essentials 
Programme’ provides new managers 
with information and skills needed 
to be great people managers. 
Hiring talent 
In 2015 our UK FTE employees 
increased by 18% as we continued 
to grow, including two senior 
appointments to the Executive team: 
Barnaby Dawe as Chief Marketing 
Officer and Lisa Hillier as our first

Management Stars 
programme (JEMS)

future.
ever Chief People Officer. These 
important hires demonstrate our 
continuing commitment to maintain 
the strongest possible leadership team.
As part of our efforts to build an 
internal pipeline of future leaders, we 
have also committed to hire 22 people 
onto a specific graduate scheme in 
September 2016. They will participate 
in functional programmes across six 
functions, gaining exposure across all 
parts of our global business. As part 
of their training programme, they 
will gain professional qualifications 
relevant to their area as well as 
taking part in a business skills 
development programme to support 
their ongoing progression.
In order to attract and retain the 
best people, we have introduced new 
hiring and onboarding processes to 
ensure new employees get up to speed 
quickly, fit with the JUST EAT culture 
and will inevitably become strong 
contributors to JUST EAT’s future.
Reward
During 2015 we enhanced our 
benefits offered to include an increase 
to the amount that the Company 
contributes to the pension savings 
of our employees and the launch of 
a three-year Company Sharesave 
Scheme enabling employees to make 
savings and gain a direct stake in the 
future success of JUST EAT.

Culture 
The JUST EAT culture goes hand in 
hand with the success of our business, 
helping our people around the world 
work together effectively to maintain 
a high performance, entrepreneurial 
way of working. Our culture is 
driven by four key values known as 
the ‘JAM’; being frank, passionate, 
innovative and working as a team. 
We believe it’s important that our 
people live and work by our values, 
making JUST EAT a unique, engaging 
and fun place to work. 
The social highlight of the Group is 
the annual “World Party”. The day 
includes briefings from the CEO and 
Executive team, awards to celebrate 
individual and team successes, and 
team building activities to ensure the 
cultural spirit that has driven our 
success to date is reinforced.
Losing the Group’s culture is 
considered a principal risk (see page 
29). Whilst the Group’s processes 
and controls have been effective in 
managing our rapid growth to date, 
there is no doubt that being a listed 
company creates a new dynamic 
that we are consciously managing.

As at 31 December 2015 we had 
grown to 936 FTE employees in 
the UK across three locations 
(31 December 2014: 824); including 
our new Technology hub in Bristol. 
In addition, we employed 910 FTE 
employees across our international 
markets (31 December 2014: 684), 
bolstered by the acquisition of the 
Menulog Group in Australia and 
New Zealand. We embrace cultural 
diversity within our organisation, 
valuing and respecting local practices 
whilst maintaining a consistent 
Group culture which aligns us to 
our core ‘Jammy’ values.

Strategic Report
Health and safety
The Group’s policy on health and 
safety is to provide adequate control of 
the risks arising from work activities, 
and ensuring JUST EAT is a great and 
safe place to work. 
Diversity
We maintain consistent and 
transparent diversity policies across 
all our markets. We firmly believe 
that career opportunity, recognition 
and reward should be determined by a 
person’s capabilities and achievement, 
not their age, gender, race, religion, 
sexual orientation or nationality.
Our policy for the employment of 
disabled persons is to provide equal 
opportunities with other employees 
to train for and attain any position 
in the Group, having regard to the 
maintenance of a safe working 
environment.
Corporate Social 
Responsibility
Our policies
In 2015 we reviewed our HR 
policies and practices to ensure they 
contain a clear ethical component, 
are effectively and fairly applied, 
and that JUST EAT remains an 
employer of choice for existing and 
potential employees. New policies 
covering equal opportunities, 
anti-harassment and bullying 
and a code of conduct were 
implemented, demonstrating JUST 
EAT’s commitment to a positive, 
productive working environment. 
Our intent is to attract and retain a 
diverse, inclusive and representative 
workforce where everyone is 
treated with dignity and respect. 
Online training for employees is 
used to highlight these policies.
The Group’s whistleblowing policy 
is also available to all employees 
on our intranet. This details how 
employees can raise concerns about 
risk, malpractice or wrongdoing 
that may affect our restaurants, 
consumers, employees or which 
may be of public interest.
The Group has no specific policy 
in place regarding human rights, 
however the above policies govern 
how all employees, officers, 
consultants, contractors, volunteers, 
interns, casual and agency workers 
are treated. 
Looking forward, we are committed 
to creating an organisation that has 
a strong, clearly defined and unique 
culture that supports our strategy 
and our organisational design is as 
lean and dynamic as it can be.
We have determined that those 
members of management within 
the General Management Team 
(“GMT”) meet the definition of a 
senior manager. 
At JUST EAT we remain committed 
to gender diversity and acknowledge 
the ‘Davies Report’ recommendation 
that at least 25% of Board members 
should be female. 
Environmental policies
We are striving to make our processes 
as environmentally friendly as possible. 
To reduce our carbon footprint we 
continue to use paper which has 
been made from agricultural waste, 
as well as joining the ‘Fruitful Office’ 
campaign, which directly results in 
new trees being planted. The majority 
of our sales fleet utilise low emission 
vehicles where it is not practical to use 
public transport and initiatives have 
been introduced to increase the fuel 
efficiency of our vehicles.
Modern Slavery Act
JUST EAT is opposed to slavery, 
servitude, forced labour and human 
trafficking. We take a zero-tolerance 
approach to modern slavery in the 
supply chain and businesses under 
JUST EAT’s control. The Board has 
approved a statement about the steps 
we have taken (and will take) to 
combat modern slavery.

Strategic Report
Greenhouse gas emissions
Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions for 
the financial year ending 31 December 
2015 have been measured as required 
under the Large and Medium-Sized 
Companies and Groups (Account and 
Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended 
in 2013. The main activities which 
release GHG emissions include the use 
of purchased electricity, waste disposal, 
business travel and use of vehicles.
We have used the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
standards (revised edition), data 
gathered to fulfil the requirements 
under the CRC Energy Efficiency 
scheme, and emission factors from the 
UK Government’s GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2014 
to calculate the disclosures. 
• Scope 1 comprises vehicle emissions 
in relation to operational visits to 
restaurants.
• Scope 2 comprises our energy 
consumption in buildings.
• Scope 3 comprises other business travel.
In 2015, JUST EAT submitted a return 
to CDP to facilitate distribution of our 
environmental strategy and impacts.
Intensity ratio 
We have chosen to present our total 
emissions in relation to revenues, in 
order to represent how our emissions are 
impacted by the growth of the business.  
Despite 58% growth in revenues, and 
acquiring new businesses in Australia, 
New Zealand and Mexico in the year, the 
intensity ratio has decreased significantly. 
Community
In 2015, we continued to support 
Starlight, our nominated charity 
partner. Starlight is a charity who 
helps grant wishes for seriously and 
terminally ill children. All of their 
activities are aimed at distracting 
children from the pain, fear and 
isolation they can often feel as a result 
of their illness. A total of 93% of funds 
raised by Starlight are put back into 
charitable spending, an important 
factor for our continuing support.
Over the year we helped raise over 
£33,000 including funds matched 
by the Company towards granting 
wishes. We did this through bake 
sales and raffles at team events, plus 
a selection of JUST EAT employees  
running the London and Brighton 
marathons, finishing Ride London, 
Tough Mudder and the Three Peaks 
Challenge. We ended the year with 
a team travelling over 200 miles on 
a takeaway delivery scooter to two 
children’s hospitals in London and 
Cardiff to deliver over 500 Christmas 
gifts donated by our employees. 
Over the year we  
are delighted to have 
supported Starlight.
In July 2015, a team 
of 17 intrepid JUST 
EATers climbed

Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance 
Report
Our commitments to high standards  
of corporate governance and business 
integrity enable us to continue to set  
the tone as well as the direction of the 
management of the Group.
Dr. John Hughes, CBE, Hon DSc 
Chairman
This was the first full year of 
JUST EA T being listed on the 
London Stock Exchange. When we 
brought the Company to the public 
markets, it was compliant with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
with the exception of two provisions. 
It became compliant with one of 
those provisions in 2015 and is set 
to become compliant with the other 
in 2016.
These steps towards full compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) are simply a reflection of our 
wider commitment to best practice in corporate governance. 
This commitment remains at the core of how JUST EAT is 
operated. We view it as a key to the ongoing success of our 
growing business. This continues to guide and provide the 
structure to how that success is being achieved.
In the past year, there have been a number of key corporate 
governance developments in JUST EAT:
1.  Following a recruitment process led by our Nomination 
Committee, in September 2015 we appointed Diego 
Oliva as an independent Non-executive Director. Diego’s 
appointment has enriched the Board with his unique 
skills and experience.
  Prior to the end of the year, we commenced a search 
process for an additional independent Non-executive 
Director and expect to announce an appointment 
during the first half of 2016. I comment further on this 
recruitment in the Report of the Board and Nomination 
Committee on page 42.
These appointments follow on from Henri Moissinac 
stepping down as an independent Non-executive 
Director in July 2015.
2.  As well as our regular review of strategic matters at each 
main Board meeting, we held a specific strategy meeting 
of Directors and management to review, consider and 
guide the ongoing strategic development of the Group.
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs034-043.indd   34 06/03/2016   20:34 35
Corporate Governance
3.  Following detailed assessment by the Board, we completed 
our first major acquisition as a public company, buying 
Menulog Group, the clear market leader in Australia 
and New Zealand. The success of this acquisition is 
a reflection of the work put in by all involved.
4.  We undertook the first formal evaluation of the Board. 
This was externally facilitated and provides a guide for 
the ongoing development of the way the Board operates. 
A summary of the process undertaken is included on 
page 42.
5.  We completed the evolution of the remuneration of 
our Executive Directors towards typical practice for 
public companies.  
These developments are part of our ongoing process to 
achieve best practice in corporate governance. We view 
this as a journey rather than a destination. In the same way 
as JUST EAT in the past year has continued to develop as 
a business, so we will continue to evolve as a Board and to 
develop our governance arrangements. Our commitments 
to high standards of corporate governance and business 
integrity enable us to continue to set the tone as well as 
the direction of the management of the Group. I believe 
this will remain an important contributor to the ongoing 
creation of sustainable shareholder value over the long term.
UK Code compliance
This Corporate Governance Report, including the sections 
that follow, sets out how the Company has applied the main 
principles of good governance contained in the Code. The 
Board considers that the Company has been compliant with 
the Code provisions that applied during the year with the 
following exceptions:
1.  Code Provision B.1.2 recommends that at least half 
the members of the Board, excluding the Chairman, 
should comprise Non-executive Directors determined 
by the Board to be independent. For the purposes of 
assessing compliance with the Code, the Board considers 
that Gwyn Burr, Andrew Griffith, and Diego Oliva are 
independent of management and free from any business 
or other relationship that could materially interfere with 
the exercise of their judgement. The Board also considers 
that I, as Chairman of the Company, was independent 
at the time of my appointment.
  As well as our two Executive Directors, we have three 
other Non-executive Directors who were nominated by 
significant shareholders and are therefore not considered 
to be independent for the purposes of the Code. Whilst 
the Board was therefore not fully compliant with this 
part of the Code, we believe its membership has worked 
well. When Benjamin Holmes and Michael Risman step 
down from the Board by our 2016 AGM, the Board will 
become fully compliant with this provision of the Code.
2.  Although the memberships of our Audit and 
Remuneration Committees were not fully compliant with 
Code Provisions C.3.1 and D.2.1, respectively, for a short 
period following Henri Moissinac stepping down as a 
Director, both became fully compliant again once Diego 
Oliva was appointed to the Board and its Committees.
I look forward to reporting to you next year on how our 
governance arrangements continue to develop. This will 
reflect the Company becoming fully compliant with the 
Code. It will also take into account the results of the Board 
evaluation. We view continuous improvement as being 
important for us as a Board, just as it is for our business.

Corporate Governance
Report of the Board and 
Nomination Committee
The principal role of our Board  
is to provide leadership to the Group, 
set and monitor the implementation 
of its strategy and, with its standing 
Committees, to oversee controls, 
risk management and senior 
remuneration. Our aim is to 
ensure that the Group has in place 
appropriate people, financial and 
other resources to enable value to  
be maximised for shareholders  
and other stakeholders over  
the long term.
As part of the Board’s role, we provide both support and 
constructive challenge to management in the review of 
proposals, in the monitoring of performance and in the 
targeting of achievement of the Group’s aims, over both 
the shorter and longer terms.
This section of the Governance Report summarises the role 
and activities of our Board and its Nomination Committee 
and is followed by specific reports from our Audit and 
Remuneration Committees.
Membership of the Board
The Board currently has nine members:
 — myself, John Hughes, as Non-executive Chairman, 
having been independent on appointment;
 — two Executive Directors, David Buttress (Chief Executive 
Officer) and Mike Wroe (Chief Financial Officer);
 — three independent Non-executive Directors, Gwyn Burr, 
Andrew Griffith and Diego Oliva; and
 — three non-independent Non-executive Directors, 
Frederic Coorevits, Benjamin Holmes and Michael 
Risman, each of whom was nominated by a major 
shareholder and has served since before the 
Company’s IPO. 
The structure of the Board did not change through 2015, 
save that one independent Non-executive Director, Henri 
Moissinac, stood down and was replaced by Diego Oliva. 
As envisaged at the time of the Company’s IPO, Benjamin 
Holmes and Michael Risman will each be stepping down 
as non-independent Directors by the Company’s 2016 AGM.
Further details of our Directors are provided on pages 36 
and 37.
The diversity of our Directors provides the Board with a 
broad range of experience of both the Group’s business and 
of other international businesses, including other publicly 
listed companies. This enables high quality, diverse and 
relevant input into Board discussions, enriching debates 
and allowing carefully considered judgements to be reached, 
consensus arrived at, and decisions then taken.
All our Directors have a deep interest in ensuring the Group 
achieves its long-term objectives. They all devote sufficient 
time and attention to their Board duties and responsibilities 
and take collective responsibility for the Board’s 
performance. A proper balance of influence is maintained 
without one person or separate groups of people having 
undue powers of decision-making. All the Non-executive 
Directors bring strong and valuable judgement to bear on 
the Board’s deliberations and decision-making process.
The Board believes that its developing structure and 
membership is appropriate for this stage in the Group’s 
development and represents a good balance of skills and 
experience necessary to manage the Company and its 
business in an effective and successful manner. As part 
of the ongoing development of the Board, an additional 
independent Non-executive Director is intended to be 
recruited during 2016.
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs034-043.indd   38 06/03/2016   20:34 39
Corporate Governance
Role of the Board
Key activities of our Board include the 
following:
Agrees the Group’s strategic 
aims after considering 
recommendations from 
the Executive Directors.
The Board reviews matters of strategic importance at each of its main meetings. This is usually 
done in the context of a presentation on a specific matter of strategic interest by a member of 
senior management. In the past year, this has included consideration of further development of the 
consumer experience and increasing the choice available to consumers to drive channel shift more 
rapidly. It also includes review and, where considered appropriate, approval of acquisitions and other 
new business opportunities, as with the Menulog Group. As part of Board discussions of strategic 
proposals, Non-executive Directors constructively challenge matters when they feel appropriate as 
part of reaching an overall consensus in the decision making process. In addition, the Board reviews 
and seeks to identify risks at a strategic level.
As well as its review of strategic matters at each main Board meeting, the Board held a specific 
strategy meeting with management during the year. This included presentations by senior 
management on particular aspects of the Group’s business and development and agreement on 
their relative prioritisation of importance.
Aims to ensure that the Group 
has the necessary financial 
strength and human resources 
in place to pursue the agreed 
strategy.
This includes regular reviews of the financial performance and requirements of the Group, presented 
by the CFO, along with regular updates from the CEO on plans for the ongoing development of 
the management team in the context of the growth of the Group. This is supported by regular 
presentations by the Group’s Chief People Officer to the Remuneration Committee; and review  
of the senior management team by the Nomination Committee with the CEO.
Reviews Group performance 
against the agreed strategy 
and considers any variations 
that may become appropriate 
to this strategy.
As well as financial performance, the Board reviews the operational development of the Group and its 
markets to ensure its strategy remains appropriate; and to consider and decide upon any adjustments 
that may improve this.
Where appropriate, 
works with the operating 
management to assist in the 
achievement of the strategy.
As well as regularly reviewing presentations at Board meetings, Directors have open and constructive 
relationships with members of senior management who can draw on their wide business experience.
Sets the tone as well as 
overseeing implementation 
of the Group’s values and 
standards.
The Board leads the Group in a way that is intended to maximise business integrity and allow its 
people and other stakeholders to operate in a transparent and ethical way as an important part of 
ensuring the long-term success of the Group. This is supplemented by more detailed reviews of 
specific areas by the Audit Committee.
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs034-043.indd   39 06/03/2016   20:34 40
Corporate Governance
Board and Committee meetings
The Board meets at regular intervals through the year 
both at meetings scheduled as part of its annual corporate 
calendar and other meetings as required for specific matters. 
At these meetings, it reviews:
 — business performance;
 — operational matters of particular note for the Board;
 — strategic considerations; 
 — activities in the Group’s industry and any potential 
acquisition opportunities;
 — shareholder communications and feedback;
 — reports of proceedings of Board Committees; and
 — progress against previously agreed actions.
In addition to our Executive Directors, members of 
management may be invited to present relevant matters 
to the Board, where considered appropriate. Executive 
Directors and members of management may also attend  
and present on relevant matters at Committee meetings,  
at the invitation of the respective Committee Chairman.
Directors have the right to request that any concerns 
they may have are recorded in the appropriate Board or 
Committee minutes (although no such requests were made 
during the period). Minutes are circulated for comment by 
all Directors before being formally approved at the next 
relevant meeting.
Support to Directors
The Directors have free access to the Company’s management 
and advisors and to visit the Company’s operations. When 
new Directors are appointed, they receive a comprehensive 
induction facilitated by the Company Secretary. This 
induction includes meetings with key members of 
management, together with briefings on the Group’s 
business, its industry and public company duties generally. 
Directors have access to ongoing training as required.
All Directors also have access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary acts as 
Secretary to the Board and each of its Committees, reporting 
in these roles directly to their Chairmen. The Company 
Secretary advises through their Chairmen on compliance 
with Board and Committee procedures and applicable laws 
and regulations on governance matters. Directors are also 
able to take external advice at the expense of the Company, 
should they feel this is necessary.
Attendance at meetings
The numbers of, and attendance of members at, Board and 
Committee meetings and calls during the year are shown

Corporate Governance
Division of responsibilities
Whilst the Directors take collective responsibility for the management of the Group, the effective operation of the Board, in 
conjunction with management, benefits from a clarity of responsibilities. Key elements of this are set out below:
Matters reserved to the Board
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved for its or its Committees’ decision which include:
—  Group strategy, which is reviewed by the Board and 
management regularly during the year;
—  the Group’s business plan and annual operating budget;
—  major investments, acquisitions and capital projects, in which 
the Board monitors their subsequent performance;
—  internal controls and risk management, which are reviewed 
regularly by the Audit Committee;
—  accounting policies, which are reviewed in detail by the 
Audit Committee;
—  shareholder communications, such as announcements of 
results, this Annual Report and the accompanying notice 
of AGM to shareholders;
—  Board structure, composition and succession planning, which  
are handled in more detail by the Nomination Committee;
—  Executive remuneration policy and the remuneration of 
the Chairman, which are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee; and
—  the remuneration of the Non-executive Directors.
Subject to such reserved matters, and any other matters which 
the Board determines are appropriate for its specific decision as 
they arise, authority for the operation of the Group is delegated 
to Executive and other management within a system of defined 
authority limits. The matters reserved for the Board’s decision 
are reviewed periodically and updated as considered appropriate.
The Chairman, CEO and Senior Independent Director
Another important aspect of the division of responsibilities in 
any listed company is between the roles of the Chairman and 
CEO. In JUST EAT, these roles are separate and distinct with 
a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the Company 
established, agreed and set out in writing:
1.   The Chairman is primarily responsible for managing the 
Board, facilitating the effective contribution of all Directors, 
ensuring effective communication with shareholders, and 
that all Board members are aware of the views of major 
shareholders.
2.   The CEO, together with the CFO, has been delegated appropriate 
responsibilities and authorities for the effective leadership of 
the senior management team and for the day-to-day running 
of the business, for carrying out the agreed strategy and for 
implementing specific Board decisions relating to the Group’s 
operations.
In addition, Andrew Griffith, the Senior Independent Director, is 
available to the other Non-executive Directors and shareholders, 
either individually or collectively, should they wish to discuss 
matters of concern in an alternative forum.
Standing Board Committees
In addition, certain matters have been delegated to three 
principal Board Committees within clearly defined terms of 
reference. These remits, together with the composition of each 
Committee, are reviewed periodically as they have been in the 
past year. 
The current terms of reference for the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees are available on the Company’s website 
at www.just-eat.com.
Summaries of the roles of each of these Committees are included 
later in this Corporate Governance Report.
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs034-043.indd   41 06/03/2016   20:34 42
Corporate Governance
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises three independent 
Non-executive Directors and myself, John Hughes, as 
Chairman. The Committee is responsible for evaluating the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the Directors. 
It also reviews the composition and structure of the Board 
and makes recommendations to the Board on retirements 
and appointments of additional and replacement Directors, 
including succession planning. The appointment of our 
current independent Non-executive Directors followed 
a formal, rigorous and transparent recruitment process 
with the assistance of The Zygos Partnership, a leading 
external recruitment firm with no other connection with 
the Company, after assessing the skills and character profile 
that would be required. This included candidates meeting 
the other Directors prior to their recommendation for 
appointment by the Board.
One of the key considerations on any appointment to the 
Board relates to diversity. The Board’s policy is to continue  
to seek diversity, including with regard to gender, as part 
of the overall selection of the best candidates for Non-
executive Director roles. Any appointments of Executive 
Directors will also be made within the Group’s aims, as set 
out in our CSR Report on page 30.
In accordance with the provisions of the Code, each Director 
retires at AGMs of the Company and, if decided appropriate 
by the Board, may be proposed for reappointment. In 
reaching its decision, the Board acts on the advice of the 
Nomination Committee. Following evaluation of their 
performance, I as Chairman confirm that the performance 
of each of the Non-executive Directors being proposed for 
appointment continues to be effective and demonstrates 
commitment to their role. The Board considers that they 
each provide distinct and valuable input to the overall 
operation and function of the Board.
This evaluation of the performance of the Non-executive 
Directors included an assessment of their attendance at 
meetings and also their ability to devote sufficient time 
to the Company outside meetings. All the Directors being 
proposed for re-appointment attended all meetings they 
were scheduled to do so. They all devote ample time to their 
duties at other times and their roles in other companies in 
no way negatively impact their roles with the Company.
The Committee has already started discussions regarding 
the expected ongoing evolution of the Board, commencing 
the recruitment process for an additional independent Non-
executive Director.
The Committee also reviews matters in relation to the  
senior management team, considering succession planning 
and new appointments as they arise.
Performance reviews
During the past year, the Board and its three 
standing Committees completed an evaluation, externally 
facilitated by Glowinkowski International, which does 
not have any other connection with the Company. 
This evaluation involved:
Comprehensive questionnaire
All Directors completed a detailed bespoke questionnaire 
containing both quantitative measurable metrics 
and qualitative narrative responses to assess Board 
performance, focused on the following areas:
 — Strategy – including its development, priorities and 
implementation;
 — Communication – both internally and externally;
 — Decision making – including data and analysis;
 — Governance – including both structures and standards;
 — Performance – both of the business and of the Board;
 — People – including talent approach and strategy, and 
skills to be sought from future Board appointments; 
and
 — Sustainability – including its importance and 
integration into the business.
Full Board discussion
Steve Glowinkowski of Glowinkowski International met 
with the Board in a review and discussion of the results 
of the evaluation, both in terms of analysis of the resulting 
metrics and the narrative answers.
Having considered these results, the Board has agreed 
to follow up with specific actions as part of the ongoing 
development of its governance processes, which will be 
reported in next year’s Annual Report.
Governance discussions
Separate meetings took place:
 — During the year, amongst the Non-executive Directors 
and Chairman without the Executive Directors 
present; and
 — Annually, amongst the Non-executive Directors only, 
to discuss the performance of the Chairman. This 
included rigorous review of his attendance, and his 
substantial and valuable contributions, both at and 
outside formal meetings, concluding that he is able 
to and does devote ample time and attention to the 
Company’s affairs, that his broad past and current 
experience provides great benefit to his role in the 
Group and that his external roles had no negative 
impact on the Company.

Corporate Governance
Shareholder relations
The Board is committed to maintaining good 
communications with existing and potential shareholders 
based on the mutual understanding of objectives. 
A comprehensive investor relations programme underpins 
this commitment. The Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have regular dialogue 
with institutional shareholders in order to develop an 
understanding of their views, which is communicated 
back to, and discussed with, the Board.
Presentations given to analysts and investors covering the 
annual and interim results, along with all results and other 
regulatory announcements as well as further information 
for investors, are included on the investor relations section 
of the Company’s website at www.just-eat.com. Additional 
shareholder information is also set out on page 122.
Shareholders are able to contact the Company through the 
Company Secretary or Head of Investor Relations.
Andrew Griffith, our Senior Independent Director, serves as 
an additional point of contact for shareholders should they 
feel that any concerns are not being addressed properly 
through the normal channels. He may be contacted through 
the Company Secretary.
Annual General Meeting
All shareholders are encouraged to attend, and have the 
opportunity to ask questions at, the Company’s AGM and 
at any other times by contacting the Company. As well 
as the Chairman, CEO and CFO, the Chairmen of the 
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees will be 
available at the AGM to answer questions relating to the 
responsibilities of those Committees. 
The Notice convening the 2016 AGM, to be held on 27 April 
2016, will be issued along with this Annual Report at least 
20 working days in advance of the meeting to provide 
shareholders with the appropriate time to consider matters. 
Separate resolutions will be proposed on each substantially 
separate matter. The results of the proxy votes on each 
resolution will be collated independently by the Company’s 
registrar and will be published on the Company’s website 
after the meeting.

Report of the  
Audit Committee
As the Audit Committee, we 
assist the Board in its oversight of 
financial reporting, internal control 
and risk management. This report 
summarises our membership and 
activities during 2015.
Membership
Our Committee comprises three independent Directors, 
Gwyn Burr, Diego Oliva and myself, Andrew Griffith, 
as Chairman. 
Role and activities
We met five times as a Committee during the year. 
We considered this frequency of meetings appropriate 
during JUST EAT’s first full year as a public company. 
Mike Wroe, our Chief Financial Officer, and senior 
representatives of the financial management team also 
attend our meetings as do representatives of the external 
auditor and the internal audit team as appropriate. At our 
meetings in the past year, we received presentations on, 
and reviewed and considered the following matters:
 — the remuneration and proposed reappointment of our 
external auditor;
 — the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of the

Significant issues the Committee has considered How the issue was addressed
Business combinations
There were a number of changes to the Group structure during 
the year which included several acquisitions. As detailed in 
note 31, the total cash consideration paid during the year was 
£457.2 million, which resulted in an increase in the Group’s 
goodwill (£415.3 million) and acquired intangible assets 
(£65.9 million).
Valuations of the acquired intangible assets of the Menulog Group 
based in Australia and New Zealand and SinDelantal in Mexico 
were performed by external valuation experts. Management 
determined this was appropriate due to the size and complexity of 
these acquisitions. All other acquisitions in the year were valued 
internally by management. 
Valuation and accounting papers prepared by management 
and external valuation experts were reviewed and considered 
appropriate by the Audit Committee. To confirm that the 
valuations and accounting treatments adopted are appropriate, 
this included consideration of the following:
1.  cash flows and discount rates used in the business valuations;
2.  models and key inputs used in the intangible assets valuations 
including expected useful lives; 
3.  fair value adjustments made by management to arrive at the 
fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired; and 
4.  the approach taken to identify acquired intangible assets 
and challenging the balance of goodwill as compared with 
intangible assets.
The Committee was satisfied that both management and the 
external valuation expert used appropriate models for identifying 
and valuing assets that are core to the existing business model. 
Please refer to note 31 to the financial statements for information 
on the business combinations.
Potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
At December 2015, the Group had goodwill balances totalling 
£457.1 million and other intangible assets totalling £72.6 million.
Impairment reviews have been performed by management on 
the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) to which goodwill 
and other intangible assets have been allocated. The cash flow 
forecasts used were based on the budgets approved by the 
Board together with assumed growth rates, thereafter. The key 
assumptions around future growth rates and discount rates 
used were reviewed and considered by the Audit Committee. 
In addition, the Committee reviewed management’s sensitivity 
analyses regarding these assumptions.
The Committee is satisfied that there was no impairment of 
goodwill and other intangible assets as at 31 December 2015. 
Please refer to note 14 to the financial statements for further 
information.
 — the enhanced disclosures regarding risk, going concern and viability under the new provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code coming into effect this year for the Company; and
 — whether this Annual Report taken as a whole provides a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s 
position and prospects and whether it provides the necessary information to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy, the ultimate decision on which is taken by the Board.
Prior to approval of the Annual Report, the Committee, and all other Board members, receive a paper detailing those steps 
that have been taken by management to ensure the report meets the fair, balanced and understandable requirement. 
They also receive drafts of the Annual Report and financial statements in sufficient time ahead of signing, to enable them 
to challenge the narrative and disclosures where required. In addition, the Group’s external auditor reviews the Annual 
Report to ensure consistency between the financial statements and the narrative reporting as set out in the Directors’ 
responsibility statement in the Directors’ Report on page 116.
The Committee also meets privately with the external auditor and the Head of Internal Audit at least once per year and did 
so prior to its recommendation to the Board on approval of this Annual Report.
Significant issues
Prior to each meeting of the Audit Committee at which they are to be considered, management produces a paper providing 
details of any significant accounting, tax, compliance and legal issues. Management are also invited to attend these meetings 
where further guidance is required. The Group’s critical accounting judgements, as included within note 39 to the financial 
statements, are not considered by the Audit Committee to be significant issues in respect of the 2015 Annual Report. Those 
issues considered significant are detailed below. 
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs044-047.indd   45 10/03/2016   17:06 46
Corporate Governance
Internal controls and risk management 
environment 
The Board is ultimately responsible for the operation of an 
effective system of internal control and risk management 
appropriate to the business.
The Company has complied with the FRC’s Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting, as applicable, throughout the period 
and up to the date on which these financial statements were 
approved. Day-to-day operating and financial responsibility 
rests with senior management and performance is closely 
monitored on a monthly basis.
Internal control environment
The following key elements comprise the internal control 
environment which has been designed to identify, evaluate 
and manage, rather than eliminate, the risks faced by the 
Group in seeking to achieve its business objectives and 
ensure accurate and timely reporting of financial data for 
the Company and the Group:
 — an appropriate organisational structure with clear lines 
of responsibility;
 — a comprehensive annual strategic and business 
planning process;
 — systems of control procedures and delegated authorities 
which operate within defined guidelines, and approval 
limits for capital and operating expenditure and other 
key business transactions and decisions;
 — a robust financial control, budgeting and rolling forecast 
system, which includes regular monitoring, variance 
analysis, key performance indicator reviews and risk 
and opportunity assessments at Board level;
 — procedures by which the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements are prepared, which are 
monitored and maintained through the use of internal 
control frameworks addressing key financial reporting 
risks arising from changes in the business or 
accounting standards;
 — an experienced and commercially focused legal 
function that supports the Group’s operational and 
technical functions;
 — established policies and procedures setting out expected 
standards of integrity and ethical standards which 
reinforce the need for all employees to adhere to all 
legal and regulatory requirements;
 — an experienced and qualified finance function which 
regularly assesses the possible financial impact of the 
risks facing the Group; and
 — an ongoing risk management programme, including 
a comprehensive disaster recovery and business 
interruption plan.
The Committee agreed the internal audit plan to be 
undertaken prior to the commencement of the year. 
At each Committee meeting, the progress of the internal 
audit plan has been reviewed to ensure that it is in line 
with the Committee’s expectations. The plan was approved 
to ensure that there was appropriate coverage of the 
internal control environment, strategic priorities and 
key risk identified by the Board.
During the year, the audit plan was amended so that 
additional areas were added to the plan based on the changes 
that gave rise to increased levels of risk. These changes to 
the agreed audit plan were approved by the Committee.
Given the acquisitions that were made in the year and the 
growth of the Group, the Committee spent time ensuring 
that an appropriate level of coverage was in place to confirm 
that the control environment was appropriate to support the 
strategic priorities of the Group.
The Head of Internal Audit provides updates to the 
Committee at each meeting summarising the internal audit 
findings and the progress made against agreed actions from 
previous audits. Detailed updates on specific audits are 
provided at the request of the Committee.
How we manage risk
As shown on the following page, the Company has a robust 
risk management process that follows a sequence of risk 
identification, assessment of probability and impact, and 
assigns an owner to manage mitigation activities. A register 
is kept of all corporate risks and is monitored by senior 
management and reported to the Audit Committee.
Throughout the period of review, the risk register and the 
methodology applied is the subject of continuous review 
by senior management and updated to reflect new and 
developing areas which might impact business strategy.
The Audit Committee actively reviews the risk register 
and assesses the actions being taken by senior management 
to monitor and mitigate the risks. Those risks which 
are considered to be the principal risks of the Group are 
presented on pages 28 to 29.
Review of effectiveness
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, reviews 
the effectiveness of the internal control systems and the risk 
management processes on an ongoing basis. This process was 
in place throughout the year and post year end to include 
the date of approval of the Annual Report. At each meeting, 
the Audit Committee receives a paper from management 
detailing any whistleblowing activity, fraud identified 
and any other issue deemed to be significant. An internal 
audit update is also presented, detailing the scope of work 
performed and findings, along with implementation of 
any previous recommendations. The Committee has not 
identified, nor been advised of, any failings or weaknesses 
that it has determined to be significant.

Communicate
This approach to risk management helps to facilitate top-
down and bottom-up perspectives across key business  
risks within the organisation. The corporate risk register  
is presented to, and reviewed by, the Audit Committee  
on a regular basis.
Independence and performance of the auditors
The Audit Committee has set a policy which is intended to 
maintain the independence and integrity of the Company’s 
auditors when acting as auditor of the Group’s accounts. 
The policy governs the provision of audit, audit-related 
assurance and non-audit services provided by the auditor 
and, in summary, requires approval by the Committee for  
all projects with an expected cost in excess of £50,000.
During the year, the audit-related assurance services 
provided by the auditors to the Group mainly comprised the 
review of the half-year results. Other services performed 
by the auditors in 2015 related mainly to the prospectus 
required for the placing and open offer. They also included 
tax compliance and tax advisory work. 
The fees paid for these other services during the year 
represented 49% of the fees paid for the statutory audit and 
audit-related assurance services together. Further details 
of these amounts are included in note 8 of the accounts. 
The Company intends to comply with the new EU rules 
in relation to non-audit fees to the auditors which are to 
come into force in 2016 (which excludes work carried out 
as Reporting Accountants).
The external auditors are not permitted to provide internal 
auditor services to the Group. PwC have been selected 
as the co-sponsor for our internal audit work. Before any 
former employee of the external or internal audit team may 
be employed by the Group, careful consideration must be 
given as to whether the independence of the auditors will be 
adversely affected, and approval of the Audit Committee is 
required. This particular circumstance has not arisen in the 
past year. The auditors are required regularly to report on 
and confirm their independence in their role.
Deloitte were appointed as the Group’s auditors in 2009 and 
the most recent partner rotation took place in 2013. Under 
the new European and UK regulations, the Group would not 
be required to execute a tender process until 2024, however 
a tender could be required by 2019 if the Competition and 
Markets Authority’s current proposals are adopted. The 
Group will put the external audit out to tender to meet these 
requirements, however may decide to conduct an earlier 
tender if this is considered to be in the best interests of the 
Company’s shareholders. A tender is not currently proposed 
for the coming financial year as it continues to be a period 
of significant growth in which the Company benefits from 
continuity. The Audit Committee will keep this under 
review, in light of ongoing consultations by the Competition 
and Markets Authority and the Financial Reporting Council. 
The Audit Committee has assessed the performance and 
effectiveness of the 2015 external audit process in the 
past year, primarily through dialogue with the senior 
members of the finance and company secretarial teams. 
A detailed follow-up will be scheduled upon completion 
of the audit process (including the individual subsidiary 
statutory accounts audit process) where additional feedback 
will be sought from senior managers around the business 
(not limited to the finance team) through the use of audit 
quality questionnaires. The initial results of the assessment 
were discussed with the Group finance team, before being 
presented to the Committee, to inform our recommendation 
to the Board for the annual re-appointment of the 
external auditors. We believe that the Group’s procedures 
as summarised above safeguard the objectivity and 
independence of the auditors.

Report of the 
Remuneration 
Committee
This has been a strong year  
for JUST EAT , driven by  
disciplined implementation of  
the Group’s strategy .
Gwyn Burr 
Chairman  
Remuneration Committee
I am pleased to present our Directors’ 
remuneration report for the year 
ended 31 December 2015. 
Company performance
This has been a strong year for JUST EAT, driven by 
disciplined implementation of the Group’s strategy. A total 
of ten targeted transactions were completed during the 
year and a significant transaction has been announced post 
the year end. The year-on-year increase in all of our KPIs 
for 2015 (as presented on page 18) demonstrates how strong 
our performance has continued to be. In particular, revenues 
increased by 58% year-on-year to £247.6 million. 
The 2015 Directors’ annual bonus plan was based around 
strong financial performance reflecting revenue growth and 
growth in profits, as well as personal/strategic objectives. 
The out-turn of the 2015 annual bonus is confirmed at 
99.7% of the maximum level, representing 149.5% of base 
salary for David Buttress and 96.0% of the maximum level, 
representing 115.2% of base salary for Mike Wroe. In line 
with best practice, we are committed to transparency in 
remuneration reporting and have therefore provided details 
of the performance targets for the annual bonus financial 
metrics on page 51.
The pre-IPO share awards continue to operate on their 
agreed terms, with the performance condition for tranche 3 
of our Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”) being satisfied in 
full (Underlying EBITDA target of £15.5 million for 2015).
Remuneration policy for 2016
At the 2015 AGM we were pleased to achieve over 99% 
support for our Directors’ remuneration policy. Consistent 
with that approved policy, in 2015:
 — The first post-IPO long-term incentive awards for our 
Executive Directors were made under the Company’s 
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). These 2015 awards were 
made at 50% of the ongoing policy level. The first full 
policy level awards, which are 200% of base salary for 
David Buttress and 160% of base salary for Mike Wroe, 
will be made in 2016.
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs48-057.indd   48 06/03/2016   20:57 49
Corporate Governance
 — Consistent with the approved remuneration policy, the 
share ownership guidelines for all JUST EAT Executive 
Directors were extended, and now require the holding of 
shares worth 400% of base salary. Clawback provisions 
were introduced and will apply to the Company’s annual 
bonus plan from 2015 onwards and to all awards made 
under the PSP. Furthermore, the Committee was pleased 
to oversee the launch of the Company’s first employee 
Sharesave scheme in 2015. It is important to the 
Committee that as many JUST EAT colleagues as possible 
are given the opportunity to participate in our continued 
development and to share in the returns which our 
business has delivered to our shareholders.
 — The first of the staged adjustments in Executive 
Directors’ base salaries was made in January 2015, with 
the second tranche taking effect in January 2016. The 
Executive Directors’ base salaries are now £465,000 for 
David Buttress and £320,000 for Mike Wroe. No further 
benchmarking of base salaries was undertaken in 2015, 
although the Company’s market capitalisation has 
continued to grow during the year. Should performance 
continue to progress in 2016, the Committee intends 
to review base salaries to ensure that the positioning 
remains correct for the business. This may, if the 
Committee considers it appropriate, result in further 
(potentially above inflationary) increases to base salaries. 
For 2016’s Annual Bonus Plan, the Committee (in line with 
its approved policy) has made certain changes:
 — The balance between financial and personal/strategic 
measures has been re-calibrated to 70% financial 
and 30% personal/strategic (2015: 80% financial, 
20% personal/strategic).
 — The increased weighting to the personal/strategic 
measures reflects the introduction of quantifiable, 
customer focused metrics (10% total weighting).
 — Within the financial metrics, the split is still made  
equally between Revenues (35% weighting) and a 
profits-based measure (35% weighting). To better align 
the profits-based measure with the Group’s KPIs, for 
2016’s Annual Bonus Plan this performance measure  
will be based on Underlying EBITDA. The Committee  
will ensure the measurement of financial performance 
against the Underlying EBITDA metric is consistent  
with wider Group performance.
The changes made to the Executive Directors’ Annual  
Bonus Plan for 2016 will better align the Executive 
Directors’ arrangements with the structure of annual 
bonuses throughout the wider business and with key 
financial and operational KPIs.
The Committee has, reflecting both time commitments 
and market rates, agreed to increase the Chairman’s fee 
to £220,000 per annum (2015: £100,000 per annum).  
However, consistent with how increases to Executive 
Directors’ base salaries have been made, this increase will 
be phased such that in 2016 the Chairman’s fee will be 
£180,000 per annum, and further moving (assuming the 
Committee considers it appropriate to do so at the relevant 
time) to £220,000 per annum in 2017.
Shareholder approval
At the AGM on 27 April 2016, shareholders will be invited 
to approve the 2015 Directors’ remuneration report as 
set out in the following pages. For ease of reference, the 
Directors’ remuneration policy approved at the 2015 AGM 
is also set out as an Appendix to the Directors’ remuneration 
report, although we are not seeking further approval from 
shareholders for our Directors’ remuneration policy at the 
2016 AGM. 
The Committee continues to seek to reflect developments 
in practice as deemed appropriate for JUST EAT, and 
I hope that we can continue to rely on the support of our 
shareholders for the resolution on the 2015 Directors’ 
remuneration report which will be proposed at the 
2016 AGM.

Corporate Governance
Introduction
We have presented this Directors’ remuneration report to 
reflect the UK’s Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 
2013. The Directors’ remuneration report also describes 
how the Board has complied with the provisions set 
out in the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to 
remuneration matters.
At our 2016 AGM we will be holding an advisory vote 
on the Directors’ remuneration report. 
The Group’s auditors have reported on certain parts of 
the Directors’ remuneration report and stated whether, 
in their opinion, those parts of the Directors’ remuneration 
report have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006. Those sections of the Directors’ 
remuneration report which have been subject to audit 
are clearly indicated.
Directors’ remuneration policy 
The Directors’ remuneration policy was approved by 
the Company’s shareholders at the Company’s AGM on 
13 May 2015 and has been in effect for all payments made 
to Directors from that date.
For information and ease of reference, the Directors’ 
remuneration policy is included in the Appendix to this 
Directors’ remuneration report. The information in 
the Appendix is not subject to the advisory vote on the 
Directors’ remuneration report at the 2016 AGM.
The “Illustrations of application of remuneration policy” 
as required under the Directors’ remuneration policy has, 
however, been updated to reflect the current salaries of the 
Executive Directors from 1 January 2016 and 2016 LTIP 
award levels, and accordingly is re-presented to the right.

Annual Report on Remuneration
Summary of implementation of Directors’ remuneration policy in 2016 (unaudited)
Element of  
remuneration policy Detail of implementation of policy for 2016
Base Salary Base salaries for Executive Directors in 2016 are as follows:
—  David Buttress – £465,000 
—  Mike Wroe – £320,000
Benefits There are no proposed changes to the benefits offered to Executive Directors in 2016.
Pension No changes to the pension arrangements for Executive Directors are anticipated for 2016.
Pension contributions of 5% of base salary are paid into the Group’s defined contribution pension plan. 
If impacted by HMRC limits on contributions, amounts can be paid as a cash supplement in lieu of pensions 
contributions (reduced for the impact of employers’ NICs).
Annual Bonus Plan¹ The Annual Bonus Plan for 2016 will operate on a basis that is consistent with how the Annual Bonus Plan 
operated in 2015.
The Annual Bonus Plan maximum potential levels for 2016 remain unchanged at 150% of base salary for 
David Buttress and 120% of base salary for Mike Wroe. 
The weightings between financial and personal/strategic performance measures for the Annual Bonus Plan 
in 2016 are as follows:
—  Revenues – 35% 
—  U n d e r l yi n g E B IT D A – 35%
—  Personal/strategic objectives – 30%
The Committee selected these performance measures for the Annual Bonus Plan for 2016 as they represent 
a balanced approach to recognising success against defined objectives. 
Given the competitive nature of the Company’s sector, the specific performance targets for the 2016 Annual 
Bonus Plan are considered to be commercially sensitive and accordingly are not disclosed. The Committee 
currently intends to disclose the financial performance targets for the year ended 31 December 2016 on a 
retrospective basis in the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Annual Bonus Plan outcomes for 2016 will be paid in cash following the determination of achievement against 
performance measures and targets. The Committee remains of the view that at present it is not appropriate 
to defer any element of bonus given the Executive Directors’ current shareholdings, the PSP awards and the 
high share ownership guidelines, all of which ensure a close alignment of interests between investors and the 
Executive Directors.
Long-term

Performance Share 
Plan (”PSP”)
1
PSP award levels for Executive Directors for 2016 are to be as follows:
—  David Buttress – 200% of base salary
—  Mike Wroe – 160% of base salary
A holding period applies so that any PSP awards for which the performance vesting requirements are satisfied 
will not be released for a further two years from the third anniversary of the original award date. Dividend 
accrual for PSP awards will continue until the end of the holding period.
The performance measures for PSP awards to be made in 2016 will be based on EPS growth (50% of award) 
and relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) (50% of award). 
The relative TSR measure is calculated against the constituents of the FTSE 250 (excluding Investment Trusts), 
with vesting commencing at median (20% of this part of the award) and with full vesting at upper quintile levels. 
The EPS growth measure will require adjusted fully diluted EPS for financial year ended 31 December 2018 
of 11.0 pence (20% vesting of this part of the award) and with full vesting at 13.75 pence. 
All-Employee  
Share Plans
Executive Directors have the opportunity to participate in the HMRC tax advantaged Sharesave and Share 
Incentive Plans (“SIP”) on the same basis as all other UK employees.
Shareholding 
Guidelines
Guideline levels are 400% of base salary level for all Executive Directors.
Executive Directors are expected to retain 50% of the ordinary shares vesting under all share plans, after any 
disposals for the payment of applicable taxes, until they have achieved the required level of shareholding.

4. The long-term incentives column includes interests granted under the 2014 JSOP tranche 2 which were granted prior to the Comapny’s IPO. These interests have performance 
conditions attached to vesting, along with continued employment, as detailed within the JSOP section on page 54. These interests have been included in the single total figure 
table in the year for which the performance condition is measured. In 2014, as no interests had commenced vesting, they were valued at the average share price during the 
last quarter of 2014, which was determined to be 306.0 pence, less the hurdle price. As required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations, this has been revalued for 
2015 to be based on the share price during 2015 when they commenced vesting, which was 309.7 pence for David Buttress (1 January 2015) and 417.0 pence for John Hughes 
and Mike Wroe (1 July 2015), less the hurdle price. 
5. The pension numbers represent employer contributions to the defined contribution pension plan which was introduced during 2014. 
6. The other column includes interests granted under the 2014 JSOP tranche 1 which were granted prior to the Company’s IPO. This interest has no performance conditions 
other than continued employment and is therefore reported at the date of grant. The interest has been valued at the share price at the date of grant as agreed with HMRC less 
the hurdle price. 
As the Company listed in April 2014, part of the 2014 remuneration relates to when JUST EAT was a privately owned group.
The three non-independent Non-executive Directors, Frederic Coorevits, Benjamin Holmes and Michael Risman, received 
no remuneration during 2015 or 2014. 
T axable benefits (audited)
Until the Joint Ownership Awards are sold, the Company makes annual payments to participants, the net amount of 
which will reimburse the participants for the annual income tax charge that arises on such proportion of the outstanding 
beneficial loan amount as is attributable to the remaining jointly-owned shares. The annual payment made to the Chairman 
and Executive Directors and the taxable benefit arising on the outstanding loan amount are included within the taxable 
benefits column in the single total figure table. The taxable benefit arising on the outstanding loan amounts is detailed below:

David Buttress 42,084 43,199
Mike Wroe 21,110 22,410
Further detail on the Joint Ownership Awards is provided on page 54. 
The Executive Directors are reimbursed for commuting costs plus the related tax liabilities and David Buttress receives a car 
allowance of £7,900 per annum. 
The Executive Directors are non-contributory members of the Company’s private health scheme which provides cover for 
them and their immediate family, currently defined as their spouse/partner and dependent children aged under 21. 
Although not a taxable benefit, the Executive Directors participate in the Company’s life assurance scheme which pays their 
dependants a sum equal to four times salary if they die during their term of employment by the Company.

Adjusted PBT £39.3m £48.4m 100%
In calculating the outcomes against these measures, the Remuneration Committee has, in accordance with the Directors’ 
remuneration policy, used its judgement to exclude the impacts of the Group’s 2015 SinDelantal Mexico and Menulog 
acquisitions and the impact of the sale of Achindra, the Group’s associated undertaking in India. The adjustments removed 
from the financial measures include both the positive and negative impacts of these actions so as to ensure the integrity of 
measuring performance against the initially set targets, within which these actions were not envisaged. 
In line with market best practice, the Company has disclosed both the actual performance targets for the specific financial 
performance measures used for the 2015 Annual Bonus Plan and the relevant levels of attainment for those targets. Specific 
performance measures and targets for the personal/strategic performance elements of the 2015 Annual Bonus Plan are not 
disclosed as these are regarded as commercially sensitive by the Committee and are likely to remain so. 
Long-term incentives (audited)
Awards granted under long-term incentive plans with performance conditions attached are included in the single total 
figure table within the long-term incentive column in the year for which performance conditions are measured. 
The figures included in the 2015 single total figure table for long-term incentives represent the 2014 JSOP tranche 3. 
As detailed on the following page, the vesting of these awards was conditional on achieving Underlying EBITDA of greater 
than £15.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2015. This was achieved (Underlying EBITDA of £59.7 million for the 
year ended 31 December 2015) and accordingly a value is included for these awards in the 2015 single total figure table. 
Actual vesting for these awards commenced on 1 January 2016 for David Buttress and will commence on 1 July 2016 for 
John Hughes and Mike Wroe.
Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”)
Joint Ownership Awards have been made under the JSOP consisting of a joint interest in the shares subject to certain terms 
and conditions. The Ordinary shares subject to Joint Ownership Awards are already in issue and are held by an Employee 
Benefit Trust (“EBT”).
Under the terms, the participant’s interest in the jointly owned shares entitles the participant to share in the proceeds of 
sale of the jointly owned shares up to the aggregate of the participant’s subscription amount and the value in excess of a 
set hurdle. Each participant was required to pay a subscription amount for the jointly owned shares equal to the market 
value of the participant’s interest as determined by HMRC. In accordance with the terms of the JSOP, such amount was 
left outstanding as a liability to the Company. 
Report of the Remuneration Committee continued
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs48-057.indd   54 06/03/2016   20:57 55
Corporate Governance
As a preparatory step to Admission in April 2014, the Company called for all outstanding subscription amounts on the 
jointly-owned shares to be paid up in full. In order to facilitate this, the Company has made a loan to the Chairman, 
Executive Directors and other participants, the amount of which was equal to their outstanding subscription. The loans 
become due for repayment at the latest by the date on which the jointly owned shares are disposed of and termination of 
continued employment. When the shares vest, if the value of the participant’s interest is less than the outstanding beneficial 
loan amount, the balance remaining on the loan once the participant’s interest has been deducted is no longer payable. 
As detailed in the taxable benefits section on page 53, the Company makes annual payments to reimburse participants for 
the income tax charge that arises on the outstanding loan amount each year.
The Joint Ownership Awards vest over time, with 25% on the specified date established on grant and then equally on a 
quarterly or monthly basis until becoming fully vested on the fourth anniversary of the vest start date. Once vested, the 
participant can require the shares subject to the Joint Ownership Award to be sold and the net amount they receive will 
equal the proportion of the sale proceeds that exceeds the hurdle amount for their shareholding. 
The 2014 JSOP tranches have the following vesting conditions:
Scheme Vesting period Vesting performance conditions

Amount vesting if 
minimum performance 
achieved 
2014 JSOP tranche 1 25% one year after the vesting start

2014 JSOP tranche 3 As above Underlying EBITDA must be greater than £15.5 
million for the year ended 31 December 2015
100%
1. Underlying EBITDA is defined as excluding any costs of fundraising (including an IPO) and excluding any costs associated with acquisitions. 
Dividends payable on the jointly owned shares are split between the participant and the EBT, in proportion to the value 
of their respective interests at such time. There are currently no dividends accrued.
The following table summarises the shares over which the Chairman and Executive Directors had an interest under the 
JSOP and those interests that have vested and been sold during the year:

1. The face values for the PSP awards made in 2015 have been calculated using the grant price in accordance with the plan rules. For the awards granted on 15 April 2015, the 
grant share price was 439.6 pence which is the average share price over five days immediately preceding the grant date.
2. Details of the performance measures for the PSP awards granted on 15 April 2015 can be found beneath this table.
3. The minimum share price in 2015 was 318.3 pence and the maximum share price in 2015 was 496.1 pence. The closing share price on 31 December 2015 was 493.7 pence.
The performance measures and targets for the PSP awards made in 2015 were based on adjusted EPS and relative 
TSR performance.
2017 EPS (adjusted as set out below, 50% of award) % of that part of the award that vests
10.5 pence or more 100%
Between 8.5 pence and 10.5 pence Pro-rata on straight-line basis between 20% and 100%

Upper quintile or more 100%
Between median and upper quintile Pro-rata on straight-line basis between 20% and 100%
Median 20%
Below median 0%
The performance conditions for 2015’s PSP will be measured over three financial years to 31 December 2017. The EPS 
condition applies to the EPS achieved in the final year only, based on the reported fully diluted EPS (subject to such 
adjustments as the Committee considers appropriate) and TSR compares the TSR over the three months prior to the start 
of the financial year in which the grant is made with the three months prior to the end of the third financial year.
The Committee selected these performance conditions as they provide a suitable balance between absolute growth 
(through EPS) and relative out-performance (through TSR).
Sharesave scheme
The Executive Directors had the opportunity to participate in the HMRC tax advantaged sharesave scheme on the same 
basis as all other UK employees, for which invitations opened on 10 September 2015. David Buttress and Mike Wroe have 
both elected to make the maximum individual employee contribution of £500 per month as permitted under the scheme 
rules. As a result, they have received an option over 5,521 shares on this basis. The options have been granted at a price of 
326.0 pence per share, representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price at the time of invitation, and vest after 
three years with the options first becoming exercisable on 1 November 2018.

The shareholdings and awards set out above include those held by the Chairman and the Executive Directors and their

Under share ownership guidelines implemented by the Remuneration Committee, Executive Directors are required to build 
and then maintain a shareholding (excluding shares held conditionally under any incentive arrangements but including 
the number of shares to the value of any vested and exercisable interest under the Company’s Joint Share Ownership Plan) 
equivalent to at least 400% of base salary. At the 2015 year end, the Executive Directors complied with this requirement.
Performance graph and CEO remuneration table (unaudited)
The following graph shows the TSR performance of an investment of £100 in JUST EAT plc shares from its listing in April 
2014 to the end of the 2015 financial year compared with a £100 investment in the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment 
trusts over the same period. The FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts was chosen as a comparator because it 
represents a broad equity market index of which the Company is a constituent.

Percentage change in remuneration of the Director 
undertaking the role of CEO (unaudited)
The table below presents the year-on-year percentage 
change in remuneration received by the Chief Executive 
Officer, compared with the change in remuneration received 
by all UK employees. All UK employees was chosen as a 
suitable comparator group as this includes the UK call centre 
employees and excludes senior management and international 
employees who are on different pay structures.

2014 and 2015
CEO All UK employees
Salary 47% 9%
Short-term incentives 107% 19%
All taxable benefits 70% 27%
The rise in salary for the CEO is in line with the 
remuneration policy as approved at the 2015 AGM. The 
rise in taxable benefits for the CEO principally reflects the 
annual payment to reimburse the income tax charge arising 
on the beneficial loan amount that is attributable to jointly-
owned shares, which applied in 2014 only from the Group’s 
listing in April 2014, whereas in 2015 a full 12 month value 
has been recognised for this benefit.
Relative importance of spend on pay (unaudited)
The table to the right details the change in total employee 
pay between 2014 and 2015 as detailed in note 7 of the 
financial statements. In line with our strategic plans, 
earnings have been retained for growth and development 
of the business and therefore no dividends have been paid 
since the one paid in April 2014 prior to the IPO as part of 
a capital restructuring. Underlying EBITDA and Revenues 
have been used as a comparative measure as these KPIs 
are used by the Directors to measure performance. These 
measures have been calculated in line with those in the 
audited financial statements.

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating 
to Directors’ remuneration
The following Non-executive Directors were members 
of the Remuneration Committee during the year:
— Gwyn Burr, Chair;
— Andrew Griffith;
— Henri Moissinac; and
— Diego Oliva.
FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP (“FIT”) were selected 
by the Committee in 2014 as their remuneration advisors, 
after a tender and presentation process involving four 
leading firms. FIT exclusively advise the Committee and 
do not provide any other advice to the Group, nor do they 
advise management. This has, the Committee believes, 
ensured their objectivity and independence. FIT are 
members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and 
comply with its voluntary code of conduct in relation 
to Executive remuneration consulting in the UK. FIT’s 
professional fees for 2015 were £129,568 plus VAT and 
were charged on the basis of the firm’s standard terms 
of business for advice provided.
The Remuneration Committee also consulted with 
the Chief Executive Officer, Chief People Officer and 
the Company Secretary who attended, by invitation, 
various Remuneration Committee meetings during the 
year, although no Executive is permitted to participate 
in discussions or decisions regarding his or her own 
remuneration. Input is also sought from the Chief Finance 
Officer as appropriate.

For information only: Directors’ remuneration policy
The Directors’ remuneration policy as set out below was approved by the Company’s shareholders at the Company’s 2015 
AGM held on 13 May 2015. The section “Illustrations of application of remuneration policy” has, however, been updated to 
reflect current salaries and LTIP award levels, and accordingly is presented as part of the Annual Report on Remuneration 
on page 50.
The policy has been developed mindful of the new Corporate Governance Code and is felt to be appropriate to support the 
long-term success of the Company while ensuring that it does not promote inappropriate risk-taking.
Executive 
Directors Base salary Benefits
1, 2
Pension Annual Bonus Plan
Element and 
purpose
This is the core element 
of pay and reflects the 
individual’s role and position 
within the Group with some 
adjustment to reflect their 
capability and contribution.
To provide benefits 
valued by recipients.
To provide retirement 
benefits.
To motivate executives 
and incentivise delivery of 
performance over a one-year 
operating cycle, focusing on the 
short/medium-term elements of 
our strategic aims.
Policy and 
operation
Base salaries will be reviewed 
each year by the Committee.
The Committee does not 
strictly follow data but 
uses the median position 
as a reference point in 
considering, in its judgement, 
the appropriate level of 
salary, having regard to other 
relevant factors including 
corporate and individual 
performance and any 
changes in an individual’s 
role and responsibilities.
Base salary is paid monthly 
in cash.
The Executive Directors 
are reimbursed for 
their commuting costs 
and associated tax 
liabilities (up to a value 
of £12,000). Additionally, 
they receive a car 
allowance or company 
car (in the case of the 
CEO), private medical 
cover and insurance 
benefits. The Committee 
reserves discretion to 
introduce new benefits 
where it concludes that 
it is appropriate to do 
so, having regard to the 
particular circumstances 
and to market practice.
Where appropriate, 
the Company will meet 
certain costs relating 
to Executive Director 
relocations and (if 
necessary) expatriate 
benefits.
Executive Directors 
can receive pension 
contributions to 
personal pension 
arrangements or the 
equivalent amount 
can be paid as a cash 
supplement in lieu of 
pension contributions 
(reduced for the impact 
of employers’ NICs).
Annual Bonus Plan levels and 
the appropriateness of measures 
are reviewed annually at the 
commencement of each financial 
year to ensure they continue to 
support our strategy.
Once set, performance measures 
and targets will generally remain 
unchanged for the year, except to 
reflect events such as corporate 
acquisitions or other major 
transactions where the Committee 
considers it to be necessary in 
its opinion to make appropriate 
adjustments.
Annual Bonus Plan outcomes 
are paid in cash following the 
determination of achievement 
against performance measures 
and targets.
The Committee will keep under 
review whether it is appropriate 
for bonuses to be partly deferred 
into shares. Where such 
arrangements are operated, 
individuals would be able to 
receive a dividend equivalent in 
cash or shares equal to the value 
of dividends which would have 
accrued during the vesting period.
Clawback provisions apply to the 
Annual Bonus Plan as explained in 
more detail on page 62.
Appendix to the Directors’ Remuneration Report
1. Travel and hospitality
 While the Committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, it has been advised that corporate hospitality (whether paid for by the 
Company or another) and business travel for Executive Directors, Non-executive Directors and the Chairman (and exceptionally their families) may technically come within 
the applicable rules and so the Committee expressly reserves the right for the Committee to authorise such activities within its agreed policies.
2. Deemed benefits from JSOP participation
 Payments to any Director in respect of the deemed cost of interest on loans relating to participation in the JSOP and, if relevant, the writing off of any such loans are benefits 
within the scope of the Directors’ remuneration policy. The value of any such amounts is in addition to the maximum amounts stated in the table above for Benefits for 
Executive Directors and for Chairman and Non-executive Directors’ fees.

Executive 
Directors Base salary Benefits
1, 2
Pension Annual Bonus Plan
Maximum The Executive Directors’ 
salaries will not be increased 
so as to exceed the median 
for the equivalent roles in 
companies listed on the 
London Stock Exchange with a 
market capitalisation ranking 
which places them within 30 
above and 30 below that of 
the Company at or around 
the time when the Committee 
obtains such benchmark data. 
In practice, the Company 
envisages, for the three-year 
life of this policy, further 
discounting the data by 20% 
to reflect the Company’s 
high market capitalisation 
to revenue ratio but reserves 
the right not to apply such 
discount should it consider 
that to be necessary to 
retain or recruit appropriate 
executives.
Once a suitable market level 
is achieved, further increases 
would not normally be more 
than the average awarded to 
staff generally.
It is not possible to 
prescribe the likely 
change in the cost of 
insured benefits or the 
cost of some of the other 
reported benefits year-
to-year, but the provision 
of benefits will operate 
within an annual limit of 
£100,000 (plus a further 
100% of base salary in 
the case of relocations 
and expatriate benefits).
The Committee will 
monitor the costs of 
benefits in practice 
and will ensure that 
the overall costs do not 
increase by more than 
the Committee considers 
appropriate in all the 
circumstances.
The maximum 
employer’s contribution 
is limited to up to 10% 
of base salary, although 
it is not currently 
anticipated that this 
will increase above the 
current 5% level for the 
three-year life of this 
policy.
The maximum level of Annual 
Bonus Plan outcomes is 150% 
of base salary per annum for 
the CEO and 120% for any 
other Executive Director for 
the duration of this policy.
Performance 
measures
N/A N/A N/A The performance measures 
applied may be financial or non-
financial and corporate, divisional 
or individual and in such 
proportions as the Committee 
considers appropriate.
Attaining the threshold level of 
performance for any measure 
will not produce a pay-out of 
more than 25% of the maximum 
portion of overall Annual Bonus 
attributable to that measure, with 
a sliding scale to full pay-out for 
maximum performance.
However, the Annual Bonus 
Plan remains a discretionary 
arrangement and the Committee 
retains a standard power to 
apply its judgement to adjust the 
outcome of the Annual Bonus 
Plan for any performance measure 
(from zero to any cap) should it 
consider that to be appropriate.

Executive 
Directors Long-term incentives Share ownership guidelines All-employee share plans
Element and 
purpose
To motivate and incentivise delivery of sustained performance 
over the long term, and to promote alignment with 
shareholders’ interests, the Group intends to operate the 
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). The Company also has the 
ability to grant market value options under an Employee Share 
Option Scheme (“ESOS”), although it is not currently intended 
that Executive Directors will receive awards under the ESOS.
To further align 
the interests of 
Executive Directors 
with those of 
shareholders.
To encourage share ownership 
by employees, thereby allowing 
them to share in the long-term 
success of the Group and align 
their interests with those of the 
shareholders.
Policy and 
operation
Awards under the PSP may be granted as nil-cost options, 
conditional awards and forfeitable shares which vest to the 
extent performance conditions are satisfied over a period of 
at least three years.
Under the PSP plan rules, vested awards may also be settled 
in cash.
The PSP rules allow that the number of shares subject to 
vested PSP awards may be increased to reflect the value of 
dividends that would have been paid in respect of any ex-
dividend dates falling between the grant of awards and the 
expiry of any vesting and holding period for awards.
Vested awards will be subject to a two-year holding period 
during which time awards may not be exercised or released 
but are no longer contingent on future employment.
Clawback provisions apply to PSP awards and are explained 
in more detail on page 62.
The Company will honour the vesting of all awards granted 
under previous policies in accordance with the terms of such 
awards; in particular, outstanding JSOP awards (and related 
loans) will continue on their terms.
Executive Directors 
are expected to 
retain 50% of the 
ordinary shares 
vesting under all 
share plans, after 
any disposals for 
the payment of 
applicable taxes, until 
they have achieved 
the required level 
of shareholding 
(currently 400% 
of salary).
The Company-operated 
Sharesave Scheme and Share 
Incentive Plan are all-employee 
share plans established under 
HMRC tax-advantaged regimes 
and follow the usual form for 
such plans.
Executive Directors are able to 
participate in all-employee share 
plans on the same terms as other 
Group employees.
Maximum The PSP allows for awards over shares with a maximum 
value as at the date of award of 200% of base salary per 
financial year, which may be increased to 300% in exceptional 
circumstances.
The ESOS allows for market value options over shares with 
a maximum value as at the date of award of 300% of base 
salary per financial year, which may be increased to 400% 
in exceptional circumstances.
The Committee expressly reserves discretion to make 
such awards as it considers appropriate within these limits 
(although, as stated above, it is not currently intended that 
Executive Directors will receive awards under the ESOS).
400% of base salary 
for all Executive 
Directors.
The Committee 
reserves the power 
to amend (but not 
reduce) these levels 
in future years.
The maximum participation 
levels for all-employee share 
plans will be the limits for such 
plans set by HMRC from time 
to time.
Performance 
measures
The Committee may set such performance conditions on PSP 
awards as it considers appropriate (whether financial or non-
financial and whether corporate, divisional or individual).
Once set, performance measures and targets will generally 
remain unaltered unless events occur which, in the 
Committee’s opinion, make it appropriate to alter the 
performance conditions in such manner as the Committee 
thinks fit.
Performance periods may be over such periods as the 
Committee selects at grant, which will not normally be less 
than (but may be longer than) three years.
No more than 20% of awards vest for attaining the threshold 
level of performance conditions.
N/A Consistent with normal practice, 
such awards are not subject to 
performance conditions.

Chairman and  
Non-executive Directors Chairman and Non-executive Director fees
1, 2
Element and purpose To enable the Company to recruit and 
retain a Chairman and Non-executive 
Directors of the highest calibre, at the 
appropriate cost.
Policy and operation The fees paid to the Chairman and 
to Non-executive Directors aim to be 
competitive with other fully-listed 
companies of equivalent size and 
complexity.
The fees payable to the Non-executive 
Directors are determined by the Board. 
The fees payable to the Chairman 
are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee.
All fees will be subject to periodic 
review. For Non-executive Directors  
the fee structures may involve separate 
fees for chairing or for membership of 
Board committees.
Non-executive Directors will not 
participate in any new cash or 
share incentive arrangements from 
Admission.
No benefits are envisaged for the 
Non-executive Directors (including the 
Chairman) but the Company reserves 
the right to provide benefits (including 
travel and office support) within the 
prescribed limits.
Fees are paid monthly in cash.
Maximum The aggregate fees (and any benefits) 
of the Chairman and Non-executive 
Directors will not exceed the limit 
from time to time prescribed within 
the Company’s Articles of Association 
for such fees (currently £2 million per 
annum in aggregate).
Any increases actually made will be 
appropriately disclosed.
Performance 
measures
N/A
1. Travel and hospitality
 While the Committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal usage 
of that term, it has been advised that corporate hospitality (whether paid for by the 
Company or another) and business travel for Executive Directors, Non-executive 
Directors and the Chairman (and exceptionally their families) may technically come 
within the applicable rules and so the Committee expressly reserves the right for 
the Committee to authorise such activities within its agreed policies.
2. Deemed benefits from JSOP participation
 Payments to any Director in respect of the deemed cost of interest on loans relating 
to participation in the JSOP and, if relevant, the writing off of any such loans are 
benefits within the scope of the Directors’ remuneration policy. The value of any 
such amounts is in addition to the maximum amounts stated in the table above for 
Benefits for Executive Directors and for Chairman and Non-executive Directors’ fees.
Clawback
Clawback (being the ability of the Company to claim 
repayment of paid amounts as a debt within two years of 
payment) provisions apply to the Annual Bonus Plan and 
PSP in certain circumstances (e.g. misstatement of accounts, 
miscalculation of vesting/payouts and an act/omission that 
justifies summary dismissal for misconduct (which has no 
time limit)).
Stating maximum amounts for the 
remuneration policy
The Directors’ Remuneration Report regulations and related 
investor guidance encourage companies to disclose a cap 
within which each element of the Directors’ remuneration 
policy will operate. Where maximum amounts for elements 
of remuneration have been set within the Directors’ 
remuneration policy, these will operate simply as caps and 
are not indicative of any aspiration.
Differences between the policy on remuneration 
for Directors from the policy on remuneration of 
other employees
While the appropriate benchmarks vary by role, the 
Company seeks to apply the philosophy behind this policy 
across the Company as a whole. Where JUST EAT’s pay 
policy for Directors differs from its pay policies for groups of 
employees, this reflects the appropriate market rate position 
for the relevant roles. The Company takes into account pay 
levels, bonus opportunity and share awards applied across 
the Group as a whole when setting the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration policy.
V ariations in share capital
The LTIP and ESOS contain standard provisions that allow 
for the adjustment of awards to take account of variations 
in share capital, demergers, special dividends, etc.

Service contracts 
Executive Directors
The Committee’s policy is that each Executive Director’s 
service agreement should be of indefinite duration, subject 
to termination by the Company on 12 months’ notice or six 
months’ notice by the individual. The service agreements 
of all Executive Directors comply with that policy.
The service agreements reserve the right for the 
Company to make a payment in lieu of notice to an 
Executive Director for the amount of 1.2 and 1.1 times 
(for the CEO and CFO respectively) of base salary for the 
notice period if notice is served on or after 1 January 2015. 
The small premium to base salary reflects the Company’s 
estimate of fixed benefits costs. Such sums may be paid in 
instalments and would cease or be reduced if the individual 
finds an alternative role. Contracts do not contain change 
of control provisions but do contain provisions allowing for 
summary termination.
The Committee reserves flexibility, for an appropriate 
candidate in exceptional circumstances only, to introduce 
a longer initial notice period (of up to two years) reducing 
over time. 
The date of each Executive Director’s contract is:
Contract date
David Buttress 8 April 2014
Mike Wroe 8 April 2014
The service agreements of the Executive Directors are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office 
during normal business hours and at the Company’s AGM, 
including during the 15 minutes preceding this.
Chairman and Non-executive Directors
Each Non-executive Director and the Chairman is engaged 
for an initial period of two years, subject to annual renewal 
at the AGM. For Non-executive Directors, other than the 
Chairman, these engagements can be terminated by either 
party on three months’ notice.
The Non-executive Directors cannot participate in 
new awards under the Company’s incentive plans from 
Admission, are not entitled to any pension benefits and 
are not entitled to any payment in compensation for early 
termination of their appointment beyond the three months’ 
notice referred to above.
For the Chairman and each Non-executive Director the 
effective date of their latest letter of appointment is:
Name Date of Appointment Term
John Hughes CBE 15 December 2011 2 years
Benjamin Holmes 10 July 2009 2 years

of the Company, Vitruvian Directors I Limited, from April 2012 to March 2014.
The letters of appointment of the Non-executive Directors 
are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office during normal business hours and at the Company’s 
AGM, including during the 15 minutes preceding this.

Corporate Governance
Recruitment remuneration policy
The Company’s recruitment remuneration policy aims 
to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the 
appointment and promotion of high-calibre executives 
to strengthen the management team and secure the 
skill sets to deliver the Group’s strategic aims. However, 
as an external recruitment at director level has not yet 
taken place, the preparation of this policy is challenging 
as it provides for an event which has not been the 
Company’s practice.
In terms of the principles for setting a package for a new 
Executive Director, the starting point for the Committee 
will be to apply the general policy for Executive Directors 
as set out on the previous pages and structure a package in 
accordance with that policy. Consistent with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report Regulations, the caps contained 
within the policy for fixed pay do not apply to new recruits, 
although the Committee would not envisage exceeding 
these caps in practice.
The Annual Bonus Plan and long-term incentives will 
operate (including the maximum award levels) as detailed 
in the general policy in relation to any newly appointed 
Executive Director. Any recruitment-related long-term 
incentive awards which are not buy-outs will be subject 
to the limits as stated in the general policy (e.g. 300% in 
the PSP). Details of any recruitment-related awards will 
be appropriately disclosed.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the prior role may either continue 
on its original terms or be adjusted to reflect the new 
appointment as appropriate.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee 
may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation 
expenses as it considers appropriate.
For external candidates, it may be necessary to make 
additional awards in connection with the recruitment to 
buy-out awards forfeited by the individual on leaving a 
previous employer. For the avoidance of doubt, buy-out 
awards are not subject to a formal cap.
For any buy-outs the Company will not pay more than is, in 
the view of the Committee, necessary and will in all cases 
seek, in the first instance, to deliver any such awards under 
the terms of the existing Annual Bonus Plan and long-term 
incentives. It may, however, be necessary in some cases to 
make buy-out awards on terms that are more bespoke than 
the existing Annual Bonus Plan and long-term incentives.
All buy-outs, whether under the Annual Bonus Plan, 
long-term incentives or otherwise, will take account of the 
service obligations and performance requirements for any 
remuneration relinquished by the individual when leaving 
a previous employer. The Committee will seek to make 
buy-outs subject to what are, in its opinion, comparable 
requirements in respect of service and performance. 
However, the Committee may choose to relax this 
requirement in certain cases (such as where the service 
and/or performance requirements are materially completed, 
or where such factors are, in the view of the Committee, 
reflected in some other way, such as a significant discount 
to the face value of the awards forfeited) and where the 
Committee considers it to be in the interests of shareholders. 
A new Non-executive Director would be recruited on the 
terms explained above in respect of the main policy for 
such Directors.

Corporate Governance
Termination policy summary
It is appropriate for the Committee to consider treatment on a termination having regard for all of the relevant facts and 
circumstances available at that time. This policy applies both to any negotiations linked to notice periods on a termination 
(see Service contracts on page 63) and any treatments that the Committee may choose to apply under the discretions 
available to it under the terms of the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP plans. The potential treatment on termination under  
these plans are summarised in the table below.
Incentives
If a leaver is deemed to be a “good leaver”; for example, leaving 
through death or otherwise at the discretion of the Committee
If a leaver is deemed to be a “bad leaver”; for 
example, leaving for disciplinary reasons or 
to join a competitor
Other exceptional cases;
e.g. change in control
Annual Bonus 
Plan
The Committee has discretion to determine the 
Annual Bonus which will typically be limited 
to the period actually worked.
No awards made. The Committee has discretion to 
determine the Annual Bonus.
PSP Receive a pro-rated award subject to the 
application of the performance conditions at 
the end of the normal performance period.
The Committee retains standard discretions 
to either vary time pro-rating or to accelerate 
vesting (and release any holding period) to 
the earlier date of cessation (determining the 
performance conditions at that time).
All awards will normally lapse. Receive a pro-rated award 
subject to the application of 
the performance conditions at 
the date of the event, subject to 
standard Committee discretions 
to vary time pro-rating.
Under the JSOP, “good leavers” will retain the rights to any vested portions of their awards for a period and “bad leavers” 
will have their awards repurchased at cost.
SIP and the Sharesave Scheme provide treatments for leavers in line with HMRC rules for such plans.
The Company has the power to enter into settlement agreements with Directors and to pay compensation to settle potential 
legal claims. In addition, and consistent with market practice, in the event of the termination of an Executive Director, 
the Company may pay a contribution towards that individual’s legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a 
negotiated settlement. Any such fees will be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements. For the avoidance 
of doubt, the policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments.
External appointments
The Company’s policy is to permit an Executive Director to serve as a Non-executive Director elsewhere when this does not 
conflict with the individual’s duties to the Company, and where an Executive Director takes such a role, they will be entitled 
to retain any fees which they earn from that appointment. No Executive Director currently holds such an appointment.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
Pay and employment conditions generally in the Group are taken into account when setting Executive Directors’ remuneration.
The Committee receives regular updates on overall pay and conditions in the Group, including (but not limited to) changes 
in base pay and any staff bonus pools in operation. There is also oversight of the all-employee share schemes which 
Executive Directors and all other Group employees can participate in on the same terms and conditions.
Reflecting standard practice, the Company did not consult with employees in preparing this Remuneration Report.

as at 31 December 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the 
year then ended;
 — the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union;
 — the parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 — the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Other

Going concern and the Directors’ assessment of the 
principal risks that would threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the Group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the 
Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the 
going concern basis of accounting contained within note 2 
to the financial statements and the Directors’ statement on 
the longer-term viability of the Group contained within the 
Strategic Report on page 27. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to:
 — the Directors’ confirmation on page 28 that they have 
carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 — the disclosures on pages 28-29 that describe those risks 
and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
 — the Directors’ statement in note 2 to the financial 
statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them and their identification of any material 
uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to do so 
over a period of at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements;
 — the Directors’ explanation on page 27 as to how they 
have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern 
basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all future events or 
conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee 
as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm 
that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those 
standards. We also confirm we have not provided any of the 
prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Business combinations
As noted in the Report to the Audit Committee on page 45, 
there have been several acquisitions, changes in ownership 
and a disposal of Group entities during the year. 
As detailed in notes 14 and 15, £415.3 million of goodwill 
and £65.9 million of intangible assets has been recognised in 
connection with the acquisitions. Of this, the acquisitions of 
Menulog Group Limited based in Australia and New Zealand 
and SinDelantal in Mexico represented £390.2 million and 
£15.0 million of the increase in goodwill, and £60.9 million 
and £2.8 million of the increase in intangible assets 
respectively. The Group also entered into an option agreement 
and subsequently a forward contract to hedge the foreign 
exchange risk, in respect of the Menulog acquisition. 
The accounting for these transactions is complex due to the 
judgements taken in the application of accounting standards, 
for example the valuation of the businesses, the recognition and 
valuation of consideration, the identification and valuation of 
intangible assets and the accounting for the financial instruments. 
Due to the size and complexity of these acquisitions, our risk 
regarding acquisitions has been focused on these transactions.  
The associated judgements and estimates are described further 
in note 31 to the financial statements and in the Report of the 
Audit Committee on page 45. 
We have performed the following procedures to address this key 
audit risk:
 — Obtained and reviewed the share purchase agreements, due 
diligence reports and associated contractual agreements for the 
current year business combinations and understood the terms 
and conditions of each transaction to assess compliance with 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations;
 — Tested the initial consideration, either through cash or shares, 
to the signed purchase agreement and to bank statements and 
assessed the appropriateness of the fair value of the total 
consideration detemined by management;
 — Assessed the valuation models prepared by management to 
value the businesses and the intangible assets identified in the 
acquired businesses for both Australia and Mexico and engaged 
our internal valuation specialists to challenge the assumptions 
and methodology used by management;
 — Examined and assessed the inputs within the valuation models, 
including the future growth patterns to the historical trends 
achieved in more developed markets; and
 — Obtained the financial instrument contracts associated with the 
Menulog acquisition, and engaged our financial instrument 
specialists to perform an independent calculation of hedge 
effectiveness and assess the accounting treatment for the cash 
flow hedge. 
We also reviewed the disclosures presented in note 31 to the 
financial statements to confirm compliance with the provisions 
within IFRS 3.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in respect 
of growth markets
As at 31 December 2015, the Group recognised goodwill of 
£457.1 million (2014: £51.2 million) and intangible assets of 
£72.6 million (2014: £12.7 million). 
The Group is highly acquisitive and the current year acquisitions 
have resulted in an increase of £415.3 million in the goodwill 
balance and £65.9 million in intangible assets, primarily due to 
the acquisitions in Australia and Mexico as detailed above. 
In addition, goodwill of £48.5 million and intangible assets of 
£7.3 million is attributable to cash-generating units (“CGU’s”) 
in the development phase of their lifecycle which have not yet 
reached maturity. As such, there is significant reinvestment of 
generated cash, and consequently, increased risk of impairment. 
The key assumptions applied by the Directors in the impairment 
reviews are:
 — Country specific discount rates;
 — Future revenue growth; and
 — Expected marketing and staff costs.
As described in the Report of the Audit Committee on page 45, 
and notes 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, 
determining whether the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets is recoverable requires management to make 
significant estimates regarding the future cash flows, discount 
rates and long-term growth rates based on management’s view 
of future business prospects. Due to the relative sensitivity of 
certain inputs to the impairment testing process, in particular 
the future cash flows of the CGUs noted above, the valuation 
of goodwill and intangible assets is considered a key audit risk. 
In order to address this key audit risk we audited the assumptions 
used in the impairment model for goodwill and intangible assets. 
As part of our work, we:
 — Considered the projected future cash flows, understood 
variances between the forecast and actual results for the year 
ended 31 December 2015 and compared the forecast growth 
trends to historic trends achieved in more developed markets, 
that have already reached maturity;
 — Compared the long-term growth rates for each cash generating 
unit to external market data;  
 — Were assisted by our valuation specialists in computing an 
independent assessment of the discount rates used and 
assessing management’s methodology used in calculating the 
discount rates applied;
 — Assessed the appropriateness of the sensitivities applied by 
management to the impairment testing model including 
considering whether the scenarios represented reasonably 
possible changes in key assumptions. Performed further 
sensitivities based on recent trading activity and our 
understanding of the future prospects to identify whether these 
scenarios could give rise to further impairment; and
 — Checked the arithmetic accuracy of the impairment model 
and the amortisation charge in the year on the intangible 
assets and assessed the appropriateness of the useful economic 
life applied to those assets.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosure in 
respect of its goodwill impairment testing and whether the 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment 
assessment to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions 
properly reflected the risks inherent in such assumptions.

Financial Statements
Last year our report included one other risk which is not 
included in our report this year: share based payments. 
In the current year, whilst we still consider this to be a 
significant risk, we no longer consider it a risk that has 
the greatest effect on the audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources and directing the efforts of the engagement risk 
as the complexity largely arose in the period immediately 
post IPO. Accordingly, we have not included this risk in 
the table of risks on the previous page.
The description of risks should be read in conjunction with 
the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee 
discussed on page 45.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement 
in the financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person 
would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both 
in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £2.0 million 
(2014: £1.0 million), which is approximately 5% (2014: 5%) of 
adjusted pre-tax profit, 6% of profit before tax and less than 
1% of equity. Pre-tax profit has been adjusted by one-off 
acquisition costs on the Australia acquisition of £3.6 million, 
the net loss of £3.9 million on a foreign exchange hedges 
primarily taken out to hedge the sterling amount of the 
Menulog Group acquisition consideration, amendments 
made to the minority buy-out for two businesses of 
£0.2 million and gains on the India disposal of £3.0 million. 
These items have been adjusted to exclude the effect of 
non-recurring costs and gains. The approach is considered 
consistent with the prior year whereby the pre-tax profit 
was adjusted for IPO costs and the gains on business 
combinations. The materiality level reflects the increase 
in the size and scale of the Group. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would 
report to the Committee all audit differences in excess 
of £40,000 (2014: £20,000), as well as differences below 
that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee 
on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding 
of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement 
at the Group level. 
The most significant component of the Group is the UK 
operation, which accounts for 68% of revenues, 290% of 
profit before tax and -1% of net assets. The Group audit 
team performs the audit of the UK business without the 
involvement of a component team. Full scope audits were 
performed for both the Danish and French operations for 
the year ended 31 December 2015 by component teams. 
In addition, Australia, Canada and Spain were subject 
to a limited scope audit of specific account transactions 
and account balances. They were selected to provide an 
appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the 
risks of material misstatement. These locations represent the 
principal business units and account for £226.5 million out 
of £247.6 million of the Group’s revenues, £620.3 million out 
of £625.9 million of the Group’s net assets and £39.4 million 
out of £34.6 million of the Group’s profit before tax.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation 
process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm 
our conclusion that there were no significant risks 
of material misstatement of the aggregated financial 
information of the remaining components not subject 
to audit or audit of specified account balances.

Financial Statements
A senior member of the Group audit team has visited all 
entities where a full audit is performed for the purposes 
of the Group audit. Going forward, we will follow a 
programme of planned visits that has been designed 
so that a senior member of the Group audit team visits 
each of the significant locations where the Group scope 
was focused at least once every two years, and the most 
significant of them at least once a year. In years when we 
do not visit a significant component we will include the 
component audit team in our team briefing, discuss their 
risk assessment, attend the close meetings remotely, and 
review documentation of the findings from their work.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:
 — the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; 
 — the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements; and
 — the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the 
Company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in 
the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.
Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding 
of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement 
at the Group level. 
Adequacy of explanations received and 
accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 — we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit; or
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 — the parent Company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to 
report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration have not been made or the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review 
part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with certain provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to 
report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the 
Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
 — materially inconsistent with the information in the 
audited financial statements; or
 — apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired 
in the course of performing our audit; or
 — otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement 
that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced 
and understandable and whether the Annual Report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated 
to the Audit Committee which we consider should have 
been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any 
such inconsistencies or misleading statements.

Financial Statements
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply 
with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and 
Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure 
that our quality control procedures are effective, understood 
and applied. Our quality controls and systems include 
our dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
and the parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that 
is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

2. Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and 
International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee 
interpretations as endorsed by the European Union, and with 
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost 
basis, except for assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business 
combination, deferred contingent consideration, provisions for 
social security costs on the exercise of options by employees and 
certain financial instruments which have been measured at fair 
value. The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group are 
set out in note 39. These policies have been consistently applied 
to all years presented.
Going concern
For reasons noted on page 27, the financial information has been 
prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the 
Group will continue to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall 
due for the foreseeable future, being a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of signing these financial statements. At the date 
of approving the financial statements, the Directors are not aware 
of any circumstances that could lead to the Group being unable 
to settle commitments as they fall due during the 12 months from 
the date of signing these financial statements.
At 31 December 2015, the Group had net current assets of 
£95.3 million, and cash net of borrowings of £192.7 million. For 
the year ended 31 December 2015 it generated cash inflows from 
operating activities of £74.2 million. The Group’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on 
pages 1 to 33. Note 35 describes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted
No new standards or amendments to standards had any impact 
on the Group’s financial position or performance nor the 
disclosures in these financial statements. 
Early adoption
The following new standards and amendments to existing 
standards are in issue, but have not been adopted by the Group as 
they are either subject to EU endorsement or are not yet effective:
 — IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018);
 — IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 
1 January 2018);
 — IFRS 16 Leases (effective 1 January 2019);
 — Annual Improvements 2012-2014 (effective 1 January 2016);
 — Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable 
Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (effective  
1 January 2016);
 — Amendments to IAS 27 Equity Method in Separate Financial 
Statements (effective 1 January 2016);
 — Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of 
Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture 
(effective 1 January 2016); and
 — Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests 
in Joint Operations (effective 1 January 2016).
With the exception of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, the Directors do not 
expect that the adoption of the standards and amendments to 
existing standards listed above will have a material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group in future periods. IFRS 15 may 
have an impact on the Group’s revenue recognition policies and 
disclosures, however, until management’s detailed review has been 
completed it is not practicable to provide details of the impact that 
its adoption will have on the Group’s financial statements. IFRS 16 
will result in the recognition of additional assets and liabilities on 
the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Until management’s 
detailed review has been completed it is not possible to quantify 
these additional assets and liabilities, nor is it possible to provide 
details of the impact that the adoption of IFRS 16 will have on 
the Group’s Consolidated Income Statement.
3. Operating segments
Following the acquisition of Menulog Group Limited and its 
subsidiaries (together the “Menulog Group”) in June 2015, and to 
better align the Group’s businesses to their stage of development, 
the Group changed its operating segments for management 
reporting purposes. The Group now reports four segments: 
United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, Established Markets 
and Developing Markets. Established Markets includes Benelux, 
Canada, Denmark, France (acquired July 2014), Ireland, Norway 
and Switzerland. Developing Markets includes Italy, Mexico 
(acquired February 2015) and Spain. Until the November 2014 
merger which created IF-JE Participações Ltda (“IF-JE”), 
Developing Markets also included Brazil. The comparative 
segmental disclosures below have been restated for the change 
in operating segments. See page 21 for further details with regards 
to this change in operating segments.
Each segment includes businesses with similar operating 
characteristics and at a similar stage of development. Underlying 
EBITDA is the main measure of profit used by the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker (“CODM”) to assess and manage performance. 
The CODM is David Buttress, the Group’s Chief Executive Officer. 
Underlying EBITDA is defined as earnings before finance income 
and costs, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) 
and additionally excludes the Group’s share of depreciation and 
amortisation of associates and joint ventures, long-term employee 
incentive costs, exceptional items, foreign exchange gains and 
losses and ‘other gains and losses’ . At a segmental level, Underlying 
EBITDA also excludes intra-group franchise fee arrangements and 
incorporates an allocation of Group technology and central costs 
(all of which net out on a consolidated level).

In January 2015 the Group recognised a gain of £3.0 million on the sale of its entire shareholding in Achindra Online Marketing Private 
Limited, the Group’s Indian associated undertaking. 
The Group is committed to the future acquisition of the minority shareholdings of two of its subsidiaries. The estimated liabilities 
for these commitments increased by a net £0.2 million during the year.
A net loss of £3.9 million was recognised on two hedges taken out to hedge the sterling amount of the Menulog Group acquisition 
consideration, which was payable in Australian dollars. The net loss comprised a £4.6 million loss on one hedge and a £0.7 million gain 
on a second hedge.
A fair value gain was recognised on the embedded option within a convertible loan which had been provided to El Cocinero A Cuerda SL 
in 2012. The loan was converted into shares as part of the Group’s acquisition of El Cocinero A Cuerda SL in February 2015.
Year ended 31 December 2014
In July 2014, the Group increased its stake in the French business from 50% to 80%. This resulted in a change in control and so the 
business was no longer treated as a joint venture, but as a subsidiary. The transaction resulted in a non-cash gain of £32.0 million, 
of which £17.8 million was the gain on the deemed disposal of the Joint Venture and £14.2 million resulted from the fair value gains 
on the Group’s option to acquire the remaining shares.
In November 2014, the control of the Group’s Brazilian business also changed from being classified as a subsidiary to an associate, 
resulting in a further non-cash deemed disposal gain of £5.8 million.

12. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share was calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to the shareholders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, excluding unvested shares held pursuant to the Group’s JSOP and SIP.
Prior to 8 April 2014, holders of the B Ordinary shares had rights to share in profits which differed to those of the holders of Ordinary 
shares, Preference A shares, Preference B shares and Preference C shares. Earnings per share figures have therefore been presented 
separately for the B Ordinary shares, up until 8 April 2014. The B Ordinary shares, Preference A shares, Preference B shares and 
Preference C shares were reclassified as Ordinary shares on 8 April 2014. 
The B Ordinary shareholders were only entitled to dividends after aggregate distributions of £18.25 million had been made to the holders 
of Ordinary shares, Preference A shares, Preference B shares and Preference C shares. Prior to 8 April 2014, aggregate distributions of 
this amount had not been made. As a result no earnings were attributable to the Ordinary B shares in the earnings per share (“EPS”) 
calculations.
Diluted earnings per share was calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion 
of all potentially dilutive shares. The Group had potentially dilutive shares in the form of share options, warrants and unvested shares 
held pursuant to the Group’s JSOP and SIP.
Adjusted earnings per share is the main measure of earnings per share used by the Group and is calculated using an underlying profit 
measure attributable to the holders of Ordinary shares in the parent, which is defined as profit attributable to the holders of Ordinary 
shares in the parent, before long-term employee incentive costs, exceptional items, ‘other gains and losses, ’ foreign exchange gains and 
losses, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and the tax impact of the adjusting items. 
Basic and diluted earnings per share have been calculated as follows:

Preference C shares and Ordinary shares pro rata to their holding of shares in the Company. The dividend was paid on 8 April 2014. 
The dividend disclosed in the consolidated financial statements (£18.1 million), is stated net of the amount of the dividends earned by 
the Group’s employee benefit trustee. No dividends have been declared or paid in the current year.

*Orogo Limited was integrated into the UK CGU during 2015.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications of impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations. The key assumptions used in the value-in-use 
calculations are the discount rate and the Underlying EBITDA growth (which is a function of increases in the number of orders generated 
and increases in costs, together with other factors). Management uses pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the particular CGU. Underlying EBITDA growth is based on past experience and 
management’s future expectations. The growth in orders and increases in costs are based on recent results and management’s 
expectations for the future.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board. Management expects that 
some markets will enjoy a period of sustained high growth continuing from the end of the current budgetary cycle to maturity (the 
medium-term). During this period each CGU will continue to acquire new consumers and increase order activity above and beyond the 
long-term growth rate applicable to each market. Management expects that a number of CGUs with the exception of the UK, Denmark, 
Ireland and Swizerland, will reach maturity after a period in excess of five years and therefore considers it appropriate for the forecasts 
to extend beyond a five-year period. A suitable medium-term growth rate, based on previous experience of growth rates (including 
historical growth rates of all CGUs) has been applied individually to reflect each CGU’s activity in this period. After this, a long-term 
growth rate is applied. This is typically between 5 and 7 years from the start of the forecast period. The Directors believe that it is 
appropriate to use forecasts extending beyond five years where a CGU is expected to grow significantly beyond five years and not 
reach maturity within that period.
The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows were in the range of 9.1% to 15.3% for all geographies (2014: 10.6% to 18.4%).  
The long-term growth rates used in the forecast cash flows were in the range of 1.4% to 3.1% (2014: 1.6% to 2.2%).

Years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014
For all CGUs, the value-in-use was in excess of the carrying value of the CGU. As a result, no impairments were required.
Sensitivity analysis
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test for each CGU. This included reducing the future cash flows and 
increasing discount rates. With the exception of the Australia & New Zealand and the Mexican CGU, no reasonably expected change in 
the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations would give rise to an impairment charge. The impairment review for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 concluded that there were no CGUs where a reasonable change in the key assumptions used in the value-in-use 
calculations would give rise to an impairment charge. 
The sensitivity process included:
 — increasing pre-tax discount rates by 2.0%; and 
 — reducing the anticipated Underlying EBITDA growth and hence future cash flow. 
For illustrative purposes, the reduction of the anticipated 2025 revenues and Underlying EBITDA resulted in the Underlying EBITDA 
reducing by 22.0% in Australia & New Zealand and 56.9% in Mexico. 
If the sensitivities for the Australia & New Zealand and Mexican CGUs were taken in isolation, there would be the following impairment:

Australia & New Zealand
£m
Mexico
£m
Increased pre-tax discount rate (13.4) 15.0
Reduced Underlying EBITDA growth (43.0) (12.2)
In order for the carrying amount and recoverable amount to be equal:
 — the pre-tax discount rate for Australia & New Zealand would have to increase by 1.7% and that for Mexico would have to increase by 6.4%; or 
 — projected 2025 Underlying EBITDA decreases by 15% for Australia & New Zealand and 40% for Mexico.

Deferred tax is provided in respect of temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and is 
determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered. 
The deferred tax asset on losses includes an asset of £2.4 million relating to losses generated in Australia during the period. A deferred 
tax asset has been recognised on these losses on the basis of forecasted profits in Australia.

Trade receivables
Trade receivables disclosed above are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost. The average age 
of the trade receivables as at 31 December 2015 was 96 days (2014: 72 days). As at 31 December 2015, 20% (2014: 42%) of the trade 
receivables were less than 30 days old, 11% (2014: 15%) were between 30 and 60 days old, 7% (2014: 8%) were between 60 and 90 days 
old and 62% (2014: 35%) were over 90 days old.
The Group has reviewed all balances and has made an allowance for debts which are considered unlikely to be collectable based on past 
default experience, and an analysis of the counterparty’s current financial position. Allowances against doubtful debts are recognised 
against trade receivables.
Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts which are past due at the reporting date but against which the Group has not 
recognised an allowance for doubtful receivables because there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts 
are still considered recoverable. 
The Group does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements over these balances.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the consumer base 
being large and unrelated. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables, after taking into account 
the allowance for doubtful debts, is approximately equal to their fair value. At 31 December 2015, £1.0 million (2014: £0.7 million) of 
the allowance for doubtful debts was in respect of receivables more than 120 days old. 
Other debtors
At 31 December 2015, other debtors of £4.7 million (2014: £5.7 million) included amounts due from loans made to the participants 
of the JSOP of £3.7 million (2014: £5.2 million). The carrying amounts of these assets approximates their fair value.

Trade creditors, and other creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. 
Included in the trade creditors balance were amounts owed to restaurants (2015: £43.8 million; 2014: £27.7 million). These amounts are 
typically settled on a fortnightly basis. The average credit period taken for restaurants is eight days (2014: eight days). For most suppliers 
no interest is charged on the trade payables for at least the first 30 days from the date of the invoice. 
The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed credit terms. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

The provisions in respect of the forward contracts to acquire non-controlling interests relate to the Group’s commitments to buy-out 
the minority shareholders of FBA Invest SaS and Orogo Limited. The provision relating to FBA Invest SaS increased by £3.6 million 
during the year due to an increase in the forecast results of FBA Invest SaS’s trading subsidiary, and hence the estimated cost of acquiring 
the minority interest. Prior to 31 December 2015, the Group has agreed to acquire the Orogo Limited non-controlling interests earlier 
than had previously been agreed. The agreed consideration of £0.2 million is payable in April 2016. As a result, the provision for the 
acquisition of the minority interest has been reduced by £3.4 million, with the remaining liability of £0.2 million being transferred 
to other creditors. The net charge to the income statement arising on the movements in these two provisions, £0.2 million, has been 
charged to other gains and losses (see note 9).
As at 31 December 2015, £0.3 million (2014: £0.3 million) of the total provisions related to employer’s social security costs that crystallise 
on the exercise of share options by employees.

On 11 February 2015, the Group acquired a further 5% stake in IF-JE (see note 31). The consideration payable of £6.7 million, was 
dependent upon the performance of IF-JE, for the period to 31 October 2015, and is payable in instalments over the period to 31 October 
2016. The cash outflow during the year ended 31 December 2015 was £3.4 million. £3.9 million was transferred to creditors once the

On 11 June 2015, the Group raised £435.6 million (net of costs) through a placing and open offer of 105.4 million new one pence Ordinary 
shares at a price of 425 pence per share. The proceeds were principally used to fund the acquisition of the Menulog Group. Costs of 
£12.4 million that related directly to the placing and open offer have been deducted from the share premium account. 
Year ended 31 December 2014
On 20 March 2014 the Company’s share premium account was reduced by £40.0 million by way of a reduction of capital. On the same 
day the Company conducted a bonus issue of 2,699 shares for every one Ordinary share, B Ordinary share, Preference A share, 
Preference B share and Preference C share in issue. This was followed by a consolidation of each of the Ordinary shares, B Ordinary 
shares, Preference A shares, Preference B shares and Preference C shares such that the nominal value of each share increased from 
£0.0001 to £0.01.
On 24 March 2014 the Company re-registered as JUST EAT plc.
On 8 April 2014 the Company’s Ordinary shares were admitted to the High Growth Segment of the Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange (the “Listing”). In conjunction, the Company made an initial public offering (“IPO”) of 38.5 million new one pence Ordinary 
shares at a price of 260 pence per share. Also on this date, immediately prior to the Listing, 29.8 million B Ordinary shares, 134.3 million 
Preference A shares, 48.8 million Preference B shares and 67.6 million Preference C shares converted to Ordinary shares. 
Costs that related directly to the issue of new shares have been deducted from the share premium account. IPO costs that related to both 
the Listing and issue of new shares have been allocated between the share premium account and the income statement in proportion 
to the number of primary and secondary shares traded on admission. As a result, during the year ended 31 December 2014, IPO costs 
totalling £4.5 million were charged to the share premium account and IPO costs of £2.3 million were charged to the income statement.

Translation reserve
Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets, income and expenses of the Group’s foreign operations, from their 
functional currency into the parent’s reporting currency, being Pound Sterling, are recognised directly in the translation reserve. 
Merger reserve
In July 2009 a Group reorganisation was undertaken. Under this reconstruction, Ordinary shares were issued and cancelled and 
Preference A shares were issued.  This was treated as a common control transaction under IFRS as the ultimate shareholders and their 
relative rights were the same before and afterwards. This reserve represents the difference between the nominal value of the shares 
issued and the nominal value of the shares on the Group reorganisation in July 2009. The balance of this account has not changed 
and remains at £1.9 million as at 31 December 2015.
Treasury shares reserve
This reserve arose when the Group issued equity share capital under its JSOP and SIP, which are held in trust by the trustee of the 
Group’s employee benefit trust (“EBT”). See note 34 for more information on the JSOP and SIP.
Cash flow hedging reserve
The cash flow hedging reserve represents the cumulative effective portion of gains or losses arising on changes in the fair value of 
hedging instruments entered into for cash flow hedges. The cumulative gains or losses arising on the hedging instruments are recognised 
in the cash flow hedging reserve. These gains or losses are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects the income 
statement, or included as a basis adjustment to the non-financial hedged item, consistent with the Group’s accounting policy.

29. Retained earnings continued
Under IAS 12, to the extent that the tax deduction available on the exercise of share options is equal to, or is less than, the cumulative 
share based payment charge calculated under IFRS 2, current and deferred tax is recognised through the income statement. However, 
when the tax deduction is greater than the cumulative expense, the incremental current tax deduction and deferred tax recognition 
is recognised in equity.

**Immediately after acquisition, Nifty Nosh Limited’s orders were diverted to Just Eat.co.uk Limited, from which time it was not possible 
to track separately the results of Nifty Nosh Limited. Similarly, Clicca e Mangia’s orders were immediately diverted to Just-Eat Italy S.r.l., 
and Restaurants on the Go Inc (“Order.it.ca”) to Just Eat Canada. As a result it is not possible to disclose the post-acquisition contribution 
of these businesses. 
In addition to the acquisition costs noted above, £0.2 million were incurred on increased shareholdings, £0.3 million on ongoing 
acquisitions at 31 December 2015, and £0.8 million on aborted acquisitions.
Net cash outflow on acquisition of businesses
The net cash outflow on acquisition of businesses during the year ended 31 December 2015 as shown in the table above was £448.0 million. 
The amount in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement also includes £0.4 million of deferred consideration paid during the year in respect 
of the 2013 acquisition of Power & Power Inc. For the year ended 31 December 2014, the net cash outflow of £8.8 million principally 
related to the acquisition of FBA Invest SaS and Eat On Line Sa (£3.5 million) and Meal2Order.com Limited (£3.7 million).
Acquired businesses
On 13 February 2015 the Group acquired the entire share capital of SinDelantal Mexico SA de CV (“SinDelantal Mexico”). SinDelantal 
Mexico is the market leader in the digital marketplace for takeaway food in Mexico. 
On 22 May 2015 the Group acquired the business assets of Clicca e Mangia based in Milan. On 5 June 2015 the Group acquired the entire 
share capital of Jeb Srl (“DeliveRex”) in Rome. These transactions added several hundred restaurants to the Group’s network. 
On 15 June 2015 the Group acquired the entire share capital of Menulog Group Limited (“Menulog”), which is the market leader in 
the Australian and New Zealand digital marketplace for takeaway food. It has 1.6 million active consumers. 
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs085-093.indd   93 06/03/2016   20:14 94
31. Business combinations continued
On 6 July 2015, the Group acquired Nifty Nosh Limited, which is the number two online takeaway company in Northern Ireland. 
The acquisition further strengthens the Group’s position and adds new restaurants to its existing business in Northern Ireland. 
On 16 July 2015, the Group acquired Restaurants on the Go Inc. which trades under the name Orderit.ca, a Canadian online takeaway 
provider which started business in 2001. The acquisition helps consolidate the Group’s position in Canada, and will help it grow in areas 
where Orderit.ca has a strong presence.
The goodwill arising on the acquisitions was principally attributable to the future growth of the acquired businesses, through expansion 
of their networks of restaurant partners and the number of orders per restaurant. In addition, the goodwill balances represented the 
value of the businesses’ active consumer bases and assembled workforces. 
Increase in shareholdings 
On 22 January 2015 the Group acquired the minority shareholdings in Eat.ch GmbH, the Group’s Swiss trading subsidiary. As a result, 
the Group’s stake increased from 64% to 100%. As Eat.ch GmbH was already consolidated as a subsidiary the acquisition had no impact 
on the Group’s revenues or Underlying EBITDA. The net cash outflow on the acquisition of the additional stake was £11.3 million. 
On 11 February 2015 the Group acquired a further 5% stake in IF-JE, the Group’s Brazilian associated undertaking, bringing its total stake 
to 30%. The consideration payable of £6.7 million was dependent upon the 2015 performance of IF-JE and is payable in instalments over 
the period to 31 October 2016. The cash outflow during the year ended 31 December 2015 was £3.4 million. Following the acquisition of 
the further stake, IF-JE continued to be accounted for as an associated undertaking. As IF-JE is loss making, the acquisition of a further 
stake initially had a small negative impact on the Group’s Underlying EBITDA. 
The £4.4 million net cash outflow on the acquisition of subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2014 was the cash outflow on the 
merger of the Group’s Brazilian business with iFood.

34. Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share based compensation plans. In accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments, 
the value of the awards are measured at fair value at the date of the grant. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the management’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. With the exception of certain 
awards under the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”), the fair value of the awards granted was calculated using the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 50% of the awards granted to certain 
individuals have total shareholder return performance criteria. The fair value of these awards was calculated using the Stochastic 
Simulation model.  
The total expense recorded in relation to the long-term employee incentives was £2.9 million (2014: £4.9 million). This charge comprised 
£2.6 million (2014: £4.4 million) in respect of share based payments and £0.3 million (2014: £0.5 million) in respect of employer’s social 
security costs on the exercise of options. As at 31 December 2015, the provision for social security costs on the exercise of options was 
£0.3 million (2014: £0.3 million). 
The Company operates the JUST EAT plc Enterprise Management Incentive Scheme (“EMI Scheme”), the JUST EAT plc Company Share 
Option Plan (“CSOP”), the JUST EAT Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”), the Sharesave Plan and the PSP for employees of the Group.  
During 2014, the share option plans were revised to take account of the bonus issue and consolidation of shares that were undertaken 
prior to the Company’s IPO (see note 26). 
EMI Scheme
Under the terms of the EMI Scheme, the Board granted options to certain employees of the Group to purchase shares in the Company. 
Options are no longer being granted under this scheme.
CSOP
Under the terms of the CSOP, the Board may grant options to purchase Ordinary shares in the Company. The CSOP is an equity-settled 
share option scheme approved by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) and was established in 2011. 
Under the CSOP, the Board may grant options over shares in the Company to eligible employees. The eligible employees to whom options 
are granted and the terms of such options are determined by the Board. All employees are eligible to participate in the CSOP, including 
employees of the Company’s subsidiaries, but not all grants are approved by HMRC. Options are not transferable.
The exercise price of options may not be less than the market value of the Company’s shares on the date of grant, in order for the scheme 
to qualify as an approved HMRC scheme.
Vested options in the CSOP scheme became exercisable on the Company’s IPO in April 2014.
EMI Scheme and CSOP
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the estimated fair value of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. Options vest in stages 
over a three-year period commencing on a specified date which is typically one year after the date of grant. Options are forfeited if an 
employee leaves the Group before the options vest and expire if they remain unexercised ten years after the date of grant. Details of 
the share options granted, under the EMI Scheme and CSOP, are as follows:

The weighted average exercise price of share options exercised during the year was 27.0 pence (2014: 5.1 pence). The options outstanding 
at 31 December 2015 had a weighted average exercise price of 33.8 pence (2014: 34.0 pence) and a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of 7.5 years (2014: 8.3 years). 
SIP
Under the terms of the SIP, the Board may award Ordinary shares in the Company at no cost to the employee. The SIP is an equity-settled 
share option scheme approved by HMRC and was established in 2014. The shares vest after three years from grant. Awards over 
472,465 Ordinary shares were granted on the date of the IPO. The fair value of the shares on the date of grant was £2.60. Since grant 
134,124 (2014: 81,270) awards have been forfeited. As at 31 December 2015 there were 338,341 (2014: 391,195) SIP awards outstanding, 
all of which vest on 8 April 2017.

Joint Share Ownership Plan (“JSOP”)
The JSOP is a share ownership scheme under which the employee and Appleby Trust (Jersey Trust) Limited, the EBT Trustee, hold  
a joint interest in Ordinary shares.  
Interests under the JSOP take the form of restricted interests in Ordinary shares in the Company. An interest permits a participant 
to benefit from the increase (if any) in the value of a number of Ordinary shares in the Company over specified threshold amounts. 
In order to acquire an interest, a participant must enter into a joint share ownership agreement with the EBT Trustee, under which the 
participant and the EBT Trustee jointly acquire the shares and agree that when the shares are sold the participant has a right to receive 
the proportion of the sale proceeds that exceed the threshold amount.
The vesting of interests granted to employees is subject to the option holder continuing to be employed by the Group. Interests vest in 
stages over a three-year period commencing on a specified date typically one year after the date of grant. The fair value of interests 
awarded under the JSOP was determined using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. Details of the JSOP interests are shown below:

PSP
During the year ended 31 December 2015, PSP awards were granted to certain employees to help motivate and incentivise them to 
deliver of sustained performance over the long term, and to promote alignment with the shareholders’ interests. Awards under the PSP 
were granted as nil-cost options which vest to the extent performance conditions are satisified, predominantly over a period of at least 
three years. The total number of awards granted were 1,227,754 of which 1,158,315 remained outstanding at 31 December 2015. The fair 
value of the awards at date of grant was £4.22 with an exercise price of £nil. 
The vesting of interests granted to employees is subject to the option holder continuing to be employed by the Group. The fair value of 
interests awarded under the PSP was determined using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model for the EPS conditions, and the Stochastic 
Simulation model for the TSR conditions.  
Sharesave Plan
During 2015, eligible employees were offered the option to buy shares in the Company after a period of three years funded from the 
proceeds of a savings contract to which they contribute on a monthly basis. Awards over 648,682 Ordinary shares were granted during 
October 2015. As at 31 December 2015 all awards were still outstanding. The fair value of the awards at date of grant was £1.63 with 
an exercise price of £3.26.
Assumptions
In determining the fair value of the awards granted under the CSOP, JSOP, SIP, PSP, and Sharesave the Black-Scholes Option Pricing 
Model was used with the following inputs:

35. Financial instruments
Financial instruments comprise financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments. 
As at 31 December, the Group’s financial assets comprised trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and as at 31 December 
2014 a derivative financial instrument. The classification of these financial assets is set out in the table below. Financial liabilities 
comprised trade and other payables, other long-term liabilities, borrowings and provisions for liabilities.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns. The capital structure of the 
Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising issued capital, reserves 
and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 26 to 29. In March 2015 the Group signed a £90 million revolving credit facility (RCF) which 
remains undrawn and has an interest rate range of 1.2% to 1.8% above LIBOR. The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital 
requirements.
Financial risk management objectives
The main financial risks faced by the Group are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, which include interest rate risk and currency 
risk. The Board regularly reviews these risks and will enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures. The use of 
financial derviaties is governed by the Group’s treasury policy approved by the Board, which provides written principles on foreign 
exchange risk and the use of financial derivatives and non-financial derivative financial instruments.

amount of all financial instruments equals their fair value.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies and consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is primarily exposed to the Euro, Australian Dollar, Danish Krone and Canadian Dollar.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% depreciation and 10% appreciation in Pound Sterling against the relevant 
foreign currencies. 10% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and 
represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only 
outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign 
currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group.

The Group’s sensitivity to fluctuations in foreign currencies is the result of increased activity in the foreign owned subsidiaries which 
has led to a significant increase in foreign currency denominated trade payables, trade receivables and intercompany borrowings. 
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date. For assets 
and floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of asset/liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was 
outstanding for the whole year. A 10% increase or decrease in the interest rate is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to 
key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. 
If interest rates had been 10% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:
 — profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2015 would increase by £49,000 (2014: £41,000); and 
 — there would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. 
The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its major counterparties are continuously monitored.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of consumers, spread across geographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed 
on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which are stated net of impairment losses, represents 
the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international 
credit rating agencies.
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk 
management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management 
requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and 
actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. In March 2015, the Group signed a £90 million 
revolving credit facility for a five-year period. The facility is unsecured and contains common financial covenants for the Company and 
its subsidiaries that the ratio of total net debt to Underlying EBITDA must not exceed 3.0, interest cover ratio of Underlying EBITDA to 
net finance charges must not be less than 4.0, and any new earn out deferred consideration must not exceed one times the Underlying 
EBITDA. The financial covenants are tested each month based on the consolidated financial position of the Group and have been 
complied with at all measurement points. No amounts had been drawn during the year.

Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. 
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group 
can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the 
undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date. The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date 
on which the Group may be required to pay.

Derivative financial instruments
Menulog Group Limited acquisition 
In connection with the acquisition of 100% share capital in the Australian based Menulog Group Limited, the Group entered into 
derivative financial instruments to help mitigate the foreign exchange risk of the agreed AUD 855 million purchase price. The derivatives 
were a foreign exchange option and a foreign exchange forward contract.
Hedge accounting was not adopted for the foreign exchange option. The net loss of £3.9 million was charged to ‘other gains and losses’ 
in the income statement. 
The foreign currency forward contract was held as a cash flow hedge and resulted in a loss of £6.2 million being basis adjusted to the 
consideration paid for Menulog Group Limited (the non-financial hedged item).
SinDelantal Internet S.L. acquisition
At the time the Group acquired SinDelantal Internet S.L., in 2012, it granted a loan to the selling shareholders in order that they could 
provide working capital to their Mexican business. Part of the loan was convertible into a minority shareholding in the holding company 
(El Cocinero A Cuerda SL) of the Mexican business. The embedded option was recognised on the 31 December 2014 Consolidated Balance 
Sheet at a fair value of £0.4 million. The fair value was based on an offer made for the business around the time of the Group’s year end. 
This unobservable market information ranks as level 3 data in the fair value hierarchy (see note 39d). During 2015, a fair value gain of 
£0.2 million was recognised within ‘other gains and losses’ in the Consolidated Income Statement, prior to the conversion of the loan into 
shares of El Cocinero A Cuerda SL on its acquisition of the Group in February 2015.

36. Related party transactions
The following transaction was entered into with a related party for the relevant financial year:
IF-JE
In addition to the acquisition of a further 5% in IF-JE (see note 31), during the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group provided IF-JE 
with working capital funding of £2.5 million (2014: nil). The Group received additional shares as consideration for the funding. The 
Group’s principal joint venture partner (Movile) also participated in the funding. As the Group’s minority joint venture partners didn’t 
participate in the funding the Group’s holding in IF-JE marginally increased to 30.2%.
No amounts were owed by and to related parties (other than key management personnel) at the balance sheet date.

Directors’ interests in Ordinary Shares of the Company are disclosed in the Report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 48 to 65.
On 24 March 2014, prior to the IPO, the Company called all the unpaid subscription amounts, totalling £13.2 million, in respect of certain 
shares issued under the JSOP. In order to facilitate this, the Company made loans to participants of the JSOP and Appleby Trust (Jersey 
Trust) Limited totalling £5.3 million and £7.9 million, respectively. The loans provided to the participants of the JSOP included loans to 
key management personnel totalling £4.9 million. As at 31 December 2015, the amount due from key management personnel in respect 
of these loans was £3.0 million (2014: £4.8 million). 
The weighted average subscription price of the JSOP awards was 28 pence. Should the Company’s share price fall below the subscription 
price, on exercise by the employee or on the Company calling the loans, the Company has guaranteed to fund the shortfall.

Audit exemption statement
For the year ended 31 December 2015, Orogo Limited, Nifty Nosh 
Limited, JUST EAT Central Holdings Limited and Just Eat 
(Acquisitions) Holding Limited were entitled to exemption from 
audit under section 479 of the Companies Act 2006 relating to 
subsidiary companies. The members of these companies have 
not required them to obtain an audit of their financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
38. Events after the balance sheet date
The Group has agreed the acquisition of four businesses from 
Rocket Internet and the foodpanda group for a total consideration 
of €125.0 million (£94.7 million) to be funded from existing cash 
resources. The businesses acquired are online takeaway food 
businesses trading in Spain (La Nevera Roja), Italy (PizzaBo/
hellofood Italy), Brazil (hellofood Brazil) and Mexico (hellofood 
Mexico). Of the acquisitions, all completed on 5 February 2016 with 
the exception of the Spanish business which is subject to regulatory 
approval from the local competition authority, the Comisión 
Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia, and it is anticipated 
that it should complete by 30 June 2016. The operational control 
of hellofood Brazil has passed to IF-JE, and the business is expected 
to be sold on to the associated undertaking in due course.
The acquisition is expected to generate significant benefits to 
the markets concerned, offering an enlarged customer base for 
takeaway restaurants and greater choice for consumers. There 
are also economic benefits of scale that lead, in time, to synergies 
and higher sustainable margins. 
It is expected the acquisitions, net of one-off exceptional 
transaction and integration costs, will be accretive to adjusted 
EPS for 2016.
39. Summary of significant accounting policies 
a)  Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company incorporate 
the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by 
the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. 
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only 
if the Group has i) power over an investee; ii) exposure, or rights, 
to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
iii) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the 
amount of the investor’s returns. 
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar 
rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, 
including i) the contractual arrangement with the other vote 
holders of the investee; ii) rights arising from other contractual 
arrangements; and iii) the Group’s voting rights and potential 
voting rights.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if 
facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or 
more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary 
begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and 
ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the date the Group gains control until the date the 
Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements 
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately 
from the Group’s equity therein. The interests of non-controlling 
shareholders may be initially measured at fair value or at the 
non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value 
of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement 
is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is 
the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the 
non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. 
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling 
interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests 
having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result 
in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. 
The carrying amount of the Group’s interests and the non-
controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their 
relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the 
amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and 
the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised 
directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it de-recognises 
the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests and the 
cumulative translation differences recorded in equity. It further 
recognises the fair values of the consideration received and any 
investment retained, with any surplus or deficit being recognised 
in profit or loss. 
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in 
relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit 
or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings) in the same 
manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities 
are disposed of. The fair value of any investment retained in the 
former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the 
fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under 
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when 
applicable, the costs on initial recognition of an investment in an 
associate or jointly controlled entity.

b)  Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method, in accordance with IFRS 3 (2008) Business Combinations 
(“IFRS 3”). The consideration for each acquisition is measured at 
the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets 
given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
For each business combination, the Group elects whether to 
measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair 
value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss 
as incurred and included within exceptional items.
When the consideration for the acquisition includes an asset or 
liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, 
the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date 
fair value and is included as part of the consideration transferred 
in the business combination. Changes in the fair value of the 
contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period 
adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding 
adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments 
are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained 
during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year 
from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that 
existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the 
contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement 
period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration 
is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity 
is not re-measured at subsequent reporting dates and its 
subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent 
consideration that is classified as an asset or liability is re-measured 
at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39 or IAS 37 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as 
appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised 
in profit or loss. 
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s 
previously-held interests in the acquired entity are re-measured 
to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains 
control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit 
or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to 
the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such 
treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised 
at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for certain items 
which are measured in accordance with the relevant IFRSs. If the 
initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the 
end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the 
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities 
are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, 
would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset 
at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is 
measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, 
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the 
fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) 
in the entity over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the 
identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at 
least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill 
is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. CGUs 
to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the 
unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is 
less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss 
is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit 
pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in 
the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not 
reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill 
is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
The Group’s policy for goodwill arising on the acquisition of an 
associate is described below.
c)  Investments in associates and joint venture
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not 
control or joint control over those policies.
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties 
that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net 
assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed 
sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when 
decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent 
of the parties sharing control.
The considerations made in determining significant influence or 
joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control 
over subsidiaries.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates and jointly controlled 
entities are incorporated in these financial statements using the 
equity method of accounting, except for when the investment 
is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in 
accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations. 
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint 
venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the 
investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share 
of net assets of the associate or joint venture since the acquisition 
date. Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included 
in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised 
nor individually tested for impairment.
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs103-110.indd   103 09/03/2016   12:49 104
39. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
The consolidated income statement reflects the Group’s share 
of the results of operations of the associate or joint venture. 
Any change in other comprehensive income of those investees 
is presented as part of the Group’s other comprehensive income. 
In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in 
the equity of the associate or joint venture, the Group recognises 
its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of 
changes in equity. 
Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group 
and the associate or joint venture are eliminated to the extent of 
the interest in the associate or joint venture. 
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group 
measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value 
in accordance with IAS 39. Any difference between the carrying 
amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant 
influence or joint control and the fair value of the retained 
investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or 
loss. In addition, the Group accounts for all amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that 
associate on the same basis as would be required if that associate 
had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
The aggregate amounts of current and long-term assets and 
liabilities, income and expenses are disclosed in notes 17 and 18. 
Where applicable, the aggregate amount of capital commitments 
and contingent liabilities are also disclosed.
d)  Fair value measurement
The Group measures certain financial instruments at fair value 
at each balance sheet date. 
The Directors consider the carrying amounts of financial assets 
and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial 
statements approximate their fair values. The fair values of 
financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed 
in note 35.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or 
disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair 
value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
Level 1  Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable; and
Level 3  Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input 
that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value in the 
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy 
by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that 
is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end 
of each reporting period.
The Group presents the valuation results to the Audit Committee 
and the Group’s independent auditors. This includes a discussion 
of the major assumptions used in the valuations.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined 
classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, 
characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of 
the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
e)  Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of each Group company are 
presented in the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of 
the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial 
position of each Group company are expressed in Pound Sterling, 
which is the functional currency of the Company, and the 
presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, 
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing at that date. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the 
date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period 
in which they arise, except for exchange differences on monetary 
items receivable or payable to a foreign operation which settlement 
is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future 
(therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign 
operation) which are recognised initially in other comprehensive 
income and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net 
investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, 
the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations 
are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates 
at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising 
are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in equity (attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate). 
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s 
entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss 
of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, loss 
of joint control over a jointly controlled entity that includes a 
foreign operation, or loss of significant influence over an associate 
that includes a foreign operation), all of the accumulated exchange 
differences in respect of that operation attributable to the Group 
are reclassified to profit or loss.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of 
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences 
arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.

f)  Revenue recognition
Revenues are derived from commission, payment card and 
administration fees, connection fees, top-placement fees, and 
other revenues. Revenues are measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable and represents amounts 
receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course 
of business, net of discounts, V AT and other sales-related taxes.
Commission
Commission revenues earned from restaurants, are earned and 
recognised at the point of order fulfilment to the restaurant’s 
consumers. 
Payment card and administration fees 
Revenues from payment card and administration fees are 
recognised when the service is completed, in line with the 
revenues recognised on commissions. This is the point at which 
an order is successfully processed and the Group has no remaining 
transactional obligations.
Connection fees
Our restaurant partners pay a one-off fee to join the JUST EAT 
network, which is comprised of a JCT equipment fee and a JCT 
connection fee. JCT’s are order confirmation terminals situated 
at restaurant sites for the purposes of communicating between 
end user consumers and restaurants via the central JUST EAT 
ordering infrastructure. 
JCT equipment fees are deferred to the balance sheet and 
recognised on a straight-line basis over 36 months. This is 
considered to be an appropriate time period as the fair value 
of the consideration received or receivable for the JCT. The JCT 
connection fee revenues are payable on connection but deferred 
and recognised on a straight-line basis over 12 months. 
In addition, our Danish and French based restaurant partners 
pay an annual subscription fee. Revenues in respect of subscription 
fees is recognised on a straight-line basis over the annual 
subscription period.
Top-placement fees
Revenues from top-placement fees are recognised over the 
period in which the service is rendered.
Other revenues
Other revenues principally relates to the sale of branded 
merchandise to our restaurant partners. Merchandise revenues 
are recognised when the goods are delivered and the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the restaurant. 
g)  Operating profit or loss
Operating profit or loss is stated after charging for long-term 
employee incentive provisions, exceptional items and foreign 
exchange gains and losses, but before other gains and losses, 
finance income and finance costs.
h)  Exceptional items
Exceptional items are costs or credits that, by virtue of their nature 
and incidence, have been disclosed separately in order to improve 
a reader’s understanding of the financial statements. 
i)  Other gains and losses
Other gains and losses are comprised of profits or losses arising on 
the disposal or deemed disposal of operations, gains and losses on 
financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss, gains 
and losses on derivative financial instrument, and movements on 
provisions for forward contracts to acquire minority interests. 
They have been disclosed separately in order to improve a reader’s 
understanding of the financial statements and are not disclosed 
within operating profit as they are non trading in nature. 
j)  Leasing
The Group as lessee
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the 
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
The Group did not have any finance leases in either 2015 or 2014.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit or loss 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except 
where another more systematic basis is more representative of the 
time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are 
consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are 
recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into 
operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. 
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction 
of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in 
which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
k)  Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes 
are charged as an expense as they fall due. 
l)  T axation
The income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax. 
Income tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other 
comprehensive income, in which case the income tax is recognised 
in other comprehensive income.
Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for 
the year, using tax rates prevailing in each respective jurisdiction 
and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability 
method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of 
deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of 
realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
temporary differences reverse, based on rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences arising 
from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit. 
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs103-110.indd   105 06/03/2016   20:22 106
39. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to 
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all temporary 
differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are 
reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that the related deferred tax benefit 
will be realised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
m) Intangible assets other than goodwill
The Group has four classes of intangible asset: patents, licences 
and intellectual property (“IP”), restaurant contracts, brands and 
development costs. 
Patents, licences and IP
Patents, licences and IP are included at cost and amortised in 
equal annual instalments over their useful economic life, which 
is typically three to five years depending on the period over which 
benefits are expected to be realised from the asset. Provision is 
made for any impairment.
Restaurant contracts
A restaurant contract intangible asset is recorded as part of a 
business combination; or when an associate is acquired; or when 
a joint venture established. They are initially recorded at fair value 
and amortised over the useful economic life of the asset on a 
straight-line basis. This period of time is the period over which 
the acquired restaurant contracts are reasonably expected to confer 
economic benefits to the Group, which is usually between three 
and ten years. The fair values of restaurant contracts are 
determined with reference to the present value of their after tax 
cash flows projected over their remaining useful lives. The cash 
flows and discount rates used in the valuations are risk-adjusted 
to the extent deemed necessary by management to accurately 
reflect local risks and uncertainties associated with the asset. 
Brands
A brand intangible asset is recorded as part of a business 
combination; when an associate is acquired; or when a joint 
venture is established. They are initially recorded at fair value 
and amortised over the useful economic life of the asset on a 
straight-line basis, which is usually between three and ten years. 
This period of time is the period over which the acquired brand 
is reasonably expected to confer economic benefits to the Group. 
The fair values of brand assets are established using the relief from 
royalty valuation method. The cash flows and discount rates used 
in the relief from royalty model are risk adjusted to the extent 
deemed necessary by management to accurately reflect local 
risks and uncertainties associated with the asset.  
Development costs
Where an application or product is technically feasible, 
production and sale are intended, a market exists, expenditure 
can be measured reliably, and sufficient resources are available 
to complete the project, development costs are capitalised and 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life 
of the respective product. 
Where these conditions are not met the amounts are classified 
as research and are expensed as incurred. 
n)  Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is 
provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated 
to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset 
on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows:
Fixtures and fittings 33% per annum  
Equipment 33% per annum  
Leasehold improvements  20% per annum or the period  
of the lease if shorter
o)  Impairment of assets excluding goodwill
Under IFRS, the Group is required to review for impairment when 
indicators of impairment exist. On these occasions, the Group 
reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an 
impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
(“CGU”) to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an 
indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and 
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the 
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be 
less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the revised estimate 
of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset (or CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss 
is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
p)  Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale 
are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2015
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs103-110.indd   106 06/03/2016   20:22 Financial Statements
107
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for 
sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition 
is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the 
asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its 
present condition. Management must be committed to the sale 
which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed 
sale within one year from the date of classification.
When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of 
control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that 
subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described 
above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a 
non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.
q) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost comprises direct materials. Cost is calculated using the first-in 
first-out method. Net realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
r) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the 
Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and de-recognised on a trade 
date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a 
contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within 
the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are 
initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for 
those financial assets classified at fair value through profit or loss, 
which are initially measured at fair value. 
Financial assets are classified into the following specified 
categories: financial assets ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ 
(“FVTPL ”), ‘held-to-maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ 
(“AFS”) financial assets and ‘loans and receivables’ . The 
classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial 
assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. 
The Group historically has held AFS financial assets, ‘loans 
and receivables’ and FVTPL financial assets.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active 
market but that are classified as AFS financial assets are stated at 
fair value (because the Directors considered that fair value could 
be reliably measured). Gains and losses arising from changes in 
fair value were recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the AFS reserve with the exception of impairment 
losses, interest calculated using the effective interest method and 
foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, which are 
recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is 
disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognised in the AFS reserve is reclassified to 
profit or loss. As at 31 December 2015 and 2014, the Group did 
not have any investments in unlisted shares which were classified 
as AFS financial assets.
The fair value of AFS monetary assets denominated in a foreign 
currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at 
the spot rate at the balance sheet date. The foreign exchange gains 
and losses that are recognised in profit or loss are determined 
based on the amortised cost of the monetary asset. Other foreign 
exchange gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive 
income. 
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
are classified as ‘loans and receivables’ . Loans and receivables are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying 
the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when 
the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Financial assets at FVTPL
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains 
or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. 
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any 
dividend or interest earned on the financial asset and is included 
in the ‘other gains and losses’ line item in the income statement. 
Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 39d.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at FVTPL, are assessed 
for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial 
assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as 
a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows 
of the investment have been affected. Evidence of impairment 
may include indications that a receivable or a group of receivables 
is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or 
delinquency in payment, the probability that they will enter 
bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and where 
observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease 
in the estimated future cash flows.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the 
impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted 
at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
When an AFS financial asset is considered to be impaired, 
cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in 
the period.
De-recognition of financial assets
The Group de-recognises a financial asset only when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when 
it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group 
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the 
Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an 
associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of 
a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the 
financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for 
the proceeds received.
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs103-110.indd   107 06/03/2016   20:22 108
39. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
On de-recognition of a financial asset, the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received 
and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities 
‘at FVTPL ’ or ‘other financial liabilities’ . The Group currently does 
not hold any financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL ’ .
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially 
measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on 
an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments 
through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where 
appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on 
initial recognition.
De-recognition of financial liabilities
The Group de-recognises financial liabilities when, and only when, 
the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host 
contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts 
and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had one contract with an 
embedded derivative (see note 35). At 31 December 2015 it 
had none.
s) Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include 
derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in respect 
of foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges or cash flow 
hedges. Hedges of foreign currency exchange risk in form 
commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents 
the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged 
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy 
for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the 
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group 
documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective 
in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged 
item attributable to the hedged risk.
Note 35 sets out details of the derivative instruments used for 
hedging purposes.
Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated 
and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss 
immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the 
hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. 
The change in fair value of the hedged instrument and the change 
in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised 
in profit or loss in the line item relating to the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the 
hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying 
amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is 
amortised to profit or loss from that date.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised 
in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the 
heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to 
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, 
and is included in ‘other gains and losses’ . 
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the 
periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same 
line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged 
forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial 
asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial 
measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-
financial liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the 
hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or 
is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies 
for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated equity at that time 
remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction 
is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss 
accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
t) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the 
consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties 
surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using 
the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation, its carrying 
amount is the present value of those cash flows. The unwinding 
of any discount is recognised in the income statement within 
finance expense. 
u) Share based payments
Equity-settled share based payments to employees and others 
providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the 
equity instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the 
effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding 
the determination of the fair values of equity-settled share based 
transactions are set out in note 34.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2015
156122_JUST EAT-TEXT-pgs103-110.indd   108 06/03/2016   20:22 Financial Statements
109
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity 
instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, 
the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based 
vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original 
estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the 
cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a 
corresponding adjustment to the share based payment reserve.
For cash-settled share based payments a liability is recognised for 
the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value 
of the liability. At each balance sheet date until the liability is 
settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability 
is re-measured, with any changes in the fair value recognised in 
profit or loss for the year.
v) Dividends
Dividends are recognised on the Company’s Ordinary shares 
when they have been appropriately authorised. 
40. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which 
are described in note 39, the Directors are required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from 
other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based 
on historical experience and other factors that are considered to 
be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects 
only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods 
if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Critical judgements, apart from those involving estimates which 
are dealt with separately below, are those which management 
have made in applying the Group’s accounting policies and have 
the most significant effect on the financial statements, and are 
discussed below. 
a) Revenue recognition
Revenues derived from connection fees includes JCT connection 
fees and JCT equipment fees.  
JCT equipment fee revenue is deferred to the balance sheet 
and recognised on a straight-line basis over 36 months. This is 
considered to be an appropriate time period as the fair value of 
the consideration received or receivable for the JCT. Judgement 
is applied in determining the period over which the JCT equipment 
fee revenues are recognised.
The JCT connection fee revenues are payable on connection but 
deferred and recognised on a straight-line basis over 12 months. 
12 months is considered to be the required period of service. 
Judgement is applied in determining the period over which the 
connection fee is earned. 
b) Share based payments
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with 
employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments 
at the date at which they are granted. Estimating fair value for 
share based payment transactions requires determination of the 
most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the 
terms and conditions of the grant. Judgements are applied in 
relation to estimations of the number of options that will vest and 
of the fair value of the options granted to employees. Estimates of 
fair value are made using a widely recognised share option value 
model and are referred to third party experts where necessary. 
Judgement is applied in determining the assumptions input into 
the share option value model. See note 34 for details of the key 
assumptions used.
c) Deferred taxation
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is 
more likely than not that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will 
be available in the future against which the reversal of temporary 
differences can be deducted. To determine the future taxable 
profits, reference is made to the latest available profit forecasts. 
Where the temporary differences are related to losses, relevant 
tax law is considered to determine the availability of the losses to 
offset against the future taxable profits. Recognition of deferred 
tax assets therefore involves judgement regarding the future 
financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group 
in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised. Details of 
the recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are included 
in note 19.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Discussed below are the key assumptions regarding the future, 
and other key sources of estimated uncertainty at the balance 
sheet date which may have a significant risk of causing material 
adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year. 
d) Acquired intangible assets
An intangible resource acquired with a subsidiary undertaking is 
recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired 
business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected 
to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be 
measured reliably. The identification of intangible assets acquired 
as part of business combinations requires judgement. For each 
business combination the balance of goodwill to other intangible 
assets is reviewed for appropriateness.
Acquired intangible assets, comprising brands, restaurant 
contracts, and intellectual property are amortised through 
the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over 
their estimated economic lives of between three and ten years. 
Significant judgement is required in determining the fair value 
and economic lives of acquired intangible assets. External 
valuations are obtained for significant acquisitions.

40. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
e) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
The Group’s balance sheet includes significant goodwill and other intangible assets. Impairment exists when the carrying value of an 
asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use. Determining 
whether an asset is impaired requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the CGU to which the asset has been allocated. The value-in-
use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next three years and do not 
include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to, or significant future investments that will enhance the asset’s 
performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used as well as the expected future cash 
inflows and the growth rate used for the period beyond the three budgets. 
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different CGUs, including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed 
and further explained in note 14.
f) Fair value measurement and valuation process
Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value, particularly intangible assets acquired through acquisition. 
In estimating fair value, the Group uses market observable data where available. Where market observable data is not available, 
recognised valuation methodologies are used. Third party valuers are used depending on the size and complexity of the acquisition.
g) Taxation
The Group’s tax charge is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges arising in each jurisdiction. The calculation of the Group’s 
total tax charge involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters where the tax impact is uncertain until a conclusion is 
reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process. Resolving tax issues can in some cases take several years as it is not 
always within the control of the Group and often depends on the efficiency of legal processes in the relevant tax jurisdiction. Provisions, 
when recognised, are based on management’s interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement. However the 
final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material profits, losses and/or cash flows, which could differ from the provision 
and in such event the Group would be required to make an adjustment in a subsequent period.

41. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and 
International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee interpretations as endorsed by the European Union, and with those parts 
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation 
and IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. These are the Company’s first financial statements prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs and IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards has been applied.
An explanation of how the transition to IFRSs has affected the reported Balance Sheet of the Group is provided in note 47. As the 
Company previously applied the FRS 1 exemption from presenting a Cash Flow Statement under UK GAAP no reconciliation from 
UK GAAP to IFRS has been provided.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments which have been 
measured at fair value. In accordance with the exemption allowed under section 408 (3) of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has 
not presented its own income statement and statement of comprehensive income. The Company has applied the same accounting policies 
as the Group as defined in note 39. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented.

45. Related party transactions continued
On 24 March 2014, prior to the IPO, the Company called all the unpaid subscription amounts, totalling £13.2 million, in respect of certain 
shares issued under the JSOP. In order to facilitate this, the Company made loans to participants of the JSOP and Appleby Trust (Jersey 
Trust) Limited totalling £5.3 million and £7.9 million, respectively. The loans provided to the participants of the JSOP included loans to 
key management personnel totalling £3.0 million. As at 31 December 2015, the amount due from key management personnel in respect 
of these loans was £2.3 million (2014: £3.0 million). 
The weighted average subscription price of the JSOP awards was 28 pence. Should the Company’s share price fall below the subscription 
price, on exercise by the employee or on the Company calling the loans, the Company has guaranteed to fund the shortfall.

As stated in note 41, these are the Company’s first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The accounting policies set out in note 39 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, 
the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 and in the preparation of an 
opening IFRS statement of financial position at 1 January 2014 (the Company’s date of transition).
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the Company has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared 
in accordance with UK GAAP (previous GAAP). An explanation of how the transition from previous GAAP to IFRSs has affected the 
Company’s balance sheet is set out in the following tables and the notes that accompany the tables. As the Company previously 
applied the FRS 1 exemption from presenting a Cash Flow Statement under UK GAAP no reconciliation from UK GAAP to IFRS has 
been provided.
In preparing the opening and subsequent IFRS Balance Sheets, Income Statements, and Statement of Cash Flows, no conversion 
adjustments were required from UK GAAP (previous GAAP).

Directors’ Report
The Directors have pleasure in presenting their Annual 
Report and audited financial statements of the Company 
and the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The Directors’ Report contains certain statutory, regulatory 
and other information and incorporates, by reference, the 
Strategic Report and the Governance Report included earlier 
in this document.
Strategic Report
A fair review of the Group’s performance during the period 
and of its position at the period end, including commentary 
on its likely future development and prospects, is set out 
in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 33, while information 
on principal risks and uncertainties and key performance 
indicators is given on pages 28 to 29 and pages 18 to 
19, respectively. All this information should be read in 
conjunction with this Report. The Corporate Governance 
Report, including the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
on pages 34 to 65, summarises the Company’s governance 
and Directors’ remuneration arrangements. The Corporate 
Social Responsibility report on pages 30 to 33 summarises 
the Group’s approach to diversity, health and safety, 
environmental matters and community matters. All these 
sections form part of this Directors’ Report, into which 
they are incorporated by reference.
Results and dividends
The audited financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company for the period under review are set out on pages 
66 to 110 and pages 111 to 115, respectively. The Company 
intends to retain its earnings to expand the growth and 
development of its business and, therefore, does not anticipate 
paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Details of 
dividends paid during the year before the Company’s IPO 
are set out in note 13 to the financial statements.
2016 Annual General Meeting (“ AGM”)
An explanation of the resolutions to be proposed at the 
AGM, and the recommendation of Directors in relation 
to these, is included in the circular to shareholders 
accompanying this Annual Report. Resolutions regarding 
the authority to issue shares are commented upon later 
in this Report under share capital.
The Company’s AGM will be held at the Lincoln Centre, 
18 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London, WC2A 3ED at 9.30am on 
27 April 2016.
Research and development
We continue to dedicate resources to the development 
of new technologies, in order to improve the consumer 
experience and enhance our offering to our restaurant 
partners. Expenses incurred are capitalised when it is 
probable that future economic benefits will be attributable 
to the asset and that these costs can be measured reliably. 
Change of control
In the event of a takeover, a scheme of arrangement 
(other than a scheme of arrangement for the purposes of 
creating a new holding company) or certain other events, 
unvested Executive Director and employee share awards 
may in certain circumstances become exercisable. Such 
circumstances may, although do not necessarily, depend on 
the achievement of performance conditions or the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee. The Company does not 
have any agreements with any Director or officer of the 
Company that would provide compensation for loss of office 
or employment resulting from a takeover.
The Group has facility agreements in place with its bank 
lenders which contain provisions giving those lenders 
certain rights on a change of control of the Company.
Save as otherwise disclosed above, there are no other 
significant agreements to which the Company is a party 
that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
following a takeover bid.
Financial instruments
Our risk management policies relating to credit risk, market 
risk, capital risk and liquidity risk are detailed within note 35 
of the notes to the financial statements on pages 97 to 99. 
In addition, the overall risk framework and strategy for the 
Group is included within the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 33.
Employment of disabled persons
Our policy in respect of the employment of disabled persons 
is set out in the Corporate Social Responsibility report on 
page 32.
Employee consultation
Details of employee consultation are set out in the 
Corporate Social Responsibility report on pages 30 to 33.

Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. UK company law requires 
the Directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union. 
Under UK company law the Directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period. In preparing these financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 — make judgements and accounting estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
 — state whether applicable IFRSs, as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
 — prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed 
on pages 36 to 37, confirm that, to the best of each person’s 
knowledge and belief:
 — the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s and the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy;
 — the Company and Group financial statements, 
which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, 
as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group and Parent Company; and
 — the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report include a 
fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and Group, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
Disclosure of information to the auditor
Each of the Directors of the Company at the time when 
this Report was approved confirms that:
 — so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditor 
is unaware; and
 — he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought 
to have taken as a Director in order to make himself 
or herself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware 
of that information.
This confirmation is given in accordance with section 418(2) 
of the Act.
Auditor
Deloitte LLP, the Group’s auditor, has indicated their 
willingness to continue in office and, on the recommendation 
of the Audit Committee and in accordance with Section 489 
of the Act, a resolution to re-appoint them will be put to 
the 2016 AGM.

Introduction Drax Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2014

In perspective
Back in 2012, we declared our intention 
to convert three of our six generating 
units to burn sustainable biomass 
in place of coal by the end of 2016. 
The transformation work is now well 
advanced with two units converted and 
the third scheduled to be converted in 
the time frame indicated above. 
Our transformation extends beyond the 
conversion works at Drax Power Station, 
both upstream and downstream. 
The benefit of a presence in the 
upstream supply market is significant, 
in the southern US our two wood pellet 
plants are in commissioning and our port 
facility is “pellet -ready” . 
Downstream the continued attraction of 
renewable power amongst businesses 
keen to meet their own sustainability 
commitments has seen our retail sales 
increase. Our commitment to becoming 
a leading provider of sustainable power is 
as strong as it has always been.
We offer a source of power which is 
sustainable, secure and reliable, cost -
effective and low carbon. We continue 
to see future value for our business and 
our shareholders in our biomass strategy , 
and we are on track to deliver that.
We also take very seriously our 
responsibility to the communities where 
our operations are based. This is well 
illustrated by our visitor programme at 
Drax Power Station where we hosted 
more than 12,500 visitors in 2014.
Earnings and dividend
Our earnings (EBITDA
(1)
) for 2014 
at £229 million were broadly level 
with those in 2013 (£230 million). 
In accordance with our dividend policy , 
the Board proposes a final dividend in 
respect of 2014 of 7 .2 pence per share, 
equivalent to £29 million. This would give 
total dividends for the year of £ 48 million 
(2013: £71 million).
Board changes
As announced in September 2014, 
I shall be retiring from the Board at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting 
this coming April. I have served on the 
Board for some nine years and I have 
been privileged to be its Chairman 
for the last seven. During that time 
Drax has seen tremendous change, 
from a business with purely electricity 
generation interests to a growing Group 
with interests along the electricity and 
biomass supply chain.
It has been an exciting journey for 
everyone involved and I have every 
confidence that the Group has a 
successful future ahead of it. I am 
delighted in the choice of my successor , 
Phil Cox CBE. Phil has significant 
experience of the power sector and 
is no stranger to the boardroom. 
We have an effective Board with good 
and complementary skills, knowledge 
and experience across all directors, both 
executive and non-executive, and Phil is 
well placed to lead them. I wish him and 
the Group every success. 
Our people
As always my final say is about the 
people at Drax. I have enjoyed getting 
to know many during the last nine years 
and I have valued the time I have spent 
with them. What is common throughout 
the Group is the unfaltering support and 
commitment of everyone. My sincere 
thanks and very best wishes go to all 
staff across the Group.

Chairman’s introduction
The last year serves as a stark reminder of factors 
in the external environment which cause uncertainty 
for our business. During the year , regulatory uncertainty 
and much weaker commodity markets have proved 
challenging. It is, however , our job to navigate through 
such uncertainties and to that end I am able to report 
good operational performance and solid progress with 
our biomass transformation during 201 4. Drax Group plc

Maximising our value
Our business model
Our objective is to maximise the value of the 
Drax business. There are several steps in the Drax  
value chain, with each one providing incremental  
value to the business.
Our value chain…
Source
How we maximise value…
Fuel
 , Currently we burn sustainable biomass in two converted 
units, which earn ROCs and LECs.
 , In our coal units we have the ability to burn other 
fuels, such as petcoke and pond fines, which can be 
economically advantageous. 
 , By diversifying our fuel sources not only are we less reliant 
on a single fuel type, but we are also able to capture 
value from commodity market cycles, and in the case 
of biomass avoid the cost of carbon.
 , Our investments in the US will help secure the timely 
delivery of reliable wood pellet supplies to Drax 
Power Station, and consolidate third party and own 
supplies to secure more efficient and cost -effective 
delivery logistics.

Marketplace, performance and risk Sustainable business review Governance Financials Overview
Review of the year
Our main priority in 2014 was the delivery 
of our biomass transformation project. 
For the business and our shareholders, 
2014 proved to be a very difficult year 
as various regulatory risks materialised 
and we faced a major deterioration 
in commodity market conditions. 
Despite these challenges I am able 
to report very good progress in our 
transformation into a predominantly 
renewable electricity provider . We are on 
track to deliver according to the plan we 
initially laid out in 2012.
Our vision for Drax is to be a bold, 
customer oriented power generation 
and retail business, driven by biomass 
innovation. In moving towards achieving 
our vision, we made good progress 
during 2014 on our biomass supply 
chain construction projects in the 
US, our biomass conversion project at 
Drax Power Station, and our growth in 
electricity sales to businesses. 
Earnings
Our earnings for 2014 reflect our 
progress in delivering reliable biomass-
fired generation as the earning potential 
of our coal-fired generation fell following 
the near doubling of the UK carbon tax. 
At £229 million, EBITDA is roughly level 
with last year (2013: £230 million). 
Securing sustainable 
biomass supplies
Sustainability is critical to our biomass 
strategy . All our biomass, whether in 
raw fibre or pellet form, is procured 
against our own robust sustainability 
criteria. These include requirements 
for high greenhouse gas emission 
reduction, habitats and biodiversity 
protection, as well as due consideration 
to the important socio-economic factors 
in the source areas. A programme 
of independent audits verifies that 
all our suppliers comply with our 
sustainability criteria. 
The dynamics of the forest industry 
are sometimes misunderstood. 
Demand for wood helps keep land in 
forest and incentivises investments 
in new and more productive forests, 
all of which have significant carbon 
benefits. Our calculations show that 
the range of sustainable biomass 
materials we have burnt over the 
last few years has a low carbon 
footprint. In 2014, the average 
greenhouse gas emissions from 
burning biomass were 34gCO
2 /MJ; 
significantly below 79gCO 2 /MJ which 
is the maximum to be permitted under 
the UK government’s framework for 
sustainability requirements for biomass 
that are expected to become mandatory 
later this year .
Our developments in the US are 
an important part of our biomass 
sourcing strategy . They help us to 
optimise the biomass supply chain 
which is still in its infancy , particularly 
in the southeast US which is the main 
source of our biomass. The main drivers 
for our upstream investments are 
twofold: securing the timely delivery 
of reliable wood pellet supplies to Drax 
Power Station and consolidating third 
party and own supplies to secure 
more efficient and cost -effective 
delivery logistics.
Our two, 4 50 thousand tonnes per 
annum wood pellet plants – Amite 
(Mississippi) and Morehouse (Louisiana ) 
– have now entered into commissioning. 
Our port facility at Baton Rouge 
(Louisiana ) is now ready to receive 
and despatch wood pellets to the 
UK. We continue to evaluate further 
upstream development opportunities 
in the US.
Aside from our investments to 
secure a self -supply of sustainable 
biomass, we have made good progress 
towards securing near -term volumes 
of wood pellets from suppliers in 
the market with more than six million 
tonnes contracted for April 2015 
to March 2016. We continue our 
negotiations for additional longer 
term volumes to support our third 
unit conversion. Drax Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2014
18
Biomass conversion
In 2012, we embarked on our plan to 
convert three of our six generating units 
to burn sustainable biomass in place 
of coal, with a target to secure fuel for 
all three converted units by the end of 
2016. We are on schedule to meet that 
target. Our second generating unit was 
converted to burn biomass in October 
2014, after running as an enhanced 
co-firing unit, that is, burning at least 
85% biomass, for five months. We plan 
to convert a third unit to biomass in the 
12-month window from 1 July 2015.
Coal-fired generation 
performance 
As in previous years, we delivered strong 
generation output from our coal-fired 
units. We were able to continue to deliver 
additional value to the business through 
providing flexible generation output 
and balancing services to the System 
Operator , National Grid, in support of 
system stability and security .
Health and safety
In the UK, our safety performance 
remains industry-leading. During 2014, 
we undertook a significant amount 
of project work and a single planned 
outage on one of our generating units. 
All work was completed without a worse 
than first aid injury .
In 2013, the safety performance in the 
US at our construction sites was weaker 
than safety performance of our UK 
operations. During last year we worked 
hard to drive improvements at these 
US sites to meet our UK standards. 
T ogether with our contractors we made 
good progress during the year . However , 
our achievements were marred by the 
tragic death of a sub-contractor towards 
the end of the year . Excellent safety 
management has always been at the 
centre of our management ethos. 
The incident serves as a poignant 
reminder of the importance of 
strong safety systems and controls 
in the construction and operation of 
large plant.
Retail performance
Selling our output through our retail 
business, Haven Power Limited (“Haven 
Power”) continues to provide us with a 
credit -efficient route to market for our 
power sales compared to the wholesale 
electricity market. It also provides a good 
route to market for the Renewables 
Obligation Certificates and Levy 
Exemption Certificates earned when we 
generate renewable power . 
During 2014, Haven Power delivered 
another year of substantial growth in 
a highly competitive market with retail 
sales 46% higher , in volume, than in 2013.
An excellent standard of customer 
service is central to our proposition for 
our retail operations. We are a consistent 
high performer in the Datamonitor 
Energy Buyers Survey and have a good 
renewals record.
We have been working to minimise 
the risk that we face from the 
implementation of a price freeze, as 
announced by the Labour Party at its 
2013 Party conference, should the Party 
come to power following May’s General 
Election. Apart from a small number of 
customers that take supply on default 
terms, all of Haven’s customers are 
supplied under fixed term contracts. 
We do not believe that this form of 
contract is the primary target of the 
proposed freeze.
Regulatory framework 
The regulatory framework is a key 
influencing factor on our business. 
At the start of 2014 we had expected 
to be awarded two early contracts for 
difference or investment contracts 
(in line with the new, forthcoming 
contracts for difference regime ) 
to support our second and third 
unit conversions. 
In April, the government concluded that 
the second unit was no longer eligible 
for such a contract. We mounted a 
legal challenge and the High Court 
found in our favour . However , the 
government appealed that judgment 
and won. We subsequently converted 
our second unit under the Renewables 
Obligation (“RO”).
The investment contract for our third 
unit conversion has been executed, 
but is subject to EU State Aid clearance 
which is still under review.
In June, Ofgem referred the electricity 
wholesale and retail markets to the 
Competition and Markets Authority 
(“CMA ”) ; the main focus being on 
supply competition in the residential 
market. The CMA initiated a market 
investigation to determine whether 
any feature, or combination of features, 
of these markets prevents, restricts or 
distorts competition in the sector . If it 
concludes that there are issues that 
need addressing, it has wide ranging 
powers to impose remedies. The CMA ’s 
updated issues statement, published 
in February 2015, reported no finding 
of major competition concerns in the 
generation sector . We expect the CMA 
to conclude its inquiry during 2015. 
We are co-operating fully with the 
CMA ’s investigation. 
In November , we reached a settlement 
agreement with Ofgem regarding 
non-compliance with our obligation 
under the Community Energy Saving 
Programme. The settlement, worth 
£28 million, will see up to £20 million 
benefit vulnerable energy consumers 
through a programme of work to be 
developed by the charity , National 
Energy Action.
In December , the Government published 
a consultation on changes to the 
grandfathering policy for future biomass 
and co-firing conversion projects under 
the RO. The changes proposed would 
apply to all such projects except those 
already awarded with an investment 
contract, for example, our third unit 
conversion as mentioned above. 
The outcome of that consultation will 
have no impact on Drax’s base strategy 
of converting three generating units to 
burn sustainable biomass in place of coal 
and becoming a predominantly biomass-
fuelled power generator . However , if the 
consultation proposals are upheld, it will 
reduce our options for the conversion of 
a fourth unit.
Also in December , the first capacity 
market auction was held. The market is 
designed to ensure security of electricity 
supply by providing a payment for 
reliable sources of capacity . T wo of 
Drax Power Station’s coal units were 
successful in the auction, with the 
capacity required for delivery in 2018/19.

Marketplace, performance and risk Sustainable business review Governance Financials Overview
Looking ahead
We are on track to complete our 
transformation into a predominantly 
biomass-fuelled power provider in 2016. 
The case for a three unit conversion 
is robust and we are committed to full 
execution of this project.
We remain convinced that sustainable 
biomass has an important and strategic 
role to play in the future energy mix of 
the UK. Not only does biomass bring the 
benefit of significant carbon savings 
over fossil fuels, but it does so without 
jeopardising the security of supply 
characteristics traditionally associated 
with fossil fuel technology . 
The financial benefit of biomass 
generation from converted coal units is 
very significant. Independent economic 
analysis by Frontier Economics 
estimates that, if our biomass 
transformation project converting 
three of the six generating units at Drax 
Power Station to burn biomass in place 
of coal was replaced by offshore wind in 
2020, the cost to the economy would be 
£3. 4 billion more. 
We trust that, over time, the significant 
benefits of biomass conversion as an 
attractive renewable will underpin 
support for further generating unit 
conversions at Drax.
We remain alert to future strategic 
opportunities and will continue to review 
options that build on the wider strengths 
and competences of the Group with

Monitoring our performance
Our principal performance indicators provide a snapshot 
of the progress we are making against our key priorities 
and in delivering our strategic initiatives.
Principal performance indicators
Includes cash and short-term investments, 
less borrowings net of deferred finance costs
Why we measure
Monitoring net (debt)/cash ensures an 
efficient capital structure is maintained to 
support our business, alongside sufficient 
liquidity to manage our future obligations.
Comment
Through our biomass transformation we 
continue to invest significant amounts 
of capital expenditure, funded by a 
combination of term loans, secured in 
2014 and previous years, and share placing 
proceeds. Associated increases in ROC and 
biomass assets held on the balance sheet 
have combined to eliminate net cash and 
give rise to net debt.
Net power sales distributed through our 
retail business, Haven Power , measured at 
customer meter
Why we measure
A measure of the rate of growth in our 
retail business.
Comment
Haven continued to deliver strong growth in 
competitive markets during 2014 as planned, 
supported by its reputation for very good 
customer service.
Fuel costs in respect of generation, 
excluding carbon allowances, divided 
by the volume of net generation sales
Why we measure
The average cost of fuel ( excluding carbon 
and including the value of renewable 
support) tracks the fuel cost component of 
the dark green and bark spreads achieved, 
and reflects the value captured from 
effective fuel procurement and diversified 
fuel sources.
Comment
Falling coal costs over the last three years 
have been offset by the introduction of 
CPS in 2013 and increase in the CPS rate 
from April 2014. Additionally, the increasing 
influence of biomass in our fuel mix has 
increased average fuel costs. 
Revenues from the sale of power in our 
generation business, divided by the volume 
of net generation sales (includes balancing 
revenues/charges)
Why we measure
The average achieved price of electricity 
tracks the power price component of the 
dark green and bark spreads achieved.
Comment
Our average achieved price of electricity 
reflects the contracted position at the start 
of the year , as well as power prices during 
the period. Power prices remained relatively 
stable during 2013 but have fallen steadily 
in 2014. The timing of our hedges has 
provided some protection against market 
price weaknesses.
Carbon costs divided by volume 
of allowances purchased
Why we measure
The average cost of carbon ( excluding CPS) 
tracks the carbon cost component of the 
dark green spread achieved.
Comment
Market prices for carbon fell dramatically 
in the second half of 2011 and remained low 
until this year , when they have been steadily 
rising reflecting increased expectation 
of political intervention to resolve the 
oversupply in the market. Our average cost 
is influenced by the timing of securing 
purchases and much of our 2014 carbon 
requirement was contracted in 2013 when 
prices were low. As a result, our average 
cost of carbon reduced compared to the 
previous year .
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, 
amortisation, unrealised gains and losses 
on derivative contracts and the one-off 
settlement of CESP in 2014
Why we measure 
EBITDA is our key financial 
performance metric.
Comment 
Our EBITDA performance has been adversely 
impacted in recent years by the increasing 
cost of carbon allowances and the UK 
Carbon Price Support (“CPS”) mechanism. 
In 2014, good operational performance and 
the increasing influence of biomass in our 
fuel mix meant, despite the cost of carbon, 
our EBITDA was broadly in line with that 
achieved in 2013. Deliver our

T onnes of sustainable biomass fuel burnt 
during the year
Why we measure
Measuring the levels of sustainable 
biomass burnt tracks our progress in 
producing power from renewable and 
sustainable sources.
Comment
Following the conversion of our first unit 
to run fully on biomass from April 2013, 
we have seen a significant increase in our 
biomass volumes burnt. We will continue 
to increase these volumes as we progress 
our biomass transformation.
CO2 emissions rate per unit of output
Why we measure
This measure of carbon emissions 
illustrates our progress in reducing the 
carbon footprint of Drax Power Station.
Comment
With our progression towards converting 
three of our generating units to biomass, 
we are realising significant savings in 
carbon dioxide emissions. We now have 
two converted biomass units (2013: one 
biomass unit) resulting in a decreasing 
trend in emissions over the last two years. 
This metric should continue to fall as we 
conclude our transformation plans. 
Why we measure
These injury rate metrics track our health and safety performance and enable us to maintain  
a strong health and safety culture.
Comment
2014 was a year of significant project activity across the Group, with a single major outage and 
conversion activity in the UK and continued construction work in the US. Against this backdrop 
of activity our safety performance continues to be strong, although we are continuing to work 
hard to improve safety records in the US, which remain behind our UK standards and have 
contributed to higher total recordable injury rates in 2013 and 2014.
The frequency rate is calculated on the 
following basis: lost time injuries/hours 
worked x 100,000
The frequency rate is calculated on the 
following basis: (lost time injuries + worse 
than first aid injuries)/hours worked x 
100,000
The aggregate of net merchant sales 
and net Balancing Mechanism activity
Why we measure
Net sales tracks the volume of power 
we can sell at positive margins.
Comment
Good operational performance in our 
generation business in 2014, taking into 
account a single major planned outage 
and biomass modification and conversion 
activity, allowed us to increase net electrical 
output compared to 2013.
Net sales from biomass-fired generation
Why we measure 
As well as tracking performance against 
our biomass transformation strategy, 
biomass generation levels provides an 
indicator of operating performance 
from our biomass units.
Comment 
Following conversion of our first biomass 
unit in April 2013, we have expanded our 
biomass generation capacity in 2014 with 
the modification of a further unit to run as 
an enhanced co-firing unit from May 2014 
and subsequent conversion in October . Drax Group plc

Marketplace
We play an essential part  
in the electricity market
At Drax Power Station, electricity 
is generated from both sustainable 
biomass and coal. 
Sourcing biomass
We only burn sustainable biomass 
to produce renewable power . 
Predominantly the biomass we 
source comes from woody (forest) 
material, the remainder comes from 
agricultural residues, such as straw, 
and purpose grown energy crops, such 
as miscanthus.
Forest product industry 
The global forest industry is already a 
large, well-established marketplace, 
serving the building, furniture and paper 
industries with high and low grade 
wood fibre. In producing electricity from 
biomass, we are able to use the low 
grade wood fibre, such as, thinnings, 
branches and tops, as well as sawmill 
residues. The table opposite gives a 
breakdown of the woody biomass 
sourced and burnt by Drax in 2014 
by type and country .
Sometimes such fibre and residues 
have no other alternative use. 
Providing a market for them increases 
the production efficiency and the 
economics of the forest, incentivising 
forest and land owners to keep their 
land forested.
Sustainable forest management
Sustainable forest management 
practices are fundamental to 
maintaining healthy and productive 
working forests with stable 
and increasing carbon stocks. 
When the fibre harvested from forests 
is completely offset by new growth 
the losses of carbon are also offset. 
Therefore, when comparing forest 
growth to harvest in any one year , if 
the growth exceeds the harvest there 
is surplus of fibre which equates to an 
increased carbon stock. Fibre taken 
from forests with a surplus means that 
there is no addition to the carbon levels 
in the atmosphere. In 2013, across 
the southeast US states, where Drax 
sources much of its fibre, there was a 
significant surplus.
Ensuring sustainable sourcing
It is a prerequisite that all our biomass 
comes from sustainable sources. 
T o ensure this we have implemented 
a sustainability policy which embeds 
comprehensive criteria into our 
procurement activities. Through a 
programme of information exchange, 
documentary evidence, due diligence 
activities and independent third party 
verification we are confident that all 
the biomass we procure comes from 
sustainable sources. Read more about 
biomass sustainability and procurement 
in the Sustainable business review on 
page 56.

The structure of the 
electricity market
The electricity market in Great Britain 
is characterised by six large vertically 
integrated companies, with interests 
in both the generation and supply of 
electricity , and a number of smaller 
independent companies, some of 
which are purely generation or supply 
companies and others which have 
an interest in both sectors. Drax is 
an independent company , with both 
generation and supply interests. 
The electricity mix
T oday , the electricity mix benefits from 
a diversity of fuel sources, including gas, 
coal, nuclear and renewables. The shares

Sustainable business review Governance Financials Marketplace, performance and risk Overview
We calculate the life cycle carbon 
footprint of all the biomass we burn, 
from forest or field to furnace. In that 
way we take account of the carbon 
emissions along the biomass supply 
chain, including those associated 
with harvesting, processing and 
transportation. In 2014, the average 
greenhouse gas saving over the full life 
cycle resulting from burning sustainable 
biomass in place of coal was 86%.
Sourcing coal
We buy coal from a range of sources. 
In 2014, 38% of the coal we burnt came 
from UK deep and surface mines with 
the remainder coming from major supply 
basins around the world, including the 
US, Colombia and Russia.
Our focus is on responsible procurement, 
and our continued membership 
of Bettercoal, an organisation that 
promotes continuous improvement in 
corporate responsibility in the supply 
chain, supports that focus. See more

Generate
Marketplace ( continued)
Drax Power Station typically meets 
around 7 -8% of the UK’s electricity 
needs. There are two routes to market 
for the power we generate – the 
wholesale market (see below) and the 
retail market (see Supply on page 25).
The wholesale 
electricity market
Various mechanisms exist to allow 
power to be traded at the wholesale 
level. T rading can take place bilaterally 
or on exchanges, and contracts 
for electricity can be struck over 
timescales ranging from several years 
ahead to on-the-day trading markets. 
It can also be traded for specific 
periods, for example, specific half hours 
or specific seasons. The wholesale 
electricity market trades across three 
sub-markets:
 , long-term forward market allowing 
contracts to be struck up to several 
years ahead of delivery in response 
to market participants’ requirements;
 , short -term bilateral market operated 
through power exchanges which 
gives market participants the 
opportunity to fine tune their 
contractual positions; and
 , Balancing Mechanism (real-time 
market) through which the System 
Operator accepts offers and bids 
for electricity to enable it to balance 
supply and demand on the system.
Wholesale prices
Power prices are driven by a number of 
factors, such as underlying commodity 
prices, the availability of generating 
capacity on the electricity system, 
and the physical positions taken by 
individual market participants.
The wholesale market operates on 
price and the relative prices of gas 
and coal. Carbon costs for fossil 
fuelled generators along with the 
operating efficiencies of the various 
power stations will determine which 
of gas-fired generation or coal-fired 
generation is the more expensive 
and so operates at the margin. If gas 
prices are high relative to the costs of 
coal-fired generation then gas-fired 
generation becomes the marginal 
plant. These dynamics of price setting 
can be expected to change in the 
future when higher penetration of 
renewable generation combined with 
nuclear generation displace fossil-
fuelled generation.
As well as selling power through the 
wholesale electricity market, we 
are selling an increasing proportion 
of our output directly to business 
customers through our retail company , 
Haven Power . This provides us with 
a credit -efficient route to market 
for power , as well as a good route to 
market for Renewables Obligation

), 
electricity sales in Great Britain to all 
consumers accounted for 291TWh. 
The electricity supply market is 
characterised by three sectors: 
domestic, industrial and commercial 
(“I&C”), and small and medium-sized 
enterprises (“SMEs”). The domestic 
sector accounts for 38% of the total 
electricity sales in Great Britain, the I&C 
sector 44% and SMEs 18%.
Through our retail company , Haven 
Power , we serve businesses of all sizes. 
In 2014, Haven Power sold 11.8TWh to 
the I&C and SME sectors.
The business sectors of the market 
have continued to be very competitive 
with our established competitors 
being joined by a number of new 
entrants. Against this backdrop, 
Haven Power has succeeded in 
growing its market share by offering 
innovative and tailored contracts at 
competitive prices.

Operational and financial performance
A challenging year ...
Introduction
In a year during which trading and 
regulatory conditions have been 
challenging, EBITDA for the year to 
31 December 2014 was £229 million, 
compared to £230 million in 2013. 
We have continued to make 
good progress with our biomass 
transformation project, having 
converted our first unit in May 2013. 
We modified a second unit in May 2014 
to operate as an enhanced co-firing 
unit, burning at least 85% of its fuel 
from biomass, which was subsequently 
fully converted to biomass in October . 
Both biomass units continue to perform 
very well and are operating in line 
with plans.
A third of our generation capacity 
is now biomass-fired, with biomass 
representing 29% of our overall fuel 
mix in 2014, compared to 12% in 2013. 
As a result, carbon (CO
2 ) emissions 
and the associated cost of allowances 
purchased under the EU ETS have fallen 
year -on-year .
The transformation is providing 
significant earnings protection to the 
Group, compared to being a solely coal-
fired generator .
Our coal-fired generation remains 
subject to increases in the cost of 
carbon incurred through the UK carbon 
price support (“CPS”) mechanism, first 
introduced in April 2013. CPS rates 
increased by 93% with effect from April 
2014, adding £56 million to our cost of 
fuel in 2014. As a result, the overall cost 
of carbon increased compared to the 
previous year .
Our capital investment plans remain 
on schedule and budget. The new 
on-site biomass facilities at Drax Power 
Station are now fully commissioned 
and fuelling our two converted units. 
In the US Gulf , we continue to expect 
commercial operations to commence 
at our first pellet plant and port facility in 
the first quarter of 2015, with commercial 
operations following at the second plant 
in the second quarter . This continued 
investment in our transformation is 
reflected in capital expenditure of 
£201 million for 2014 (2013: £286 million).
Our retail business, Haven Power 
Limited (“Haven Power”), has continued 
to deliver strong sales growth in highly 
competitive markets, with 11.8TWh of 
sales in the year ended 31 December 
2014, compared to 8. 1TWh in 2013.
The expected increase in ROC assets 
and biomass stocks arising from 
increased biomass generation has 
resulted in a reduction in cash generated 
from operations from £171 million in 2013 
to £127 million. We have utilised available 
agreements to accelerate ROC cash 
flows in 2014 where possible.
Our balance sheet remains robust. 
In May 2014, we agreed a new 
£100 million private placement with 
M&G Investments, which complements 
our existing financing structure secured 
in previous years and provides additional 
liquidity to the Group.
With £325 million of loans drawn down, 
net debt at 31 December 2014 was 
£99 million (2013: net cash of £71 million). 
At the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, the Board will recommend a 
final dividend for 2014 of 7 .2 pence per 
share, taking total dividends for the year 
to £ 48 million.
. . . but we are on track with our biomass conversion plans, which 
create a fundamentally stronger business. Our E BITDA is in line 
with last year , despite absorbing increased carbon costs.

EBITDA for the Group is our key measure of profit 
or loss. Our biomass strategy has helped us to 
maintain EBITDA performance year -on-year despite 
the increased cost of carbon and challenging 
trading conditions. 
Implementing the asset base and financing platform 
to realise our biomass strategy has resulted in 
increased depreciation and financing charges, which 
have contributed to the reduction in underlying 
earnings per share. 
Throughout our biomass transformation, operating 
cash flows have been reinvested to support the 
significant expenditure required. 
Haven Power continued to deliver strong growth 
in sales during 2014, and is well on track to achieve 
continuing growth targets. 
The majority of capital spend in the last two years has 
related to our biomass transformation project, with 
further spend expected through to the completion of 
this work. 
T wo out of six generating units are converted to 
run solely on sustainable biomass, which now 
accounts for more than 29% of our total fuel burnt 
by energy content.

Operational and financial performance ( continued)
A look at the detail
To d a y
With two units (out of six) converted so far , biomass exerts increasing influence on our results; 
however the performance of our coal operations and the dark green spreads we can achieve still 
remain very important to our earnings...
Our financial performance is driven by the gross margin 
achieved by our generation and retail businesses.
Supply
Generate
Source
Fuel costs
Fuel costs make up the largest portion of our 
cost of sales, and reflect the cost of coal and CO2 
emissions allowances purchased, as well as the 
cost of sustainable biomass offset by the benefit 
of associated renewable support received.
T otal fuel costs are influenced by market prices 
at the time we secure fuel purchases but are 
also subject to changes in our fuel mix as we 
progress our biomass transformation.
Biomass now represents 29% of the fuel we 
burn (by energy content), a significant increase 
from 12% in 2013. 
Increased biomass burn results in a number of 
changes in the composition of our fuel costs.
Biomass is a more expensive fuel than coal, 
increasing the gross cost of fuel purchased; 
however it attracts renewable support in the 
form of ROCs and LECs that are recognised at 
the point of generation and reduce the overall 
cost of fuel. A reduction in the volume of coal 
burnt also reduces CO2 emissions and thus the 
number of allowances we have to purchase 
under the EU ETS. However , in 2014, this benefit 
has been offset by increases in the rate of UK 
carbon tax charged from April 2014.
Capacity , efficiency and flexibility
In 2014, our net generation sales were 
26.7TWh compared to 26.2TWh in 2013. 
Generation volumes are driven by plant 
availability and commodity market conditions.
Net generation sales increase when availability 
is high and commodity prices make it profitable 
for us to generate. Availability is driven by plant 
outages (both planned and forced) and the load 
factor (actual generation as a proportion of the 
maximum available) increases when market 
conditions are favourable and plant is available.
Operational performance remained good in 
2014. Availability levels were comparable with 
recent performance and reflected a single 
major scheduled outage, forced outages for 
plant maintenance requirements and biomass 
conversion activity.
Key to our ability to maximise value is 
the efficiency and flexibility of our plant. 
High efficiency reduces the volume of fuel 
required to generate a given volume of power , 
increasing margins. Flexible plant enables us 
to take advantage of opportunities to provide 
system balancing and ancillary support to the 
electricity system operator . 
Wholesale and retail sales
We sell power into the wholesale market and 
through our retail business to non-domestic 
customers in the Industrial and Commercial 
(“I&C”) and Small and Medium Enterprise (“SME”) 
markets. The revenue achieved is driven by 
market prices at the time of securing the sale.
Generation sales revenue, excluding power 
purchased in the market, increased from 
£1,335 million in 2013 to £1,373 million in 2014, 
reflecting both the increase in output described 
above and an increase in the average price 
achieved – the timing of our hedges providing 
protection from market price weakness 
described on page 30.
Retail sales grew from £751 million to 
£1,090 million in 2014, underpinned by strong 
volume growth although average prices fell 
slightly as market prices reduced in the year .
ROC and LEC sales represent an increasing 
element of our total revenue as we expand 
our output from biomass generation. ROC and 
LEC revenues are influenced by the number 
of ROCs and LECs generated, the price that 
can be achieved in the market and the timing 
of the sales. Increasingly, we are able to utilise 
monetisation agreements to accelerate sales 
of ROCs and the associated cash flows. Drax Group plc

drive our profitability.
Wholesale power sales
Our generation business sells power both to Haven Power , our retail business, and into the wholesale markets.
The price achieved for power sold into the wholesale market is based on market prices at the time we secure the sale of power . The timing of 
our sales is driven by our hedging strategy, but can be influenced by liquidity in the market and requirements for collateral.
Market prices fell in 2014 (see page 30); however our hedging strategy provided some protection from recent market weakness. As a result, 
the average achieved price for generation power sales increased slightly compared to 2013.
Whilst the market spreads available, in comparison to our short run marginal cost of producing, determine whether it is optimal to generate, 
the operational performance of the power station determines whether we are able to generate and benefit from good market spreads.

Retail power sales Power purchases Third party costs
Haven Power sells electricity to business 
customers in the I&C and SME markets. 
The revenue achieved is determined by 
contracted prices and customer demand.
Haven has a very good service reputation 
which has helped to drive strong growth over 
the last few years.
Selling power into the retail market attracts 
low margins, but provides a credit -efficient 
route to market for the power generated 
by, and a route to market for ROCs and LECs 
earned by, the generation business.
Power purchases represent approximately 
60% of the total costs of sale of the 
retail business.
The cost of power purchases is driven by 
market prices and the timing of purchases. 
Haven offers flexible contracts that enable the 
customer to determine when to fix the price of 
their power .
The cost of power purchases fell during 2014, 
as market prices decreased across the year as 
described on page 30.
Third party costs are the other costs of supply 
that we do not directly control – notably 
charges for transmission, distribution and 
balancing of the electricity system (known 
collectively as grid charges) and environmental 
and regulatory costs such as the renewables 
obligation, levy exemption certificates (LECs) 
and small-scale feed-in-tariffs.
Third party costs have risen during 2014 and 
now represent over 40% of the total costs 
of supply.

performance 36– 37 
Coal and carbon
The cost of biomass burnt is made up of two elements, the gross 
cost of purchasing the fuel, less the value of the renewable 
support receivable. 
The gross cost of the fuel includes the cost of the raw material, 
processing costs, logistics, handling and storage costs, and is 
influenced by exchange rates where the fuel is contracted in a 
foreign currency. As a renewable fuel, biomass is exempt from the 
CPS regime.
The renewable support reflects the value of the ROCs and LECs 
earned through generating electricity from burning sustainable 
biomass. This value is recognised as a reduction in cost of sales 
when the related biomass is burnt. 
Upon sale the value of the ROCs and LECs is recognised in revenue 
and transferred from cost of sales. T raditionally, sales have been 
made at the end of a compliance period resulting in a significant build 
up of working capital. We have successfully accelerated ROC cash flows 
this year utilising available ROC monetisation agreements.

The cost of coal and carbon allowances is driven by market prices 
at the time we secure the purchases. Our aim is to match the timing 
of our coal and carbon purchases to the related power sales in order 
to lock in a margin (or spread). 
CPS rates are set by government and are levied on coal deliveries to 
the power station. The cost of CPS is therefore influenced by the rates 
prevailing at the date coal was delivered.
We are able to burn a variety of fuels including petcoke, pond fines 
(a coal mining residue) and a wide range of coals, all of which allow us 
to maximise value where alternatives are economically advantageous.
Under the EU ETS we are obliged to submit carbon emissions 
allowances equivalent to the tonnes of carbon we emit through 
burning fossil fuels. The volume of allowances we are required to 
purchase is dependent on the volume and quality of coal we burn 
and the efficiency of the station.

Operational and financial performance ( continued)
The margins of our generation business are driven by commodity market 
movements and the timing of our fuel purchases and power sales described in 
more detail on pages 28-29. The key profit drivers are those commodities that make 
up the dark green and bark spreads, as described on the previous page, being power , 
coal, carbon and biomass.
The trends in commodity prices witnessed in the last two years are described in 
the following paragraphs and illustrated in the accompanying charts.
Power and gas
Following a period of relative stability through 2013 and early 2014, power prices 
reduced substantially through the second half of 2014. The gas market continues 
to drive power prices.
Limited Japanese nuclear generation, in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster , 
continued to provide support to Japanese liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) demand. 
However , growth in new LNG supplies and a relatively mild winter led to muted gas 
demand and increasing stored inventories, resulting in some price pressure in the 
second half of the year . 
International LNG and oil-indexed European gas prices came under pressure due 
to a falling oil market. Weaker than expected global demand and increased supplies 
driven by the prevalence of US production coupled with key OPEC oil producers 
not making supply cuts caused a crash in global oil prices – down 50% during the 
second half of 2014. 
Coal 
Market prices for international coal have continued to fall steadily as the global coal 
market remains oversupplied. Delivered prices have also fallen as a result of lower 
global freight rates.
During Summer 2014 UK coal demand from power generators was down 31% year -
on-year and indigenous coal production is under pressure with two of the remaining 
deep mines expected to close by the end of 2015. China seabourne coal demand has 
fallen year -on-year , with growth focus now on India.
With prices falling, producers focused on reducing production costs and increasing 
output to improve efficiencies. The strengthening of the US dollar during the year 
also supported many exporting nations.

Sustainable business review Governance Financials Marketplace, performance and risk Overview
Carbon
A downward trend in market prices for EU ETS carbon allowances continued through 
2012 and 2013. 
Carbon prices spiked early in 2014 due to the introduction of the much-debated “back 
loading” (postponing the sales of 900mt of emissions allowances to 2019/20 in order 
to restrict current supplies) in an attempt to alleviate the oversupply in the market. 
However , the oversupply of allowances resulting from the European recession and 
emission reductions persists and as a result prices fell back to pre-back loading levels 
almost immediately . 
Political intervention remains the key driver for carbon prices and further possible 
measures, such as discussions around the market stability reserve proposed for 
phase four of the EU ETS in 2021, drove a steady rise in carbon prices over the second 
half of 2014.
Biomass 
The majority of biomass used for large-scale power generation is imported from 
North America and Europe and accordingly is priced in US dollars, Canadian dollars or 
euros. Movements in these exchange rates, set out in the chart to the left, therefore 
drive the changes in biomass costs during the period. 
Our extensive foreign currency hedging programme provides some protection from 
these fluctuations in exchange rates. 
Dark green spread and bark spread
As a result of falling gas and power prices throughout the second half of 2014 
and an increase in carbon prices, dark green spreads reduced from the levels 
seen earlier in the year and in 2013. The increase in carbon price support (“CPS”), 
a levy on coal deliveries, from April 2014, continued to reduce margins for coal-
fired generators.
The fall in power prices also impacted bark spreads, which fell steadily during the 
year . The US dollar strengthened against sterling, increasing the overall cost of 
fuel to UK generators. Looking forward, if soft power markets persist bark spreads 
could fall further as the cost of fuel does not fall in line with weaker power and 
gas prices.
However , bark spreads were stronger than dark green spreads throughout the period 
and further increases in CPS from April 2015 will continue to erode the competitive 
position of coal-fired plant. 
The performance of our coal operations and the dark green spreads we can 
achieve remain important to our earnings. However , as we progress our biomass 
strategy , with a third unit due to be high biomass from the second half of 2015, 
the value of renewable support and the bark spread will increasingly drive 
our profitability .  Drax Group plc

The generation gross profit for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £ 433 million, 
compared to £ 430 million in 2013. Dark green spreads, which currently account 
for the majority of our gross profit, were weaker in 2014, but good operational 
performance and the increasing influence of biomass in our fuel mix means 
profitability was slightly higher than in 2013.
The introduction of the UK CPS mechanism from April 2013 has added a levy to our 
coal purchases and, as expected in its first full year of operation, which saw a rate 
increase applicable from April 2014, continued to erode the profitability of our coal 
generating plant.
However , with biomass now accounting for 29% of fuel burnt (by energy content), 
this was mitigated somewhat by the reduced cost of CO
2 emissions allowances 
purchased under the EU ETS. This reinforces the economic case for the strategy we 
have developed to become a predominantly biomass-fuelled power generator .
Revenue
T otal generation revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £2,4 50 million, 
compared to £1,780 million in 2013.
Our generation business recognises revenue when it sells power into the wholesale 
market, or to Haven Power (see Retail, on page 36). Intra-group sales totalled 
£735 million in 2014 (2013: £ 468 million). We can meet our power delivery obligations 
either by generating the power ourselves or by buying power from the market. 
We purchase power from the market either when it is more economical to do so, or to 
meet delivery obligations that cannot be covered by generation.
Power purchases of £710 million (2013: £334 million) are included within cost of sales 
and the associated revenue within power sales. Increasing retail sales have increased 
our power delivery obligations which, along with falling market power prices during 
2014 (illustrated by the charts on the previous page ) has resulted in a substantial 
increase in the amount of power we have purchased from the market. As prices 
fall, the overnight power price drops below our marginal cost of production more 
frequently at the point of delivery .
Increasing levels of intermittent generation (principally wind and solar) on the 
electricity system in the UK, which can contribute to falling power prices and 
increased grid charges, are also providing opportunities to capitalise on the flexibility 
of the Drax plant through balancing and system support activities.

Sustainable business review Governance Financials Marketplace, performance and risk Overview
Excluding the cost of power purchased in the market, our power sales revenue of 
£1,369 million was higher than the equivalent comparative for 2013 (£1,335 million). 
This increase reflects both a 0.5TWh increase in net power sold ( electrical output) 
and a small increase in the average achieved electricity price from £51. 0 per MWh to 
£51.3 per MWh, despite a fall in market prices during the year . The timing of our power 
sales hedges has provided protection from recent power market weakness.
Generation revenue also includes sales of ROCs and LECs of £315 million 
(2013: £63 million). With two units now fully converted and biomass now accounting 
for 29% of our fuel mix (2013: 12%) we are entitled to considerably more ROCs and 
LECs from our renewable generation.
The timing of ROC sales is driven by a combination of Renewables Obligation 
deadlines and commercial considerations. Increasingly , we are able to utilise available 
agreements ( described in more detail in Financing and cash flow management) to 
monetise ROC sales, accelerating the recognition of sales as well as the associated 
cash flows.
This trend, in addition to the greater entitlement to ROCs and LECs described above, 
is demonstrated in the table at the foot of the opposite page. 
It is the value of ROC and LEC support earned in any given period, rather than the 
income received for those sold, that drives the bark spreads achieved. This support 
is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in fuel costs in the month the 
associated biomass is burned – matching the benefit against the cost of the biomass.
Cost of sales
As explained on pages 28 to 29, our fuel costs are driven by a combination of market 
prices at the time of securing the fuel and the mix of different fuels burnt during 
the period.

T otal fuel costs in respect of generation for the year ended 31 December 2014 were 
£1,225 million (2013: £946 million).
The average gross cost of fuel, before the impact of carbon allowances, CPS and ROC 
support, was £ 40.3 per MWh in 2014 compared with £32. 1 per MWh in 2013, reflecting 
the increasing proportion of biomass in our fuel mix.
Following the conversion of our first unit to run on biomass in April 2013, we modified 
a second unit to run as an enhanced co-fired unit in May 2014, burning up to 85% 
biomass, which was subsequently fully converted in October . 
Within cost of sales, net biomass costs are made up of the cost of the fuel delivered 
to site less the value of renewable support received. The cost of the fuel includes 
raw material and delivery costs. The renewable support reflects the value assigned 
to ROCs and LECs earned through generating electricity from burning biomass, that 
value being derived from prevailing market prices for ROCs and LECs at the point 
of generation. The value of the renewable support therefore reduces the net cost 
of biomass.

When renewable support is taken into account, the average cost of fuel for the 
year is £26.8 per MWh, compared to £26.6 per MWh in 2013.
Coal remains the largest component of our fuel mix and as a result the cost of the UK 
carbon tax introduced in April 2013, which was subject to a 93% rate increase from 
April 2014, has continued to add to our fuel costs. The total cost in respect of CPS 
in 2014 was £118 million, compared to £62 million in 2013.
However , as our proportion of generation from biomass increases our requirement 
to purchase emissions allowances under the EU ETS reduces. In 2014 our 
emissions reduced to 16.6 million tonnes (with allowances purchased at an 
average price of £ 4.6 per tonne ) from 20.3 million tonnes last year (with allowances 
purchased at an average price of £6. 1 per tonne ), a saving of £ 47 million year -on-year .
When we sell ROCs and LECs, to a third party or Haven Power , the value 
previously recognised as a reduction in fuel costs and held in our balance sheet is 
recognised as a cost of sale. The cost of ROCs and LECs sold in 2014 is £314 million 
(2013: £62 million), with the increase compared to last year reflecting both 
increased generation and our ability to accelerate sales using ROC agreements as 
described above.
When it is more economical to do so, we can meet our power delivery obligations 
( created through forward sales of power in prior periods) by buying power from the 
market. Power purchases in 2014 totalled £710 million (2013: £334 million).
Generation cost of sales also includes grid charges of £82 million (2013: £70 million) 
which continue to increase as the level of intermittent generation on the UK 
electricity system impacts system balancing costs.
Generation operating performance
Health and safety
2014 saw another year of significant project activity at Drax Power Station, with the 
modification of a second unit to run as an enhanced co-firing unit from May and 
its subsequent conversion in October alongside a single major scheduled planned 
outage. Against this backdrop our safety performance in the UK remains industry-
leading, with no worse than first aid injuries during annual major planned outages 
at Drax Power Station for two years.
In the US, substantial progress has been made on the construction of two pellet 
plants and a port facility . We have worked hard this year , with our contractors, to 
improve safety standards at these sites and bring them into line with performance 
levels at our UK operations.
Regrettably , as noted in the Chief Executive’s statement, the tragic death of a sub-
contractor at one of our US construction sites in the year stands as a reminder to the 
critical importance of strong safety standards and culture. The safety of all of our 
employees and contractors across the Group is of paramount importance and has 
always been at the centre of our management ethos.
The Group’s lost time injury rate and total recordable injury rate (“TRIR”) in 2014 were 
0. 06 and 0.33 respectively , compared to 0. 09 and 0.29 in 2013. Despite the increase 
in TRIR, which was related to our US construction programme, our performance 
continues to be in the upper quartile amongst global coal power plants.

Plant operational performance
Biomass
When initially converted in April 2013, our first biomass unit was materially 
constrained by the use of temporary fuel storage, handling and distribution systems. 
The commissioning of our bespoke systems late last year has largely overcome these 
start -up issues.
With two converted units at the end of the year , both running fully on our bespoke 
receipt, storage and handling infrastructure, biomass now represents 29% of our 
electrical output, having increased from 2. 9TWh in 2013 to 7 . 9TWh in 2014. Both units 
are performing well and to plan, delivering 630MW of capacity on a consistent basis.
We have made good progress with biomass unit optimisation. In addition, we 
completed a successful grid flexibility test during 2014. As a result, we expect to 
undertake greater system balancing activities from biomass units, enhancing 
potential value streams.
Outage activity in the year included a one-month outage to modify the second 
unit for enhanced co-firing from May and a further outage ahead of full conversion 
from October , in addition to scheduled routine maintenance and fuel trials. The first 
biomass unit, which has now been running for over 18 months, ran very reliably 
throughout 2014.
Our maintenance regime includes a major planned outage for each of our six 
units once every four years. Consequently , there is an irregular pattern to planned 
outages and associated expenditure, since in two of the four years two units will 
each undergo a major planned outage. In 2015, our first converted biomass unit will 
undergo a major planned outage.
Coal
We have continued to realise good operating performance from our remaining 
coal units. Generation from coal-fired capacity was 18.8TWh (2013: 23.3TWh) in 
2014, the reduction from the prior period caused by biomass conversion activity 
described above.
A single major planned outage took place on coal units in 2014, compared to two 
in the previous year . There are no major outages planned for coal-generating units 
in 2015.

Strategic value
The strategic value of Haven Power , the Group’s retail business, is in providing an 
alternative credit -efficient route to market for power , ROCs and LECs.
ROCs earned by the generation business from burning biomass can be utilised by the 
retail business through its sales of power . In 2014, Haven Power utilised 36% of ROCs 
generated by Drax. In addition, where Haven Power supplies Renewable or Levy 
Exempt Power this utilises the LECs earned by burning biomass. Such sales account 
for over half of Haven Power’s volumes.
With our growth targets for the business, Haven Power should utilise all the ROCs 
generated from one of our converted units and a substantial proportion of the LECs 
from the three planned unit conversions.
In selling power into the retail market, rather than wholesale, the Group swaps 
collateral risk for credit risk, which is more controllable. Haven Power actively 
manages credit risk by assessing the financial strength of its customers and 
applying rigorous credit management processes, reflected in very low bad debt 
experience to date. Further information on credit risk is provided in note 22 to the 
financial statements.
We continue to have a strong focus on cash collection and working capital. 
This focus, combined with the growth at Haven Power , has again resulted in the retail 
business being a net contributor of cash to the Group.
Revenue
Movements in key financial metrics for Haven Power are underpinned by continued 
good volume growth. Haven Power delivered net sales volume growth of 46% this 
year to 11.8TWh from 8. 1TWh in 2013.
Haven Power has built its business on a good service reputation, which has 
supported the achieved growth and has resulted in an excellent renewals 
performance in the I&C sector .
As a result of this growth, revenue increased to £1,090 million at an average price 
of £92. 4 per MWh (2013: £751 million at an average price of £92.7 per MWh). 
Much of Haven’s sales growth continues to be from the larger but more competitive 
I&C market. Many larger I&C customers are signed up to flexible contracts where 
the customer decides when to fix the price of their power , or leave it to day or month 
ahead prices. As a result, the declining wholesale power price in 2014 has contributed 
to the reduced average price for retail sales.
With over 13TWh of sales already contracted for the next 12 months we expect 
Haven to continue to grow in the future, with our proven infrastructure providing the 
foundation from which future growth can be achieved.

Cost of sales
T otal power purchases increased to £629 million in 2014 (2013: £ 4 55 million), primarily 
as a result of the increase in sales volumes described above. Haven purchases most 
of its power requirement from Drax Power Station, with all non-long-term intra-group 
purchases made at market equivalent prices. Accordingly , the average price paid of 
£53.3 per MWh has fallen slightly from £56.2 per MWh in 2013 reflecting changes in 
the wholesale market over the period.
In addition to the cost of purchasing power , cost of sales comprise third party costs 
including grid charges, the cost of meeting our obligations under the Renewables 
Obligation, small-scale Feed-in- T ariff schemes and the cost of LECs required to deliver 
Renewable or Levy Exempt Power to our customers. Grid charges include costs of 
distribution, transmission and system balancing. 
The rates charged by the network and system operators have increased compared 
to 2013. Distribution costs increased by 9% on average in April 2014 and transmission 
costs increased by 15% on average for the same period. As described under 
Generation, the increase in intermittent generation on the UK electricity system has 
driven an increase in system balancing costs. As a result, total grid charges for 2014 
were £253 million, equivalent to £21. 4 per MWh sold (2013: £168 million, equivalent to 
£20.8 per MWh sold).
In April 2014 the costs of the Renewables Obligation increased from £8.66 per MWh 
to £10.57 per MWh sold, an increase of over 22%. Small-scale Feed-in- T ariff costs 
also increased by 30% in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the same period 
last year .
Approximately half of the power sold by Haven is levy exempt. Accordingly the 
associated total cost of LECs sold has increased year -on-year as sales volumes grow.
T otal third party costs, at £ 44 5 million, represented 4 1% of the overall costs of supply 
(2013: £280 million, 38% of the overall costs of supply).
Gross margin
The markets in which Haven Power operates have been very competitive in both the 
current and prior period. It is these challenging trading conditions that drive the gross 
margin performance of the retail business.
As noted above, revenues from flexible sales contracts have reduced due to the 
falling wholesale power price in the year . Conversely , rising third party costs put 
further pressure on the margins achievable on fixed price sales.
The majority of the growth achieved at Haven Power over recent years has come 
from the more competitive I&C market, which typically has a lower gross margin than 
the SME market.
T aking all of these factors into account, retail gross margin for 2014 was £17 million 
compared to £16 million in 2013. Drax Group plc

Group operating and administrative expenses
Group operating and administrative expenses before depreciation were £220 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2014 compared to £215 million in 2013, the increase 
reflecting investment in our US-based pellet production operation as it approaches 
commercial operations.
In addition, we invested £3 million into the White Rose Carbon Capture and Storage 
(“WRCCS”) project during the year . The project is at the mid-point of a two-year 
Front -End Engineering and Design process. We have committed to provide a further 
£1 million of funding to enable the project to conclude this process, with a final 
investment decision expected in 2016. Further details of our investment in WRCCS 
are set out in note 12 to the financial statements.
Further costs associated with Retail Market Reform added £1 million to the cost base 
of Haven Power in 2014, compared to the previous year .
Despite these incremental costs, the result for the year demonstrates our continued 
commitment to strong operational cost control. The chart to the left of this page 
illustrates good year -on-year performance in managing the underlying cost base 
of the Group, with low inflation in underlying costs after allowing for a single major 
outage (2013: double major outage ) in 2014.
Group EBITDA
Group EBITDA ( earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation) 
which excludes the impact of unrealised gains and losses and the one-off settlement 
of CESP in 2014 (see below), is our primary financial performance indicator . 
Changes in EBITDA are primarily driven by factors influencing the gross margin.
Despite challenging market conditions and absorbing additional carbon costs 
through CPS, our gross margin improved modestly this year as a result of the 
increasing influence of our biomass transformation, good operational performance at 
Drax Power Station and continued strong growth at Haven Power .
However , investment in our cost base to support our US operations as they approach 
commercial operations and the increasing costs of meeting regulatory requirements 
in both generation and retail mean our EBITDA is in line with last year at £229 million.

Group EBITDA 
(2013: £230 million).
Looking forward, we remain committed to our plan to convert a third unit to biomass; 
however our trading environment is challenging and the expected trajectory of CPS 
may continue to erode the margins achieved by our remaining coal-fired plant. 
Community Energy Saving Programme (“CESP”)
In November 2014 we reached a settlement agreement with Ofgem regarding non-
compliance with our obligations under the Community Energy Saving Programme 
(“CESP”). The settlement requires us to contribute a total of £28 million, which will see 
up to £20 million benefit vulnerable energy consumers through a programme of work 
to be developed with the charity National Energy Action.
A further £5 million fine will be payable and £3 million delivered as further consumer 
redress measures.
The objective of CESP was to deliver energy saving measures to domestic energy 
users in specified low-income areas of Great Britain.
We voiced our concerns at the outset regarding the inclusion of independent 
generators in the scheme given their lack of experience in delivering the energy 
efficiency schemes requested and lack of any direct relationships with domestic 
electricity consumers.
For these reasons, we outsourced our obligation to a third party provider operating 
within the sector . Unfortunately , the chosen provider failed to deliver the obligation 
in full and, despite procuring additional measures, we did not comply with our 
obligations under the scheme by the end of the obligation period.
We have agreed a settlement with the third party for breach of contract in this regard, 
which will result in Drax receiving settlement of £5 million in cash and the third party 
delivering the consumer redress measures described above.
The net impact of these settlements to Drax is therefore a cash cost of £20 million 
which, as a material one-off item which is non-operational in nature, has been 
excluded from our underlying performance measures, including EBITDA, in line with 
previous policy .
Depreciation
Depreciation was £81 million for the year ended 31 December 2014, compared 
to £65 million in 2014. The commissioning of our biomass storage, handling and 
distribution systems at Drax Power Station late in 2013 drives the majority of this 
increase. As we progress our biomass transformation and the US supply chain 
investments come online in 2015, depreciation charges will continue to increase.
Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts
A key component of the Group’s risk management strategy , set out in more detail on 
pages 46 to 4 9, is the use of forward contracts to secure and de-risk the future cash 
flows of the business.
The Group uses forward contracts in two ways – forward purchases and sales of 
physical commodities to secure market level dark green and bark spreads on future 
sales and the use of financial contracts ( either currency exchange contracts or 
contracts underpinned by commodity prices which are settled financially , rather than 
by delivery of physical goods) to fix sterling cash flows.
As we progress our biomass transformation, we have entered into an extensive 
hedging programme to support our biomass procurement activities and secure the 
sterling cost of biomass. This has included forward contracts for the purchase of 
physical biomass, the use of financial products to fix variable elements of indexation – 
notably oil-linked – within these contracts, and foreign exchange contracts to secure 
the sterling cash flows. This programme covers all contracted and a substantial 
proportion of uncontracted but forecast purchases.
This programme, in conjunction with the established hedging strategy for our 
coal operations, provides a significant degree of protection from adverse market 
price movements. Drax Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2014

Operational and financial performance ( continued)
The accounting for these contracts is described in further detail in note 20 to the 
financial statements, but briefly , the unrealised gains and losses recognised in the 
income statement reflect changes in the fair value of forward commodity and 
financial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption or as hedges 
(from an accounting perspective, even though the contracts represent an economic 
hedge ) under International Financial Reporting Standards.
The fair value of a forward contract is primarily derived with reference to prevailing 
market prices at the start and end of the period. The location of the unrealised 
gains and losses arising on our portfolio of these contracts within the 2014 financial 
statements is summarised in the table below:

T otal net gains in hedge reserve (note 28) £100.4 million
T otal net gains in income statement (note 20) £65.8 million
*  Accounting treatment is determined by the availability of the own-use exemption or the hedge relationship being designated as and 
meeting the definition of an effective hedge under IFRS. Where neither of these items apply, unrealised gains and losses are recognised 
in the income statement.
Unrealised gains recognised in the income statement of £66 million this year 
(2013: unrealised losses of £110 million) principally reflect the strengthening US dollar , 
relative to sterling during the period, which improved the value of our contracted 
position relative to prevailing market rates. These gains were offset to an extent 
by unrealised losses on financial oil contracts, utilised in securing the element of 
biomass costs linked to oil price indices, as global oil prices fell significantly in the final 
quarter of the year .
In considering these movements it is important to recognise that profitability is 
driven by our strategy to deliver market level dark green and bark spreads, not by 
the absolute price of any single commodity at a given date. The unrealised gains 
and losses on forward contracts represent a subset of our total forward contracted 
position, driven by accounting regulations, and are not indicative of future financial 
performance. Accordingly we exclude these gains and losses from our key underlying 
performance measures.
Interest
Net finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2014 were £29 million compared 
to £23 million in 2013.
The £6 million increase in net finance costs reflects the additional costs associated 
with financing our biomass transformation. This includes interest on our borrowings 
which are described in further detail in the Liquidity and capital resources section on 
page 42. Drax Group plc

Sustainable business review Governance Financials Marketplace, performance and risk Overview
Profit before tax 
The profit before tax for 2014 is £166 million, compared to £32 million in the 
previous year .
The settlement of CESP , additional depreciation and interest charges have resulted in 
an incremental pre-tax charge of £ 4 1 million in 2014 ; however the increase in pre-tax 
profits has been driven by unrealised gains on derivative contracts of £66 million, 
compared to unrealised losses of £110 million last year .
Underlying profit before tax, which excludes the impact of unrealised gains 
and losses and the one-off effect of the CESP settlement in 2014, amounted to 
£120 million compared to £142 million in 2013. The £22 million reduction is primarily 
attributable to additional depreciation and interest charges.

T otal tax charge 37 .2 22.5 24.2 20.0
The 2014 tax charge of £37 million compares to a £20 million tax credit in 2013. 
The increase principally reflects the increase in profit before tax in 2014 versus 2013, 
which was driven primarily by the unrealised gains recognised in respect of derivative 
contracts (2013: unrealised losses). 
The 2013 tax credit included non-recurring tax credits of £22 million relating to 
reductions in UK corporation tax rates, and £7 million in respect of research and 
development claims agreed with HMRC.
The underlying effective rate of tax ( excluding the after tax impact of unrealised 
gains and losses on derivatives contracts and settlement of CESP , as described 
above ) is 20% in 2014, in line with the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 
as expected. The comparable underlying rate in 2013 was 0%, driven by the non-
recurring tax credits described above.
Cash taxes paid during the year were £16 million (2013: £18 million), principally 
reflecting lower underlying profit before tax. These payments were offset by tax 
refunds in settlement of prior years, bringing net taxes paid in 2014 to £14 million 
(2013: £11 million).
Profit after tax and earnings per share
Profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £129 million, compared to 
£51 million in 2013, driving basic earnings per share of 32 pence in 2014, compared to 
13 pence in 2013.
Underlying profit after tax, which strips out the impact of unrealised gains and 
losses on derivative contracts and the settlement of CESP in 2014, was £96 million 
(2013: £142 million) resulting in underlying earnings per share of 2 4 pence per share 
(2013: 35 pence per share ).
The reduction in underlying earnings per share in 2014 reflects the impact of 
increased depreciation, interest and tax charges described above. This is the basis for 
dividend distributions.

Liquidity and capital resources
Cash generated from operations
Cash generated from operations of 
£127 million in 2014, compared to 
£171 million in 2013, incorporates an 
increase in working capital of £84 million, 
driven primarily by rising biomass stocks. 
This was compounded by increased ROC 
and LEC assets of £ 45 million, following 
the conversion of our second biomass 
unit in the year . As noted above, the value 
of our ROCs and LECs generated is held 
in the balance sheet until the assets 
are sold to a third party – the timing of 
which is driven by RO deadlines and 
commercial considerations. This outflow 
was only partially offset by the inflows 
from reductions in carbon assets as our 
emissions decrease.
Net cash flows from operating activities
2014 taxes paid relate to settlement of 
the 2013 liability and 2014 payments on 
account, and are shown net of £2 million 
of refunds in relation to previous years. 
Such credits were greater in 2013, arising 
from the research and development 
claims agreed with HMRC, reducing 
overall tax payable in the prior period. 
As noted on page 41, our underlying 
tax charge for the 2014 was in line with 
standard rates of corporation tax in 
the UK.
Net cash used in investing activities
Purchases of property, plant and 
equipment of £200 million in 2014 
(2013: £302 million) are reflective of the 
significant amount of investment across 
the business as we continue to progress 
our biomass transformation. See more 
detail on page 43.
Net cash flows from financing activities
In order to support our biomass 
transformation we completed and drew 
down a further £100 million in loan 
facilities during 2014 (2013: £125 million), 
as described in Financing and cash 
flow management.
Net cash
From £287 million at 31 December 
2013 the decrease in cash and cash 
equivalents of £66 million during the year 
leaves cash and short -term investments 
of £221 million at 31 December 2014. 
Increased borrowings have been used to 
support cash generated from operations 
in funding the capital investment 
programme. As such net debt (after 
deducting borrowings) at 31 December 
2014 of £99 million compares to net cash 
of £71 million in 2013.

Sustainable business review Governance Financials Marketplace, performance and risk Overview
Financing and cash flow management
In May 201 4, we agreed a new private placement for £100 million with various funds 
managed by M&G Investments. This complements our existing term loan facilities 
secured in 2012 and 2013 and enhances the existing financing structure by providing 
additional liquidity to the Group and ensuring a smooth profile of debt maturities. 
Furthermore, the all-in cost of the new facility is very competitive.
The financing structure also incorporates the £75 million amortising term loan 
facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM T reasury under the 
Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme, agreed last year , a £50 million amortising term 
loan from the Green Investment Bank, a £100 million amortising term loan facility with 
the M&G UK Companies Financing Fund and a £ 400 million working capital and letter 
of credit facility . The term loans have varying maturity profiles ranging from 2017 to 
2025. As envisaged under the terms of the original agreement, the working capital 
and letter of credit facility has been extended for one year and is now due to mature 
in April 2017 .
In addition, a commodity trading facility allows us to transact prescribed volumes 
of commodity trades at attractive prices without the requirement to post collateral. 
This facility continues to operate well, offering trading counterparties uncapped 
access to the security package available to our senior lenders.
Overall, the financing structure is a key component of the steps we have taken over 
the past few years to restructure our business, financing and trading arrangements 
to enable Drax to both invest to strengthen and secure the potential of the business, 
whilst being able to operate comfortably at a sub-investment grade level.
ROCs and LECs earned from renewable generation can drive significant working 
capital absorption, with the associated cash income typically received up to 12 months 
after burning the associated biomass. At the end of 2013 we executed an £80 million 
ROC monetisation agreement with Lloyds Bank Commercial Finance Ltd, expanding 
our capability to enhance cash flows by selling ROC receivables. The agreement has 
been utilised during the year to accelerate over £50 million of cash from ROC sales 
to third parties. We have recently concluded further similar agreements with HSBC 
and Lloyds, taking the total of ROC monetisation agreements in place to £200 million. 
We continue to explore ways to further enhance our ROC cash flows.
Capital expenditure
Fixed asset additions were £201 million in the year ended 3 1 December 201 4, compared 
to £286 million in 2013. This includes £125 million on our biomass transformation 
project (2013 : £228 million), which is now mostly focused on our US developments 
following the commissioning of the on-site facilities at Drax Power Station in late 2013.
T otal capital expenditure to date on the biomass transformation project, with two 
units complete, necessary supporting infrastructure in place and significant progress 
with the two US pellet plants and port facility , amounts to approximately £550 million. 
We expect to spend a further £130 million over the period to 2017 concluding these 
projects and ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Industrial Emissions 
Directive (IED ), bringing total development expenditure to £ 6 50-£700 million, in line 
with our original guidance.
Our lead case investment for IED compliance remains unchanged, incorporating the 
implementation of low nitrogen oxide burners and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction 
technology across all units.
At Drax Power Station, the on-site infrastructure and systems that underpin our 
transformation strategy are now in place and provide us with the ability to unload rail 
wagons efficiently , store up to 300 thousand tonnes of biomass on-site and deliver it 
directly to the combustion systems of converted units.
In the US, our port facility is now “pellet -ready” and both pellet plants have entered a 
commissioning phase. We continue to expect commercial operations at our first pellet 
plant in the first quarter of 201 5, with commercial operations at the second pellet plant 
following in the second quarter . Both plants are expected to reach full capacity six 
months later .

Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect future 
developments, performance and position including principal risks and uncertainties 
are set out in the Chief Executive’s statement, this Operational and financial 
performance review and the Principal risks and uncertainties section which follows. 
Our cash flows and borrowing facilities are described above. In addition, notes 20 
to 22 to the consolidated financial statements explain our approach to capital risk 
management and give details of financial instruments and hedging activities, and 
exposure to credit, counterparty and liquidity risk.
We have significant headroom in our banking facilities, a recent history of cash 
generation, strong covenant compliance, and good visibility in near -term forecasts, 
due to our progressive hedging strategy . Our Business Plan takes account of our 
capital investment plans and reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
including sensitivity analysis on downside scenarios. The Plan demonstrates that we 
expect to be able to operate within the level of our current banking facilities over the 
period under review.
Accordingly , the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, 
and continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing these 
financial statements.

Seasonality of borrowing
Our business is seasonal with higher electricity prices and despatch in the Winter 
period and lower despatch in the Summer months, when prices are lower and plant 
availability is affected by planned outages.
Accordingly , cash flow during the Summer months is materially reduced due to the 
combined effect of lower prices and output, while maintenance expenditures are 
increased during this period due to major planned outages. The Group’s £ 400 million 
working capital and letter of credit facility assists in managing the cash low points in 
the cycle where required (see Financing and cash flow management).
Future developments
The market outlook for 2015 remains challenging. We will continue to see the erosion 
of dark green spreads as the cost of carbon increases following the CPS trajectory 
set by government. Our dark green spreads will also be impacted by changes to gas 
and power prices, which remain uncertain. Lower power prices will also impact bark 
spreads, where the fuel price is less variable and will not fall in line with revenues 
received. The timing of our hedges provides protection for a limited period, following 
which any persisting market weakness will impact our future financial results.
We remain committed to our strategy to convert three units to biomass with the 
funding platform already in place to deliver this. Our capital expenditure projects 
to support this ambition remain on schedule and on budget and are set to deliver 
a stronger , more robust business. In 2016 we will have converted three units to 
biomass, providing cost -effective, low carbon renewable energy .
As noted in the Chief Executive’s statement, two of our coal generating units were 
successful in the first capacity market auction in December 2014, with capacity 
payments expected to commence in 2018.
The White Rose CCS project is now half way through its feasibility study , which is 
on schedule to complete towards the end of 2015. Drax has committed to provide 
a further £1 million of funding over this period.

Distributions
Distribution policy
The Board has committed to distribute 50% of underlying earnings (being profit 
attributable to equity shareholders adjusted to exclude the after -tax impact of 
unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and the one-off CESP settlement 
in 2014 ) in each year . Underlying earnings for the year ended 31 December 2014 were 
£96 million.
Dividends paid
On 17 February 2014, the Board resolved, subject to approval by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting (“ AGM”) on 23 April 2014, to pay a final dividend for the year 
ended 31 December 2013 of 8. 9 pence per share (£36 million). The final dividend was 
paid on 16 May 2014.
On 28 July 2014, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months 
ending 30 June 2014 of 4.7 pence per share (£19 million), representing 50% of 
underlying earnings for the period. The interim dividend was paid on 10 October 2014.

A structured approach 
to risk management
The effective management of risks within the Group  
underpins the delivery of our key priorities.
The Group has a comprehensive 
system of governance controls in place 
to manage risks. Policies have been 
established in key areas of the business 
such as trading, treasury , production 
and health and safety to ensure that 
these risks are managed in a controlled 
manner and in accordance with the 
policies set by the Board.
Internal control and 
risk management 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. A process 
has been established for identifying, 
evaluating, determining risk appetite 
and managing the significant risks faced 
by the Group and this has been in place 
for the year under review up to the date 
of approval of the 2014 Annual report 
and accounts. 
The process is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives, and 
can only provide reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Risk management committees
The Group Risk Management Committee 
is responsible for monitoring the risk 
management process on a Group 
wide basis. It assists the business risk 
management committees in risk analysis 
and identification of best practice, and 
provides additional assurance on the 
risk control environment to the Audit 
Committee and the Board. 
During the year there was incremental 
enhancement of the structure as our 
operations develop and to improve risk 
optimisation across the Group.
There are six business risk 
management committees:
1 T reasury and commodity risk 
management committee
2 Safety , health, environmental and 
production integrity committee
3 Regulation and strategy risk 
management committee
4 Corporate services risk 
management committee
5 Haven Power risk 
management committee
6 Drax Biomass USA risk 
management committee
Each Committee is responsible for 
ensuring that all risks associated with 
its specific area of the business are 
identified, analysed and managed 
systematically and appropriately . 
Each Committee has terms of reference 
that require systems and controls 
to be approved, implemented and 
monitored in order to ensure that 
activities are commensurate with the 
risk appetite established by the Board, 
are adequately resourced and comply 
with applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements. Each risk committee 
contains at least one member of the 
Executive Committee.

Risk management process
The key elements of the risk 
management process are as follows:
Risk identification – risks faced by 
the Group are identified during the 
formulation of the Business Plan. 
Senior management and risk owners, 
with the assistance of the risk 
management committees, periodically 
review the risks to ensure that the risk 
management processes and controls in 
their area are appropriate and effective, 
and that new risks are identified.
Risk analysis – the basic causes of each 
risk are considered, and the impact and 
likelihood of it materialising is assessed. 
Risk registers are used to document 
the risks identified, level of severity and 
probability , ownership and mitigation 
measures for each risk. The risk registers 
are reviewed by the risk management 
committees on at least a quarterly basis.
Risks are then logged with reference 
to impact and probability as follows:
Probability
Low Medium High
Impact
Low Medium High
Risk appetite is identified by reference 
to the same criteria. The analysis enables 
decisions to be taken as to how that 
risk should be managed by applying 
mitigation measures to align the 
risk with the identified risk appetite.
Risk monitoring and assurance – 
the Board is ultimately responsible for 
this system of risk management and 
internal control. The Audit Committee 
reviews the suitability and effectiveness 
of risk management processes and 
controls on behalf of the Board. 
Risk management committees assist the 
executive directors in the operation and 
implementation of the risk management 
process, and provide a source of 
assurance to the Audit Committee that 
the process is operating effectively . 
Internal control
In addition, the Group has a 
comprehensive and well-defined 
internal control system with clear 
structures, delegated authority levels 
and accountabilities. 
The Group has a system of planning 
and monitoring, which incorporates 
Board approval of a rolling five-year 
Business Plan and approval of operating 
and capital expenditure budgets. 
Performance against the budget is 
subsequently monitored and reported to 
the Board on a monthly basis. The Board 
also receives monthly reports on 
trading risk exposure as compared to 
the pre-set limits, and monitors overall 
Group performance against a Scorecard 
which shows progress against a set of 
financial, operating, safety and other 
targets set at the start of the year . 
Performance is reported formally to 
shareholders through the publication of 
Group results. Operational management 
makes frequent reports on performance 
to the executive directors.
The Group also has processes in 
place for business continuity and 
emergency planning.
Through the Audit Committee, the 
Board has implemented a programme 
of internal audit reviews of different 
aspects of the Group’s activities. 
The programme, which is reviewed and 
updated annually , is designed so that, 
over time, all facets of the business 
are reviewed to ensure appropriate 
systems of control are in place and are 
working effectively or , where they are 
not, deficiencies are rectified by timely 
and appropriate action. In agreeing 
the actions to be taken in response to 
each report, the aim is always to embed 
internal controls, including measures 
intended effectively to identify and 
manage risk, within each area of the 
Group’s operations. In parallel with its 
work in relation to internal audit, the 
Audit Committee also satisfies itself 
that an action plan, for dealing with 
points raised by the external auditor in 
their yearly management letter is being 
properly addressed by management.
With the assistance of the Audit 
Committee, the Board has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the system of internal 
control. It has reviewed the reports of the 
Audit Committee, which has considered 
all significant aspects of internal control 
including financial, operational, trading, 
compliance, social, environmental and 
ethical risks in accordance with the 
“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors 
on the UK Corporate Governance Code” .
Following its review, the Board 
determined that it was not aware 
of any significant deficiency or 
material weakness in the system 
of internal control. Commodity market price risk

Principal risks and uncertainties ( continued)
Context
The commodity markets in which 
we trade are inherently volatile, and 
generation remunerated through 
the Renewables Obligation increases 
the risk in relation to the ROC market.
Risk
 , We are exposed to the effect of fluctuations 
in commodity prices, particularly the price 
of electricity and gas, the price of coal and 
sustainable biomass (and other fuels), the price 
of CO2 emissions allowances and the market 
price of ROCs.
Potential impact
 , Low dark green or bark spreads 
resulting in lower margins and reduced 
financial performance.
 , Volatility in financial results.
Associated key priorities
Maximise the value of the Drax business
Context
Continued uncertainty in the global 
economy and cautious economic 
growth potentially impact on the 
financial strength of our counterparties.
Risk
 , We rely on third party suppliers for the 
delivery of fuel and other goods and services. 
We purchase a significant quantity of our fuel 
under contracts with a number of large UK and 
international suppliers, so are exposed to the 
risk of non-performance by these suppliers.
 , We enter into fixed price and fixed margin 
contracts for the sale of electricity to a number 
of counterparties, including non-domestic 
consumers via our retail business, so are 
exposed to the risk of failure of one or more 
of these counterparties.
Potential impact
 , Additional costs associated with securing 
fuel and other goods and services from 
other suppliers.
 , Failure to secure fuel from other suppliers 
resulting in limitation of operations.
 , Adverse effect on cash flow and earnings 
arising from the failure of one or more of the 
counterparties to whom we sell power .
Associated key priorities
Maximise the value of the Group
Examples of mitigating activities
 , Well-understood progressive hedging 
strategy with forward power and ROC sales 
combined with corresponding purchases 
of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when 
profitable and appropriate to do so.
 , Applications for conversions under the CfD 
regime which, if approved, remove potential 
income volatility associated with those units.
Examples of mitigating activities
 , Diversified fuel supply in terms of source 
and counterparties.
 , Diversified logistics routes.
 , T arget to optimise holding of fuel stocks.
 , Close monitoring and reporting of 
concentration risk in suppliers and 
power counterparties.
 , Full suite of power counterparties with 
strong credit ratings.
 , Power trading contracts generally include 
provisions that force counterparties to post 
collateral where their credit rating drops, 
subject to certain restrictions.
 , Close monitoring and reporting of potential 
credit and collateral risk.
Context
The government’s market reform 
agenda is driven predominantly 
by the need to move to a sustainable, 
low carbon energy sector which delivers 
affordable supplies to customers whilst 
maintaining security of supply over 
the longer term. Laws and regulations 
are many and complex, are frequently 
changing, and becoming ever more 
stringent, particularly in relation 
to environmental matters.
Risk
 , Changes to the current renewable support 
regime could adversely impact our 
biomass strategy.
 , Renewable support regime expires in 2027 .
 , Further financial disincentives such as the 
CPS mechanism, could further erode the 
competitiveness of coal-fired plant.
 , The EU, UK and local environmental and 
health and safety laws and regulations 
affect our operations including limits on 
emissions to air and water, noise, soil/
groundwater contamination, waste, and health 
and safety standards.
Potential impact
 , Less funding available for plant retrofit/
investment costs to meet increasingly stringent 
environmental requirements.
 , Lower load factors/generation levels.
 , Adverse effect on financial results 
and cash flows.
Associated key priorities
Deliver our biomass strategy
Drive Group operational excellence
Examples of mitigating activities
 , Briefing, representation and engagement 
at EU and UK level.
 , Development of abatement and alternative 
generation options.
 , Apply for conversions under the CfD 
regime and grandfathered ROC regime to 
provide increased certainty over future 
revenue streams.
 , Continue to promote and lobby the benefits 
of biomass, seek to secure support beyond 
current regime window.
 , Pricing of biomass contracts to allow for 
adverse commodity market movements.
 , Regular third party assurance over 
system effectiveness.
 , Strong safety culture and related training. Power and renewables market liquidity risk

Sustainable business review Financials Governance Marketplace, performance and risk Overview
Context
Liquidity in the power and ROC markets 
is dependent on there being a sufficient 
number of counterparties willing to 
trade actively .
Risk
 , The market structure and consolidation of 
the existing generation and supply businesses 
in the UK could result in a reduction in the 
number of active participants in the market 
with whom we are able to trade power and 
other commodities, including ROCs.
Potential impact
 , Inability to hedge short to medium-term 
exposure to electricity prices through 
wholesale market trading.
 , Increased exposure to short -term 
market volatility.
 , Inability to sell all of our electricity output, 
or ROCs.
 , Lower revenues and increased costs to achieve 
trading objectives.
 , Adverse effect on financial results 
and cash flows.
Associated key priorities
Grow our retail business
Maximise the value of the Group
Deliver our biomass strategy
Examples of mitigating activities
 , Grow direct sales through Haven Power, 
our electricity supply business.
 , Initiatives to be active and responsive make 
Drax an attractive business partner .
 , Oppose structural changes that impact 
our market access, such as clearing 
and margining.
 , Work with other independent generators 
(via Independent Generators Group) to 
achieve positive market and regulatory 
changes to improve liquidity.
 , Secure longer -term structured deals when 
profitable to do so.
 , Application for conversions under the 
CfD regime which, if approved, reduce our 
reliance on the liquidity of the ROC market.
Context
The biomass market is developing 
and investment in the supply chain 
is required.
Risk
 , We could fail to secure sustainable biomass 
supplies and/or logistics arrangements 
which meet our hurdle return rates and 
operational requirements.
 , Most of the sustainable biomass that we can 
procure is priced in foreign currency which 
increases our exposure to fluctuations against 
sterling and poses a risk to profitability.
Potential impact
 , Inability to progress the biomass 
growth strategy. 
 , Adverse effect on financial results 
and cash flows.
Associated key priorities
Deliver our biomass strategy
Context
Maintaining plant integrity is critical to 
securing stable and safe operation.
Risk
 , Plant failure may be caused by the 
underperformance or outright failure of plant, 
transmission assets or other equipment and 
components including the IT systems used to 
operate the plant or conduct trading activities. 
The duration of the resultant forced outages is 
influenced by the lead time to manufacture and 
procure replacement components and to carry 
out repairs.
 , As we progress our plans to convert to a 
predominantly biomass-fuelled generator, we 
are exposed to a broader range, and increased 
level, of technical risk. Whilst successful first 
conversion of a unit to biomass has been 
achieved, further units are planned.
 , Good progress has been made on our US 
investments however, project execution 
risk remains.
Potential impact
 , Personnel injury.
 , Lower revenues.
 , Increased costs and contractual penalties.
 , Adverse effect on financial results 
and cash flows.
Associated key priorities
Drive Group operational excellence
Deliver excellent people leadership 
across our operations
Examples of mitigating activities
 , Contract with suppliers where a robust 
operational plant and logistics infrastructure 
is already in place; work with new suppliers 
to help develop such infrastructure.
 , Invest in the supply chain whilst in its infancy 
to ensure security and timing of supplies.
 , Hedge currency exposures or secure 
contracts in sterling to the extent that it 
is appropriate.
Examples of mitigating activities
 , Comprehensive risk-based plant investment 
and maintenance programme.
 , Maintaining a trained and 
competent workforce.
 , Strong health and safety culture.
 , T arget to optimise holding of spare 
components for use in the event of plant 
failure, particularly long lead time items.
 , Business continuity plan for IT systems.
 , Ensure adequate insurance in place to cover 
losses from plant failure where possible.
 , Significant amounts of research and 
development work have been undertaken 
in terms of handling and burning biomass. Drax Group plc

The Board establishes the policies in 
respect of sustainable development, 
such as our business conduct, 
environmental, and health and safety 
programmes. The Board’s policies are 
implemented by dedicated specialists 
who make sure effective processes 
and procedures are in place to assure 
compliance and to identify and to report 
on risks and opportunities.
As in previous years we have continued 
to invest, not only to comply with 
environmental and health and safety 
requirements, but, where practicable, 
to go further . In 2014, we retained our 
presence in the FTSE4Good Index 
Series, which is designed to measure 
the performance of companies that 
meet globally recognised corporate 
responsibility standards and facilitate 
investment in those companies.
Materiality
Given the diversity of our stakeholders 
there are a wide range of topics and 
performance measures on which we 
could report. In determining which to 
report we consider their materiality in 
terms of their relevance to the Company 
and their importance to stakeholders.
Throughout this Annual report and 
accounts we aim to report on topics and 
performance measures that represent 
our significant environmental, social 
and economic impacts and those 
that would substantively influence 
the assessments and decisions of 
stakeholders. Further sustainability 
reporting is available on our website at:

Sustainable business review
Our approach to a 
sustainable business
We have a major role to play in helping to 
protect and enhance the environment. 
This is in line with the wider goals of 
sustainable development. Our approach 
contributes to a sustainable, low carbon 
economy and offers opportunities for 
economic growth and job creation. 
We operate our business within a 
framework of increasingly stringent and 
challenging legislative and regulatory 
requirements. We are, however , mindful 
of the still tougher expectations of 
our wider stakeholder group. For us, a 
sustainable business is about achieving 
a balance between the commercial 
and regulatory rigours of a competitive 
market and operating responsibly .
Committed to 
sustainability
Sustainability underpins all that we do and the future of 
our business encompasses all three aspects of sustainable 
development – environmental, social and economic.

Marketplace, performance and risk Governance Financials Sustainable business review Overview
T owards a low 
carbon economy
We have an important role to play in 
the transition of the UK towards a low 
carbon economy whilst maintaining 
secure and affordable supplies of 
electricity . For us, a sustainable business 
principally implies delivering on our 
strategic carbon abatement initiative 
to generate increasing amounts of 
electricity from sustainable biomass in 
place of coal.
During 2014, significant progress was 
made on executing our plan to transform 
the business into a predominantly 
biomass-fuelled generator . 
We converted our second generating 
unit to burn sustainable biomass in place 
of coal at the beginning of October . 
Through increasing the amount of 
sustainable biomass burnt in place of 
coal we are significantly reducing our 
carbon footprint. 
Our electricity supply business, Haven 
Power , has been successful in selling the 
increased output of renewable power 
generated from our biomass conversion 
to our customers. Renewable power 
sales are exempt from the Climate 
Change Levy and even after our price 
premium many customers can make 
savings whilst enjoying the benefits of 
power from sustainable biomass.
In partnership with Alstom UK Limited 
and BOC ( a member of the Linde Group ) 
and in association with National Grid, we 
are involved in a Front End Engineering 
and Design (“FEED”) study to develop 
an oxy-fuel carbon capture and storage 
(“CCS”) power plant of up to 448MWe 
(gross) at the Drax Power Station site 
with supporting transportation and 
storage infrastructure. The project is 
dependent on technical and commercial 
viability , external funding and 
appropriate regulatory support. T o that 
end we are participating in UK and EU 
funded programmes for CCS. 
Environmental performance 
and compliance
Environmental compliance of our power 
station and associated landfill site is 
managed through an environmental 
management system. This system is 
externally certified to the international 
standard ISO 14001 and is subject to 
external audit twice a year .
There were no major breaches of our 
environmental consents during 2014.
Emissions to air
In accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 we set out our carbon reporting 
information for direct emissions 
(“Scope 1”) from activities such as 
fuel combustion and processing, and 
indirect emissions (“Scope 2”) being 
the equivalent emissions created 
by the generation of the electricity , 
heat or steam we purchase. Scope 1 
for Drax covers the emissions arising 
from burning fossil fuels, namely 
coal, to generate electricity and the 
operation of some of our plant at the 
power station, for example, our flue gas 
desulphurisation system. The Group’s 
Scope 2 emissions arise mainly from 
electricity purchased to run operations 
across our various sites.
We are also required to disclose 
emissions from biologically sequestered 
carbon, which include emissions 
released through burning biomass to 
generate electricity . 
Through implementing our strategy 
to become a predominantly biomass-
fuelled generator we aim to reduce 
our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. As a 
result there will be a rise in biologically 
sequestered carbon emissions. 
We collate data on our carbon dioxide 
emissions from fuel combustion as 
part of our measurement and reporting 
plan under the EU ETS. This includes all 
Scope 1 and the biologically sequestered 
carbon figures. For Scope 2 reporting 
we use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, 
A Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (revised edition) and the 
government’s published greenhouse gas 
conversion factors to determine the level 
of carbon dioxide emissions.

Sustainable business review ( continued)
Beyond carbon dioxide we manage 
all our emissions effectively and have 
maintained high levels of investment 
in flue gas desulphurisation and 
combustion control systems to ensure 
compliance with environmental limits. 
All emissions in 2014 were within the 
limits set by the Environment Agency .
T rials were undertaken in 2014 to 
develop the lead solution to comply 
with the emission limits which will be in 
force beyond 2016 under the Industrial 
Emissions Directive.

Sulphur dioxide 23.8 31.7 35. 1
Nitrogen oxides 35.5 39.2 39.2
Dust 0.9 0.8 0.8
Discharges to water
Water is a key resource to Drax Power 
Station with the great majority of the 
cooling water abstracted from the River 
Ouse. Other minor sources include the 
Sherwood Sandstone Aquifer and the 
town’s mains. Procedures are in place to 
manage and monitor the drainage and 
water systems on-site so as to ensure 
all discharge consent limits are met. 
Water abstraction (Mt) 2014 2013 2012
River Ouse water 62.5 56.9 56.7
Mains water 0.4 0.3 0.2
Borehole water 1.7 1.9 1.8
The majority of our emissions arise 
through the combustion of fossil 
fuel for generating electricity . As this 
single figure can shadow smaller , but 
still important trends, we have set a 
materiality threshold of 100 thousand 
tonnes, equivalent to approximately 
0.5% of the reporting year’s emissions, 
to ensure we strike the right balance 
between demonstrating important 
trends and limiting data to a 
meaningful level.
Carbon dioxide emissions, calculated 
under the EU ETS, as a ratio of electricity 
generated, before deductions for that 
used on-site, is a principal performance 
indicator for the Group. This metric 
has also been selected for mandatory 
carbon reporting.

Disposals to land
We have continued to invest in site 
infrastructure to maximise the sale 
of ash products into the construction 
industry and to reduce the disposal 
of surplus ash to landfill. In 2014, ash 
was sold in conformity with European 
construction product standards and in 
compliance with the Pulverised Fuel Ash 
Quality Protocol.
This has helped us to sell over 85% of the 
1. 1 million tonnes of ash produced in 2014 
as replacement for virgin aggregates and 
as a cement replacement product.
Any unsold ash is sent to the power 
station’s ash disposal site, Barlow Mound. 
The completed area of the site has 
been fully restored for use as farmland 
and woodland.
We pay landfill tax on the ash disposed 
of to the site. Through the Landfill 
Communities Fund, we are able to 
claim a tax credit for our donations 
to recognised Environmental Bodies. 
We have worked with Groundwork 
North Y orkshire since 2001 on projects 
designed to help mitigate the effects 
of landfill upon our local community . 
During 2014, we contributed £23,305 
towards local community-based projects 
designed to bring about sustainable 
environmental benefits and contribute 
to the social and economic regeneration 
of the area.
We continue to manage waste from 
our operations in a responsible manner . 
In 2014, we diverted 96% of non-ash 
waste from landfill.
We have worked with Groundwork North 
Y orkshire since 2001 on community-based

statutory requirements are viewed 
as a minimum standard and leading

Following the weaker performance at 
our US construction sites last year , we 
are working hard to drive improvements 
to meet the standards set by our UK 
operations. Despite seeing some 
improvement during 2014, we were 
deeply saddened by the fatal injury 
sustained by an employee of a sub-
contractor working in an area under the 
day-to-day supervision of a contractor .
In the UK , where our safety performance 
is industry-leading, we have continued to 
undertake a significant amount of project 
work. This work was completed without 
a worse than first aid injury . For outages 
alone, we have now completed over 
1.3 million hours of work without injury .
Attaining leading performance
The lost time injury rate and total 
recordable injury rate for 2014 were 
0. 06 and 0.33 respectively compared to 
0. 09 and 0.29 in 2013. This performance 
was achieved against a backdrop of 
significant construction activity; one-
third of the 7 .2 million hours worked 
across the Group was in higher risk 
construction activities. Our safety record 
continues to compare very favourably 
with that of our sector peers and 
international benchmarks. 
We have retained certification of our 
Health and Safety Management System 
to the internationally recognised 
Occupational Health and Safety standard, 
OHSAS 18001, at the Drax Power Station 
site and for our biomass pellet plant, 
based at Goole in the East Riding of 
Y orkshire. The standard is approved by 
Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance.
In addition to this, Drax Power Station was 
once again awarded the Royal Society for 
the Prevention of Accidents Gold Medal 
Award. Having achieved the Gold Medal 
Award for ten consecutive years, this year 
Drax was awarded the President’s Award 
for outstanding performance in health 
and safety at work. 
Safety leadership and recognition
We are constantly striving to improve the 
critical safety leadership contribution 
required from first line supervisors. 
The expectations of both management 
and supervisors continue to be 
reaffirmed in the Safety Leadership 
Charter , which is based on the Health and 
Safety Executive’s approach to achieving 
a balance between the systems and 
behavioural aspects of management, 
treating health and safety management 
as an integral part of good management 
generally , rather than as a stand-
alone system.
A Health and Safety Advisory 
Committee, which brings together 
a range of employees, including 
trade union representatives, safety 
representatives, occupational health and 
management team members, continues 
to play a vital role in facilitating staff 
consultation on health and safety issues, 
and driving standards upwards.
Our active involvement with the 
programmes of our trade body , Energy 
UK, and the Coal Generators Forum 
continues to provide new ideas and a 
stimulus to drive our health and safety 
improvement efforts forward.
Health and wellbeing
We are committed to promoting 
the health and wellbeing of all our 
staff and ensuring a professional 
response to first aid and emergency 
situations should any occur . We have 
occupational health policies in place 
which address industrial disease risks, 
and our occupational health team 
undertakes regular programmes to 
screen colleagues in accordance with 
risk, exposure and Health and Safety 
Executive requirements. 
Our people
We are committed to developing 
a positive health and safety culture.

Health and wellbeing-based 
programmes and initiatives are 
run throughout the Group to raise 
awareness and promote a healthy

safety programmes. 
Employees
Employment
The Group employed 1,383 people at the 
year end, an increase of 103 people, or 
8%. The pie charts on page 55 provide 
a breakdown of headcount across 
the Group’s businesses. Most of our 
employees work full-time and are on 
permanent contracts.
At Drax Power Limited the annual 
staff turnover rate in 2014 was 6. 4%, 
which included a significant number 
of retirements. Haven Power’s annual 
staff turnover rate was 39%, reflecting 
some structural changes in the business. 
At Drax Biomass, the annualised 
turnover rate was 23%, including those 
staff who opted not to relocate to the 
new head office in Atlanta, Georgia.
Gender split both across the Group 
and the senior management team is 
illustrated in the pie charts on page 55. 
The Board’s policy on diversity is given in 
the Nominations Committee report on 
page 77 .
Employee engagement
Some 4 1% of the Group’s workforce is 
covered by collective bargaining, and 
for the remainder who are employed 
on individual employment contracts 
we have representative employee 
consultation and information 
arrangements in place in our UK 
businesses, with plans to introduce 
similar arrangements in the US when 
the plants become operational. In 2015, 
we will conduct our first Group-wide 
engagement survey , designed and run 
in conjunction with T owers Watson. 
The survey will include measures 
of leadership, communications 
and involvement.
We use a variety of communication 
channels to ensure that all colleagues 
are kept fully informed of developments 
in the Group’s operations and provided 
with the opportunity to give feedback.
Employee policies and relations
We have a suite of policies designed to 
support our people at work, including 
those to assist, where appropriate, a 
variety of work/lifestyle preferences, 
procedures for raising grievance or 
safety concerns, and diversity and 
inclusion in the workplace. We make 
every effort to provide long-term 
employment security and we maintain 
high standards in employment practices. 
Learning and development
Our personal and career development 
processes across the Group are designed 
to equip all our people with the technical 
skills, management and leadership 
competences, and personal behaviours 
needed to achieve our Business 
Plan. All employees receive annual 
performance and development reviews. 
Each year , Drax Power Limited 
recruits for the four -year apprentice 
training programme covering power 
station operations and engineering 
maintenance. In 2014, we took 
on eight apprentices across the 
three engineering disciplines of 
mechanical, electrical, and control 
and instrumentation.
Out of the 15 graduates who had 
commenced a two-year programme 
in September 2013, ten are now in 
substantive posts, four have left 
the business, and one is in his final 
placement rotation. 
We have a structured process of 
succession planning for senior roles 
with a specific career management 
discussion integrated within the existing 
appraisal process. The process identifies 
succession potential and gaps, which 
in turn inform individual development/
recruitment planning. Increasingly we 
look to identify cross-Group moves to 
accelerate development and improve 
the future leadership pipeline. In 2015, 
we will pilot a UK -wide leadership 
development programme with a view 
to extending this Group-wide in 2016.
Reward and recognition
We benchmark our reward packages at 
every level in the organisation against 
the industry sector and the market as a 
whole, nationally or locally , as appropriate 
to the role. We also participate in 
specialist industry meetings to exchange 
information and developments in 
employment policy .
Through a range of share plans we 
encourage all UK employees to build a 
personal stake in the ownership of the 
business. In 2015, we plan to extend the 
opportunity to our US colleagues.
In 2014, we took on eight apprentices across 
three engineering disciplines.

Engaging with our 
stakeholders
Like most businesses, our stakeholders 
are many and diverse, including our 
shareholders, employees, customers, 
energy consultants, suppliers, the 
local community , government, non-
governmental organisations, regulators, 
opinion formers and the media. 
Communication with all our stakeholders 
is considered to be an essential part of 
our business and we aim to be open and 
transparent in all that we do.
Business conduct
We are committed to high ethical 
standards and to conducting our 
business with honesty , integrity and in 
accordance with applicable laws and 
regulations. Honesty and integrity not 
only underpin how we do business, but 
how we expect our customers, suppliers, 
agents, partners, contractors and 
consultants to do business, whether in 
the UK, US or beyond. 
In order to prevent bribery and 
corruption we take responsibility for 
maintaining a culture within the Group 
in which bribery is never acceptable. 
In protecting fundamental human 
rights, Drax does not tolerate the use 
of underage workers or any concept of 
forced labour , at the same time ensuring 
our suppliers’ activities have a minimal 
impact on the environment and local 
communities. Any supplier found to be 
complicit in a breach of such standards, 
either directly or indirectly , will be barred 
from further participation in our supply 
chain activities.
The Group’s Code of Business Ethics 
establishes the rules and framework 
on which employees should base 
their decision making. Employees are 
expected to follow not only the letter 
of the Code, but the spirit.
The Group’s whistleblowing policy 
provides a confidential means for our 
employees to speak up with confidence. 
The policy provides guidance on how 
to make a disclosure of information, 
in good faith, relating to safety , fraud 
or other illegal or unethical conduct 
that they may have witnessed or are 
concerned about.

Sustainable business review ( continued)
The Group appreciates that public 
policy on taxation and the external tax 
environment are constantly evolving and 
this is reflected in our tax strategy . 
The Group has a comprehensive 
structure of governance and controls in 
place to manage tax risk in accordance 
with the Group’s risk management 
framework, and this is closely 
monitored by the Head of T ax, Audit 
Committee and internal audit functions. 
Drax is committed to maintaining a 
good relationship with HMRC and 
other tax authorities, and to be pro-
active, collaborative and transparent 
in compliance and to paying our fair 
share of tax. The Group interprets and 
applies relevant tax laws in a reasonable 
way and in the spirit of that intended 
by tax legislators, consistent with 
this approach. 
Recognising public perception of any 
links to low tax jurisdictions, the Group 
commenced a process to cut the legacy 
ties it inherited from its previous owners 
by removing several Cayman and Jersey 
incorporated companies from the 
Group. Whilst all such companies have 
always been UK tax resident and paid 
UK tax on all gains and losses arising, 
we recognise that such links create 
an adverse impression of the Group’s 
approach to managing its tax affairs. 
Since then progress has been made 
with four companies being formally 
placed into liquidation and formally 
dissolved. Our next goal is to eliminate 
the remaining Cayman company in the 
Group and we anticipate taking similar 
steps once the tax losses it holds have 
been fully utilised. 
In 2014, the Group made a significant 
contribution to local and national 
communities in which it operates, with 
paid taxes in excess of £200 million, 
comprising taxes on profit, labour 
and payroll taxes, taxes on burning 
fossil fuels, and environmental taxes 
(but excluding VA T).
Supply chain
Non-fuel procurement
We take a balanced approach to our 
supply chain and we look to use suppliers 
and working partners from diverse 
backgrounds, in particular , small and 
medium-sized suppliers in the local 
community where possible.
Recognising that prompt payment is 
critical to the cash flow of our suppliers, 
particularly the smaller ones, we have 
signed up to the Prompt Payment 
Code. As a signatory to the Code we 
are committed to paying our suppliers 
according to clearly defined terms 
and conditions.
Sustainability is an essential element of 
good procurement practice and takes 
account of wider social, economic and 
environmental factors in addition to the 
conventional criteria of price, quality 
and service. By applying these wider 
principles our procurement practices 
go beyond meeting simple tender 
requirements to delivering improved 
value and real cost savings throughout 
the supply chain. 
Coal procurement
We buy coal from a range of sources 
with the objectives of managing our 
commercial exposures, environmental 
obligations and diversity of supply . 
In 2014, 38% of the coal we burnt came 
from UK deep and surface mines with 
the remainder coming from major supply 
basins around the world, including the 
US, Colombia and Russia.
When buying from overseas we have 
continued to require, through our 
contracts, minimum standards with 
suppliers in respect of compliance 
with legislation, human rights, labour 
relations and health and safety 
arrangements. Our supply chain is fully 
informed of Drax’s Code of Business 
Ethics. In order to support our focus on 
responsible procurement, we continue 
our membership of Bettercoal, a not -
for -profit organisation that promotes 
continuous improvement in corporate 
responsibility in the coal supply chain.
Biomass sustainability and procurement
It is a prerequisite that all our biomass 
must be purchased from sustainable 
sources. T o ensure this we have 
implemented a sustainability policy 
which embeds comprehensive criteria 
into our procurement activities. 
Our Biomass Sustainability Management 
System ensures commitment to 
our policy .
We are leading the introduction of 
credible sustainability standards 
into biomass procurement activities. 
Our procurement process is designed to 
ensure that the production and delivery 
of biomass will:
 , Significantly reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions compared to coal-
fired generation.
 , Not result in a net release of carbon 
from the vegetation and soil of either 
forests or agricultural lands.
 , Not endanger food supply or 
communities where the use of 
biomass is essential for subsistence 
(for example heat, medicines, 
building materials).
 , Not adversely affect protected 
or vulnerable biodiversity and, 
where possible, give preference 
to biomass production that 
strengthens biodiversity .
 , Deploy good practices to protect and/
or improve soil, water (both ground 
and surface ) and air quality .
 , Contribute to local prosperity in the 
area of supply chain management and 
biomass production.
 , Contribute to the social wellbeing of 
employees and the local population in 
the area of the biomass production.
We work collaboratively with our 
suppliers to ensure compliance with the 
UK government’s sustainability criteria 
which have now been incorporated 
into legislation. Confidence in the 
sustainability of the biomass is achieved 
through a programme of information 
exchange, documentary evidence, due 
diligence activities and independent 
third party verification.
We have also been involved in the 
Sustainable Biomass Partnership 
(“SBP”) which has developed a pan-
European sustainability framework 
which involves third party certification 
of the management systems of biomass 
producers, at pellet mill level, supplying 
Drax with woody biomass. The SBP 
standards are a development of those 
currently employed by Drax and it 
is envisaged that they will continue 
to evolve as stakeholder views and 
practical experience mature. 
Customer relations
Customers and their consultants are 
at the heart of our retail business. All of 
our customers have named account 
managers who are responsible for the 
service that we deliver . We continue 
to build on our reputation for providing 
good service and this supports an 
ongoing good level of renewal at the end 
of customers’ supply contracts. Drax Group plc

Marketplace, performance and risk Governance Financials Sustainable business review Overview
Market conditions remained challenging 
with yet more change in the shape of 
Electricity Market Reform. For example, 
new legislation to ensure the UK’s future 
demand for electricity is satisfied and 
that CO
2 emissions are reduced in line 
with statutory commitments. 
We held a range of events throughout 
the year targeted at customers, 
prospective customers and their 
consultants to inform and educate 
them about these changes, and other 
industry developments. These events 
share information which is invaluable to 
customers and consultants and provide 
us with the opportunity to obtain direct 
feedback to better meet their needs. 
Events such as these complement 
the high level of service and account 
management we offer and this is 
reflected in our positive independent 
customer satisfaction results.
Our online portal community continues 
to grow and offers our larger customers 
2 4/7 access to bills and statements as 
well as consumption data and flexible 
purchasing information. 
Investor relations
We are committed to delivering 
shareholder value. We communicate 
our results and prospects to our 
shareholders in an accurate and timely 
manner using a variety of channels. 
In addition to the Annual General 
Meeting, we communicate through 
our Annual report and accounts, Half 
year report and Interim Management 
Statements. In November 2014, the 
Financial Conduct Authority removed 
the requirement to publish Interim 
Management Statements. However , it is 
our intention to provide updates on our 
trading performance in addition to the 
annual and half year reports, generally on 
a quarterly basis. All of these documents 
are made available on our website at 
www.drax.com. Significant matters 
relating to trading and the development 
of the business are disseminated to the 
market by way of announcements via a 
regulatory information service and those 
announcements appear as soon as 
practicable on our website.
Announcements are frequently followed 
up with either conference calls or 
presentations to provide further detail 
and greater understanding. In addition, 
face-to-face meetings are held with our 
major institutional shareholders, and 
other potential investors in the Group, 
to assist them in their understanding of 
the announcements and also to ensure 
that the Board is aware of their views 
and concerns. T o aid our communication 
with private investors, the investor 
section of our website has been 
developed to be a readily accessible and 
transparent source of information to 
enhance understanding of the business.
Public affairs
As in previous years, we maintained 
our engagement with public affairs 
audiences on issues with implications 
for our business. With energy policy 
still high on the political agenda we 
had significant engagement with 
Parliamentarians and officials at all 
levels on issues including forthcoming 
environmental legislation, renewables 
policy and market reform issues.
The form of engagement was varied 
and included both face-to-face and 
written briefings, participation in public 
consultations, written evidence to 
inquiries, and visits by Parliamentarians 
and officials to Drax Power Station. As in 
the past, trade association membership 
proved useful during the year . The ability 
to meet with and discuss issues of the 
day with other interested parties has 
facilitated presentation of collective 
positions on energy policy matters.
No political donations were made 
in the UK or elsewhere during 2014 
(2013: nil), and the Group’s contact with 
those active in the political arena has 
been and will continue to be aimed 
solely at the promotion of the Group’s 
business interests.
The definitions of EU political 
expenditure are broad and there 
is uncertainty about the extent to 
which normal business activities, 
which might not be thought to be 
political expenditure in the usual sense, 
could be considered to be political 
expenditure within the meaning of the 
legislation. The Company wishes to 
avoid any inadvertent infringement of 
the legislation and each year , through 
a resolution at the Annual General 
Meeting, seeks the authority of 
shareholders to incur expenditure for the 
Company and its subsidiaries for such 
purposes of £100,000.
Community relations
We are committed to being a good 
neighbour to our local community 
and our “caring for the community” 
philosophy involves being part of 
local and regional communities. 
Our involvement takes the form of 
sponsoring a variety of local charities 
and fundraising events, promoting our 
own campaigns which focus on the 
three themes of youth sport, education 
and the environment, and maintaining 
open communication channels and 
good working relationships with the 
region’s key opinion formers.
Sponsorship and fundraising
During 2014, the Group gave financial 
support of £228,000 (2013: £200,000) 
in total across a range of charitable and 
non-charitable community causes. 
Of that total, charitable donations 
amounted to £154,000 (2013: £142,000).
Education in the community
We provide a choice of educational 
experiences hosted by our team of 
power station guides and, at times, 
technical experts. A state-of -the-art 
visitor centre is of particular interest 
to students of all ages allowing them 
to explore the properties of electricity , 
discover how a power station works 
and consider the environmental issues 
related to electricity generation.
Another visitor opportunity exists at 
our nature reserve that lies at the heart 
of our ash disposal site. Established as 
a sanctuary for over 100 species of 
wildlife, it is specially designed to help 
schoolchildren understand more about 
the natural habitat and ecology of 
the area.
Campaigns such as “Cricket in the 
Community” , “ Art in the Community” 
and the “Community Pride Awards” are 
now established in the annual calendar 
of community events and continue to 
prove popular .
Visitors to Drax
During 2014, we played host to some 
12,700 visitors through organised tours 
of the power station, and various activity 
days and charity events. The tours and 
activities have wide appeal attracting 
schools and colleges as well as business 
organisations, local and professional 
associations and members of 
our community .  Executive:

New structure of the ex ecutive management team
From March 2015 a new structure of the 
executive management team will come 
into operation.
The Group is now made up of three separate 
business units: Drax Biomass, Drax Power and 
Haven Power .
The new structure is designed so that:
 , each business unit will run under its own 
management team; and
 , the services needed to support the three 
business units, and operate and optimise 
the Group will be managed centrally through 
Group functions. 
The new structure will see the creation of 
a Group Executive Board (“GEB”), which 
will replace the Executive Committee and 
be responsible for the overall running of 
the business. There are some changes to 
the roles and responsibilities of the senior 
management team: 
 , Peter Emery will become Group Operations 
Director , overseeing operational excellence 
across the Group;
 , Paul T aylor will become Group Commercial 
Director , with responsibility for strategy and 
commercial optimisation across the Group;
 , Matthew Rivers will become Group 
Sustainability Director . In this role he will 
lead the sustainability strategy and activities 
across the Group, and he will also retain 
responsibility for Drax Biomass;
 , Andy Koss will take up the new position 
of CEO, Drax Power Limited and will draw 
together the management team to lead our 
power generation business;
 , T ony Quinlan will continue in his current role; 
and
 , Peter Bennell, CEO, Haven Power Limited 
will continue in his current role, but will join 
the GEB.
This structure is designed with an eye to the 
future and with growth of the business in 
mind. Drax has made good progress on its 
biomass transformation strategy. The GEB 
plans to launch a full strategic review in 2015 
to consider what other opportunities might be 
attractive to the Group. Drax Group plc

Corporate governance
Chairman’s letter
I am pleased to present the Group’s Corporate governance 
report for 2014. In 2014, we complied with the requirements 
of the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code except in relation 
to provisions on tendering the appointment of auditors as 
explained in the Audit Committee report on page 75.
At Drax we believe that governance is not only about following 
good rules and setting up the right processes. It is as much 
about how we actually do things. It is my role to ensure that 
the Group is led by an effective Board which sets a tone of 
openness, transparency and behaviour that matches our core 
values. Good governance needs to be embedded throughout 
the business to enable effective management. This is 
increasingly important as the scope of the Group’s operations 
has changed through the growth of our retail business, the 
development of our supply chain operations and the US 
business. The role of the Board in establishing the right culture 
for all parts of the Group to work together is vital. 
The Board regularly reviews the work involved in operating 
the Group’s internal control and risk management systems. 
It is important that we have the assurance that these are 
embedded in the day-to-day operations of the business 
and are addressing risks in line with the overall risk appetite 
established by the Board. We have been pleased with the 
incremental enhancement of these processes, particularly as 
our operations have been changing, and with the additional 
review of risk to ensure optimisation across the Group. 
Part of my role as Chairman is to ensure that the Board is 
aware of the views of shareholders. The Company and its 
management are fortunate to enjoy the support of a stable 
group of major shareholders who are extremely supportive. 
I have found this to be the case from my meetings with 
shareholders, which have been one of the most enjoyable 
aspects of my time with Drax. In addition to meeting 
with shareholders, we also commissioned a shareholder 
audit in 2014 which was undertaken by Makinson Cowell 
Limited (“Makinson Cowell”), an independent capital 
markets consultancy firm and part of the KPMG Group. 
This corroborated the Board’s impression of shareholders’ 
views, particularly their support for the Group’s biomass 
strategy and its implementation. We do note that shareholders 
recognise that uncertainty can arise from the political and 
regulatory environment in which we operate. The Board has 
a clear focus on the need to ensure that the business is robust 
in this environment.
With Phil Cox taking over from me as Chairman after the 
Annual General Meeting (“ AGM”) I am confident that I will be 
leaving the Board with an excellent balance of skills, expertise 
and experience to take the Group forward. Diversity is part of 
this mix, and our policy is to ensure that diversity (including 
gender diversity) is one of the factors taken into account when 
considering appointments to the Board and senior roles.
More detail on our corporate governance arrangements is set 
out on the following pages.

Our governance framework
How the Board functions
The Board receives regular reports on performance against 
the Business Plan and periodic business reports from senior 
management. Directors are briefed on matters to be discussed 
at meetings by papers distributed in advance of Board and 
committee meetings.
The Board has adopted a policy whereby directors may , in the 
furtherance of their duties, seek independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense. During 2014, no director 
sought independent professional advice pursuant to the policy .
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board 
on all governance matters, ensuring good information flows 
within the Board, its committees and senior management, 
and ensuring that Board processes are complied with. He is 
also responsible for compliance with the Listing, Prospectus, 
Disclosure and T ransparency Rules and the Companies 
Act. In his role he is also responsible for advising the Board 
on legal matters and has responsibility for the Company 
Secretarial, Group Legal and Human Resources functions, and 
for the management of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management framework and processes.
The Company’s Articles of Association (the “ Articles”) give the 
directors power to authorise conflicts of interest. The Board 
has adopted a procedure that has operated effectively , by 
which situations giving rise to potential conflicts of interest 
are identified to the Board, considered for authorisation and 
recorded. The Articles also allow the Board to exercise voting 
rights in Group companies without restriction ( e.g. so as to 
appoint a director to the Board of a Group company without 
this counting as a conflict requiring authorisation).
Each director has the benefit of a deed of indemnity from the 
Company and its subsidiaries in respect of claims made and 
liabilities incurred, in either case arising out of the bona fide 
discharge by the director of his or her duties. The Company has 
also arranged appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal 
action against directors of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Selection, appointment, review and re-election
Notwithstanding the provisions of the Articles, which provide 
that one-third of directors shall retire by rotation each year 
and are eligible for re-election by shareholders at the AGM, 
and in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Company will continue to propose all directors for annual 
re-election. Accordingly , each of Tim Cobbold, Peter Emery , 
Melanie Gee, David Lindsell, T ony Quinlan, Paul T aylor , Dorothy 
Thompson and T ony Thorne will retire at the forthcoming AGM 
and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. 
Charles Berry will retire at the conclusion of the forthcoming 
AGM and will not seek re-election.
The Articles require that, following appointment to the Board, 
directors submit themselves for election by shareholders at the 
first AGM following their appointment. Phil Cox’s appointment 
to the Board was since the last AGM and, therefore, he will 
retire and offer himself for election by shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM .
The evaluation of the Board described below concluded that 
the directors offering themselves for election or re-election 
continue to demonstrate commitment, management 
and industry expertise in their particular role and to 
perform effectively .

The election or re-election of each director is recommended 
by the Board. Details of the service contracts for the executive 
directors and letters of appointment for the non-executive 
directors are set out in a table on page 92.
It is the Board’s policy that each non-executive director will 
be appointed for a term of three years which, subject to the 
Board being satisfied as to the director’s performance and 
commitment, and a resolution to re-elect at the appropriate 
AGM, may be renewed by mutual agreement. However , it is the 
Board’s policy not to extend the aggregate period of service 
of any independent non-executive director beyond nine years, 
and any proposal made to extend a non-executive director’s 
aggregate period of office beyond six years is the subject 
of a rigorous review. Such reviews in cases where a director 
remains in office after six years, will be conducted annually , as 
part of the evaluation of the Board.
The Board is satisfied that all the directors are able to devote 
sufficient time to their duties as directors.
Performance revi ews and directors’ development
The effectiveness of the Board is vital to the success of 
the Group. Having used an external facilitator in 2013 to 
conduct the annual review of the effectiveness of the 
Board, its committees and individual directors, the review 
was facilitated internally in 2014. Each director completed a 
questionnaire covering matters including strategy , objectives, 
performance monitoring, succession and management 
development, process and governance, and matters relating 
to the general business environment in which the Group 
operates. Directors were asked to provide scores against 
specific statements and to provide narrative comment. 
The review concluded that each of , the Board, its individual 
directors and its committees were effective. No significant 
areas of concern were identified, but some suggestions to 
improve effectiveness were made. In particular , directors 
recognised the importance of energy policy and the regulatory 
environment to the Group’s strategy and agreed to consider 
further steps to maintain their knowledge and understanding 
in this area. There were also some practical suggestions made 
to improve the means by which non-executive directors can 
further contribute and add value to the Group.
During the year , the Chairman held a meeting with the non-
executive directors in the absence of the executive directors, 
and the Senior Independent Director held a meeting with 
the non-executive directors without the Chairman being 
present, as required by provision A. 4.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The Board is committed to the development of all employees 
and directors and has reviewed and will periodically continue 
to review each director’s development requirements and make 
appropriate arrangements to address them. All new directors 
receive an induction, including being provided with information 
about the Group and their responsibilities, meetings with key 
managers and visits to the Group’s sites. 
In addition, each non-executive director visits operational sites 
both in the UK and the US. Periodically , they also meet with 
senior management to be briefed on the Group’s business and 
specific Board training days are arranged, where appropriate, 
involving presentations on relevant topics.

Group Risk Management Committee
The Group Risk Management Committee (“GRMC”) overseas the operation of the Group’s risk management system and 
internal controls and co-ordinates the activities of the six business risk committees. The GRMC provides oversight of Group risk 
optimisation and cross-Group risk issues. Four meetings of the GRMC were held in 2014. Drax Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2014
67
Sustainable business review Financials Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Governance
The purpose of the GRMC is to:
 , monitor the risk management process on a Group wide basis;
 , maintain the Consolidated Risk Register and Cross-Group 
Risk Register;
 , oversee the risk management process in relation to 
cross-Group risks;
 , provide an escalation route for Risk Committees who 
disagree on materiality or probability of a shared or 
common risk;
 , assist in the risk analysis conducted within the business units 
and identify areas where best practice in one area can be 
transferred to another;
 , provide additional assurance on the control environment;
 , make recommendations to improve effectiveness of internal 
controls; and
 , make recommendations for changes in procedures 
and policies.
Directors’ interests, indemnity arrangements 
and other significant agreements
Other than a deed of indemnity between each director , the 
Company and each of its subsidiaries in respect of claims 
made and personal liability incurred as a result of the bona fide 
discharge of the directors’ responsibilities, a service contract 
between the executive directors and a Group company , or 
as noted in the Remuneration Committee report, no director 
had a material interest at any time during the year in any 
contract of significance with the Company or any of its 
subsidiary undertakings.
There are no agreements between the Group and its directors 
providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid.
The Board has reviewed the independence of each non-
executive director . None of the non-executive directors who 
have served during the year had any material business or other 
relationship with the Group, and there were no other matters 
that were likely to affect their independence of character and 
judgement. The Board therefore considers all of the non-
executive directors to be independent.

Time commitment
Under the terms of his letter of appointment, the Chairman is 
expected to commit between 50 and 70 full days a year to fulfil 
his role.
Under the non-executives’ letters of appointment, the 
time commitment each is expected to give in respect 
of membership of the Board, is 12 to 15 full days a year . 
That includes attendance at Board meetings, the AGM, 
one annual Board strategy day and at least one site visit per 
year . In addition, they are expected to devote appropriate 
preparation time ahead of each meeting. The time 
commitment expected in respect of their membership of 
committees of the Board, notably the Audit, Nominations and

Non-executive directors also spend time with management in 
order to maintain their knowledge of the developing business 
and to understand the operational challenges being faced.
Corporate governance
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance, details of which are given in this Corporate 
governance report and the Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committee reports set out on pages 73 to 96.
The various sections of this report contain in summary certain 
provisions of the Company’s current Articles of Association (the 
“ Articles”) and applicable English law concerning companies 
(the Companies Act 2006). This is a summary only and the 
relevant provisions of the Articles or the Companies Act should 
be consulted if further information is required. Drax Group plc

Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
It is the Board’s view that throughout the period commencing 
on 1 January 2014, there has been full compliance with the 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
issued in September 2012, and this compliance is illustrated in 
the details set out in this report. However , the Board has, on the 
recommendation of the Audit Committee, taken the decision 
not to comply for the time being with provision C.3.7 . of the

Relations with shareholders
The Chairman is keen to ensure that he maintains an open 
relationship with the Group’s major shareholders and 
communicates directly with them, offering the opportunity 
to meet any other directors in order that the Board can 
understand their views on the Group, be it corporate 
governance issues or any other points they might wish to raise.
The Board also reviews and discusses the investor feedback 
from post -results investor meetings conducted by the Chief 
Executive and the Finance Director in the UK, Europe and 
the US. These took place following both the preliminary and 
half year results announcements in 2014. Makinson Cowell 
is engaged by the Group to advise and assist in relation to 
communications with shareholders.
The Company’s private registered shareholders hold, in 
aggregate, approximately 0.6% of the issued share capital. 
The Board is as interested in their concerns as it is in the 
concerns of institutional and corporate shareholders. 
All shareholders are free to put questions to the Board at 
the AGM. Questions asked in person at the AGM will receive 
a verbal response whenever possible. Otherwise a written 
response will be provided as soon as practicable after the 
AGM. Questions asked at other times will normally receive a 
written response. Shareholders attending the AGM will have an 
opportunity to meet informally with the directors immediately 
after the meeting.
All information reported to the market via a regulatory 
information service also appears as soon as practicable on the 
Group’s website.
The directors consider that this Annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair , balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy . Pages 1 
to 57 provide an assessment of the Group’s affairs. The Annual

Variation of rights
Subject to statute, the Articles specify that rights attached 
to any class of shares may be varied with the written consent 
of the holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal 
value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction 
of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate General 
Meeting of the holders of those shares. At every such separate 
General Meeting the quorum shall be two persons holding or 
representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value of the 
issued shares of the class ( calculated excluding any shares held 
as T reasury shares). The rights conferred upon the holders of 
any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in 
the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied 
by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu 
with them.
T ransfer of shares
All transfers of shares which are in certificated form may be 
effected by transfer in writing in any usual or common form or 
in any other form acceptable to the directors and may be under 
hand only . The instrument of transfer shall be signed by or on 
behalf of the transferor and ( except in the case of fully paid 
shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor shall 
remain the holder of the shares concerned until the name of 
the transferee is entered in the register . All transfers of shares 
which are in uncertificated form may be effected by means of 
the CREST system.
The directors may decline to recognise any instrument of 
transfer relating to shares in certificated form unless it: 
a)  is in respect of only one class of share; and 
b)  is lodged at the transfer office ( duly stamped if required) 
accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and such 
other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to 
show the right of the transferor to make the transfer ( and, 
if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other 
person on his/her behalf , the authority of that person so 
to do ).
The directors may , in the case of shares in certificated form, 
at their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason 
therefore, refuse to register any transfer of shares (not being 
fully paid shares) provided that, where any such shares are 
admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange, 
such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to 
prevent dealings in the shares of that class from taking place 
on an open and proper basis. The directors may also refuse to 
register an allotment or transfer of shares (whether fully paid or 
not) in favour of more than four persons jointly .
If the directors refuse to register an allotment or transfer , they 
shall send within two months after the date on which the letter 
of allotment or transfer was lodged with the Company , to the 
allottee or transferee, notice of the refusal.
A shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the 
Company , or of other shareholders of shares in the Company , 
for a transfer of shares to take place.
The Articles provide that the directors must give reasons for 
any refusal to register a transfer of shares in accordance with 
the Companies Act.
Shares in uncertificated form
Directors may determine that any class of shares may be 
held in uncertificated form and title to such shares may be 
transferred by means of a relevant system or that shares of 
any class should cease to be held and transferred. Subject to 
the provisions of the Companies Act, the CREST Regulations 
and every other statute, statutory instrument, regulation or 
order for the time being in force concerning companies and 
affecting the Company . The provisions of the Articles shall not 
apply to shares of any class which are in uncertificated form to 
the extent that the Articles are inconsistent with the holding 
of shares of that class in uncertificated form, the transfer of 
title to shares of that class by means of a relevant system or any 
provision of the CREST Regulations.
Voting
Subject to the Articles generally and to any special rights or 
restrictions as to voting attached by , or in accordance with, 
the Articles to any class of shares, on a show of hands every 
member who is present in person at a General Meeting shall 
have one vote and, on a poll, every member who is present 
in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of 
which he/she is the holder . It has been the Company’s practice 
since incorporation to hold a poll on every resolution at Annual 
General Meetings and Extraordinary General Meetings.
Shares are held by the trustee on behalf of employees in 
respect of the Group’s Share Incentive Plan. The voting rights 
attached to such shares are not directly exercisable by the 
employees. The employee may direct the trustee on how 
to vote at the AGM and the trustee may only cast its vote in 
respect of shares/voting rights over which it has received a 
valid direction from employees.
Under the Companies Act, members are entitled to appoint a 
proxy , who need not be a member of the Company , to exercise 
all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their 
behalf at a General Meeting or class meeting. A member may 
appoint more than one proxy in relation to a General Meeting 
or class meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to 
exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares 
held by that member . A member that is a corporation may 
appoint one or more individuals to act on its behalf at a General 
Meeting or class meetings as a corporate representative. Drax Group plc

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year . Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the 
parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or 
loss of the company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
 , select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 , make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 , state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
 , prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
 , properly select and apply accounting policies;
 , present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 , provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
 , make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Company and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 , the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
 , the Strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
 , the Annual report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair , balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy .

The Chairman of the Committee reports the Committee’s 
deliberations to the following Board meeting and the minutes 
of each meeting of the Committee are circulated to all 
members of the Board.
In undertaking its duties, the Committee has access to the 
services of the Finance Director and the Group Company 
Secretary and their resources, as well as access to external 
professional advice.
Main activities during the year
During the year , the Committee undertook its duties in 
accordance with an agreed annual work plan. The routine 
items which are put to each meeting are as follows the 
Committee’s rolling annual plan review, reports from the 
internal audit function on the progress of their programme for 
the year including fee analysis and new internal audit reports. 
The Committee continues to focus on specifically identified 
strategic risk areas, as well as ensuring the provision of a core 
compliance assurance service. No significant weaknesses 
were identified in any of the internal audit reports although 
certain improvements in processes and procedures were made 
as a result of reviews.
At meetings in February and July 2014, the Committee 
reviewed the Group’s Preliminary results announcement 
and Annual report and accounts, and the Half year results 
announcement and Half year report respectively . At these 
meetings, the Committee received reports from management 
and the external auditor on the application of accounting 
policies on significant estimates and judgements made in 
preparing the financial statements, and on the methods 
used to account for any significant or unusual transactions. 
Our principal accounting policies are set out in the notes to the 
accounts. In respect of all such matters, the external auditor 
concurred with the judgements made by management and 
the Committee was satisfied that the accounting policies were 
applied appropriately and the estimates and judgements made 
were appropriate. In addition, the Committee also satisfied 
itself of the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditor on the basis set out below under “Independence of the 
external audit” .

Audit Committee report ( continued)
Reviewing the 2014 Annual report and accounts
At the meeting in February 2015, the Committee reviewed the 
content of the 2014 Annual report and accounts, alongside a 
paper on accounting issues and judgements impacting the 
accounts. The significant issues and judgements considered 
were as follows:
 , ROCs and LECs – The value of ROCs and LECs is recognised 
as they are earned through generating electricity from 
burning biomass. Accordingly , the value is deducted from 
the cost of the biomass burnt and held on the balance sheet 
until sold. The valuation is necessarily based on assumptions 
regarding future sales prices of these instruments in the 
market. The Committee was satisfied that the assumptions 
made by management were appropriate and that the 
Company’s accounting policy for ROCs and LECs has been 
applied in a manner consistent with the previous year 
(see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements) ;
 , Derivatives – As explained in more detail in note 20 to 
the consolidated financial statements, the Group enters 
into commodity contracts to manage its exposure 
to commodity price movements and forward foreign 
currency exchange contracts to manage its exposure to 
transactions denominated in currencies other than sterling. 
The Committee gained assurance regarding the valuation 
of and movements in the Group’s derivative contracts 
through management reports on derivative valuations 
supported by market data, detailed reports of the year end 
positions, and discussion with management regarding 
the approach taken to fair value measurement and the 
application of hedge accounting. The Committee also 
noted that an independent review of internal controls over 
certain aspects of trading activities during the year had 
raised no significant issues; and
 , Property, plant and equipment – The net book value of 
the Group’s property , plant and equipment was £1.7 billion 
at 31 December 2014 (see note 11 to the consolidated 
financial statements). The useful economic lives of assets 
making up a large proportion of this balance are based on 
the assumed economic life of the Drax Power Station as a 
whole. This assumption therefore has a material impact on 
the depreciation charge in the income statement and the 
carrying value of the assets concerned. The Committee 
received a report on the outcome of a review by 
management of the useful economic life of Drax Power 
Station and was satisfied that the 35-year life set in 2004 
remained appropriate. The Committee also discussed with 
management the possibility that, due for example to new 
regulatory requirements and/or the biomass transformation 
project, any assets in the balance sheet were impaired. 
The Committee was satisfied that, based on reviews carried 
out by management, no firm indicators of asset impairment 
had been identified.
Explanation of the critical accounting judgements, 
estimates and assumptions is set out in detail in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
In addition, other matters relating to the application of 
accounting policies or accounting treatment have been 
considered during the year at the February , July and November 
2014 meetings, and again at the February 2015 meeting in 
relation to our financial reports. These included:
 , the accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in 
relation to ROC valuation and income recognition, obligations 
under the Community Energy Savings Programme, 
retirement benefit obligations (pension), taxation and 
investments. Further detail on these areas can be found in 
note 3 to the consolidated financial statements; and
 , other accounting issues, namely in relation to application 
of accounting policies or accounting treatment ( capital 
expenditure, segmental reporting), accounting for 
Contracts for Difference (CfDs) and new items in the 
financial statements were reviewed. Where applicable our 
accounting policies are set out in the relevant note to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Committee met twice in the absence of management with 
each of the external auditor (February and July) and internal 
auditor (April and November). No matters of concern were 
drawn to the Committee’s attention at any of these meetings. 
The Committee’s understanding with both the external and 
internal auditor is that, if they should at any time become 
aware of any matters occasioning them material concern, 
they will immediately draw it to the Committee’s attention via 
the Chairman of the Committee. Nothing was subject to this 
procedure in the course of the year . 
In addition to the routine items outlined above, there were 
a number of specific items which are put to the meetings 
as follows:

Committee undertook a review of its own effectiveness 
and concluded that the composition of its membership, the 
manner in which it operates and the reviews that it undertakes 
throughout the year all contribute to the continued effective 
functioning of the Committee.  Drax Group plc

Fair , balanced and understandable view
At the February 2015 meeting, the Committee reviewed the 
content of this Annual report and accounts and advised the 
Board that, in its view, taken as a whole, it is fair , balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy .
External auditor effectiveness
At the February 2015 meeting, the Committee reviewed 
the effectiveness of the external auditor , Deloitte LLP . 
This process incorporated feedback from management and 
key individuals across the Group, as well as its own experience. 
The assessment considered the robustness of the audit 
process, the quality of delivery of the audit plan, the quality of 
reporting on findings and recommendations to the Committee 
and management, and the experience and expertise of the 
audit team and the quality of service provided.
Having reviewed Deloitte’s performance during the year and 
satisfied itself of their continuing independence and objectivity 
within the context of applicable regulatory requirements and 
professional standards, the Committee has invited the Board 
to recommend the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor at 
the next Annual General Meeting (“ AGM”) and a resolution to 
that effect appears in the Notice of the AGM.
Independence of the external audit
The Group has an Auditor Independence Policy , in accordance 
with which the Committee annually reviews the quality and 
cost -effectiveness of the external audit and the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor . The Auditor 
Independence Policy can be found on the Company’s website 
at www.drax.com
The provisions of the Policy include:
 , seeking confirmation that the auditor is, in its professional 
judgement, independent of the Group and obtaining from 
it an account of all relationships which may affect the firm’s 
independence and the objectivity of the audit partner 
and staff; 
 , a policy governing the engagement of the auditor to conduct 
non-audit work under which:
 – the auditor may not be engaged to provide certain 
categories of work, including those where they may be 
required to audit their own work or make management 
decisions, or where the auditor would act in an advocacy 
role for the Group; 
 – there is a clear process of approval for engaging the auditor 
to conduct other categories of non-audit work, subject to 
financial limits; 
 – all engagements of the auditor to conduct non-audit work 
are reported to the next meeting of the Committee; 
 – the balance between the fees paid to the external 
auditor for audit and non-audit work is monitored by the 
Committee; and 
 , a policy on the employment by the Group of former 
employees of the external auditor , the essence of which 
is to require a period of two years to elapse between the 
cessation of an individual’s association with the auditor and 
appointment to any financial reporting oversight role within 
the Group.
The Committee receives reports from the external auditor on 
its own processes and procedures to ensure its independence 
and objectivity and to ensure compliance with the 
relevant standards.
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the 
year for audit and other services are set out in note 5 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 111. The external 
auditor is required to rotate the audit partner responsible for 
the Group audit every five years and the current audit partner , 
James Leigh, is in his first year of tenure and took responsibility 
with effect from the 2014 audit.
No contractual obligations exist that restrict the Group’s choice 
of external auditor .
Audit tendering
Last year , the Committee recommended that the Board 
decide not to comply for the time being with provision C.3.7 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), as revised 
in September 2012, which stipulates that the external audit 
contract should be put out to tender at least every ten years.
The Committee considered at that time the importance we 
place on the period of transformational change the business 
is undergoing to become a predominantly biomass-fired 
power generator . The incumbent auditor has accumulated 
knowledge and experience that allows it to carry out effective 
and efficient audits during this period of change and provide 
insightful and informed challenge. In addition, to conduct a 
thorough competitive audit tender process would require 
substantial Board and management participation at a time 
when the transformation of the business is placing greatly 
increased demands on them.
Accordingly , the Committee intended to recommend going 
through a full audit tender process for the 2016 year end, in line 
with the substantial completion of the biomass transformation 
process, and committed to review this decision annually .
Subsequently , in June 2014, EU audit reform legislation, 
effective from June 2016, was enacted requiring public interest 
entities to rotate their auditor every ten years. This would take 
effect for the first auditor appointment after June 2016, which 
for Drax would be the 2017 year end ( appointed at the AGM in 
April 2017).
EU member states can opt, by derogation, to extend 
the maximum duration of the audit engagement to 20 
years, subject to retendering at least every ten years. 
The government has issued a discussion document in which it 
states that it proposes to take up this option, but the results of 
this consultation are not expected until Summer 2015. Drax Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2014

As a result, if Drax were to conduct an audit tender process 
in time for the appointment of auditors to be proposed at 
the 2016 AGM, it would have to commence the process 
without knowing whether it would be able to appoint the 
incumbent auditor for more than one year before having to 
conduct another audit tender process. In view of the small 
number of audit firms that have the experience and expertise 
required to carry out a high quality and efficient audit of the 
Group’s financial statements and that are independent in 
accordance with Drax’s auditor independence policy , and 
the relevant professional standards on independence, the 
Committee does not wish to reduce that number by excluding 
the incumbent auditor from the tender process if it is not 
necessary . Accordingly , the Committee considers that it would 
be appropriate to defer the tender process for a further year , i.e. 
to put the audit for 2017 out to tender during 2016.
In coming to a recommendation the Committee considered 
how, notwithstanding its recommendation to defer putting 
the external audit out to tender , the Group would adhere to the 
principle of the Code to maintain an appropriate relationship 
with the auditor . The independence and effectiveness of 
the auditor are reviewed annually by the Committee and no 
weakening in the level of the auditor’s scepticism or in its desire 
to challenge management’s assumptions and judgements in 
relation to financial reporting has been noted.
The Committee continues to undertake to review this 
decision annually .
Internal audit
Grant Thornton UK LLP undertakes the Group’s internal 
audit function. The Committee periodically reviews whether 
the internal audit function is likely to be more effective or 
efficient if provided internally . In view of the nature and scope 
of the Group’s business and its management structure, the 
Committee considers that it continues to be more effective 
and efficient for core internal audit functions to be undertaken 
by an external service provider , augmented as appropriate by 
additional reviews that require specialist expertise.
The Committee receives reports at each meeting regarding 
the internal audit programme and reviews undertaken. 
Recommendations are made to management for process 
improvements as appropriate. T opics dealt with by internal 
audit reports reviewed by the Committee during 2014 included: 
 , compliance with Regulation on Energy Market Integrity and 
T ransparency (REMIT) and European Market Infrastructure 
Regulation (EMIR) ; 
 , Group risk management, oil and freight hedging; 
 , review of US operations – fibre procurement and shipments; 
 , key financial controls over revenue and financial reporting, 
compliance with Senior Accounting Officer legislation and 
HMRC guidance; 
 , key IT controls in relation to system access; and 
 , in respect of Haven Power , business continuity processes, 
planned infrastructure, position management and key 
financial controls in respect of revenue.
In November , the Committee supported a proposal from 
management to consider developing a different approach to 
internal audit with the introduction of an in-house internal 
audit team. An initial scoping exercise is underway to assess 
the appropriate areas of focus and balance between internal 
and external resources. The Committee will review progress 
during the course of 2015.
The Chairman of the Committee, independent of management, 
maintains regular and direct contact with both the internal and 
external auditor .
This report was reviewed and approved by the Audit 
Committee on 23 February 2015.

The Chairman of the Committee reports on the Committee’s 
proceedings to the following Board meeting and, subject to 
redaction in the event that they include personal information, 
the minutes of each meeting of the Committee are circulated 
to all members of the Board.
The Committee has an annual programme of work which is 
designed to fulfil its principal duties. This programme reviews:
 , Re-election and appointment of directors – The Committee 
met on 17 February 2015, following the completion of 
the 2014 Board evaluation process, and determined 
that all of the directors who are the subject of annual 
re-election will retire at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting (“ AGM”) and, being eligible, offer themselves for 
re-election. The evaluation of the Board described on page 
66 concluded that the directors offering themselves for 
re-election continue to demonstrate commitment to their 
particular role and to perform effectively;
 , Size, structure and composition of the Board – At its 
meeting in June 2014 the Committee concluded that 
the Board, constituted with four executive directors, four 
independent non-executive directors and a chairman who 
was independent on appointment, was appropriate for the 
Company . It also concluded that the Board collectively has 
the necessary balance of skills, experience, independence 
and knowledge to enable it to discharge its duties;
 , Membership of Board Committees – It the Board policy 
normally to invite all independent non-executive directors to 
join the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees. 
The Defence Committee comprises executive and non-
executive directors with particular skills and experience 
relevant to the work of that Committee. The Committee 
reviewed this policy and considered that it continues to 
ensure that each of the Committees is constituted with the 
skills, experience, independence and knowledge to enable it 
to discharge its duties; and
 , Succession planning – The Committee reviews the 
succession plan at least annually . The Company has a well-
established succession planning process which covers all 
Executive Committee members and their direct reports, as 
well as other individuals who have been identified as having 
long-term potential for senior roles. In the Committee’s 
opinion the plan is well prepared and appropriate for the 
size of the Group’s business and management structure 
and there are considered to be many good candidates for 
senior roles.
In addition to the regular programme of work, the Committee 
also considered the question of Board diversity , and gender 
diversity in particular . During the year the Company has actively 
engaged with initiatives promoted by the Department for 
Business Innovation and Skills to improve gender diversity 
at Board level. The Committee recognises the strength that 
can be achieved through diversity in its wider sense in the 
Group’s management. In particular , it is the Board’s policy to 
ensure that the proportion of women on the Board is one 
of the considerations for Board and senior management 
appointments. That policy is implemented as part of the 
recruitment and selection process. Further details of gender 
diversity in the Group are included in the Sustainable business 
review on page 54.
Finally , following my decision to step down as a director and 
Chairman of the Company at the conclusion of the AGM in 
April 2015, the Committee has undertaken a rigorous search 
and selection process for a successor . 
The process was led by David Lindsell, the Senior Independent 
Director . Russell Reynolds Associates were engaged to assist 
with the process. The brief provided to Russell Reynolds was 
specifically targeted to search for someone capable of leading 
the Board through the next stage of the Group’s development. 
Membership and process: Nominations Committee

the Board (including the skills, knowledge and experience 
required by it) ; 
 , consider succession planning for the directors and other 
senior managers; 
 , identify and nominate candidates to fill vacancies among 
the directors; and 
 , review the time required from non-executive directors.

As well as the necessary personal and leadership 
characteristics, the Committee’s specification included 
experience and demonstrable achievement leading a listed 
company , relevant sector experience and an understanding 
of relationships with government and regulators.
The Committee considered a long list of candidates from 
a diversity of backgrounds and identified three short -list 
candidates. Initially , each of the short -listed candidates was 
interviewed by David Lindsell and one other member of the 
Committee, followed by a meeting with the Chief Executive.
The lead candidates subsequently met with each of the 
members of the Committee. The Committee agreed that 
Phil Cox was the preferred candidate to be recommended to 
the Board. Members of the Executive Committee then met 
Phil Cox. On the Committee’s recommendation the Board 
agreed that Phil Cox should be invited to join the Board subject 
to receipt of satisfactory references. Excellent references were 
provided in discussion with Russell Reynolds by two chairmen 
of boards on which Phil Cox served. On 18 December 2014, an 
announcement of Phil Cox’s appointment was made to the 
London Stock Exchange. 
I am delighted that the Company has been able to appoint 
someone of Phil’s calibre and experience as my successor and 
I wish him well.
The Company’s Articles provide that directors retire by rotation. 
However , the UK Corporate Governance Code provides that all 
directors should be subject to annual re-election. The Company 
follows the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
on the annual re-election of all directors. 
The Committee initiated a review of the effectiveness of 
the Board, its committees and individual directors and the 
outcome is reported in the Corporate governance report on 
page 66. 
The executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive 
directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection 
by prior arrangement during normal business hours at the 
Company’s registered office. They will also be available for 
inspection at the venue, prior to the AGM, details of which are 
contained in the Notice of Meeting.

Annual statement to shareholders from the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee’s work during 2014 has been mainly directed 
towards making sure that remuneration properly reflects 
progress on the Group’s strategy . Our assessment of 
management’s performance in executing the transformation 
to a predominantly renewable generator and supplier has been 
at the heart of our consideration as it is delivery of the biomass 
transformation that will enhance shareholder value in the 
longer term.
It has been a very good year in terms of strategy development 
and operations. The business now has two of its generating 
units converted to biomass and delivering excellent 
performance. The conversion of a third unit is well on track 
in line with the original plan. The retail business and the US 
pellet business continue to develop as planned. In assessing 
performance the Committee was very conscious of the fall 
in the share price during the year; this being related to the 
drop in commodity prices and to changes in the regulatory 
environment. The Committee recognises the significant 
influence that the Company’s management has had in 
encouraging regulatory support for biomass conversions. 
Ultimately however , the extent of support is determined 
by government and the Committee’s concentration was 
principally on the factors management can influence. 
We continue to believe that directors’ and shareholders’ 
interests are properly aligned through the performance-related 
long-term share plan and directors’ shareholding requirements. 
Base salaries
The Committee last reviewed benchmarks in 2013. During 2013 
we also consulted with the Company’s largest shareholders. 
We made some adjustments to the structure of executive 
remuneration to reflect changes in the business and the 
executives’ roles. We reported those changes last year . 
For 2014 the Committee agreed that the only changes needed 
to base salaries were annual adjustment in line with our policy . 
Dorothy Thompson’s and T ony Quinlan’s salaries were 
increased by 3%. This was slightly below the level of increases 
in the rest of the business. Peter Emery’s salary was increased 
by 8% to reflect the increasing scope of his role which 
encompasses responsibility for production, engineering, 
construction and safety in the wider Group beyond Drax Power 
Station. Paul T aylor’s salary was also increased by 8% to reflect 
increasing experience in his role. These higher increases are in 
line with the remuneration policy .
Assessment of performance-related remuneration 
relating to 2014 
The Balanced Corporate Scorecard is the key measure of 
management performance. The targets are designed to drive 
both annual performance and long-term development of the 
business. There is a detailed review of performance against 
scorecard measures on page 88. Profit in 2014 was very similar 
to 2013. Operationally , 2014 was a very good year with some 
excellent successes in execution and development. It was 
also a difficult year with a number of setbacks, particularly in 
regulatory matters. 
Membership and process: Remuneration Committee
Role of the Committee
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are:
 , recommending to the Board the remuneration strategy and 
framework for the executive directors and senior managers;
 , determining, within that framework, the individual 
remuneration packages for the executive directors and 
senior managers;
 , approval of the design of annual and long-term incentive 
arrangements for executive directors and senior managers, 
including agreeing the annual targets and payments under 
such arrangements;
 , determining and agreeing the general terms and conditions 
of service and the specific terms for any individual within the 
Committee’s remit, either on recruitment or on termination;
 , determining the policy for , and scope of , executive pension 
arrangements; and
 , to oversee any major changes in employee benefit 
structures throughout the Group and review remuneration 
trends across the Group.

Remuneration Committee report ( continued)
Performance against the quantitative measures which 
management can control has been good, particularly 
controllable costs, safety and operational performance 
measures, biomass sourcing and retail business performance. 
There was also good progress made against strategic and 
development measures. 
One of the scorecard measures was the development of the 
Company’s capital structure and dividend policy . The Board 
agreed that this should be done when regulatory support and 
the long-term revenue base is clear . That position has not yet 
been reached and the Board decided to exclude this measure 
from the 2014 assessment.
The score can be between zero and 2. 0. A score of 1. 0 
represents an on target performance and the score in any year 
is capped at 1.5. We assessed the performance score at 1.22. 
The Board has a discretion to adjust the performance score in 
the light of matters not reflected in the scorecard. The main 
negative factors were the tragic death of a contractor working 
on the construction of the Group’s pellet plant in Mississippi, 
the penalty for non-compliance with the Community Energy 
Savings Programme (CESP) and changes in regulatory 
support for the Group’s biomass conversions. We weighed 
these respectively against the Group’s own excellent 
safety performance, the general problems with CESP , and 
the execution of the original plan for three biomass units 
supported by the Renewables Obligation by the end of 2016. 
The strategic progress towards delivery of the biomass 
transformation has been good during 2014. Logistics and 
operational performance of biomass units have been excellent. 
Audit findings show that Drax is meeting its own stringent 
sustainability criteria. Real progress has been made towards 
establishing an industry standard for biomass sustainability . 
Looking at all of these factors we felt that the positive and 
negative balanced each other , and we decided not to make 
a discretionary adjustment to the scorecard.
In considering directors’ personal performance against 
objectives, we agreed that there were no individual 
circumstances of exceptional over or under performance, 
and that the usual policy approach of a single score was fair . 
The directors’ performance score can be between zero and 1.5 
and in 2014 it was assessed at 1.20.
The Committee’s application of the scorecard and personal 
performance assessment resulted in annual bonus payments 
to executive directors of approximately 73% of maximum.
The Committee has also considered the vesting of the 
Bonus Matching Plan awards made in 2012, which were 
conditional upon performance over the three years from the 
start of 2012 to the end of 2014. The awards are 50% based 
on the Company’s relative T otal Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
performance and 50% on the three-year average of the 
Balanced Corporate Scorecard. The Company’s TSR over the 
period was below the median of the comparator group, and the 
Committee therefore confirmed that none of the TSR element 
of the award vested. The Balanced average scorecard score 
over the same period was 1.39. 
The Committee has a discretion to adjust the average to reflect 
achievement of strategic objectives over the three-year period. 
We considered this and decided not to exercise discretion 
to adjust the average score. The Committee determined 
that 81.30% of the Scorecard Award element would vest. 
Therefore based on the performance measures the Committee 
determined that 40.65% of the executive directors’ 2012 BMP 
awards vested.
2015 targets and long-term incentives
The Committee also considered targets for 2015. These have 
been established to be at least as challenging as those for 2014. 
A description of the 2015 corporate targets is set out on page 
94, with such detail as can be provided whilst safeguarding 
commercial confidentiality .
The Committee also agreed to the grant of 2015 Bonus 
Matching Plan awards to the executive directors to the value 
of 150% of their 2014 annual bonus, and subject to the same 
performance conditions as described in the policy section of 
this report.
Directors’ remuneration policy
This remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 
2014 Annual General Meeting (“ AGM”). It became effective 
from immediately after the AGM on 23 April 2014 and binding 
upon the Group until the close of the 2017 AGM. There are no 
planned changes to the policy over the three-year period to 
which it relates.
The core principles of the remuneration policy are to:
 , give effect to existing remuneration commitments in 
accordance with directors’ contracts of employment;
 , pay market rates of total remuneration;
 , ensure that there is an appropriate link between 
performance and reward;
 , award annual bonuses which are linked to the delivery of the 
annual Business Plan targets including the achievement of 
strategic objectives and personal performance; 
 , ensure that long-term incentives are linked to TSR and to 
the delivery of Business Plan strategic objectives;  ensure 
that payments on termination of employment are linked to 
performance and the exercise of good faith; and
 , allow the Committee an element of discretion to enable 
recruitment or termination situations to be managed in the 
best interest of the Group.
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in 
accordance with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations in 2013 (“the Regulations”) and the provisions of 
the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code.  Drax Group plc

Remuneration policy report 
Section 1
Key components of remuneration
The remuneration policy for executive directors has been designed to support the delivery of business performance and creation 
of shareholder value. We set out in the table below the remuneration policy , and in the notes following the table we provide a 
commentary on differences between this policy and that of the remuneration of employees generally . 
The following table sets out the policy relating to the key components of executive director remuneration: 
Remuneration 
component
How this component  
relates to Group strategy How this component operates in practice
Performance measures and  
maximum potential value
i) Base salary Base salary helps 
to attract, reward 
and retain the right 
calibre of executive to 
deliver the leadership/ 
management needed 
to execute the Group’s 
vision and business 
plan.
Base salary reflects the role, the executive’s skills and experience, 
and market level.
T o determine market level, the Committee reviews remuneration 
data on executive positions at companies which the Committee 
considers to be appropriate comparators.
The comparator companies are selected, with advice from the 
Committee’s remuneration advisers, taking into account relevant 
comparator factors such as, but not limited to, sector , size, and 
international presence.
On appointment, an executive director’s base salary is set at the 
market level, or below if the executive is not fully experienced at 
this level.
Where base salary on appointment is below market level to 
reflect experience, it will over time, be increased to align with 
the market level, subject to performance.
Base salaries of all executive directors are generally reviewed 
once each year .
Reviews cover: individual performance; experience; 
development in role; and market comparisons.
The base salaries of executive directors 
in post at the start of the policy 
period and who remain in the same 
role throughout the policy period will 
not usually be increased by a higher 
percentage than the average annual 
percentage increase in salaries of all 
other employees in the Group.
The only exceptions are where:
(i) an executive director has been 
appointed at below market level to 
reflect experience. In this case, the 
maximum annual increase to base salary 
will be 5% over the normal maximum; or
(ii) there is a particular reason for a higher 
increase, such as a change in the scope 
or nature of responsibilities.
In the case of the Production Director 
and the Retail and T rading Director , 
some further adjustment is envisaged 
to reflect increasing scope of roles and 
increasing experience. The maximum 
increase to base salary in any year will be 
5% over the normal maximum.
ii) Annual bonus The award of annual 
bonuses is directly 
linked to personal 
performance and to 
the achievement of 
the annual Business 
Plan targets.
The multiplicative 
formula is designed 
to ensure that bonus 
payments for high 
personal performance 
are moderated where 
business performance 
is below target, or vice 
versa.
Strategic and Business plan targets are set by the Board as part 
of the Business Plan approval process.
The Committee determines Group performance measures 
using a Scorecard.
The Scorecard shows executive directors’ annual targets 
and measures of performance (low, target and stretch), 
and weightings.
Score is zero if performance is below the low measure.
Maximum score is attributed to the stretch measure.
The Scorecard is amended each year in line with business 
strategy and objectives.
Summary Scorecard and performance results are published 
in the Annual report on remuneration.
T o determine the actual bonus awards, the following formula 
is used:
Chief Executive’s bonus
T arget bonus is 75% of base salary
Actual bonus = basic salary x 75% x company score x personal 
score
Bonus is capped at 150% of salary
Other directors’ bonus
T arget bonus is 70% of salary
Bonus = basic salary x 70% x company score x personal score
Bonus is capped at 140% of salary
Role
Maximum bonus 
potential (% of  
base salary)
Chief Executive 150%
Finance Director 140%
Production Director 140%
Retail and T rading 
Director 140%
Group performance measures
Group performance measures include 
financial, production, strategic and other 
Business Plan objectives.
These measures and weightings are 
determined by the Board and adopted by 
the Committee.
Individual performance measures
The Remuneration Committee 
determines the personal objectives 
for the Chief Executive. The Chief 
Executive proposes personal objectives 
for the other executive directors, which 
are reviewed and approved by the 
Remuneration Committee. Generally, 
all executive directors will be awarded 
a single score based on their collective 
performance in providing effective 
day-to-day leadership of the Group as a 
unified leadership team. Personal scores 
may differ in circumstances of 
exceptional over or under performance. Drax Group plc

ii) Annual bonus 
(continued)
Clawback
The Committee may require a director to repay to the Company 
such amount of any annual bonus payment as it considers 
appropriate in circumstances of financial misstatement, 
misconduct or if assessment of a performance condition is 
found to have been based on an error , inaccuracy or misleading 
information, or in other circumstances that the Committee 
considers to justify the operation of the clawback provision.
In these circumstances, Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”) clawback 
provisions may also apply (see BMP below).
iii) Deferred 
annual bonus
This is the deferred 
portion of annual 
bonus. The aim of 
deferral is to further 
align executives 
to the interests of 
shareholders, by linking 
share-based reward to 
long-term sustainable  
performance.
35% of any annual bonus is settled in shares deferred for 
three years. No performance conditions are used other than 
continued service.
If the executive leaves the Group before the normal vesting 
day, the shares will vest (prorated to the date of leaving) only if 
the termination is for a specified reason including redundancy, 
retirement or death in service, or , if for any other reason, at the 
discretion of the Committee. In any other circumstances the 
award is forfeited.
100% of the shares will vest subject to 
continued employment up to the date 
of vesting.
iv) Bonus 
Matching Plan 
(“BMP”)
This is the long-term 
incentive plan for 
executives. 
It links long-term 
share-based incentives 
to T otal Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) and to 
the achievement of 
Business Plan strategic 
targets.
The Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”) is a long-term performance 
share plan.
Under the BMP , executive directors receive an annual grant of 
conditional shares to a value of up to 1.5 times the amount of the 
executive’s annual bonus for the prior year .
It is the Committee’s policy to grant BMP awards to executive 
directors at 1.5 times the amount of the annual bonus unless the 
performance of the director or of the business makes an award 
at that level inappropriate. No payment is made for the shares.
Vesting is conditional upon service and performance conditions, 
and shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant subject 
to the achievement of performance conditions determined 
by the Committee. T o the extent that vesting is determined by 
reference to Company Scorecard performance, at the end of the 
three-year performance period, the Committee will review each 
of the annual results going into an average Scorecard calculation 
and has the discretion to adjust the final outcome based on 
events over the period to ensure that the result is consistent 
with the underlying performance progression of the business. 
In exercising its discretion the Committee will have particular 
regard to progress against the strategic objectives incorporated 
in the Scorecard.
If the executive leaves the Group before the normal vesting day, 
the shares will vest (prorated to the date of leaving and phased 
over the normal cycle of the performance periods) only if the 
termination is for a specified reason including redundancy, 
retirement or death in service, or , if for any other reason, at the 
discretion of the Committee. In any other circumstances the 
award is forfeited.
Performance condition override
The Committee will include an override provision in each grant 
under the BMP . This will give the Committee discretion to 
determine that no vesting shall occur or vesting shall be reduced 
if there are circumstances (relating to the Company’s overall 
performance or otherwise) which make vesting as calculated by 
reference to the performance conditions alone inappropriate.
Clawback
If a repayment of bonus is required (see “annual bonus” above) 
the Committee shall also make an appropriate reduction in the 
number of shares that may vest under the BMP (in respect of an 
award made pursuant to the annual bonus payment subject to 
the clawback).
The Committee may also reduce the number of shares under 
a BMP award in circumstances of financial misstatement, or if 
assessment of a performance condition is found to have been 
based on an error , inaccuracy or misleading information, or in 
other circumstances that the Committee considers to justify the 
operation of the clawback provision.
Maximum number of shares granted 
equals shares to the value of 1.5 times 
annual bonus for prior year .
Maximum vesting of shares three years 
later is subject to performance.
There are two vesting performance 
measures (vesting threshold is 15% in 
both measures):
i) up to 50% of shares vest subject to TSR 
performance over three years relative to 
FTSE 51– 150 as follows:
Below median = 0% vesting
At median = 15% vesting (threshold)
Upper quartile = 100% vesting.
ii) up to 50% of shares vest subject to 
Company Scorecard performance 
averaged over the three-year 
performance period, as follows: 
Score <1 = 0% vesting
Score 1 = 15% vesting (threshold score)
Score 1.5 = 100% vesting
The three-year average Company 
performance score is capped at 1.5.
Example:
Y ear 1 Score 1.8
Y ear 2 Score 1.4
Y ear 3 score 1.4
Three-year BMP performance score = 1.5 
For both the TSR and Scorecard 
conditions vesting between 15% and 
100% is on a straight -line interpolation.
In accordance with the rules of the 
BMP , Dividend Shares are awarded at 
the time and in the event that shares 
vest. They are calculated based on the 
dividends paid following the initial award 
until the award vests.

How this component  
relates to Group strategy How this component operates in practice
Performance measures and  
maximum potential value
v) Pension Pension provision 
is one of the 
components to attract, 
reward and retain 
the right calibre of 
executive in order 
to ensure delivery of 
the leadership and 
management needed 
to execute the Group’s 
vision and Business 
Plan.
Executive directors are entitled to non-contributory membership 
of the Group’s defined contribution pension plan. The employer’s 
contribution for executive directors is 20% of base salary.
Alternatively, at their option, executive directors may either 
have contributions of the same amounts made to their personal 
pension schemes or cash in lieu of pension at the stated rate 
and subject to normal statutory deductions; or a combination of 
pension contributions up to the HMRC Annual Allowance with 
the remainder as cash in lieu of pension.
Maximum is 20% of base salary.
vi) Other  
benefits
In general, other 
benefits aim to 
align directors’ total 
remuneration broadly 
with the market. 
In particular , all-
employee share 
plans incentivise 
sustained long-term 
performance and 
strengthen teamwork 
by enabling all 
employees to share 
in the success of the 
business. The plans are 
vehicles for aligning 
staff remuneration 
with TSR performance.
Executive directors receive a car allowance, life assurance 
( 4 times salary), the opportunity to participate in all-employee 
share plans on the same basis as other employees, annual 
private health assessment and annual private medical cover .
Relocation expenses and/or second base expenses are paid 
where appropriate in individual cases. Directors’ relocation 
expenses are determined on a case-by-case basis. The policy 
is designed to assist the director to relocate to a home of 
similar standing.
vii) Share  
ownership
The Group’s share 
ownership guidelines 
align the interests 
of executives with 
shareholders.
The share ownership guideline is that the Chief Executive 
should retain shares to the value of 175% of base salary and other 
directors should retain shares to the value of 125% of base salary. 
Until this level is reached, directors who receive shares by virtue 
of share plan awards or who receive deferred bonus shares must 
retain 50% of the shares received net (i.e. after income tax and 
national insurance contributions). Only shares that have actually 
vested count towards the threshold.
Differences between the policy and that of the remuneration of employees generally
The following differences apply between the remuneration of directors and the policy on the remuneration 
of employees generally:
 , executive directors and a number of senior employees are eligible for BMP . However , there are differences in terms of levels 
of grant.
 , annual bonus levels vary across the workforce, and the requirement to defer a portion of annual bonus applies only 
to executive directors.
 , employees in the collective bargaining unit have a contractual right to receive an annual bonus subject to Company 
performance and continued employment, whereas directors and all other UK -based employees participate in a discretionary 
bonus scheme. 
 , hourly paid employees qualify for overtime payments. Drax Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2014

Non-executive directors
Remuneration component How this component operates in practice
Annual fee The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee whilst that of the other non-executive directors is 
determined by the Chairman and the executive directors. These are determined in the light of:
 , fees of chairmen and non-executive directors of other listed companies selected for comparator purposes on the same basis 
as for executive directors; 
 , the responsibilities and time commitment; and
 , the need to attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills and experience.
The Chairman receives an annual fee.
Non-executive directors receive an annual base fee.
Additional annual fees are paid:
 , to the Senior Independent Director (which includes the fee for chairing a Board Committee other than the Audit Committee);
 , to the Chair of the Audit Committee;
 , to the Chair of the Remuneration Committee; and
 , to the Chair of any other Committee (this is not paid to the Chairman of the Nominations Committee if he or she is also the 
Chairman of the Board).
Non-executive directors’ fees are reviewed periodically against market comparators. They were last reviewed in July 2013. 
Current fee levels are shown in the annual report on remuneration.
Non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in any performance-related remuneration arrangements.
T ravel expenses Reimbursement of reasonable travel and accommodation expenses as applicable.
Non-executive directors do not receive any benefits in kind, nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus, pension or 
any of the share-based reward plans. The Chairman’s notice period is six months whilst the other non-executive directors have 
a notice period of one month.
Section 2
Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee will apply the core principles on page 80 and the remuneration components set out in the table on pages 81 
to 83 determine the remuneration of newly appointed directors. Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the 
experience of the director being appointed. Where this is below the market level, it will be adjusted over time to align with the 
market level, subject to good performance. In relation to directors appointed from outside the Company , where the Committee 
considers it to be necessary to secure the appointment of the director , the Committee may:
 , pay “sign-on” compensation for loss of benefits on resignation from a previous employer , such as loss of long-term share 
incentives (subject to the right to phase any payment to reflect performance, the requirement to mitigate loss and the right of 
the Company to clawback any amount which is subsequently paid to the executive by the former employer , and to clawback an 
appropriate proportion of the payment if the executive leaves soon after appointment) ; and
 , make appropriate payments in circumstances where a director is relocated from outside the UK.
Section 3
Service agreements
Executive directors’ service agreements are of indefinite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months’ 
prior notice.
Under each of the executive directors’ service agreements the Company has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice of 
termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued to the executive director during 
the contractual notice period.

Notes:
(1) Annual bonus threshold is assumed at 25% of maximum, target at 50% of maximum and outperformance at 100% of maximum bonus. 
(2) The BMP award threshold is assumed at 15% of maximum award and outperformance 100% of maximum, with target representing the average of the two. 
(3)  The award of conditional shares under the BMP is based on the individual’s prior year annual bonus and therefore it is assumed that corresponding threshold, target and maximum bonus is earned for 
calculating threshold, target and maximum BMP award under each scenario.
Section 5
Policy on loss of office
If an executive director’s employment is brought to an end by either party and if it is necessary to determine a termination 
payment, the Committee’s policy , in the absence of a breach of the service agreement by the director , is to determine a director’s 
termination payment in accordance with his/her service agreement. The termination payment will be calculated based on the 
value of base salary and contractual benefits that would have accrued to the director during the contractual notice period. 
The Committee will seek mitigation to reduce the amount of any termination payment to a leaving director when appropriate to 
do so, having regard to the circumstances and the law governing the agreement. It may , for example, be appropriate to consider 
mitigation if the director has secured another job at a similar level. Mitigation would not be applicable to a contractual payment in 
lieu of notice. 
In addition, the director may be entitled to a payment in respect of his/her statutory rights. No service agreement includes any 
provision for the payment of compensation upon termination. Any compensation payable in those circumstances would need 
to be determined at the time and in the light of the circumstances.
All bonus payments are discretionary benefits. The Committee will consider whether a departing director should receive an 
annual bonus in respect of the financial year in which, and/or immediately preceding which, the termination occurs, prorated 
to reflect the period of the performance year completed at the date of termination. The Committee will take into account 
performance; co-operation with succession; and any breach of goodwill and adherence to contractual obligations/restrictions. 
If the termination is by the Company on less than the specified notice in the director’s service agreement, the Committee will also 
consider whether the director should receive an annual bonus in respect of any period of the financial year following termination 
for which the director has been deprived of the opportunity to earn annual bonus. If the employment ends in any of the following 
circumstances, the director will be treated as a “good leaver” and the director will be eligible for a bonus payment:
 , redundancy;
 , retirement;
 , ill-health or disability proved to the satisfaction of the Company; and 
 , death. Drax Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2014
86
If the termination is for any other reason a bonus payment will be at the discretion of the Committee. It is the Committee’s policy to 
ensure that any such bonus payment properly reflects the departing director’s performance and behaviour towards the Company . 
Therefore the amount of any such payment will be determined as described in the table on page 81, taking into account (i) the 
director’s personal performance and behaviour towards the Company and (ii) the Group performance. If a bonus payment is made, 
it will normally be paid as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Group performance element has been determined for the 
relevant period. There may be circumstances in which the Committee considers it appropriate for the bonus payment to be made 
earlier , for example, on termination due to ill-health, in which case, on-target Group performance score shall be assumed. 
No element of any such bonus payment shall be deferred. 
The Committee will consider the extent to which deferred and conditional share awards held by the director under the BMP 
should lapse or vest. Any determination by the Committee will be in accordance with the rules of the BMP ( as approved by 
shareholders). In summary , the rules of the BMP provide that awards will vest (pro-rated to the date of employment termination) 
if employment ends for any of the following reasons:
 , redundancy;
 , retirement;
 , ill-health or disability proved to the satisfaction of the Company;
 , change of ownership; and 
 , death.
If employment ends for any other reason, the rules of the BMP require the Committee to exercise its discretion. In doing so it 
will take account of all relevant circumstances, in particular the performance of the Company; the director’s performance and 
behaviour towards the Company during the performance cycle of the relevant awards; as well as a range of other relevant 
factors, including the proximity of the award to its maturity date. The rules of the BMP also provide that in circumstances where 
awards vest, deferred bonus shares vest as soon as reasonably practicable following termination. Awards, which vest subject to 
satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions, will be (time ) prorated and will be phased over the performance cycle of the 
relevant awards. 
The Committee will consider whether the overall value of any benefits accruing to a leaving director is fair and appropriate taking 
account of all relevant circumstances. Examples of circumstances in which the Committee may be minded to award an annual 
bonus payment and/or permit the vesting of BMP awards include:
 , the director’s continued good performance up to and following the giving of notice; and
 , the director accommodating the Company in the timing of his/her departure and handover arrangements.
Conversely , the Committee may be minded not to allow such payments if the reason for the departure is:
 , poor performance; or
 , the director does not continue to perform effectively following notice; or
 , the director is departing to join a competitor . 
Section 6
Context
Wider employee population
In determining executive remuneration, the Committee also takes into account the level of general pay increases within 
the Group. 
It is the Committee’s policy that annual salary increases for executive directors should not exceed the average annual salary 
increase for the wider employee population unless there is a particular reason for a higher increase, such as a change in the nature 
or scope of responsibilities.
Views taken from the employee population
In the course of discussions on pay with employee representatives, the Group discusses executive remuneration policy and 
provides details of the process by which the Committee establishes executive remuneration packages. The information provided 
includes details of the benchmarking of executive director remuneration as well as information benchmarking the pay of 
employees in the collective bargaining unit with pay elsewhere in the industry .

Environmental, social and governance issues
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the 
remuneration of executive directors. Specific measures can be included in the balanced Corporate Scorecard. The Committee 
is able to consider those issues in considering whether to exercise its discretion to adjust the overall score, and in considering 
the performance conditions override under the BMP , as described on page 82.
Shareholder engagement
The Company holds regular meetings with its largest shareholders, and the Committee takes into account any views or 
representations of shareholders relating to executive remuneration. 
The Company has consulted its ten largest shareholders in relation to the formulation of its directors’ remuneration policy .

Personal objectives
Each executive director is primarily assessed based on their performance in delivering the Company’s strategy , enhancing 
shareholder value, their overall leadership of the Group and their respective divisions and in implementing the Company’s values. 
In addition, each executive director has specific personal objectives covering the following key areas.
Director Objective
Peter Emery , Group wide safety, environmental, engineering and plant performance and risk management;
 , Project development and execution including biomass conversion and supply chain and Industrial Emissions 
Directive compliance;
 , Development of the carbon capture and storage project consistent with agreed objectives; and
 , External representation of the Company in industry and business communities.
T ony Quinlan , Strategic developments;
 , Effective investor communications;
 , Efficient cash flow and balance sheet management;
 , Maintenance of core financial controls and system improvements; and 
 , Development of senior finance support team. 
Paul T aylor , Strategic developments;
 , Commodity trading performance;
 , Retail sales operations and strategy;
 , Logistics and optimisation; and 
 , Lead commercial process and systems programme coordination.
Dorothy Thompson , Development of strategy and clear strategic objectives;
 , Lead process to embed the Group’s core values; 
 , Maintain effective external communications on regulation and policy;
 , Leadership for biomass transformation; and 
 , Financial performance.
The Committee assessed the performance of each of the executive directors against the broad leadership and specific objectives. 
The executive directors, as members of the Executive Committee, were assessed as providing effective day-to-day leadership 
of the Group as a unified leadership team. Each were considered to have met or exceeded personal targets. The assessment 
resulted in a personal score of 1.2 for each director .
For 2014 bonus awards, the target bonuses for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors were 75% and 70% of base 
salary respectively . Their maximum bonuses were 150% and 140% of base salary respectively . 65% of any bonus award is paid in 
cash and 35% is deferred in shares that vest after three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves the Group other than as a 
“good leaver” before the end of that period.

Notes:
(1)  In accordance with the BMP Rules, Dividend shares are only awarded, at the time and in the event that, awards actually vest. No Dividend shares are awarded where the initial awards lapse. The number of 
Dividend shares awarded is calculated based on the actual dividends paid to ordinary shareholders in the period following the initial award up until the award vests. 
(2) The Deferred Awards referred to above are the share awards made in respect of the deferral of cash bonus awarded each year. Those share awards operate under the rules of the BMP . 
(3) Details of the conditions subject to which the above awards will vest are given on page 82.
(4) The face value of the awards is calculated based on the share price on 31 December 2014, which was 460.60 pence per share.

T otal pension entitlements for defined contribution schemes (Audited information)
Executive directors are entitled to non-contributory membership of the Group’s defined contribution pension plan with 
either an employer contribution of 20% of base salary , or have contributions to a personal pension, or cash in lieu of pension, 
or a combination of any of these up to a maximum contribution of 20% of base salary .
No director was a member of the defined benefit scheme.
Payments for loss of office
No director left the business during the year and therefore no payments for loss of office were made to directors during 
the financial year .

Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests (Audited information)
During the year , the shareholding guidelines required executive directors who receive shares by virtue of share plan awards or who 
receive deferred bonus shares to retain 50% of the shares received net (i.e. after income tax and national insurance contributions) 
until the value was equal to at least 175% and 125% of salary respectively for the Chief Executive and other executive directors. 
Only shares that have actually vested count towards the threshold. 
In March 2014, immediately post the vesting of the 2011 BMP Awards, the shareholding guidelines were fully met to the 
extent that the value of the Chief Executive’s shareholding was 311% of salary and each of the other executive directors held 
between 137% and 175% of salary . The following table shows the executive directors’ shareholdings and share interests at 
31 December 2014.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Drax Group plc
Opinion on financial statements of 
Drax Group plc 
In our opinion: 
 , the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2014 and of the group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
 , the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
 , the parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 , the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated income 
statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, the Consolidated and parent company balance sheets, 
the Consolidated cash flow statement, the Consolidated 
statement of changes in equity , the related Group notes 1 to 36 
and the related parent Company only notes 1 to 8. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
parent Company financial statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice ). 
Going concern 
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the 
directors’ statement that the Group is a going concern, 
contained within the operational and financial performance 
review. We confirm that:
 , we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 
financial statements is appropriate; and
 , we have not identified any material uncertainties that may 
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern
However , because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below 
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy , the 
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team and are the same risks as identified in 
the prior year . 
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Useful economic life and carrying value of property, plant and 
equipment 
The net book value of fixed assets at 31 December 2014 is 
£1.7 billion (2013: £1.6 billion). The assessment and timing of 
whether assets meet the capitalisation criteria set out in IAS 16 
Property , Plant and Equipment, the estimation of appropriate 
useful economic lives and the assessment of whether any 
impairment indicators are present, such as redundant assets, 
all require judgement. Further explanation is included in 
the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and 
assumptions in note 3 and the Audit Committee report on 
page 7 4.
We tested a sample of fixed asset additions to third party 
evidence such as purchase invoice and bank statement 
to assess the validity , valuation and appropriateness of 
capitalisation of those additions. 
We considered the circumstances as to whether any additions 
or prevailing events would give rise to indicators of impairment 
such as redundant assets.
We reviewed management assumptions over the carrying 
value and useful economic life of key assets by consideration 
of internal and external available data. We challenged 
management’s assumptions in estimating the useful economic 
lives of existing and new assets capitalised in the year based 
on our knowledge of the business.
Valuation of commodity contracts 
The valuation of commodity contracts is complex and requires 
judgement in areas such as estimates of future prices, market 
movements and assumptions of credit risk.
The accounting standards governing the availability and 
application of hedge accounting are complex, and require 
judgement in their applications.
Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the 
Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and 
assumptions in note 3 and the Audit Committee report on 
page 7 4.
We used financial instruments specialists to test 
management’s key judgements and calculations, including 
testing a sample of trades undertaken to supporting trade 
tickets confirming key information such as volumes and 
market price. We challenged the assumptions involved in 
determining valuation, hedge effectiveness and credit risk, 
including analysis of the forward price curves used and hedge 
effectiveness documentation maintained. Drax Group plc

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Drax Group plc ( continued)
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk 
Valuation of biomass and coal stocks 
Biomass stocks of £80 million and coal stocks of £148 million 
(2013: £36m and £14 1m respectively) are held on the balance 
sheet at year end. The valuation of biomass and coal stocks 
is dependent upon the estimation or measurement of the 
tonnage held, the calorific value, its purchase price and its 
net realisable value. The weighted average cost calculation 
is complex for both coal and biomass and this results in 
increasing risk of management error or bias and therefore an 
increased risk of material misstatement. Further details of the 
key accounting policy judgements are included in note 3.
Our audit procedures include testing the underlying weighted 
average cost calculation for both coal and biomass to source 
data such as purchase invoice for amounts delivered in the 
year . This also included sample testing of the calorific value to 
third party laboratory reports or purchase invoice.
We also assessed the results of external surveys completed 
on the coal pile and attended the survey to assess the controls 
over the accuracy of the survey . We assessed biomass 
deliveries and usage associated with the calculation of 
biomass volumes held at the year end.
On a sample basis we also received external stock confirmation 
for stocks held off site.
Valuation and recoverability of Renewable Obligation 
Certificates (ROCs)
£17 4 million of ROCs are held on the balance sheet at the year 
end (2013: £140 million). ROCs are recognised as they are 
earned through generating electricity from burning biomass 
and initially recognised at fair value (reducing the cost of 
biomass in the income statement) and subsequently written 
down to the net realisable value as appropriate. Judgement is 
required from management in estimating both the initial fair 
value and estimated net realisable value, including the value 
of any recycling fund element. Further detail is explained in 
the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and 
assumptions in note 3 and the Audit Committee report on 
page 7 4.
We have assessed the initial fair value of ROCs by agreement 
of the buy-out price to available third party supporting 
information and external sales agreements. 
We have also challenged the estimation by management 
of the recycling fund element which impacts the estimated 
net realisable value of the ROCs held in the balance sheet at 
year end. This included comparison to other available third 
party estimates.
We gain assurance over the ROCs generated in the year by 
agreement to Ofgem confirmation certificates and available 
burn data.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed 
in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts 
or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not 
modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and 
we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning 
the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of 
our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £6. 1 million 
(2013: £10 million), which is approximately 5% (2013: 7%) of 
adjusted pre-tax profit, and below 1% (2013: 1%) of equity . Pre-
tax profit has been adjusted by excluding the effect of volatility 
from unrealised gains or losses on derivative contracts and 
the one-off CESP settlement ( as described in note 2) from our 
determination. Adjusted pre-tax profit is an appropriate base 
for determining materiality as shareholders place significant 
value on the income statement, adjusted for these items. 
The percentage applied to adjusted pre-tax profit has been 
reduced to align more closely with comparable companies.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0. 1 million 
(2013: £0.2 million), as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters 
that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of 
the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of 
the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, 
and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group 
level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit 
scope primarily on the audit work at three locations (2013: 
the same three locations), being Drax Power , Haven Power 
and Drax Biomass. All of these were subject to a full audit. 
These three locations represent the principal business units 
and account for all of the Group’s net assets, revenue and profit 
before tax. They were also selected to provide an appropriate 
basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material 
misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the three 
locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to 
each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality 
and ranged from £2. 9 million to £5.5 million (2013: £5. 0 million 
to 8.5 million). 
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation 
process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our 
conclusion that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement of the aggregated financial information of 
the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of 
specified account balances.
The Group audit team follow a programme of planned visits 
that has been designed so that the Senior Statutory Auditor 
visits the most significant locations where the Group audit 
scope was focused at least once a year . In years when we 
do not visit a significant component we will include the 
component audit partner in our team briefing, discuss their risk 
assessment and review documentation of the findings from 
their work. Drax Group plc

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
 , the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
 , the information given in the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if , in our opinion:
 , we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
 , adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company , or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or
 , the parent Company financial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report 
if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
have not been made or the part of the Directors’ remuneration 
report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from 
these matters.
Corporate governance statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the 
part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from 
our review. 
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), 
we are required to report to you if , in our opinion, information 
in the annual report is:
 , materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
 , apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired 
in the course of performing our audit; or
 , otherwise misleading.
In particular , we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement 
that they consider the Annual report is fair , balanced and 
understandable and whether the Annual report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the 
Audit Committee which we consider should have been 
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
 Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities 
statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 
1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to 
ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, 
understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a 
body , in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body , for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error . This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the 
parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
1General information
Simplifying the numbers… These notes provide additional detail on the disclosures within our annual report and accounts. 
Throughout the notes we have included explanations of the information presented. In general, the notes to the financial 
statements include additional information required by law, International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) or other 
regulations to facilitate a better , more detailed understanding of the primary financial statements set out on pages 100 to 104.
Our business model… Where relevant to do so, we have set out key elements of our business model and strategy (see pages 6 
to 15) and how pursuit of this has impacted our financial results.
Drax Group plc (the “Company”) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries 
(together the “Group”) predominantly operate in the electricity generation and supply industry within the UK. The address of the 
Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby , North Y orkshire YO8 8PH, United Kingdom. 
The principal operating companies of the Group are disclosed in note 4 to the Company’s separate financial statements, which 
follow these consolidated financial statements. The principal activities of the Group are the sourcing of fuel from both domestic 
and international sources, the generation and sale of electricity into the wholesale market at Drax Power Station, and the sale of 
retail electricity to business consumers by Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”).
2Basis of preparation
This section describes the accounting standards we have followed in preparing these financial statements and the 
interpretation of accounting standards into accounting policies which are relevant to our Group. Wherever possible, we have 
explained how our accounting policies work in practice within the relevant note to the consolidated financial statements, 
and have not sought to repeat that information here. 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the 
consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as explained in Operational and financial performance 
on page 44, and on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value. 
Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial results of the Company and of all entities controlled by 
the Company , (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year . The company owns 100% of the equity of all subsidiaries 
consolidated within these financial statements.
The impact of all intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
Accounting policies
Those accounting policies that are material to the understanding of our financial statements have been incorporated within 
the relevant note or are set out below:
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, 
VA T and other sales-related taxes, and excluding transactions with or between group companies.
Revenues from the sale of electricity are recorded based upon output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or 
prevailing market rates as applicable.
Revenues from sales of ROCs and LECs are recorded at the invoiced value, net of VA T . Revenue is recognised when the risks and 
rewards of ownership have been substantially transferred to a third party , that being when the ROC or LEC is transferred to the 
account of that third party .  Drax Group plc  
Annual report and accounts 2014

Notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued)
2. Basis of preparation ( continued)
Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of similar nature and value, the exchange is not treated as giving 
rise to revenue. Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a dissimilar nature, the exchange is treated as 
giving rise to revenue. The revenue is measured at the fair value of goods or services received, adjusted by the amount of any cash 
or cash equivalents received or paid. If the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be measured reliably , the revenue 
is measured at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents received 
or paid.
Revenue from the sale of electricity directly to customers through our retail business, Haven Power is recorded after deduction of 
agreed discounts, VA T and Climate Change Levy . Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity when a contract exists, supply 
has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered 
at the point of sale. Energy supplied, but not yet measured or billed, is calculated based on consumption statistics and selling 
price estimates.
Foreign currency transactions
T ransactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction and from 
the translation at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, are recognised in the income 
statement within finance costs.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional currency other than sterling are translated to sterling using 
published exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of such operations are translated to sterling using 
the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the retranslation of 
these operations are recognised in reserves.
Community Energy Saving Programme (“CESP”)
As described in Operating and financial performance on page 39, during the year the Group reached settlement with Ofgem 
regarding its non-compliance with CESP . 
As settlement has been agreed at the balance sheet date, full provision has been made in the financial statements for the 
anticipated economic flows. T rade and other payables include an accrual for the £25 million cash settlement due to Ofgem and 
National Energy Action. T rade and other receivables include an income accrual for the £5 million settlement reached with a 
third party for related breach of contract.
Recognising the materiality of the settlement to the Group in both quantitative and qualitative terms, the net settlement has been 
presented separately on the face of the income statement.
The settlement with Ofgem incorporates £3 million of additional remedies that will be delivered by a third party as further 
consumer redress measures. This represents the settlement of an obligation with services and has no financial impact on the 
Group. Accordingly no entries have been made in the financial statements in respect of this element of the transaction.
As a transaction that is one-off in nature and does not reflect the ongoing operational performance of the Group, the impact 
of the CESP settlement has been excluded from our non-statutory financial performance measures, including EBITDA and 
underlying profit.
Non-statutory measures of financial performance
We present two non-statutory measures on the face of the income statement. Our non-statutory measures exclude certain items, 
including any transactions considered to be one-off in nature, to provide a measure of the underlying trading and operational 
performance of the Group.
EBITDA is the primary measure we use to assess our financial performance. EBITDA is defined as profit before interest, tax, 
depreciation, amortisation and unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts. In 2014, it excludes the one-off settlement of 
CESP described above.
Underlying measures, including underlying profit before and after tax and underlying earnings per share (EPS) exclude the impact 
of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and, in 2014, the one-off settlement of CESP . Underlying profit after tax and 
EPS exclude the post -tax effect of these items.
Under our current distribution policy , dividends are calculated based upon 50% of underlying profit after tax. A reconciliation from 
profit for the year attributable to equity holders to underlying profit after tax is provided in note 9. Drax Group plc

Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
In 2014, a number of new, amended or revised standards and interpretations became effective. The Group adopted the following 
standards from 1 January 2014:
IAS 32 ( amended) – Offset ting financial assets and liabilities.
IFRS 10 ( amended) – Consolidat ed financial st at ements.
IFRS 12 ( amended) – Disclosure of int erests in other entities.

IAS 36 ( amended) – Impairment of Assets.
IAS 39 ( amended) – F inancial Instruments : Recognition & Measurement .
IFRIC 12 (interpretation) – Lev i es.
The adoption of these standards and interpretations has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The disclosures required by IFRS 12 in respect of the Group’s interest in Capture Power Limited have been included at note 12.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and relevant interpretations, which have not 
been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective ( and some of which were pending endorsement 
by the EU):

IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Cust omers – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 . 
IAS 19 ( amended) – Defined Benefit P lans : E mployee Contributions – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 
February 2015. 
Annual improvements to 2010-2012 Cycle – all amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 
February 2015. 
Annual improvements to 2011-2013 Cycle – all amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2015.

effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. 
IAS 1 ( amended) – P resent ation of F inancial S t at ements – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2016.
The Group is in the process of assessing the full impact of adopting IFRS 9 . The Group currently intends to adopt the standard in 
the earliest permitted accounting period, subject to endorsement by the EU.
Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of 
the Group. Drax Group plc

Notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued)
3 Accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect 
the values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of income and expenditure recorded during the period. These estimates 
are based on our reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions that require judgement, but the actual amount may 
ultimately differ from the initial or subsequent estimates.
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The most important of these judgements – those that carry the most significant risk of an outcome that differs from the amount 
recognised in the financial statements – are as follows:
Property, plant and equipment – Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually , taking into account prices 
prevailing at each balance sheet date. The carrying values of property , plant and equipment are also reviewed for impairment 
where there has been a trigger event (that is, an event which may have resulted in impairment) by assessing the present value 
of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book value. The calculation of estimated future cash 
flows and residual values is based on management’s reasonable estimates of future prices, output and costs, and is therefore 
subjective. Estimated useful lives are based on past experience, future replacement cycles and other available evidence; however 
an inherent degree of judgement remains.
Derivatives – Derivative financial instruments are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value 
of derivatives are recorded for each period in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The fair values of 
derivative instruments for commodities and foreign exchange rates are determined using forward price curves. Forward price 
curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement 
of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward price curves upon 
readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally 
extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves. However , the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how 
future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective. Where derivative financial instruments include options these are valued 
using an option pricing model. Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, 
discount rate and assumptions around volatility based on historical movements. The inputs include assumptions around future 
transactions and market movements, as well as credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.
ROCs and LECs – ROCs and LECs are stated within the balance sheet at fair value on the date of recognition and subsequently 
written down to net realisable value where appropriate. Inherent in the calculation of this fair value and in the estimate of net 
realisable value is an assumption regarding future sales prices in the market. Historic experience indicates that the assumptions 
used in the valuation are reasonable; however actual sales prices may differ .
Other accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
Pensions – The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the 
projected unit credit method and actuarial valuations of the plan assets and liabilities are carried out as at the balance sheet 
date. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases, 
and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that 
the assumptions utilised in recording obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions 
and the advice of scheme actuaries. However , actual results may differ from such assumptions.
T axation – In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure 
for tax purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with 
advisers. Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have 
been substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be 
recovered, taking into account the nature of the losses, and the certainty of the relevant offsetting income streams.
Impairment – The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy 
detailed in note 10. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations. 
These calculations require the use of estimates.
Inventories – Fuel inventories are valued on a weighted average cost basis according to invoiced purchase prices, limited to net 
realisable value where appropriate. The quantum of fuel on-site is calculated using a number of complementary methodologies 
with the most prudent adoption for financial accounting purposes. Whilst value is largely based on observable costs, an element 
of judgement remains in determining the requirement, if any , for a provision against stock values based on available data such as 
market price trends and independent stock surveys and also in determining appropriate values in respect of fuel received but not 
invoiced at the balance sheet date. Drax Group plc

4 Segmental reporting
We view our operational business as two distinct areas – or segments – the generation of electricity at Drax Power Station 
(“Generation”) and the supply of power to business customers (“Retail”). The respective financial performance of these 
segments is shown here ( and described in far greater detail in Operational and financial performance on pages 32 to 37). 
The costs incurred by our US business, which is still in the development phase, during the current and previous year have been 
included in the Generation segment.
The Generation business segment spans all three core activities of the Group in that it incorporates sourcing of coal, biomass 
and other fuels, generation and supply (through its sales to the wholesale electricity market).
The Retail business segment contributes to the supply activities of the Group, through sales direct to the small and medium 
enterprise and industrial and commercial markets.
Grow our retail business… Haven Power , our retail business, has demonstrated strong sales volume growth in the current and 
previous year . 
Information reported to the Board and for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is organised 
into two operating segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment, presented to the Board on a regular 
basis, is EBITDA.

Assets and working capital are monitored on a Group basis, with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made in the 
management accounts, and accordingly no separate asset disclosure is made here. However , spend on key capital projects 
is monitored. T otal spend on the biomass transformation project during 2014 was £125 million (2013: £228 million), of which 
£85 million (2013: £117 million) relates to construction of assets within our US business. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements. The revenue and results of both reporting segments presented are subject to 
seasonality as detailed in Operational and financial performance, page 44.
Major customers
T otal revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 includes amounts of £320.6million and £288.7 million (2013: £222.3 million) 
derived from two customers (2013: single customer), each representing 10% or more of the Group’s revenue for the year . 
These revenues arose in the generation segment.

7 T axation
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the amount payable on this year’s taxable profits (which 
are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax, or in some cases for items upon which we are required to pay 
additional tax in respect of tax-disallowed expenditure ). Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more 
or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules.
The tax charge/( credit) reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 
2014 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year , so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid ( or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not 
that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
In light of the complex nature of the CESP settlement, there is currently uncertainty as to the likely level of any tax deduction 
available for the net settlement cost, on this basis no tax relief has been recognised in respect of this matter in these 
financial statements.

8 Dividends
Dividends are amounts we return to our shareholders and are paid as an amount per ordinary share held. Our current dividend 
policy is to return 50% of underlying earnings (see note 9) to our shareholders each year . The remaining 50% is retained for 
reinvestment in the future growth of the business.

55. 0 78.8
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve 
payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2014 of 7 .2 pence per share ( equivalent to approximately £29. 0 million) 
payable on or before 15 May 2015. The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2014.
9 Earnings per share
Earnings per share (“EPS”) represents the amount of our earnings (post -tax profits) that are attributable to each ordinary share 
we have in issue. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were 
in issue during the year . Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options (such as those to be issued under 
our employee share schemes – see note 26), that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and 
treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS as it reflects the figures upon which our annual dividends are calculated 
(note 8). Underlying EPS removes the post -tax effect of fair value movements on derivative contracts and the CESP 
settlement, incurred in 2014, from earnings. Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will give the total dividends per share for 
the period.

1 0 Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business, when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired. 
All of our goodwill relates to the acquisition of Haven Power , our retail business, in 2009. Other intangibles include any amounts 
paid in respect of carbon emission allowances for future years.

Goodwill
Goodwill arising on the Haven Power acquisition has been allocated to the Haven Power cash-generating unit. At 31 December 
2014, the fair value of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value reflecting Haven Power’s cash generative profile. 
Sensitivity analysis performed over the goodwill balance indicates the level of change required is beyond what would be 
considered reasonably possible. Accordingly this sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed. 
The recoverable amount of Haven Power is calculated annually , based on a value in use calculation. The key assumptions in 
this calculation relate to the discount rate and future cash flows. Management estimates the discount rate using a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business. The first five years of 
cash flows are based upon the five year Business Plan approved by the Board. Future cash flows have been taken in perpetuity , 
assuming no growth rate is applied to the final year of the Business Plan. The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows 
from Haven Power is 8% reflecting a reasonable assumption of the applicable cost of capital. 
Carbon assets
Carbon assets arise upon the purchase of CO
2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated and required for the 
current financial year and are recognised at cost, net of any impairment.
The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation 
for the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year , and to the 
extent further purchases are required, the market price at the balance sheet date.
All carbon assets brought forward or purchased during 2014 were utilised by the end of the year . Drax Group plc

1 1 Property , plant and equipment
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our business. 
The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation is calculated by taking that cost, net of 
any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful economic life of the asset. An asset’s net book value is its 
cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date.
We construct many of our assets under long-term projects. Assets that are in the course of construction are not depreciated 
until they are ready for us to use in the way intended.
Delivering our biomass strategy… Additions in 2014 include a further £125 million on our biomass transformation project, which 
remains on schedule and budget. Our two pellet plants, in Mississippi and Louisiana, both entered a commissioning phase and 
our port facility at Baton Rouge is now pellet ready . At Drax Power Station, two converted biomass units are now running fully 
on the bespoke receipt, storage and distribution systems that entered service at the end of 2013.
Accounting policy
Property , plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price ( after deducting trade discounts 
and rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable 
of operating in the manner intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and 
removing the item and restoring the site. Property , plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
provision for impairment in value. Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation is provided on a straight -line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives 
of the assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station). 
The estimated useful lives, beginning in 2004 when they were reset, are currently:
Years
Main generating plant and freehold buildings Up to 35
Other plant and machinery 3-25
Decommissioning asset 35
Plant spare parts 35
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually , taking into account commercial and technological obsolescence 
as well as normal wear and tear , and any provision for impairment. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance 
sheet date.
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or 
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely , when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably . All other repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Drax Group plc

Impairment
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property , plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that 
these assets may have suffered an impairment loss. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference 
to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the asset (value in use ) or sales value net of expenses. If an asset is 
impaired, a provision is made to reduce its carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount. The discount rate applied 
to future cash flows for this purpose is a pre-tax rate based upon the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and reflects the 
current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.

1 2 Investments in joint ventures
Capture Power Limited (“CPL ”) is the company responsible for the development, implementation and operation of the proposed 
White Rose Carbon Capture and Storage (“CCS”) project. The Group holds a 33% investment in CPL. This note explains how our 
investment in CPL is accounted for and how the financial position and performance of CPL affects that of the Group. CPL is 
currently conducting a Front End Engineering and Design study which is expected to conclude around the end of 2015. Drax 
has committed £ 4 million in funding to support this process, £3 million of which was incurred and recognised in operating 
expenditure within 2014.
Committed to sustainability… CPL represents an integral part of our commitment towards a low carbon economy .

Our investment in Capture Power Limited of £1 (2013: £1) is accounted for using the equity method in these consolidated financial 
statements as the Group exerts significant influence by virtue of its ownership interest. Under the equity method, the group’s 
initial investment is recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the investee. Where the Group’s 
share of losses exceeds the Group’s interest, recognition of losses is discounted with further losses only recognised to the extent 
that the Group has incurred a legal or constructive obligation or made payments on behalf of the investee. 
Based upon relevant management information, prepared in accordance with IFRS, as at 31 December 2014, Capture Power 
Limited held net liabilities of £7 . 4 million (2013: £nil) and incurred a loss for the year there-ended of £7 . 4 million (2013: £nil) reflecting 
the commencement of operations early in 2014 and the developmental activities undertaken in the year . The Group’s share of 
losses for the year was therefore £2.5 million (2013: £nil). Accordingly , the Group’s net investment in Capture Power Limited is fully 
written down with a carrying value in these financial statements of £nil, and therefore there is no entry in the Balance Sheet. 
The unrecognised portion of the Group’s share of losses, both for the year and cumulatively , is £2.5 million. The Group received no 
dividends from Capture Power Limited during the year .
13 Inventories
We hold stocks of fuels and other consumables that we use in the process of generating electricity . This note shows the cost of 
coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables that we held at the end of the year , including items at Drax Power Station, and 
those owned by us but stored in off -site locations.
Our fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.
The cost of fuel stocks includes the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the 
UK carbon price support mechanism) and transport/handling costs.
Delivering our biomass strategy… The increasing cost of carbon, including the carbon price support mechanism, added 
£56 million to our fuel costs in 2014. The relative economics of coal and biomass generation going forward underpins our 
transformation strategy , as biomass margins are more favourable than coal margins.

1 4 ROC and LEC assets
We earn ROC and LEC assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets (“Ofgem”), as a result of 
burning renewable biomass to generate electricity . This note sets out the value of such assets we have earned but not yet sold. 
Delivering our biomass strategy and growing our retail business… As we generate more of our electricity by burning renewable 
biomass, the volume and therefore the total value of ROC and LEC assets we generate will increase. As Haven Power grows, it 
provides us with a credit -efficient and timely route to market for these ROCs and LECs.
ROCs and LECs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and initially measured at fair value based 
on anticipated sales prices. At each reporting date the Group reviews the fair value of ROC and LEC assets generated but 
not sold against updated anticipated sales prices. Any impairments required are recognised in the income statement in the 
period incurred.

1 5 T rade and other receivables
T rade and other receivables represents amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but not 
yet been paid for . The note includes accrued income, which is income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in 
respect of power delivered that will be invoiced the following month, and prepayments, which are amounts paid by the Group 
for which we are yet to receive the relevant goods or service in return ( e.g. insurance premiums we have paid for that will be 
utilised within the year).
T rade and other receivables, given their short tenor , are measured at cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established subsequently where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according 
to the original terms of the receivable.

T rade receivables principally represent sales of electricity to a number of counterparties within both our generation and retail 
businesses. At 31 December 2014, the Group had amounts receivable from four (2013: five ) significant counterparties within the 
generation business, representing 68% (2013: 69%) of trade receivables, all of which paid within 15 days of receipt of invoice in line 
with agreed terms.  Drax Group plc

1 5. T rade and other receivables ( continued)
Of total trade receivables at 31 December 2014, £34 million (2013: £18 million) relates to retail power sales. The risk profile of 
retail debt is different to that of the generation business with a larger volume of counterparties, and hence lower concentration 
of credit risk, of varying size with different payment terms. All past -due receivables are assessed against the Group’s credit risk 
policies for indicators of impairment and provisions made where appropriate. The value of retail debts that are past -due and not 
provided against, in accordance with this assessment are not material. 
Accordingly management does not consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the normal provision 
for doubtful debts of £6.8 million (2013: £5.6 million). This provision, which relates entirely to retail receivables, has been 
determined with reference to past default experiences in line with our policies. Credit and counterparty risk are both discussed in 
further detail in note 22.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table:

T rade and other payables represent amounts we owe to our suppliers (for goods and services provided), tax authorities and 
other creditors that are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business. We make accruals for amounts that will fall due for 
payment in the future as a result of our activities in the current year ( e.g. fuel we have received but for which we have not yet 
been invoiced).

Accruals include amounts in respect of fuel received and not yet invoiced of £12 4.3 million (2013: £7 4. 4 million). As described in 
note 2, accruals also reflect £25 million in respect of the Group’s obligations under the settlement of CESP agreed with Ofgem in 
November 2014.
The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU ETS. 
Accruals at 31 December 2014 include £12.2 million (2013: £9.2 million) with respect to the Group’s estimated net liability to deliver 
CO
2 emissions allowances. Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.
1 9 Borrowings
Borrowings are chiefly comprised of bank loans with fixed maturity repayment profiles between 2016 and 2025. 
Maximising the value of the Group… In April 2013, we agreed a new £75 million amortising term loan facility with Friends Life, 
underpinned by a guarantee from HM T reasury under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme. This replaced £50 million of 
the £100 million facility with the UK Green Investment Bank agreed in 2012.
In May 2014, we agreed a new private placement for £100 million with various funds managed by M&G investments. 
The new loan facilities, which were fully drawn at the year end, enhance the financing structure executed in previous years 
by providing additional liquidity and a smoother profile of debt maturities.
The Group measures all debt instruments, whether financial assets or financial liabilities, initially at the fair value, which equates 
to the principal value, of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. T ransaction costs ( any such costs incremental and directly attributable 
to the issue of the financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, amortised through 
the income statement over the life of the instrument.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. Drax Group plc

20 Derivative financial instruments
We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities (principally power , coal, sustainable 
biomass and CO 2 emissions allowances) to secure market level dark green and bark spreads on future electricity sales, and also 
financial contracts (principally currency exchange contracts and financial coal and oil derivatives) to fix sterling cash flows.
We hold these contracts for risk management purposes, to manage key risks facing the business including commodity price 
risk, and foreign currency risk (see note 22).
The accounting rules for derivative contracts are complex. At the balance sheet date all contracts (subject to certain 
exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence the difference between the price we have 
secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time. Changes in fair value are recognised 
either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in question qualifies as an 
effective hedge under IFRS (see note 28).
Managing our principal risks and uncertainties… A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to our business model. 
Our policy is to lock down exposures to commodity price movements and changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative 
contracts such as those described above. This strategy aims to de-risk the business, providing security and certainty over cash 
flows into the future.
Accounting policy
Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from 
fair value mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for our own 
purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.
Contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption – principally power , financial coal, CO
2 emissions allowances and 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts – are accounted for as derivatives and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value, 
with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve (note 28) to the extent that the contracts are designated as 
effective hedges in accordance with IAS 39, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met.
Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current 
assets or liabilities. Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities. Drax Group plc

The total movement in the fair value of these contracts of £166.2 million (2013: £168. 9 million loss) is recognised in the income 
statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 are met, as follows:

Unrealised gains/(losses) on derivative contracts recognised in the hedge reserve (note 28) 100. 4 (58.7)
T otal unrealised gains/(losses) on derivative contracts 166.2 (168. 9 )
Unrealised gains in the income statement in 2014 are primarily the result of changes in the fair value of our forward currency 
exchange contracts. We undertook an extensive currency hedging programme in the prior year to secure the sterling cost of 
fuel purchases made in foreign currencies. The high volume of contracts held ( demonstrated in the table on page 126) means 
low levels of exchange rate volatility can have a significant impact on amounts recognised in our income statement in respect 
of these contracts. The vast majority of our fuel purchases, and therefore our currency exchange contracts, are denominated 
in US dollars. The strengthening of the US dollar against sterling during 2014 offset previous losses driven by weakening during 
previous periods, resulting in significant unrealised gains in the current year .
These were offset by unrealised losses on our financial oil contracts as a result of falling oil prices in the final quarter of 2014. 
We utilise financial contracts to fix oil indexation in fuel purchase contracts.
Unrealised gains recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect gains on the portion of our forward currency exchange 
contracts that are designated in effective hedge relationships in accordance with IAS 39 and forward contracts for the sale of 
power which have increased in value relative to the market as prices fell in the second half of 2014. Drax Group plc

Fair value measurement
 , Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of commodity contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, not 
excluded through the own use exemption, are calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. 
As contracts are generally short -term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. The quoted 
market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the quoted price for financial liabilities is the 
current ask price.
 , Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
 , Other financial contracts fair value – The fair value of other financial contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, 
not excluded through the own use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. 
As contracts are generally short -term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. Where contracts were found to 
contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host 
contract, and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.
Categorisation within the fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that 
is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability as follows:
Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices ( unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities;
Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are 
observable for the asset or liability , either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) ; and
Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data ( unobservable inputs). 
The fair value of both commodity contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts is largely determined by 
comparison between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2. 
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs. 
21 Other financial instruments
We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and 
receivables arising from our operations.
Fair value
Cash and cash equivalents (note 17), short -term investments (note 16), trade and other receivables (note 15), and trade and other 
payables (note 18) generally have short times to maturity . For this reason, their carrying values approximate to their fair value. 
The Group’s borrowings (note 19) relate principally to amounts drawn down against term loans, the carrying amounts of which 
approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments. Drax Group plc

Notes to the consolidated financial statements ( continued)
22 Financial risk disclosures
IFRS require us to provide information that assists you in understanding the nature and extent of risks arising from the financial 
instruments we hold, described in the two previous notes. Such risks include liquidity , credit and counterparty risk.
We also describe below the wider financial risks that we manage using financial instruments, for example how derivative 
contracts minimise our exposure to commodity market and foreign currency risk.
Risk
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, 
liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability 
of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by the risk 
management committees as detailed in Principal risks and uncertainties (page 46) which identify , evaluate and hedge financial 
risks in close co-operation with the Group’s trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity , the price of coal, 
sustainable biomass and other fuels, and the price of CO
2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have 
historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO
2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so. 
All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash 
flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity . 
The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different 
maturities from a variety of domestic and international sources. All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a 
fixed price and financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow hedges 
as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal. 
The Group purchases CO
2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of 
domestic and international sources. All commitments to purchase CO 2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are 
designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO 2 
emissions allowances. 
Commodity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items 
at the balance sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date. 
If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:
 , profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2014 would increase/decrease by £9. 4 million (2013: increase/decrease by 
£6.3 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to financial coal and oil derivatives; and
 , the hedge reserve would decrease/increase by £12. 0 million (2013: decrease/increase by £27 . 0 million) mainly as a result of the 
changes in the fair value of commitments to sell power .
Interest rate risk
Historically the Group has been exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its bank debt, and has sought to mitigate 
this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities. The Group has no interest rate swaps outstanding at 
the balance sheet date; however this risk management tool remains available to the Group. Information about the Group’s 
instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is included below.
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the 
balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance 
sheet date was outstanding for the whole year . 
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and net assets for 
the year ended 31 December 2014 would decrease/increase by £1. 4 million (2013: decrease/increase by £1. 0 million) as a result of 
the changes in interest payable during the period. Drax Group plc

Marketplace, performance and risk Sustainable business review Governance Financials Overview
22. Financial risk disclosures ( continued)
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered to hedge fixed price international coal purchases in US dollars, 
biomass purchases in US dollars, Canadian dollars and euros, and CO
2 emissions allowances purchases in euros. As our 
biomass transformation plans have progressed, we have entered into an increasing volume of forward foreign exchange 
contracts. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising a variety of foreign currency 
exchange contracts.
Foreign currency sensitivity
If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, 
the Group’s:
 , profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2014 would decrease/increase by £26 1. 0 million (2013: decrease/increase by 
£198. 9 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts entered in relation 
to fuel purchase contracts; and
 , other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £ 48.7 million (2013: decrease/increase by £ 4 9.6 million) as a result of the 
changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts.
Liquidity risk
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity , funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board 
of directors. Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. 
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for 
business requirements. 
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include 
both interest and principal cash flows. T o the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from 
interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

Counterparty risk
As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of fuel, sustainable biomass and other goods and services, it is exposed 
to the risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers. If a large supplier falls into financial difficulty and/or fails to deliver 
against the contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing fuel from other suppliers. 
The Group enters into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure 
of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase 
the risk profile of the Group.
Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, 
as summarised below:

T rade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £6.8 million (2013: £5.6 million). 
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by risk management committees. 
Where considered appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee, 
letter of credit, deed of charge, or cash collateral. In addition, where deemed appropriate the Group has purchased credit 
default swaps.
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies. These policies manage 
credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the 
maturity profile. Drax Group plc

23 Provisions
We make a provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning, demolishing and remediating our 
generation assets at the end of their useful economic lives. The amount represents the present value (i.e. it is discounted to 
reflect the time value of money) of the expected costs. Provisions are for liabilities of uncertain timing and/or amount, 
and as such by their nature are estimated.
Provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating 
assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the present value 
of the expected costs. The discount rate used is a risk free pre-tax rate, reflecting the fact that the estimated future cash flows 
have built in risks specific to the liability . An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property , plant 
and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in interest 
payable and similar charges.

The initial provision and subsequent estimation changes are capitalised within property , plant and equipment and are being 
depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs (note 6).
The provision is estimated using the assumption that the reinstatement will take place between 2039 and 204 5, and has been 
estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent third party advice, updated on a triennial basis.

24 Deferred tax
Deferred tax is principally an accounting adjustment to reflect the tax charges or credits that are expected to arise in the 
future, as a result of differences between the accounting and tax rules relating to certain transactions that happened before 
the end of the current year . 
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during each year are shown below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
offset as there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

profits is probable. 
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets with an estimated value of £10 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: £6. 1 million) 
in respect of UK and US losses that are carried forward against future taxable income, where recovery is not currently probable.
25 Issued equity
Our ordinary share capital reflects the total number of shares issued, which are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of 
its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net 
of tax, from the proceeds.

On 10 March 2014, a total of 2, 126,934 shares were issued in satisfaction of shares vesting in accordance with the rules of the 
Group’s Bonus Matching Plan granted in 2010. From 1 May 2014 a further 113,085 shares were issued in satisfaction of options 
vesting in accordance with the rules of the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan, also granted in 2010. During 2014, 
7 , 106 shares and 5,563 shares were issued on early exercise of options under the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan 
by five individuals whose employment had terminated due to retirement (2013: 7 ,222 shares relating to three individuals whose 
employment terminated due to retirement) and four whose employment had terminated due to redundancy , respectively . 
Additionally during 2014 2,54 1 shares were issues on early exercise of options under the Group’s Bonus Matching Plan to one

2 6 Share-based payments
We operate two share option schemes for our employees – the Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”) for directors and senior 
executives, and the Savings-Related Share Option (“SA YE”) Plan for all qualifying employees. We incur a cost in respect of these 
schemes in our income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of 
options outstanding.
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight -line basis over the relevant 
vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.

Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”)
Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to £1,500 worth of Partnership Shares in any one tax year . 
Matching Shares were awarded to employees to match any Partnership Shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the 
cost of Matching Shares borne by the Group. There were no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching Share plan in 2012, 
or 2013.

Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”)
The BMP was introduced in 2009. Under the scheme, annual awards of performance and service-related shares are made at £nil 
consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus. A proportion 
of the shares vesting is conditional upon whether the Group’s TSR matches or outperforms an index ( determined in accordance 
with the scheme rules) over three years. For awards made from 2011, a proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon 
performance against the internal Balanced Corporate Scorecard. The fair value of the 2014, 2013 and 2012 BMP awards of 
£5. 4 million, £6. 1 million and £5.8 million, respectively , are being charged to the income statement on a straight -line basis over 
the corresponding three year vesting periods.

Savings-Related Share Option Plan (“SA YE”)
In April 2014, participation in the SA YE Plan was offered again, to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for employees 
to acquire shares at a price of 530 pence (2013: 4 93 pence ), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price 
determined in accordance with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five year savings contracts. 
The fair value of the options granted in connection with the SA YE Plan of £1.5 million (2013: £0.8 million) is being charged to the 
income statement over the life of the relevant contracts.

27 Share premium and other reserves
The share premium account reflects amounts received in respect of issued share capital (see note 25) that exceed the nominal 
value of the shares issued.

The capital redemption reserve arose when the Group completed a share buy-back programme in 2007 .
The share premium and the merger reserve arose on the financial restructuring of the Group which took place in 2005. 
Movements in share premium during 2014 reflect amounts received from the issue of shares under the Group’s employee 
share schemes.
28 Hedge reserve
Changes in the fair value of our derivative commodity , financial and currency contracts are recognised in the hedge reserve, to 
the extent that they qualify as effective hedges under accounting rules. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are 
released as the related contracts mature, and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency .
Managing our principal risks and uncertainties… As described in note 20, all of our derivative contracts are entered into for the 
purpose of commercial hedging; however not all of these contracts qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39. The changes in 
fair value of contracts that do not meet the definition of an IFRS effective hedge are recognised in the income statement. 
Managing our principal risks and uncertainties is about locking down exposures to moving prices and securing market level 
dark green and bark spreads for the future.
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow 
hedges. At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along 
with its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents 
whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged 
items. Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to 
the extent they are effective.

The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power) and forward foreign currency 
exchange contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each 
period end for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge 
reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales 
contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered. For FX contracts, this is when the associated foreign currency transaction 
is recognised. Further information in relation to the Group’s accounting for financial instruments is included in note 20. Drax Group plc

33 Retirement benefit obligations
We operate a defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The Drax Power Group section of the Electricity 
Supply Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme; a pension arrangement under which participating members receive 
a pension benefit at retirement determined by the scheme rules. Members are typically entitled to annual pensions on 
retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three times pension.
The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme, by contrast provides a retirement benefit that is 
dependent upon actual contributions made by the Group and members of the scheme.
The income statement charge for the defined benefit scheme is twofold – the current/past service cost is the increase in the 
overall liability to pay benefits earned by current employees of the Group in the current/previous periods, the net interest cost 
reflects the unwinding of the pension deficit over time, offset by income earned by the scheme’s assets.
The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group 
in respect of the current period.
Defined contribution scheme
The Group operates two defined contribution schemes, The Drax Power Limited Pension Plan and Haven Power Personal Pension 
Plan, for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the defined contribution scheme are as follows:

As at 31 December 2014, contributions of £0. 4 million (2013: £0.7 million) due in respect of the current reporting period had 
not been paid over to the scheme. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Defined benefit scheme
The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme on behalf of the Drax Power Group (“DPG”) section of the Electricity 
Supply Pension Scheme (“ESPS”). This scheme was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through 
being existing members of another part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits 
as part of the scheme.
The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be:
Investment risk The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; 
if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion 
of growth assets ( equities, property and direct lending) which, though expected to outperform 
corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short -term. The allocation to growth 
assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the scheme’s long-term objectives.
Interest rate risk A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the scheme’s liabilities, 
although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.
Longevity risk The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member , so increases 
in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.
Inflation risk The majority of the scheme’s benefit obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation, and as such 
higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either 
unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning an increase in inflation will also 
increase the deficit. In most cases, caps on inflationary increases are in place, to protect against 
extreme inflation.
Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the government increasing 
the burden on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as a higher proportion of 
members with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group ). The T rustees insure certain benefits payable on death 
before retirement.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension. See note 35 for details. Drax Group plc

33. Retirement benefit obligations ( continued)
The last funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, as a qualified independent actuary , as at 31 March 
2013. Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years, therefore the next valuation will take place 
on or before 31 March 2016.
The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2013 have been adjusted to 31 December 2014, taking into account 
experience over the period since 31 March 2013, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic 
assumptions. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost were measured using 
the projected unit credit method. The principal assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, 
are as follows:
As at 31 December
2014 
% p.a.
2013 
% p.a.
Discount rate 3.7 4.5
Inflation (RPI) 3. 0 3. 4
Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.8 3.2
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.6 4. 4
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. 
The assumptions are that a member who retired in 2014 at age 60 will live on average for a further 27 years (2013: 27 years) after 
retirement if they are male and for a further 29 years (2013: 29 years) after retirement if they are female. Similarly life expectancy at 
age 60 for male and female non-pensioners ( currently aged 4 5) is assumed to be 28 years and 31 years respectively (2013: 28 years 
and 31 years respectively).
The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is the excess of the present value of the defined benefit obligation over the fair 
value of the plan assets, determined as follows:

(1)  Under the Group’s long-term asset strategy, 60% of assets are invested in ‘return generating’ asset classes – of which 5% is invested in emerging market equity. 
The remaining 40% of assets are invested in ‘liability-matching’ asset classes.
(2)  Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, government and absolute return bonds. Less than 1% has a sub-investment grade credit rating  
(i.e. BB+ or lower).
(3) Other assets include £2.9 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market.
The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group. 
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. 
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely 
accepted capital market principles. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected 
return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the scheme.
The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have 
a potentially significant effect on the measurement of the scheme deficit. The following table provides an indication of the 
sensitivity of the pension deficit at 31 December 2014 to changes in these assumptions:
%
(Decrease)/Increase in net liability 
£m
Discount rate – Increase 0.25 (11. 1)
– Decrease 0.25 12. 0
Inflation rate
(1)
– Increase 0.25 10. 0
– Decrease 0.25 ( 9.6)
Life expectancy – Increase 1 6.7
– Decrease 1 ( 6.8)
(1)   The sensitivity of the scheme liabilities to salary and pension increases is closely correlated with inflation. The impact of corresponding decreases in these 
variables is included here.
The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional 
contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected 
investment income.

33. Retirement benefit obligations ( continued)
The defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group (70%), former employees of the Group 
who are yet to retire (5%) and retired pensioners (25%). The weighted-average period over which benefit payments are expected 
to be made, or the duration of the liabilities, is currently 22 years.
The Group expects to contribute £11.2 million to its pension plans during the 12 months ended 31 December 2015. 
The Group intends to fund the deficit, agreed at the last triennial valuation, over the period to 31 December 2019.
34 Capital and other financial commitments
We have a number of financial commitments (i.e. a certain, contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future ) that 
are not recorded within our balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery . Such commitments include contracts for 
the future purchase of coal and biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and 
contracts for the provision of services. 
Delivering our biomass strategy … We have made good progress towards securing near -term volumes of sustainable wood 
pellets and continue with negotiations for long-term supplies and to support our third unit conversion, which is reflected in the 
level of future commitments to purchase fuel, set out below.

Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of our control; 
timing of the payment is uncertain, cannot be measured reliably , or is considered to be unlikely .
Guaranteed Minimum Pension (“GMP”)
The UK government intends to implement legislation to equalise the GMP , resulting in an increase in the value of GMP for 
males. This would correspondingly increase the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group (note 33). At present, the 
methodology for implementing the equalisation is uncertain and thus the impact cannot be reliably measured. As a result, no 
allowance has been made for GMP equalisation in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation within these consolidated 
financial statements. Drax Group plc

1. Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been 
prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below, and have been consistently applied to both years presented.
Implementation of Financial Reporting Standard 100 (“FRS 100”)
The Company will be required to apply the requirements of FRS 100, the new financial reporting standard applicable in the United 
Kingdom, with effect from 1 January 2015. The first financial statements prepared by the Company in accordance with the new 
standard will be for the year ending 31 December 2015. 
It is currently the intention of the Company , as a Qualifying entity in accordance with that standard and as permitted by paragraph 
4b of FRS 100, to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements of FRS 101. This will result in the 
application of the accounting recognition and measurement criteria of EU-adopted International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS), consistent with those policies adopted in the consolidated Group financial statements which are set out within the 
relevant notes on pages 105 to 140 of this Annual report.
FRS 101 permits certain disclosure exemptions from full EU-adopted IFRS principally , in relation to share-based payments, 
business combinations, assets held for sale, financial instruments, fair value, impairment and related parties. The full list of 
available exemptions can be viewed at www.frc.org.uk. Full disclosure of the Group’s activities will continue to be made in the 
consolidated financial statements which are not affected by this change and will remain prepared in accordance with full 
EU-adopted IFRS.
At this stage, the adoption and implementation of FRS 100/101 is not expected to have any noticeable impact on the presentation 
of the financial statements of the Company , which are set out on pages 14 1 to 14 5 of this document.
Any objections to the adoption and implementation of FRS 100/101 should be made in writing to the Company Secretary at the 
Company’s registered address as set out on page 150.
Cash flow statement
The cash flows of the Group are included in the Consolidated cash flow statement of Drax Group plc, which is set out on page 104 
of this document. Accordingly , the Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 “Cash flow statements” not to 
publish a cash flow statement.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption granted by paragraph 3(b ) of FRS 8 “Related party disclosures” not to 
disclose transactions with other group companies.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
(A) Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provision for impairment.
(B) Financial instruments
Issued equity – Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The share premium account records the difference between the nominal value of shares 
issued and the fair value of the consideration received, unless merger relief criteria within the Companies Act (2006) are met, 
in which case the difference is recorded in retained earnings.
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short -term 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. 
Short -term investments – Short -term investments includes cash held on deposits with financial institutions with a maturity of 
greater than three months at inception.

Share frauds (“Boiler room scams”)
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence offering to purchase their shares at apparently inflated prices. It is often the case that the caller , or message 
in the correspondence claims that they represent a majority shareholder who is looking to take over the Company . At the time 
of this report, the Company was not the subject of a take-over attempt, hostile or otherwise, and approaches such as those 
outlined are usually made by unauthorised companies and individuals. Shareholders should be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a premium or offers of free reports into the Company . Below is the advice from the Financial 
Conduct Authority (the “FCA ”). 
Beware of share fraud 
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be 
worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you 
buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money . 
How to avoid share fraud 
 , Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.
 , Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person and firm contacting you and then end the call.
 , Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by 
the FCA.
 , Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, copying its website or giving you false contact details.
 , Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want to call it back.
 , Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
 , Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at www.fca.org.uk/scams.
 , Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service 
or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
 , Think about getting independent financial and professional advice before you hand over any money . 
Remember , if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is! 
Report a scam 
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams,  
where you can find out more about investment scams. 
Y ou can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768. 
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.  Drax Group plc

Availability
Average percentage of time the units 
were available for generation.
Average achieved price
Power revenues divided by volume of net 
sales (includes imbalance charges).
Balancing mechanism
The sub-set of the market through which 
the System Operator can call upon

Contracts for difference (CfD)
A mechanism to support investment

revenue from selling their electricity into 
the market as usual. However , when 
the market reference price is below the 
strike price they will also receive a top-up

amount. Conversely if the reference price is 
above the strike price, the generator must 
pay back the difference.

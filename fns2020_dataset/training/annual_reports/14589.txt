SCA Hygiene Products’ mill in Mannheim, Germany,
is the largest tissue mill in Europe, with a production
capacity of more than 260,000 tonnes of tissue per
year. Changing to using BTG’s slow-wearing ceramic
Duroblade® instead of conventional steel blades has
reduced the number of blade changes on the tissue
machines, thus decreasing the amount of downtime
and lost production. An increase in blade lifetime from
an average of 2.2 hours per blade to over 40 hours has
resulted in a significant increase in tonnes of tissue
produced per year. A further benefit from the ceramic
blades is more consistent tissue quality.

German company Schuler’s coining presses produce around
80% of the world’s coins. Prior to the introduction of the euro
in 2002, the presses had to work at full speed. With the help
of HBM’s measurement technology, which accurately monitors
the force used in minting, Schuler were able to guarantee the
output and performance of their machines and their European
clients were able to fulfil ambitious targets for supplying the
new coins on time. Schuler’s latest generation of minting
machines are equipped with HBM’s instrumentation and
customised software. These new presses operate at speeds
around 20% higher than the previous machines, resulting
in an additional 150 coins produced per minute.

Hoben Industrial Minerals, based in England, are specialists in processing
hard minerals to fine powders. Following installation of a Malvern in-line
particle size analyser, product consistency and mill control has been improved
and the manpower required to run the unit substantially reduced. The silica
sand processing mill now operates around the clock and throughput has
increased by 60%. In addition, Hoben’s ability to produce a more closely-
specified product consistently has helped its customers to access new markets.

The way that its cars sound and feel is a key product differentiator for automotive
manufacturer SEA T , part of the V olkswagen Group. At its research and development
facility near Barcelona, Spain, sound and vibration characteristics such as interior
noise from the engine along with functions such as the electric windows, wipers and
sunroof are analysed and recorded. A new model cannot be released for production
until it fully conforms to its specified noise parameters. Using Brüel & Kjær’s sound
analysis equipment, the total measurement time has been reduced from four hours
per car to one hour - a saving of 75 per cent.
Noise testing times cut by 75%

Swedish company LKAB is one of the world’s leading producers of iron 
ore products for the steel industry. New products are developed using their
own experimental blast furnace. The objective is to develop new pellets with
better properties which will help to reduce hot metal costs at their customers’
blast furnaces. Using a PANalytical XRF spectrometer to perform analyses of
iron and slag has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the time spent waiting
for the results, enabling more precise monitoring and control of the process 
in the experimental blast furnace.

SPECTRIS 01-17  3/4/06  8:56 pm  Page 4 Pressing the oil from rape seed results in a protein-rich cake which
is used as an animal feed supplement, the oil being used for a
variety of consumer products. Using NDC Infrared Engineering’s
on-line near infrared analyser to monitor the moisture content of
the rape seed enabled Danish producer Scanola to maintain the
maximum permissible amount of moisture in the cake, resulting
in an additional 1,800 tonnes of cake being produced each year.
A second NDC on-line analyser measuring the oil content has
enabled an additional 1% of oil to be extracted from the seed,
resulting in an extra 800 tonnes of oil per year. More accurate
measurement of oil and moisture, through continuous on-line
monitoring rather than intermittent laboratory sample testing,
has generated additional production for Scanola worth around
€600,000 per year at current prices.

SPECTRIS 01-17  5/4/06  11:08 am  Page 5 Starkey Laboratories is the world’s leading manufacturer of
custom hearing instruments. Each highly specialised instrument
comprises a mass of miniature electronic circuitry encased in
plastic and is individually constructed. However, manufacturing
productivity was restricted as the glues, used to bond the speaker
component to the silicone tube which delivers the amplified sound
into the ear, required overnight curing. Following the installation
of a Fusion UV curing unit, this process now takes just one minute.
An additional benefit is that solvent-based glues have been replaced
with more environmentally-friendly silicone adhesives.

With replacement costs exceeding $1 million,
preventing damage to optical equipment is a critical
issue for semiconductor manufacturers. Using
instrumentation from Particle Measuring Systems to
monitor and detect airborne contamination during
the photolithography process, which creates the
multiple layers of circuit patterns on the chip, a major
North American semiconductor manufacturer was
able to detect and identify a gas contaminant.
Alternative technology would have been unable to
detect this event in real time, thus the company was
able to prevent damage to the equipment and avoid
the cost of production lost during the downtime.

The Port of Long Beach in California is the second-busiest port in
the US, with its mile-long Pier T terminal capable of handling more
than two million cargo containers per year. T o meet growing
demand, state-of-the-art surveillance and intrusion detection systems
are installed. Theseinclude intelligent cameras which capture truck
drivers’ vehicle information at the 29-lane gates. Microscan’s bar code
scanners then scan their ID cards on entry and the bar codes on the
paperwork on exit and document the time and date the driver exited
the facility. In addition to increasing the security of the facility, the
gate and access control systems have also increased cargo throughput
by reducing gate waiting times and overall driver turn times which
has measurably lowered the operating cost per move.

Chairman’s statement
“The company achieved good progress in 2005, with sales,
operating profit and margins all ahead. Actions to restrain
overheads, restore profitability in under-performing
businesses, improve margins and generate cash were all
positive. Levels of demand in the first two months of the
year provide encouragement that the company will show
further good progress in 2006. ”
Overview
As indicated in the trading update in January, sales in 2005
increased by 7%, with all three sectors reporting growth over
the previous year and orders in excess of sales. Profits, earnings
per share and cash conversion also moved ahead strongly.
Growth in Asia, in particular, continued to be vigorous.
Actions taken to improve margins, involving overhead
containment, reflected in an unchanged year end headcount,
and the elimination of some lower margin sales, began to show
benefits. Operating margins improved from 10.5% to 11.2%.
Sales increased by 7% to £655.9 million (2004:
£614.1 million). Operating profit increased by 14% to 
£73.5 million (2004: £64.6 million)
*
. Earnings per share
increased from 31.6p to 36.2p on a tax rate of 27% (2004: 24%).
The effects of changes in exchange rates were negligible.
Cash conversion was excellent with 107% of operating profit
converted into cash, as actions to generate cash on a more
consistent basis took effect. Net debt at the year end was 
£119.9 million compared with £158.9 million twelve months
earlier. Interest costs were £12.6 million, giving an annualised
interest cover of 5.8 times.
The Board proposes to pay a final dividend of 11.2p which,
combined with the interim dividend, gives a total of 15.8p
(2004: 14.5p), an increase of 9%. The dividend will be paid on
23 June 2006 to shareholders on the register at 2 June 2006.
Board changes
I am pleased to welcome John O’Higgins, who joined the
Board in January 2006, as Chief Executive. John was previously
with Honeywell Inc, the US aerospace and technology products
multinational, latterly as President of Honeywell Automation
and Control Solutions based in Shanghai. John’s educational
qualifications, track record within the instrumentation and
controls industry and business experience, equip him well to
lead the company and drive its development. I am also pleased
to welcome John Warren, who joins the Board from 7 March as
a non-executive director. Non-executive directors Martin Lamb
and Professor Leo Murray will be standing down at the AGM
and I should like to thank them for their guidance and
contribution to the development of the company in recent years.

The following paragraphs describe the operational performance
of the group’s business segments.
Sector performance
Electronic controls achieved sales growth of 3% from 
£139.7 million in 2004 to £143.5 million, with profit up 6%
from £17.2 million to £18.2 million. Operating margins
improved from 12.3% to 12.7%. Microscan launched two new
bar code readers during the year which made a positive
contribution to a good growth performance. Red Lion Controls
enjoyed particular success, with human/machine interface
products increasing sales in the US by more than 40% compared
with the prior year. At HBM, sales in the second half were
attenuated both by a lack of large projects and the elimination
of some low margin business, largely for Chinese customers,
however profitability improved. A conditional agreement for
the disposal of Arcom was signed in February 2006 for a total
consideration of US$26 million. This business is being divested
as it is not core to Spectris’ strategy and will have greater
opportunities as part of a specialist embedded computer
technology company.
In-line instrumentation achieved sales growth of 2% from
£198.4 million to £202.3 million with profit growing by 11%
from £20.6 million to £22.9 million. Operating margins
improved from 10.4% to 11.3%. Sales of BTG’s Duroblade
product recovered in the second half with the ending of the
lock-out at paper mills in Finland. However, delayed capital
spending by paper manufacturers in the light of increases in
energy and transport costs, caused sales at the instrumentation
side of BTG’s business to be subdued. Servomex reported
record sales and operating profits, with strong demand in the
second half for gas analysis systems on the back of increased
spending by companies in the hydrocarbon industries.
Operating profits were up at Brüel & Kjær Vibro on
relatively flat sales due primarily to an improved product mix.

SPECTRIS 01-17  5/4/06  4:26 pm  Page 9 Outlook
Levels of demand in the first two months of the year provide
encouragement that the company will show further good
progress in 2006. Spectris has a strong business portfolio, with
market-leading brands and good technology positions, exposure
to a number of attractive end-user industries, and high calibre
people. Continued focus on the emerging markets of Asia
Pacific, Eastern Europe and Latin America, together with
growing emphasis by customers on the value of after-sales
service, present good opportunities for the company. Several 
of our operations are well positioned to take advantage of
increasing investment in petrochemical, mining and metals
industries as a consequence of high oil and commodity demand.
Our priority going forward is to continue to pursue the
strategy of managing cost, pricing and overheads tightly.
Actions such as transferring component sourcing,
manufacturing and assembly to lower-cost regions,
productivity and process improvements, and a maintained
focus on cash generation, reinforce our ability to deliver
improved profitability and operating margins. In addition we
will continue to drive organic sales growth and to strengthen
our portfolio of businesses by considering external
opportunities for growth where appropriate.

Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s review continued
The company is expected to benefit as oil refiners invest in
new capacity, with increased demand for safety and condition
monitoring systems. At Ircon trading margins and profits
moved ahead. NDC made good progress, particularly with the
sales of sensors for measuring equipment, with strong growth
in Asia. Although the Chinese plastics market suffered from
the high oil price and overcapacity, greater penetration of
other industries, such as non-wovens, compensated. Beta
LaserMike made good progress with its restructuring and
returned to trading profitability in the year. The restructuring
at Loma and Cintex returned the business to profitability in
the second half, as management focused on product margins
and the benefits of the move to a manufacturing unit in the
Czech Republic were realised. The company has been renamed
Spectrum Inspection Systems.
Process technology achieved sales growth of 12% from 
£276.0 million to £310.1 million with profit growing by 21%
from £26.8 million to £32.4 million. Operating margins
improved from 9.7% to 10.4%. In a year in which
semiconductor equipment investment was flat, Particle
Measuring Systems did well, primarily due to market share
gains in the flat panel display, optical display and
pharmaceutical industries. Continued investment by the
automotive and electronics industries in Japan benefited
Fusion UV Systems, particularly in flat panel displays, where
demand for UV-coated functionalised film products is strong,
with Asia expected to satisfy around 90% of world demand.
Malvern produced a good performance both from the
laboratory business, where nanomaterial and biotechnology
research markets are attractive, and in the process business
globally. Malvern’s newly-opened applications laboratory in
China underpinned a strong Asian performance.
Sales at Brüel & Kjær Sound & Vibration increased.
The company won strategic environmental contracts in China
for both Beijing city and airport, giving Brüel & Kjær a strong
position in the growing Chinese environmental noise
management market. Underlying profits increased but were
impacted by a one-off cost for centralising back-office
functions. PANalytical enjoyed double-digit growth in both
sales and operating profit, with particular success in Asia.
The European directives on restricting hazardous substances
and waste electrical and electronic equipment have already
been beneficial. The measurement of traces of heavy metals 
in foods and asbestos in waste presents good opportunities.
PANalytical also entered into an agreement with Lafarge,
making it the preferred supplier of X-ray analysis systems for
the entire cement division, comprising 150 plants worldwide.

Financial review
Introduction
During 2005, Spectris adopted International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) in common with other
companies that are listed in the European Union. This has
required a restatement of the 2004 results reported previously
under UK GAAP . In certain respects, IFRS has introduced
more complexity to Spectris’ financial statements through the
use of fair value accounting rules. The section headed
‘Adoption of IFRS’ below describes the principal impact on
Spectris from adopting IFRS.
Spectris uses adjusted figures as key performance measures
in addition to those reported under IFRS. Adjusted figures are
stated before amortisation of acquisition-related intangible
assets, goodwill charges, profits or losses on the termination
or disposal of businesses or major fixed assets, unrealised
changes in the fair value of financial instruments, related tax
effects and other tax items which do not form part of the
underlying tax rate. Unless otherwise stated all profit and
earnings figures referred to below are adjusted measures.
Operating performance
2005 2004
Turnover (£m) 655.9 614.1
Operating profit (£m) 73.5 64.6
Operating margin (%) 11.2 10.5
Sales increased by 7% overall, driven largely by increased
demand from customers in Asia.
Adjusted operating profit rose by 14% overall with the
operating margin improving from 10.5% to 11.2%. Aside
from the impact of sales growth, operating profits benefited
from the constraint exercised on overheads and the return to
profitability of the Beta LaserMike and Spectrum businesses.
Interest costs, including IAS 19 pension charges, reduced
from £14.1 million to £13.0 million, reflecting both the
consistent reduction in the level of net debt during the year
and more efficient use of surplus cash balances. After taking
account of lower interest costs, adjusted profits before tax
increased by 20% from £50.5 million to £60.5 million.
Bolt-on acquisitions and currency movements had a
broadly neutral overall effect on the profits for the year.
Operating profits, after including goodwill charges of
£7.4 million (2004: £12.2 million) and acquisition-related
intangible asset amortisation of £1.2 million (2004:
£1.2 million), increased by 27% from £51.2 million to
£64.9 million.
Unadjusted profits before tax increased by 42% from 
£35.9 million to £50.8 million. In addition to goodwill
charges and acquisition-related intangible asset amortisation
charges, the 2005 result includes a £1.7 million profit on the
disposal of the group’s remaining interest in the Luxtron
business. This result also includes unrealised losses of £2.8
million on the group’s cross-currency interest rate swaps and
average rate options as a consequence of the adoption of IAS
39 with effect from 1 January 2005. These items are explained
in more detail in the ‘Adoption of IFRS’ section below.
Acquisitions and disposals
During the year, one small bolt-on acquisition was made for
which the total consideration, including acquisition expenses
and debt acquired, was £2.5 million.
In February 2006, Spectris entered into an option
agreement to sell the Arcom business to Eurotech S.p.A.
Since the year end, Eurotech has paid US$2 million to
Spectris in consideration for the option which gives Eurotech
60 days to acquire Arcom on a cash and debt-free basis.
Should the acquisition complete, the total consideration will
be US$26 million (including the US$2 million option payment
already received). As a consequence of this agreement, the
Arcom business’ assets and liabilities are presented separately
in the group balance sheet as ‘held for sale’ .
T axation
The effective tax rate on profits was 26.9% (2004: 24.4%).
The effective tax rate continues to be below the weighted
average statutory tax rate of 32.8% (2004: 32.6%) as a
consequence of the utilisation of unrecognised tax losses in
Germany, tax-efficient financing, and prior year tax credits.
As anticipated, the increase in the tax rate in 2005 was due to
SPECTRIS 01-17  3/4/06  8:56 pm  Page 11 12 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005
Financial review continued
a reduction in the effect of tax planning and brought forward
loss utilisation. The underlying tax charge is expected to
increase further towards the weighted average statutory tax
rate over the next few years.
Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share increased by 15% from 31.6p to
36.2p. This increase is lower than the growth in profit before
tax due to a higher effective tax rate.
Basic earnings per share increased by 48% from 19.5p to
28.8p. The differences between the two measures are shown in
the table below.

Operating cash flow 78.4 48.7
Movement in net debt 39.0 4.5
Cash conversion of operating profit to operating cash was
107% (2004: 75%). The improvement in cash conversion was
chiefly due to a turnaround of £18.2 million in the working
capital movements which improved from a cash outflow in
2004 of £13.7 million to a cash inflow of £4.5 million in 2005.
Inventory turns improved from 2.9 times at December 2004
to 3.3 times at the end of 2005. Debtor days outstanding
increased very slightly, rising from 59 days at December 2004
to 60 days at the end of 2005. Over the same period, trade
working capital expressed as a percentage of sales remained
constant at 16%.
Capital expenditure reduced during the year and equated to
1.9% of sales and, at £12.2 million, was 97% of depreciation.
The level of tax paid in 2005 was higher than in 2004 due
primarily to the acceleration of payments on account in
Germany and an increase in the current tax on profits.
Overall, net debt fell by £39.0 million. Interest cost,
excluding the financing charge arising from IAS 19, was
covered by operating profits 5.8 times (2004: 4.7 times),
providing headroom over the banking covenants which
require a minimum of 3 times cover.
Financing and treasury
The group finances its operations from both retained
earnings and third-party borrowings, the majority of which
are currently at fixed rates of interest.
During 2004, no significant new loan borrowings were
taken out and the majority of third-party borrowings
continue to be comprised of US dollar private placement
loans which have been partly swapped into euros to provide 
a hedge against euro-denominated net assets in the group’s
balance sheet.
30% of debt is due to mature within one year (2004: 0%),
29% of debt is due to mature in between one and five years
(2004: 27%) and the remaining 41% in more than five years
(2004: 73%). During July 2006, the $100 million 1996 Private
Placement loan notes will become due for repayment. New
committed facilities have already been negotiated which,
together with the free cash flow generated by the group, will
provide sufficient funds to repay these loans.
Currency
The group has both translational and transactional currency
exposures. Translational exposures arise on the consolidation
of overseas company results into sterling. Transactional
exposures arise where the currency of sale or purchase
invoices differs from the functional currency in which each
company prepares its local accounts. The transactional
exposures include situations where foreign currency
denominated trade debtor, trade creditor and cash balances
are held.
T o demonstrate the currency exposures faced by the 
group, the chart opposite shows the differences between 
the group’s consolidated revenues and costs for each of the
major currencies.
SPECTRIS 01-17  5/4/06  08:51  Page 12 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005   13
The largest transactional exposures are to the US dollar and,
to a lesser extent, the Japanese yen. The largest translational
exposures are to the US dollar and euro (and also the Danish
krone which has tended to track the euro quite closely). The
table below shows the average exchange rates during 2004 and
2005 which are quite similar and there was therefore a modest
currency effect on the results when compared year-on-year.
The key exchange rates were as follows:
2004 2005 2005
(average) (average) (year-end rate)
US$ 1.83 1.82 1.72
Euro 1.47 1.46 1.45
Yen 197 200 203
In the past, the group’s currency exposures have been
hedged using zero cost average rate options. The group’s US
dollar, euro and Japanese yen exposures were hedged in 2004
through zero cost average rate options which, in aggregate,
generated net gains of £3.2 million. In 2005, whilst the group
had zero cost average rate options in place, no gain or loss
arose. Going forward, the group does not intend to use zero
cost average rate options to hedge currency exposures and no
options were outstanding as at 31 December 2005.
Translational currency exposures are not hedged. Forward
exchange contracts are used to hedge forecast sale transactions
where there is reasonable certainty of an exposure.
Defined benefit pension schemes
Operating profit includes a defined benefit pension scheme
current service charge of £0.7 million (2004: £0.8 million).
The net pension liability in the balance sheet (before taking
account of the related deferred tax asset) has increased to
£22.6 million (2004: £20.7 million), largely as a consequence 
of a reduced discount rate. During 2005, the group increased
its cash contributions into the defined benefit pension
schemes to £3.2 million (2004: £1.5 million).
Adoption of IFRS
In most respects, there was a minimal impact on Spectris
from the adoption of IFRS. However, IFRS has introduced
more complexity into the group’s financial statements,
particularly the requirement to fair value derivative financial
instruments (following the adoption of accounting standard
IAS 39 with effect from 1 January 2005). The detailed
transitional reconciliations from the group’s reported UK
GAAP results in 2004 to the restated IFRS results for 2004 are
presented in Note 36 of the financial statements. However, the
most significant adjustments arising on adoption of IFRS
are summarised below.
Presentational matters
IFRS has different presentation and disclosure requirements
to UK GAAP and has involved significant changes to the
presentation of the financial statements. Wherever possible,
the group has attempted to present the financial statements in
a consistent manner with those presented in the past. The
changes in accounting rules have meant that the group’s
adjusted measures of profits and earnings have been changed,
and the new measures are described in the introduction to
the financial review.
Deferred tax
The single largest adjustment arising on the transition to
IFRS relates to deferred tax. Deferred tax accounting under
UK GAAP is based on the concept of ‘timing’ differences
which focuses on the differences in timing between when
profits are recognised for accounting and tax purposes.
In contrast, IFRS has a concept of ‘temporary’ differences
which is more balance sheet focused, comparing the carrying
value of assets and liabilities for both tax and accounting
purposes. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of the group’s
US businesses which was previously written off to reserves is
deductible for tax purposes. Under UK GAAP , the current tax
deduction obtained each year gave rise to a deferred tax
liability because it was perceived that there was a timing
difference which could reverse (for example on disposal of a
business). Under IFRS, the tax balance carried forward at each
balance sheet date instead gives rise to a deferred tax asset
since the accounting asset has been written off to reserves and
is not recognised on the balance sheet, whilst a tax asset exists
by virtue of the ability to claim future deductions.
At 31 December 2004, the deferred tax liability under 
UK GAAP was £17.6 million. Under IFRS, this liability has
been eliminated and replaced with a deferred tax asset of
£11.0 million, a combined adjustment of £28.6 million.
There was an impact of £0.2 million on the tax charge in the
income statement in 2004 from this change.
Goodwill
There are a number of differences in the way goodwill is
treated between IFRS and UK GAAP:
1. Under UK GAAP , goodwill was amortised over its estimated
useful life. Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but is

Financial review continued
instead subject to an annual impairment test. As a
consequence of this, goodwill amortisation included in 
the 2004 UK GAAP accounts of £13.0 million has been
reversed.
2. Under UK GAAP , no distinction was made between the
various components of any intangible asset arising on
acquisitions where the price paid exceeds the fair market
value of the tangible assets and liabilities acquired. Under
UK GAAP all such intangibles were disclosed as goodwill
and amortised over an appropriate economic life. IFRS
requires separate identification of these intangibles, and
amortisation where appropriate, with any residue being
classified as goodwill. As a consequence, £5.8 million of the
goodwill reported at 31 December 2004 under UK GAAP
has been reclassified under IFRS as intangible assets, and
amortisation of £1.2 million was charged on these assets 
in 2004.
3. Where an acquisition occurs and the conditions for
recognition of a deferred tax asset are not met at that time,
but are met at a later date, IFRS requires that an equal and
opposite adjustment to goodwill is made. In 2004 under
UK GAAP , the group recognised a deferred tax asset of
£12.2 million relating to an earlier acquisition and as a
consequence, under IFRS, an additional goodwill charge 
of £12.2 million has been made in 2004.
Dividends
Under UK GAAP , dividends payable to shareholders were
recognised in the profit and loss account in the period to
which they related. On this basis the 2004 UK GAAP accounts
included an accrual for the final dividend approved at the
Annual General Meeting in May 2005.
IFRS requires that dividends are not recognised until they
are declared. As a consequence, the net assets reported by the
group on a UK GAAP basis at 31 December 2004 have been
increased on adoption of IFRS by £12.4 million to reverse the
accrual for the final dividend declared in 2005 in respect of
the year ended 31 December 2004.
Other adjustments impacting the transition to IFRS in the 2004
comparative period
There were three other types of adjustment made to the 2004
comparative results in the transition to IFRS which had a less
significant impact than those items already described above:
1. Share options – a charge to the profit and loss account is
recognised under IFRS where previously no such charge
existed under UK GAAP . The charge applies to options
issued after November 2002. This requirement resulted 
in a charge to the income statement in the year ended 
31 December 2004 of £0.4 million. However there is no
overall impact on the balance sheet since there is also a
corresponding adjustment to equity through reserves.
2. Revenue recognition – IFRS is similar to UK GAAP but
contains specific additional guidance on accounting for
contracts that include installation elements. Following a
review of existing policies, this gives rise to some subtle
differences in the timing of accounting for certain
transactions. This led to a reduction in profits before tax 
of £0.2 million in the income statement for the year ended 
31 December 2004. The net deferral of revenue and
associated costs in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004
was £2.3 million.
3. Holiday pay – IFRS requires short-term accumulating
benefits such as holiday and sick pay entitlements to be
accrued over the period in which the entitlement is earned.
There was no impact on the income statement in 2004 but 
an additional liability of £1.1 million was recognised in the
balance sheet as at 31 December 2004.
Adoption of IAS 39 from 1 January 2005 (derivatives and
hedge accounting)
As permitted by the IFRS transitional accounting rules, the
group elected to adopt IAS 39 with effect from 1 January 2005
and consequently the comparative period for 2004 has not
been restated to comply with IAS 39. IAS 39 has impacted on
the group in 2005 in three main areas:
1. Average rate options – the group has historically used
average rate options to provide a hedge against the group’s
currency exposures. Under UK GAAP , the value of the
options was recognised in the profit and loss account in a
way that matched the gains or losses arising with the period
the options were intended to hedge. IFRS requires that the
fair value of such derivative financial instruments is
recognised on the balance sheet at all times. Since the
options did not meet IAS 39’s strict hedge accounting
criteria, all changes in the fair value were recognised in the
income statement. As at 1 January 2005, the fair value of the
average rate options was £1.7 million, reducing to a value of
£nil at 31 December 2005. This gives rise to a charge in the
income statement in 2005 of £1.7 million. This charge is
excluded from the group’s adjusted measure of profits and
earnings since it is an unrealised loss.
2. Cross-currency interest rate swaps – the group uses cross-
currency interest rate swaps to convert some of its fixed
interest US dollar private placement loan note borrowings
into fixed interest euro-denominated borrowings. This is
done so as to provide a natural hedge of the group’s
European investments. Under UK GAAP , the combined
instruments were accounted for as if they were a single
financial instrument whilst IFRS requires that the
instruments are recognised in the balance sheet separately
and the swaps are required to be carried at their fair value.
The fair value of the cross-currency swaps can effectively
be split into two components: a currency portion that
converts a US dollar borrowing obligation into one
denominated in euros; and an interest portion that changes
a stream of US dollar fixed interest payments into euro
fixed interest payments. Under UK GAAP , the currency
SPECTRIS 01-17  3/4/06  8:56 pm  Page 14 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005   15
portion of the swaps was included within the carrying value
of the group’s borrowings in the balance sheet. However,
the interest portion of the swap was not previously
recognised in the group balance sheet. Aside from the
change to the way these financial instruments are presented
in the balance sheet, the move to IFRS has required the
interest portion of the swap to be carried in the group
balance sheet for the first time. Since it is considered to be
ineffective in any hedging relationship, all changes in the
fair value of the interest portion of the swap are recognised
in the income statement. At 1 January 2005, the fair value
of the interest portion of the swap was a liability of
£7.6 million, increasing to a liability of £8.7 million at 
31 December 2005. This gives rise to a charge in the income
statement of £1.1 million in 2005.
Over time, as the group continues to make the fixed 
interest payments due under the swap arrangement, the
value of the interest portion of the swap will decrease to nil.
On this basis, changes in its value are considered to be
unrealised gains or losses and so are excluded from the
group’s adjusted measures of profits and earnings.
3. Forward currency contracts – the group uses forward
exchange contracts to hedge highly probable forecast future
cash flows. Under UK GAAP , the value of these contracts
was recognised at the time when the sale transactions to
which they related were recognised. Under IFRS, the fair
value of the forward exchange contracts is required to be
recognised on the balance sheet at all times. Provided the
hedges are considered to remain fully effective, the change
in the fair value of the forward exchange contracts is
recognised in a hedging reserve until the point in time
when the sale transactions occur. At this point, the fair
value of the contracts is recognised in the income
statement.
This change from UK GAAP to IFRS has not had any 
impact on the income statement in 2005 but there is an
impact on the group balance sheet. The fair value of the
forward exchange contracts at 1 January 2005 of an asset 
of £0.8 million was recognised in the group balance sheet,
reducing to a liability of £0.6 million at 31 December 2005.
£1.3 million of this movement was recognised in the 
hedging reserve and £0.1 million of the movement has 
been recognised in the income statement in 2005.

Directors’ report
The directors present their report and accounts for the year
ended 31 December 2005.
Principal activities
Spectris is engaged in the development and marketing of
precision instrumentation and controls. For 2005 reporting
purposes, the businesses were grouped into three sectors:
electronic controls, in-line instrumentation and process
technology. Further details of the trading companies can
be found in the Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s review 
(page 9). Developments in the group’s business activities
are discussed in the Chairman’s and Chief Executive’s review
(page 9) and financial review (page 11).
Acquisitions
During the year, a small, bolt-on acquisition was made, for
which the consideration was £2.5 million, including expenses.
Disposals
In February 2006, the company entered into an option agreement
to sell the Arcom business to Eurotech S.p.A. Eurotech paid
US$2 million in consideration for the option. Should the
acquisition complete the total consideration (including the 
US$2 million already received) will be US$26 million.
During the year the company sold its remaining equity interest
in Luxtron Corporation for £1.7 million net of legal expenses.
Share capital
The issued share capital at the year end consisted of
124,624,405 5p ordinary shares.
At the 2006 Annual General Meeting resolutions will be
proposed for the renewal of the authorities granted to the
directors to allot shares, to allot shares on a non pre-emptive
basis for cash and to purchase the company’s own shares
(either to be cancelled or to be held in treasury), all within
specified limits.
At 7 March 2006 interests notified to the company in
accordance with Part VI of the Companies Act 1985 comprised:
Aegon Asset Management 
5,234,182 shares (4.20% material interest)
Standard Life Investments
4,940,303 shares (3.96% material interest)
Liberty Wanger Asset Management LP
4,120,000 shares (3.31% material interest)
Legal & General Investment Management Limited
4,088,072 shares (3.28% material interest)
Prudential plc
3,989,203 shares (3.20% material interest)
Dividends
Results for the group are set out in the consolidated income
statement on page 33 and in the supporting notes. A final
dividend of 11.2p per ordinary share is proposed for the
year to 31 December 2005 (2004: 10.25p). With the interim
dividend, this makes a total for the year of 15.8p (2004: 14.5p).
The final dividend will be paid on 23 June 2006 to
shareholders on the register on 2 June 2006.
The terms of the Spectris plc Employee Benefit Trust
provide that dividends payable on shares held within the
Trust are waived to 0.01p.
Research and development
Expenditure committed to research and development
is focused on new product development, applications
engineering and process integration. Costs are expensed as
incurred, except where the expenditure meets certain strict
criteria for capitalisation. In the year to 31 December 2005,
amounts expensed totalled £44.9 million (2004: £43.4 million),
and no expenditure met the criteria for capitalisation 
(2004: £nil).
Fixed assets
Whilst the market values of some properties differ from
book values, the directors believe that the differences are
not material.
Payment of suppliers
The group’s policy on payment of suppliers is to ensure that
terms of payment accord with contractual and legal
obligations. The company had £0.1 million of trade creditors
at the year end (2004: £nil).
Directors
The directors of the company are named on pages 16 and 17.
John O’Higgins and John Warren were appointed to the
Board on 10 January 2006 and 7 March 2006 respectively.
Hans Nilsson resigned from the Board on 25 May 2005.
Martin Lamb and Leo Murray will retire from the Board
following the 2006 AGM.
John O’Higgins and John Warren, having been appointed
since the 2005 AGM, retire from the Board under the terms of
the Articles of Association and, being eligible, offer themselves
for election. All other directors of the company were either
appointed or re-appointed at the 2004 or 2005 AGMs.
Therefore, in accordance with Article 106 of the company’s
Articles of Association, approved at the 2005 AGM, no
director is required to submit themselves for re-election at
the 2006 AGM.
The directors’ total remuneration for the year and their
interests in the shares of the company and its subsidiaries
at 31 December 2005 are disclosed in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 29.

Corporate Governance
Combined Code statement of compliance
Spectris plc is subject to the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (“the Combined Code”) that is appended to the
Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. The Combined
Code sets out principles and provisions relating to the good
governance of companies.
Corporate governance has been and remains the
responsibility of the whole Board. This statement describes
how the company applied the principles and complied with
the provisions of the Combined Code during 2005.
The Board considers that it was throughout the year and
continues to be in full compliance with the provisions set out
in Section 1 of the Combined Code, save that:
• a majority of the members of the nomination committee
are not independent non-executive directors, as required
by provision A4.1. The committee consists of the
Chairman, the senior independent director and the
Chief Executive and the Board considers this to be the
most appropriate composition for the sensitive issues
addressed by the committee;
• until 31 May 2005 the audit committee did not consist
exclusively of independent non-executive directors, as
required by provision C3.1. The Chairman, John Poulter,
has since resigned from the audit committee, whose
composition is now in compliance.
Board composition and procedures
The Board meets formally around nine times each year to
consider developments in relation to the company’s strategy
and long-term objectives and to review trading results and
operational and business issues. In particular it deals with
those matters reserved to it for decision, including the
acquisition and disposal of businesses, major capital
expenditure, the appointment and, where necessary, removal
of directors and Board and senior management succession
planning. Usually, two meetings each year are held at
operating locations and encompass a detailed review of the
relevant business. Operational decisions are delegated by the
Board to senior management at trading company level over
which the Business Group Directors exercise supervision.
All directors receive detailed progress reports one week prior
to each Board meeting.
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, four
executive directors and five non-executive directors.
The Board considers all its non-executive directors 
(Andrew Given, Martin Lamb, Leo Murray, Anthony Reading
and John Warren) to be independent. In normal
circumstances, the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive,
and that of senior independent director, are held by separate
individuals and the Board has adopted written profiles for
each of these. The non-executive directors have all had senior
experience in other organisations and offer independent
judgement on Board matters. The Chairman’s other
significant interests are as a non-executive director of Smaller
Companies Value Trust plc and certain private companies.
The Board believes that the Chairman’s obligations to the
company are unaffected by these directorships.
There are procedures for individual Board members to
receive induction and training as appropriate and to solicit
independent professional advice at the group’s expense where
specific expertise is required in the course of exercising their
duties. All directors have access to the company secretary, who
is responsible for ensuring compliance with appropriate
statutes and regulations.
All directors are subject to re-election by shareholders
at the first AGM after their appointment and thereafter at
intervals of no more than three years.
The Board delegates specific responsibilities to Board
committees, notably the nomination, remuneration and audit
committees. The terms of reference of these committees are
published on the company’s website and the following
additional documents are available to shareholders on
application to the company secretary:
• schedule of matters reserved for decision by the Board;
• responsibilities of the Chairman, the Chief Executive and
the non-executive directors;
• relations with shareholders;

Board appointments and performance evaluation
The nomination committee consists of the Chairman, the
senior independent director and the Chief Executive and is
chaired by the Chairman, save in the event of discussions
relating to his succession when the senior independent
director would take the chair.
Following a decision of the Board that the appointment of
a new director is appropriate, the duty of the committee is to
present for Board consideration suitably qualified candidate(s).
In making such recommendations, the committee evaluates the
balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and
develops a description of the role and required capabilities.
Candidates are then identified for interview, external search
consultants being engaged as part of this process. The
committee also makes recommendations to the Board
regarding the re-election and/or re-appointment of any
director. Similar selection processes would apply for the
appointment of a successor chairman.
The nomination committee meets as the need arises. Its
terms of reference can be found on the company’s website.
The operation of the Board and its committees is evaluated
by the Board as a whole annually. The executive directors’ and
company secretary’s performances are appraised annually
against objectives established for the prior year. The
contributions of the Chairman and non-executive directors
are reviewed in advance of the conclusion of their initial 
three-year term, by the senior independent director and
the Chairman respectively, prior to their being proposed to
shareholders for re-election. Additionally, the Chairman holds
periodic meetings with the non-executive directors only and,
led by the senior independent director, the non-executives
meet at least annually without the Chairman present.
An external moderator assisted the Board during 2005 in
the evaluation of its operation and performance.
Shareholder relations
Spectris conducts regular dialogue with institutional
shareholders and divulges such information as is permitted
within the guidelines of the Listing Rules. The content of
presentations made after results announcements may be
accessed by individual investors on the group website,
www.spectris.com.
All shareholders are invited to participate in the Annual
General Meeting, where the Chairman, the Chief Executive
and the chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination
committees are available to answer questions. The results of
proxy votes are declared at the Annual General Meeting after
each resolution has been dealt with on a show of hands.
The Board is kept informed of the views of major
shareholders through periodic reports from the Chief
Executive, the company’s broker Merrill Lynch and the
company’s shareholder relations adviser Makinson Cowell.
The Chairman and non-executive directors have the
opportunity to attend the bi-annual analyst presentations.
Shareholders representing in excess of 3% of the company’s
issued share capital receive a standing invitation to meet
with the Chairman, the senior independent director or new
non-executive directors. Such meetings would supplement
if necessary, but not replace, the regular meetings with the
Chief Executive and group finance director.
Audit committee
The audit committee comprises the non-executive directors
and is chaired by Andrew Given. Andrew Given and John
Warren both have recent and relevant financial experience
as the former group finance directors of Logica plc and
WH Smith PLC respectively. The committee meets at least
three times each year to consider the effectiveness of the
group’s internal controls, policies and procedures, the process
of internal audit and the outcome of the external audit. Its
meetings are normally attended by the Chairman, the Chief
Executive, the group finance director, the company secretary
and the external auditor. The committee regularly confers with
the auditor without the attendance of executive directors. Its
terms of reference can be found on the company’s website.
The committee is responsible for making recommendations
to the Board in relation to the appointment of the external
auditor and then for approving the external auditor’s
remuneration, terms of engagement and scope of work.
The committee has also adopted procedures governing
and restricting the appointment of the external auditor for
non-audit services. The following services are precluded:
• book-keeping or other services related to the accounting
records or financial statements of Spectris plc;
• financial information systems design and implementation;
• appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or
contribution in kind reports;
• actuarial services;
Directors’ report continued
SPECTRIS 18-22  3/4/06  9:50 pm  Page 20 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005   21
• internal audit outsourcing services;
• management functions or human resources;
• broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment
banking services;
• legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit.
A cumulative annual cap of £200,000 is established for all
other non-audit services (save for acquisition due diligence
and taxation services) above which all engagements are
subject to prior approval by the audit committee.
The group employs an internal control and risk manager
who performs internal control reviews across the group
according to a work programme agreed by the committee.
The group internal control and risk manager is assisted in this
by an internal auditor and by other group finance personnel.
The nature and scope of the group’s internal control review
resources is reviewed by the audit committee annually. The
audit committee receives reports twice a year on the results
of internal control reviews. The group internal control and
risk manager has direct access to the chairman of the audit
committee and may meet with him in the absence of
executive management.
Internal controls 
The Board is ultimately responsible for the group’s system of
internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. However,
such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate
risk of failure to meet business objectives and can provide
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
Following publication of the updated guidance for directors
on internal control (“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors
on the Combined Code”), the Board confirms that there is an
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing any
significant risks faced by the group, that this has been in place
for the year under review and up to the date of approval of
the annual report and accounts, that this process has been
reviewed by the Board during the year and that the group
accords with the guidance. The Board affirms the importance
it attaches to the continuous review and application of the
guidance, the regular and systematic assessment of the risks
facing the group and the value of embedding risk management
and internal control systems within its business processes.
To that end an experienced internal auditor was appointed
during the year to assist the group internal control and risk
manager and further such strengthening of the internal audit
function is under consideration.
The processes which the Board and the audit committee
have applied in reviewing the effectiveness of the group’s
system of internal controls are summarised as follows:
• risk assessment and evaluation for each business unit takes
place as an integral part of the annual strategic planning
cycle. Having identified the principal risks to achievement
of their strategic business objectives, each business unit is
required to document the management and mitigating
actions in place and proposed;
• the principal risks identified during the annual strategic
planning cycle and the effectiveness of the management
and mitigating actions in place are reviewed regularly by the
executive directors and twice yearly by the audit committee;
• additionally, the executive directors consider those risks to
the group’s strategic objectives which are not addressed
within the business units and develop appropriate
approaches to managing and mitigating these risks;
• annual financial plans for each business unit, significant
capital investments or contractual commitments and major
acquisitions or divestments are all subject to review and
approval by the Board;
• there is a Group Accounting and Policies Manual which
sets out the minimum standards and procedures to be
applied in relation to those risk areas which are regarded
as significant in a group context;
• a process of self assessment of compliance with the Manual
and reporting thereon has been established, providing for 
a documented trail of accountability from business unit
presidents and finance directors to the audit committee.
The necessary actions are taken by the audit committee to
remedy any failings or weaknesses identified by its review
of the internal control system;
• the executive directors report to the Board on changes
in the business and external environment which present
significant risks. The group finance director provides the
Board with monthly financial information which includes
key performance and risk indicators. Regular reports on
significant legal issues and insurance matters are received
from the company secretary.
Going concern
Having reviewed the group’s plans and available financial
facilities, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the
group has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason it
continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the group’s accounts.

Directors’ report continued
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the
annual report and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report
and the group and parent company financial statements, in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and
parent company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the directors are required to prepare the
group financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU
and have elected to prepare the parent company financial
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
The group financial statements are required by law and
IFRS as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial
position and performance of the group; the Companies Act
1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that
references in the relevant part of that Act to financial
statements giving a true and fair view are references to
their achieving a fair presentation.
The parent company financial statements are required
by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the parent company.
In preparing each of the group and parent company
financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
• for the group financial statements, state whether they have
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the parent company financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the parent company and enable
them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard
the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are
also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement
that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the corporate and financial information included
on the company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
By order of the Board.

Directors’ remuneration report
The directors present their remuneration report for the year
ended 31 December 2005.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is responsible for
recommending to the Board the broad policy for the
remuneration of the Chairman, the Chief Executive,
the executive directors and the company secretary. The
remuneration of non-executive directors is a matter
reserved to the Chairman and executive directors.
Within the terms of the agreed policy, the committee
determines:
• the total individual remuneration package including,
where appropriate, bonuses and share-based incentives;
• the targets for any performance-related incentives;
• the scope of any pension arrangements;
• contractual terms of engagement and any payments
to be made on termination; and
• the policy for authorising claims for expenses from
the Chairman or Chief Executive.
The committee also monitors the level and structure of
remuneration for business unit presidents or managing
directors and the head of corporate development.
The remuneration committee consists of the non-executive
directors (who are all independent), these being at the date
of this report Anthony Reading (chairman), Andrew Given,
Martin Lamb, Leo Murray and John Warren. Martin Lamb
served as chairman throughout 2005. John Poulter, Chairman
of the Board, is in attendance at most meetings save during
discussions relating to his own remuneration. The Chief
Executive may also on occasions be in attendance by
invitation and the committee takes into consideration
his recommendations regarding the remuneration of his
executive colleagues. The Chief Executive is not involved
in discussions concerning his own remuneration.
The committee has appointed New Bridge Street
Consultants LLP to advise on various aspects of the
Chairman’s and executive directors’ remuneration, including
the establishment of the proposed new performance share
plan for the company’s senior management. This firm did not
provide any other services to the company during the year.
The terms of reference of the remuneration committee
can be found on the company’s website and are available
on request.
Remuneration policy
The Board, in considering the recommendations of the
remuneration committee, complied throughout the year
with the provisions of the Combined Code (including the
principles for performance-related remuneration set out in
Schedule A). The policy objective is to ensure that the high
calibre managers required at board level are fairly and
competitively remunerated and incentivised in a manner
consistent with the group’s strategic objectives.
The remuneration committee also regularly reviews the
relative importance of fixed and variable pay and considers
the current balance to be appropriate.
Salaries
Base salaries are established by reference to surveys of the
terms offered by comparable UK quoted companies. The
starting point for comparative surveys is the scope of the
position and associated performance of the Chairman, each
executive director and the company secretary. Excluding
his own position and performance, the Chief Executive is
responsible for the definition of the scope of positions and
assessment of performance of each executive director for
approval by the remuneration committee. Salaries are set at
competitive levels, typically based around the market median,
although the remuneration committee reserves the flexibility
to respond to individual circumstances. Market ranges are
reviewed on a regular basis.
Bonuses
To align remuneration with shareholders’ interests, a
significant proportion of executive directors’ potential total
remuneration is related to corporate performance and it is
intended that this balance should continue. Bonuses of up
to 75% of base salary are achievable dependent upon the
attainment of demanding normalised earnings per share,
profit before tax, or similar targets, set in relation to carefully
considered business plans. In a typical year bonus payments
will commence only at a level which shows an acceptable
degree of progress year-on-year and a 50% of salary payment
is set at an achievable but stretching target. Maximum bonus
would only become payable for an exceptional level of
performance. Such bonuses are not pensionable and the
executive directors have undertaken that any bonus payment
in excess of 50% of salary will, after deduction of tax, be used
for the purchase of shares in the company until the required
once times salary shareholding is achieved.
Mr O’Higgins’ bonus entitlements for 2006 include a
guaranteed 25% element. This was negotiated as part of the
terms of his joining and there will be no guaranteed element
in subsequent years.
45.5% bonuses were earned in respect of 2005 performance.
Share-based incentives
It is intended that each executive director should, subject
to personal circumstances, build (through the vesting of
performance share awards, the exercise of option grants
and the achievement of bonus levels above 50%) a retained
shareholding in Spectris plc greater than once times salary
in value within a five-year period from appointment.
The remuneration committee keeps under constant review
the company’s share-based incentive arrangements and takes
advice on market practice. Previously, the company has made
grants of share options under the 1996 executive share option
plan and the 1999 executive share option scheme. The ten-year
life of the 1996 plan will expire at the 2006 AGM. Following
SPECTRIS 23-29  3/4/06  9:08 pm  Page 23 24 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005
Directors’ remuneration report continued
a process of consultation with major shareholders, the
committee has decided that the replacement scheme should
be in the form of a performance share plan. The Board is
therefore seeking approval at the 2006 AGM for a
performance share plan for senior management to be known
as the Spectris Performance Share Plan (the “Plan”), the full
details of which are set out in the Chairman’s letter
accompanying the Notice of AGM.
The committee is of the view that offering senior
management the opportunity to be awarded shares in the
company is an important part of motivating and rewarding
key employees so that they may participate in the future
growth in value of the company. The Plan is intended to
support this objective and to facilitate the retention of senior
management over the longer term.
In summary, under the Plan, annual awards of shares will
be made which will vest at the end of a three-year period
subject to continued employment and the satisfaction of
performance conditions.
The maximum award of performance shares that may be
made to any participant in any financial year will be limited
to shares with a market value equal to 125% of the
participant’s salary, although initial awards will be over shares
worth a multiple of salary determined by reference to a base
award of 67% of salary, which may then be flexed up or down
depending on corporate and personal performance.
It is proposed that the performance condition at least
in respect of initial awards granted up to the normal level
(i.e. awards over shares worth 67% of salary) will be structured
so that 50% of awards will be subject to an earnings per share
(“EPS”) target and 50% will be subject to a total shareholder
return (“TSR”) target. The performance criteria are
summarised in the table below:
Company % of award that vests (expressed as 
EPS performance a percentage of one-half of the total 
number of shares subject to an award)
Consumer Prices Index (”CPI”) 100%
+ 10% compound 
per annum (c.p.a.)
Between CPI + 5% and 10% Pro-rata straight line between
c.p.a. 25% and 100%
CPI + 5% c.p.a. 25%
Less than CPI + 5% c.p.a. 0%
Company TSR performance % of award that vests (expressed as 
relative to the FTSE 250 a percentage of one-half of the total
(excluding Investment Trusts) number of shares subject to an award)
Upper quartile of above 100%
Between upper quartile Pro-rata straight line 
and median between 25% and 100%
Median 25%
Below Median 0%
If awards in excess of 100% of salary are granted then
the percentage of an award that will vest for threshold
performance will be limited to 25% of a participant’s base
salary rather than 25% of the number of shares subject to
an award, with pro-rata straight line vesting from this lower
point up to 100% of award.
If the Plan is approved, it is the intention of the committee
that all further share-based incentives granted to senior
managers or executive directors would be made under the
Plan and that no further grants would be made under the
remaining 1999 executive share option scheme. No option
grants have been made during the year to date, nor are any
grants envisaged. Executive directors may, however, continue
to participate in the savings-related option scheme which is
applicable to all UK employees.
Mr Poulter retains share option grants received during his
previous service as an executive director, but has not received
grants since being appointed Chairman in 2001 and would
not receive awards under the proposed Plan.
Exercise of share options which were granted under the
1996 executive share plan or the 1999 executive share option
scheme remain subject to prior achievement of performance
conditions, requiring compound growth in earnings per
share before exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill
(“EPS”) over three financial years to be significantly ahead
of the increase in the retail prices index (“RPI”). EPS growth
was selected as the appropriate pre-condition to exercise
in order to ensure that share option gains would only be
received if the company’s performance for shareholders had
been enhanced. EPS figures to be used will be those published
in the audited accounts for each financial year. During the
period of transition to International Financial Reporting
Standards, the remuneration committee will ensure that
EPS figures continue also to be calculated on a UK GAAP
basis to enable the base and final EPS figures for prior grants
to be calculated on a consistent basis. Grants of options made
in 2005 will be calculated under IFRS.
Benefits
Company car and health insurance benefits are subject
to income tax and none of these benefits is pensionable.
The executive directors have defined contribution pension
arrangements to which the company contributes at a rate
of 25% of salary.
Contractual terms
All executive directors have rolling contracts subject to
12 months’ notice. Mr O’Higgins’ contract provides for an
initial notice period of 18 months reducing to 12 months
over the first six months of employment.
The committee has determined that contracts of
employment should, going forward, contain a contractual
best endeavours obligation to seek alternative employment in
the event of serving of notice of termination by the company,
and that full mitigation reflective of any earnings from a new
position should apply so as to reduce the payments otherwise
due from the company during the notice period. Additionally,
in these circumstances, it is the current intention that bonus
entitlements should be calculated to the date of notice of
termination only and that a phased payment provision,
subject to reduction as explained above and equivalent to
1.65 times monthly salary, should apply in lieu of all
SPECTRIS 23-29  3/4/06  9:08 pm  Page 24 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005   25
remuneration and benefits otherwise payable during
the notice period and in full and final settlement of all
employment-related claims. Mr O’Higgins’ contract
of employment reflects these terms.
The contracts for all other executive directors only provide
for a predetermined compensation payment in lieu of notice
(equivalent to total notice period remuneration – salary,
bonus and benefits) in the event of termination within
12 months of a change in control of the group. Termination
payments in other circumstances would be a matter for
negotiation and remain, at the discretion of the committee,
subject to mitigation and/or reduction for accelerated payment.
The Chairman, John Poulter, is retained on a contract of
employment subject to six months’ notice and terminating
at the 2007 AGM.
External appointments
Executive directors may retain any payments received in
respect of external non-executive appointments. Such
appointments are limited to one per director at any time
and are subject to the approval of the Board.
Remuneration below board level
Remuneration for presidents of the group’s trading
companies is set at competitive levels to reflect the size,
complexity and geographic locations of these businesses. Base
salaries for presidents of the group’s European operations fall
within a range between €140,000 and €240,000. Base salaries
for presidents of the group’s US operations fall within a range
between $160,000 and $260,000. Additionally, the group’s
presidents participate in profit-related bonus arrangements
yielding up to 75% of base salary dependent upon
performance over both the current and subsequent
financial years.
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors’ fees are agreed by the Chairman
and executive directors by reference to market practice.
There is no participation in bonus, share option, or pension
arrangements and there will be no participation in the
proposed Performance Share Plan. All non-executive
directors’ conditions of appointment provide for a six-month
period of notice within an initial term of three years from
election by shareholders at the director’s first AGM. The
appointment may be renewed by mutual agreement for
a further three-year period.
Total shareholder return
The following graph indicates the value by the end of 2005
of £100 invested in Spectris plc 5p ordinary shares on
31 December 2000 compared with the value of £100 invested
in the FTSE mid-250 index (excluding investment trusts)
over the same period. The graph was selected as the most
appropriate comparison measure because the company is
a constituent member of the FTSE mid-250 index and the
members of the FTSE mid-250 (excluding investment trusts)
form the comparator group for the purposes of the TSR
performance test under the proposed Performance Share Plan.

The company has entered into a termination agreement, incorporating a contractual duty to mitigate loss, with former director Mr Nilsson,
terminating his service agreement on 12 months’ notice effective from 25 May 2005. The table above shows only Mr Nilsson’s emoluments paid
to the date of his resignation from the Board. Under the provisions of this termination agreement, which was concluded in accordance with
independent legal advice, Mr Nilsson will continue to receive his salary and benefits during the subsequent notice period or to such earlier date
as may be agreed (the “Termination Date”). Mr Nilsson’s 2005 bonus payment is to be based on the percentage authorised by the company’s
remuneration committee as payable to members of the company’s executive committee for the 2005 financial year. Mr Nilsson will receive a fixed
bonus payment for 2006 based on his 2005 bonus payment percentage, but pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the 2006 financial year during
which he remains in the employ of the company up to the Termination Date. £12,000 will be paid, post the Termination Date, in consideration of
Mr Nilsson’s compliance with certain post-termination restrictions. In the event of his securing new employment during the notice period, payments
will cease and the company will pay to Mr Nilsson 50% of the aggregate value of his salary, contractual benefits, and fixed bonus payment which
would otherwise have been paid in the period from the Termination Date to the end of the notice period. The arrangements described will incur
a maximum cost of £614,000 (plus £89,000 pension contribution) from the date of resignation, all of which was accrued in 2005. All unexercised
share options will lapse at the Termination Date. At the date of notice of termination, Mr Nilsson had served as a director of the company for in
excess of 7 years.

Shares other than those marked SAYE relate to executive share option grants. Entitlement to exercise grants under the unapproved 1996 Executive
Share Option Plan is conditional upon a performance criterion requiring compound growth in normalised earnings per share (“EPS”) over three years
up to 5% per annum in excess of the increase in the retail prices index (refer to the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 24 for further
explanation). No consideration was paid by any recipient in relation to the grant of an option and there were no changes to the conditions
on which any option was granted during the year.
J C Webster exercised 20,518 options under the Approved 1988 Executive Share Option Scheme during the year. He sold sufficient shares to pay
the exercise and dealing costs, retaining the balance of 2,065 shares. The gain on exercise was £12,476. J C Webster also exercised 15,389 options
under the Unapproved 1996 Executive Share Plan during the year. He sold sufficient shares to pay the exercise and dealing costs and income tax

Corporate responsibility
Spectris is committed to creating business growth whilst
ensuring that impact on the environment is minimised and
that all activities are conducted safely by well-trained and
qualified employees.
Spectris comprises a number of subsidiary companies which
operate around the world. The companies’ products are used
to monitor and control processes in many industries, helping
customers to improve efficiency and minimise their impact
on the environment by reducing raw material consumption,
waste or energy use. In turn, Spectris companies themselves
actively seek to minimise their impact on the environment by
designing products which are more energy-efficient and avoid
the use of harmful substances.
Policy setting and monitoring
Overall responsibility for developing corporate policies on
social, ethical and environmental matters and for reviewing
their effectiveness lies with the Spectris Board. The individual
operating units are then responsible for ensuring the policy is
communicated and applied within their particular business,
taking account of local legislation and regulation. All policies
and procedures are reviewed periodically and any updates
are communicated to the operating companies.
Spectris policies and procedures are communicated to all
business units via the Spectris Group Manual. As an integral
part of the company’s risk management and corporate
governance processes, the presidents and finance directors of
the operating companies are required to certify, on an annual
basis, compliance with the company’s policies and procedures
and report on, where appropriate, all non-compliance events.
The process for identifying, evaluating and managing any
significant risks, including those arising from social, ethical
and environmental matters, forms part of the group’s system
of internal controls and is regularly reviewed by the group
internal control and risk manager. Additionally, the executive
directors report to the Board on any changes in the business
and external environment which present significant risk,
whilst regular reports on legal exposure and insurance
matters are received from the company secretary.
FTSE4Good index
Spectris has been a member of the FTSE4Good UK index
since its establishment in July 2001. The FTSE4Good UK
index measures and benchmarks the performance of
companies that meet globally recognised corporate
responsibility standards, with particular emphasis on the
environment and human rights.
The following report explains the company’s commitment
to social, ethical and environmental issues. The policies are
described fully on the company’s website at
http://www.spectris.com/aboutus/corporate.php.
Environment, health and safety (EHS)
The Chief Executive has overall responsibility for
environment, health and safety matters. Senior executives in
each of the business units are responsible for implementing
the policy at local level.
Environment
Spectris addresses environmental concerns by providing
customers with products which enable them to minimise
their impact on the environment by reducing raw material
and energy consumption, eliminating waste and minimising
harmful emissions. Products are also designed to help
customers to meet new legislation, for example instrumentation
providing the ability to measure low levels of materials such
as lead and cadmium to meet the new European directive
on the restriction of hazardous substances. Other examples
of the use of Spectris products having a direct beneficial
contribution to reducing environmental impact are shown on
the company’s website.
Spectris products do not require capital-intensive
manufacturing processes and hence their manufacture
generally has a low overall environmental impact.
Nevertheless, Spectris is committed to adopting
environmentally responsible policies in its internal
operations wherever its companies operate. Each
operating company is required to comply with all
relevant environmental laws and minimise raw material
usage, energy and waste disposal.
The design processes for Spectris products take into account
the operational lifetime of every product and end-of-life
removal or disposal. Consideration is given to the recyclability
of materials, energy consumption and environment-friendly
production, packaging and shipping. During 2005, Spectris
companies, and their suppliers, worked to ensure the provision
of products which comply with the new European regulations
on the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Waste
Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), where
appropriate. These directives apply particularly in the
manufacture of printed circuit boards (an activity largely
carried out by third-party suppliers to Spectris), where
lead-free solder is now being used.
Internal initiatives are in place at many Spectris sites to
reduce energy usage and minimise wastage. These include
recycling of waste paper, cardboard, plastic cups, aluminium
cans and mobile phones, reducing energy consumption
through the use of timers and sensors to control hot water, air
conditioning and lighting, reducing water consumption and
re-use of packaging and filling materials. Spectris complies
with the UK Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging
Waste) Regulations which set targets for the recovery and
recycling of packaging waste.

Environmental management systems
Operating companies representing over one-third of Spectris
business by turnover are certified to ISO14001.
During the year no significant environmental incidents
were recorded. Investigative studies into contaminated land
at Almelo in the Netherlands, resulting from activities prior 
to ownership by PANalytical, have now been completed and
a final report has been submitted to the Dutch authorities
for review and approval prior to any remediation activities.
Health and safety 
Spectris is committed to providing a working environment
at all of its sites which is safe and without risk to health. Each
operating company is responsible for ensuring the health
and safety of its employees and also that of sub-contractors
and suppliers.
Audits of health and safety policies and procedures are
undertaken at all major locations by external assessors acting
on behalf of the group’s insurers on a periodic basis.
During the year no significant health and safety incidents
were recorded.
Human rights, employment and ethics
Spectris operates mainly in Europe and the US, but with
a growing presence in Asia. Although different social and
employment conditions exist in different locations, Spectris
places high priority on compliance with legislative and ethical
requirements within all jurisdictions in which business is
conducted, particularly with respect to employment practices,
labour rights and equal opportunities. The Head of
Commercial has overall responsibility for human rights,
employment and ethics policies, but responsibility for
implementation is delegated to individual business units,
with operational policies tailored to suit local needs.
Human rights 
Spectris believes in the fundamental rights of people in
all parts of the world and is committed to adopting
internationally recognised human rights standards wherever
it operates. The company’s human rights policy is consistent
with the Principles of Human Rights, as set out in the
International Labour Organization’s core conventions, and
includes policies on non-discrimination, harassment, pay
and forced labour.
The group monitors compliance with the policy through
various processes, including confirmation in writing by each
business unit annually, and consolidated Equal Employment
Opportunities Commission returns which are produced in
the US.
Ethics
All employees are expected to behave with integrity and
honesty and demonstrate appropriate business behaviour.
The ethics policy prohibits bribery and similar facilitation
payments. Donations to political parties or similar
organisations are also prohibited.
Spectris operates a confidential “whistleblowing” policy via
which employees may report to the business’s management
team or any Board member any concerns they may have over
unethical business practices or conduct, dangers to health and
safety, or breach of company policies. Any such disclosures are
appropriately investigated. In addition, Spectris is committed
to protecting the career and reputation of employees who
report wrongdoing in accordance with established procedures,
as long as their disclosures are delivered in good faith and seek
to safeguard the best interests of the group.
Training and development
Spectris recognises the value that its employees create for
the business and its commitment to training and personal
development, together with remuneration policies which
are designed to reward achievement, emphasises the
importance of retaining staff throughout the group. Local
policies, based on overall group guidelines, are set by
individual managements according to the needs of their
business and local conditions.
Employee communications
The company has a policy of encouraging its operating
companies to provide information to their employees on a
regular basis. This information includes matters relating to
their company’s performance, its prospects in the markets it
serves and the future outlook for its business. In addition, the
group distributes a periodic electronic newsletter, Perspectives,
which keeps employees abreast of group progress (and is also
available to shareholders at www.spectris.com). Financial
participation in the group is encouraged through the Savings
Related Share Option Scheme available to all UK employees,
the group’s executive share option schemes and the proposed
performance share plan.
Community involvement
Spectris operating companies worldwide support local
charities and participate in a range of community activities
and educational initiatives. Charitable donations in 2005
totalled £73,300 of which £5,500 were in the UK (2004:
£35,000, of which £8,000 in UK). Examples of community
activities are described on our website.

Independent auditors’ report 
to the members of Spectris plc 
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements
(the “financial statements”) of Spectris plc for the year ended
31 December 2005 which comprise the Group Income Statement,
the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group Cash Flow
Statement, the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense
and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited
the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described
as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the
group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU,
and for preparing the parent company financial statements and the
Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with applicable law and
UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice)
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on pages 21
and 22. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
whether, in addition, the group financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also
report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent
with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by
law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is
not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance procedures 
or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
• the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, of the state of the
group’s affairs as at 31 December 2005 and of its profit for the
year then ended; 
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation; 
• the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the
state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2005; and 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the accounts
1 Accounting policies
General information
Spectris plc is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in the
United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985, whose shares are
publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling. Foreign
operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below. 
Statement of compliance and basis of preparation
The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the
directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
as adopted by the EU (IFRS). The company has elected to prepare its
parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these
are presented on pages 70 to 76. Reconciliations required by IFRS 1, First
Time Adoption of IFRS, are included in Note 36 to these accounts.
The financial statements are prepared rounded to the nearest
hundred thousand on the historical cost basis except that the derivative
financial instruments are stated at fair value and non-current assets and
disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount
and fair value less costs to sell.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS
requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated
assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities are noted within specific
accounting policies below. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision
affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently
to all periods presented in these financial statements except where the
policy is indicated as relating to the implementation of IAS 32 or IAS 39
which were adopted from 1 January 2005, or to the implementation
of IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued
Operations, which was also adopted from 1 January 2005. The
accounting policies have been applied consistently by group entities.
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements include the results of the company and
all of its subsidiary undertakings. A subsidiary is an entity controlled by
the group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The
financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date that control commences until the
date that control ceases.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income
and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in
preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair
value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses
of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average annual
exchange rates. Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are
recognised directly in a separate translation reserve within equity.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are
translated at the exchange rate ruling at that date with any exchange
differences arising on retranslation being recognised in the income
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Derivative financial instruments may be purchased to hedge the
group’s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates. The accounting
policies applied in these circumstances are described under the heading
‘Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting’ below.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value
less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition,
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any
difference between cost and redemption value being recognised
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an
effective interest basis.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure
to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operating and
financing activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, it does not hold
or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Following the transition to IFRS and in accordance with the
transitional provisions set out in IFRS 1 the group adopted IAS 32,
Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39, Financial
Instruments: Measurement and Recognition, with effect from 1 January
2005. The paragraphs relating to cash flow hedge accounting, net
investment hedge accounting, and other derivative financial instruments
which follow therefore explain both the previous UK GAAP accounting
policy applied in the comparative period ended 31 December 2004 and
those new policies applied during the year ended 31 December 2005.
The financial impact of these changes of accounting policy is set
out in Note 21.
Cash flow hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments may be transacted to hedge the
variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or of highly
probable forecast transactions, caused by changes in exchange rates.
In the comparative period ended 31 December 2004, the value
of such instruments is not recognised until the point at which the
transactions being hedged occurred. At the point the hedged
transaction occurs, the asset or liability is recorded using the rate
of exchange under the related derivative financial instrument.
From adoption of IAS 39 as at 1 January 2005, derivative financial
instruments are carried in the balance sheet at fair value. Where a
derivative financial instrument is designated in a cash flow hedge
relationship with a highly probable forecast transaction, the
effective part of any gain or loss arising is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income
statement. When the forecast transaction subsequently occurs and
results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability that impacts
on the income statement, the associated cumulative gain or loss is
removed from equity and presented within the income statement.
When the forecast transaction subsequently occurs and results in the
recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative
gain or loss is removed from equity and included within the initial cost
SPECTRIS 32-76  3/4/06  9:18 pm  Page 36 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005   37
of the non-financial asset or liability. If a derivative financial instrument
is not formally designated in a cash flow hedge relationship, any change
in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Net investment hedge accounting
The group uses US$ and euro-denominated borrowings as a hedge
against the translation exposure on the group’s net investment in
overseas companies. In both 2004 and 2005, where the hedge is fully
effective at hedging the variability in the net assets of such companies
caused by changes in exchange rates, the changes in value of the
borrowings are recognised in equity. The ineffective part of any change
in value caused by changes in exchange rates is recognised in the
income statement.
The group takes advantage of cross-currency swaps for some of its
US$-denominated private placement borrowings. The swaps have the
effect of converting fixed rate US$ borrowings into ‘synthetic’ fixed
rate euro-denominated borrowings. The portion of the swap that locks
interest payments at a fixed euro interest rate changes as US$ variable
interest rates, euro variable interest rates, and foreign currency
exchange rates change. Under IAS 39’s rules, such changes in value
are considered to be ineffective as a net investment hedge. In the
comparative period ended 31 December 2004, the fair value attributed
to the portion of the swap that locks euro interest payments at fixed
rates was not recognised. From adoption of IAS 39 as at 1 January
2005, this value is recognised in the balance sheet with any changes
in value being recognised in the income statement.
Other derivative financial instruments
Certain other derivative financial instruments are transacted to provide
a hedge against the group’s overall exposure to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates.
In the comparative period ended 31 December 2004, the value of
these instruments is not recognised in the balance sheet or income
statement until the accounting period they were intended to cover
as a hedge. From adoption of IAS 39 as at 1 January 2005, these
instruments do not meet IAS 39’s hedge accounting criteria and
consequently these instruments are carried at fair value with any
gain or loss being recognised in the income statement.
Business combinations and goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase
method. Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the
purchase consideration for the interests in subsidiary undertakings
over the fair value to the group of the net assets and any contingent
liabilities acquired. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004,
goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost which represents
the amount recorded previously under UK GAAP. Prior to 1 January
1998, goodwill was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is stated at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses. From 1 January 2004, goodwill is allocated on
acquisition to cash-generating units that are anticipated to benefit from
the combination, and is no longer amortised but is tested annually for
impairment. Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount
of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. This estimate of
recoverable amount is performed at each balance sheet date.  
The estimate of recoverable amount requires significant judgement,
and is based on a number of factors such as the near-term business
outlook for the cash generating unit, including both its operating profit
and operating cash flow performance. Where the recoverable amount
of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an
impairment loss is recognised. Where goodwill forms part of a cash-
generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed
of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in
the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss
on disposal. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on
the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the
portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Non-current assets held for sale
Following the adoption of IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations from 1 January 2005, non-current assets (and
disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower
of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale
if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met
only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group)
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management
must be committed to the sale and an active programme to locate a
buyer and complete the sale must have been initiated. Ordinarily the
sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale
within one year from the date of the classification as held for sale.
Segmental analysis
A segment is a distinguishable component of the group that is engaged
in providing products or services (business segment), or in providing
products or services within a particular economic environment
(geographical segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that are
different from those of other segments.
Segmental information is based on two segment formats: the primary
format represents the group’s business segments whereas the secondary
format reflects the geographical segments.
Segment result represents operating profits (including intangible asset
amortisation and goodwill charges) and includes an allocation of head
office expenses. Segment result excludes tax and financing items.
Segment assets comprise goodwill, other intangible assets, property,
plant and equipment, inventories, trade and other receivables and assets
held for sale. Segment liabilities comprise trade and other payables,
provisions, held for sale liabilities, and other payables. Unallocated items
represent corporate and deferred taxation balances, defined benefit
scheme liabilities and all components of net debt.
Intangible assets
Self-funded research and development costs are charged to the income
statement in the year in which they are incurred unless development
expenditure meets certain strict criteria for capitalisation. These criteria
include demonstration of the technical feasibility of completing a new
intangible asset that will be available for sale and that the asset will
generate probable future economic benefits. Where expenditure meets
the criteria, development costs are capitalised and amortised over their
useful economic lives.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the group are stated at
cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Subsequent
expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to administrative
expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The estimated useful lives
are as follows:
Patents and trademarks  up to 5 years
Other intangible assets up to 3 years
SPECTRIS 32-76  3/4/06  9:18 pm  Page 37 38 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005
Notes to the accounts continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any provision for impairments in value. The group
recognises in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment the
subsequent costs of replacing part of such items when there are future
economic benefits. All other costs are recognised in the income
statement as an expense as they are incurred.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost,
less the estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment over
its estimated useful life. The depreciation charge is revised where useful
lives are different to previously estimated, or where technically obsolete
assets are required to be written down. Where parts of an item of plant
and equipment have separate lives, they are accounted for and
depreciated as separate items. Land is not depreciated. Estimated useful
lives are as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold property 20 to 40 years
Short leasehold property over the period of the lease
Plant, machinery and other equipment 5 to 20 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Tooling, computer hardware and software 3 to 5 years
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
The carrying amount of the group’s assets is reviewed at each balance
sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent
from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset
with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and
value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows
have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised
as an operating expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount
of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment
loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an
impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their amortised cost as reduced
by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress are carried at the lower of cost and
net realisable value. Cost represents direct costs incurred and, where
appropriate, a proportion of attributable overheads. Inventory is
accounted for on a first-in, first-out basis. Provision is made for slow
moving and obsolete items based on an assessment of technological
and market developments and on an analysis of historic and
projected usage.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral
part of the group’s cash management are included as a component
of cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the group has a
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation. In respect of warranties a provision is recognised
when the underlying products or services are sold. Provisions are
recognised at an amount equal to the best estimate of the expenditure
required to settle the group’s liability. Obligations arising from
restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans have
been established and when there is a valid expectation that such a
plan will be carried out.
Post-retirement benefits
The group has applied the amendments in IAS 19 (revised 2004) from
the date of transition to IFRS, 1 January 2004. The group operates both
defined benefit schemes based on final pensionable pay and defined
contribution schemes.
The group operates pension schemes providing benefits based on
final pensionable pay. The assets of the schemes are held separately
from those of the group. The group’s net obligation in respect of
defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by
estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned
in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit
is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any
plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is determined by reference
to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate
bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the
group’s obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the
projected unit method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full
in the period in which they arise in the statement of recognised income
and expense.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the
increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as
an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the
average period until the benefits become vested. To the extent that the
benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the
income statement. 
For defined contribution schemes, the assets are held separately from
those of the group in independently administered funds. Payments to
defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as
they fall due. 
Share-based payments
The fair value of employee share option grants is calculated at grant
date. The resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the
vesting period of the plans. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect
expected and actual levels of options that vest, except where forfeiture
is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. 
SPECTRIS 32-76  3/4/06  9:18 pm  Page 38 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005   39
Revenues
Revenues comprise sales to outside customers after discounts and
excluding value added tax.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income
statement when the significant risk and rewards of ownership of the
goods have been transferred to the customer. For contracts which
involve a significant element of installation or testing of equipment,
revenue is recognised at the point of customer acceptance. Revenue
from services rendered is recognised in the income statement in
proportion to the measurement of the stage of completion of services
rendered as at the balance sheet date. Rental income is recognised
in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of
the agreement. Revenue is not recognised if there are significant
uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due.
Interest payable
Interest payable comprises the interest payable on borrowings calculated
using the effective interest method. 
Interest receivable and payable is recognised in the income statement
as it accrues using the effective interest method. Dividend income is
recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment
is established.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group
at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet
as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between
finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a
straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Benefits received
and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also
spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises both current and
deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which
case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method,
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for taxation purposes. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of intra-group
dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the
related dividend.
IFRS transitional arrangements
When preparing the group’s IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004,
the date of transition, the following optional exemptions, provided by
IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards,
from full retrospective application of IFRS accounting policies have
been adopted:
• Business combinations – the provisions of IFRS 3 have been
applied from 1 January 2004. The net carrying value of goodwill
at 31 December 2003 under the previous accounting policies has
been deemed to be the cost at 1 January 2004;
• Financial instruments – the provisions of IAS 32 and IAS 39 have
not been applied to the comparative period to 31 December 2004,
which, for these purposes, has been prepared on the basis of
previous UK GAAP accounting policies as described above;
• Cumulative translation differences arising on consolidation of
subsidiaries – IAS 21 requires such differences to be held in a separate
reserve, rather than included in the profit and loss reserve under UK
GAAP. This reserve has been deemed to be nil on 1 January 2004;
• Share-based payments – IFRS 2 has not been applied to share options
granted prior to 7 November 2002 nor to any options that vested
prior to 1 January 2005; and
• Employee benefits – the group has elected to recognise all cumulative
actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes at
the date of transition. 
The group’s transitional balance sheet, and other reconciliations required
by IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards, together with a description of the significant adjustments
applied, are included in Note 36 to these financial statements.

Notes to the accounts continued
2 Financial risk management
The group’s multinational operations and debt financing expose it to
a variety of financial risks. In the course of its business, the group is
exposed to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, funding risk, and
credit risk. Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the
group is managed. Financial risk management policies are set by the
Board of directors. These policies are implemented by a central treasury
department that has formal procedures to manage foreign exchange
risk, interest rate risk, and funding risk, including where appropriate the
use of derivative financial instruments. The group has clearly defined
authority and approval limits.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not hold or use
derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Such
instruments are only used to manage the risks arising from operating or
financial assets or liabilities or highly probable future transactions.
a) Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk arises both where sale or purchase transactions
are undertaken in foreign currencies (transactional exposures) and
where the results of overseas companies are consolidated into the
group’s reporting currency of £sterling (translational exposures). The
group has operations around the world which record their results in a
variety of different local functional currencies. In countries where the
group does not have operations, it invariably has some customers or
suppliers that transact in a foreign currency. The group is therefore
exposed to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates between a
number of different currencies but the group’s primary exposures relate
to the US$, euro and £sterling and, to a lesser extent, the Japanese yen.
Where appropriate the group manages its foreign currency exposures
using derivative financial instruments.
Historically, the group has used zero cost average rate options
to manage, to a greater or lesser extent, both transactional and
translational foreign currency exposures. The last such derivative
financial instrument expired on 31 December 2005 and the group
has no current intention of using average rate options as a hedging
instrument in future.
The group manages its transactional exposures to foreign currency
risks through the use of forward exchange contracts. Forward exchange
contracts are typically used to hedge highly probable forecast sale
transactions which can be forecast to occur from anything between
1 and 18 months into the future.
The group’s translational exposures to foreign currency risks can relate
both to the income statement and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
Following the expiry of the last zero cost average rate option on
31 December 2005, the group’s policy is not to hedge the translational
exposure that arises on consolidation of the income statements of
overseas subsidiaries. The group finances overseas company investments
partly through the use of foreign currency borrowings in order to
provide a natural hedge of foreign currency risk arising on translation
of the group’s net investment.
b) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results
from borrowing at fixed rates of interest and also the interest cash flow
risk that results from borrowing at variable rates. Where appropriate
interest rate swaps are used to manage the group’s interest rate profile.
At this time, the majority of the group’s borrowings attract fixed rates
of interest payments and therefore the group’s principal interest rate risk
is a price risk.
c) Funding risk
Funding risk represents the risk that the group encounters difficulties in
raising finance in order to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The group manages this risk by maintaining adequate committed lines
of funding from high quality lenders.
During July 2006, the $100m 1996 Private Placement loans will
become due for repayment. New committed facilities have already been
negotiated which, together with the free cash flow generated by the
group, will provide sufficient funds to repay these loans and ensure
that the group’s funding risks remain at an acceptable level.
d) Credit risk
Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its
obligations. The group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets
such as cash balances, derivative financial instruments, trade and
other receivables.
The group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are net of appropriate
allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the group’s
management based on prior experience and their assessment of the
current economic environment. Trade receivables are subject to credit
limits and control and approval procedures in the operating companies.
Due to its large geographic base and number of customers, the
group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on its
trade receivables.
Credit risk associated with cash balances and derivative financial
instruments is managed by transacting with financial institutions with
high quality credit ratings. Accordingly the group’s associated credit risk
is limited. The group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the
carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial
instruments, in the group balance sheet.

3 Adjusted performance measures
Spectris uses adjusted figures as key performance measures in addition to those reported under IFRS. Adjusted figures are stated before amortisation
of acquisition-related intangible assets, goodwill charges, profits or losses on termination or disposal of businesses or major fixed assets, unrealised
changes in the fair value of financial instruments, related tax effects and other tax items which do not form part of the underlying tax rate 
(see Note 11).

5 Assets and liabilities held for sale
During the ordinary course of the group‘s strategic reviews, a decision was taken to dispose of the Arcom business which is included in the
Electronic controls segment. In February 2006 Spectris entered into an option agreement to sell the Arcom business to Eurotech S.p.A. Since the
year end, Eurotech has paid US$2m to Spectris in consideration for the option which gives Eurotech 60 days to acquire Arcom on a cash and debt-
free basis. Should the acquisition complete, the total consideration will be US$26m (including the US$2m option payment already received). As at
31 December 2005, the assets and liabilities of the Arcom business are presented in the group accounts as held for sale and are stated at the lower
of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. There was no gain or loss arising as a result of the classification as held for sale.

9 Retirement benefit schemes
Spectris plc operates funded defined benefit ‘final salary’ and defined contribution pension plans for the group’s qualifying employees in the UK.
In addition, six overseas subsidiaries provide defined benefit plans. Other UK and overseas subsidiaries have their own defined contribution plans
invested in independent funds, and the group operates a defined contribution plan in the USA for its US subsidiaries. 
Defined contribution plans
The total cost to Spectris plc of the defined contribution plans for the year ended 31 December 2005 was £6.9m (2004: £6.3m). There were no
outstanding or prepaid contributions to these plans as at 31 December 2005 (or at 31 December 2004).
Defined benefit plans
The last full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates:
Plan name Date of last full actuarial valuation
Spectris Pension Plan 31 December 2002
Servomex Pension and Assurance Scheme 30 June 2002

BTG Mütek GmbH 31 December 2005
Brüel & Kjær GmbH 31 December 2005
PANalytical GmbH 31 December 2005
The valuations were updated to 31 December 2005 for IAS 19 purposes by qualified independent actuaries.
The total contributions made to the defined benefit plans in the year ended 31 December 2005 were £3.2m (2004: £1.5m). Contributions for 2006
are expected to be as follows:

The above contribution rates are subject to review at future valuations and periodical certifications of the Schedule of Contributions.
The assets and liabilities of the Servomex Pension and Assurance Scheme were transferred to the Spectris Pension Plan on 31 December 2005 and
this is reflected in the above contribution rates.
The Spectris Pension Plan is a closed scheme and hence under the Projected Unit Method, used to calculate the service cost under IAS 19, the
current service cost will increase when expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay as the members of the plan approach retirement.
The major assumptions used by the actuary to value the liabilities of the defined benefit plans were:

The overall expected return on assets is calculated as the weighted average of the expected return on each individual asset class. The expected
return on equities is the sum of inflation, dividend yield and economic growth, less investment expenses. The return on gilts and bonds is the
current market yield on long-term gilts and bonds. The expected return on other assets is the current interest rate set by the Bank of England.

Other financial income represents a gain made on disposal of the group’s remaining interest in Luxtron Corporation. In 2002, the group disposed
of 80.1% of its interest in Luxtron Corporation in exchange for US$6m 5% preference shares and continued to hold its 19.9% equity interest.
The group’s preference shares and equity interest were deemed to be impaired and have since been carried in the group balance sheet at a nil
value. During 2005, £0.4m of preference shares were redeemed and the group has disposed of its remaining interest in Luxtron for a further
£1.3m, generating a gain on disposal of £1.7m. This gain is presented as financial income in the income statement. In addition the group has
received dividend income amounting to £0.1m (2004: £0.1m).

A tax liability of £2.8m (2004: £9.8m) has been recognised on dividends received in the UK from EU-based subsidiaries on the basis of current UK
tax legislation. The legality of the UK rules is currently being challenged and the group litigation order test case has been referred to the European
Court of Justice. In view of the uncertainties regarding the final outcome of the court proceedings and taking into account current UK tax law,
a liability has been recognised. In the event that current UK law is overturned, no tax will be due.
Taxation on other dividend flows of £3.6m (2004: £0.9m) is mitigated by movements on unrecognised deferred tax assets of £1.4m (2004: £0.9m)
and current year UK tax losses of £1.9m (2004: £nil). The remaining £0.3m (2004: £nil) relates to withholding tax payments.

13 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the parent by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year but adjusted for the effects of dilutive options. The key features of share option contracts are
described in Note 28 to these accounts.

From 1 January 2004, goodwill is no longer amortised and is annually tested for impairment. The reduction in goodwill reflects the corresponding
adjustment to goodwill for the recognition of Danish deferred tax assets following an acquisition prior to 1 January 2004.
During the year, the carrying value of the group’s goodwill has been reviewed and an impairment charge of £7.4m (2004: £nil) has been recognised
in order to write down the goodwill to its estimated recoverable amount. This goodwill is attributable to the In-line instrumentation segment.

At 31 December 2005, the group had available £43.5m (2004: £73.1m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all
conditions precedent had been met.
Secured bank loan
Bank loans are secured by fixed charges over property at three of the group’s subsidiaries. Of these £1.7m is denominated in Chinese Renminbi 
and is repayable by instalments until December 2012 with a fixed interest rate of 7.5%, £0.8m is denominated in US dollars and is repayable 
by instalments until December 2014 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin, and £0.7m is denominated in euros and is repayable 
by instalments until December 2012 with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus a small margin.
Unsecured loan notes
In 1996 the group issued US$100m of loan notes repayable on 15 July 2006 at par. The loan notes bear interest at an average rate of 7.72%,
which is fixed until redemption. In 1996 the group entered into treasury locks to underwrite the interest rate at which the loan notes were issued.
This produced net proceeds of US$1.4m. These proceeds are amortised over the period of the loan notes in the income statement. After taking
these proceeds into account, the average net rate of interest on the loan notes is 7.5%.
In September 2000 the group issued US$75m of loan notes repayable on 13 September 2010 at par. The interest rate on these notes is 8.23%.
On issue, the group entered into cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements which have the effect of converting the US$ borrowings into fixed
interest euro-denominated debt. The combined effect of the borrowing and swap arrangement results in euro debt of €80.4m with a fixed interest
rate of 6.89%. The interest rate is fixed until redemption of the loan notes.
In October 2003 the group issued €25m of loan notes repayable on 15 October 2013. The interest rate on these notes is 5.56% and remains
fixed until redemption.
In October 2003 the group issued US$100m of loan notes repayable on 15 October 2013. The interest rate on these notes is 6.08%. On issue,
the group entered into cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements which have the effect of converting the US$ borrowings into fixed interest
euro-denominated debt. The combined effect of the borrowing and swap arrangement results in euro debt of €90.5m with a fixed interest rate of
5.64%. The interest rate remains fixed until redemption.
Interest is paid six-monthly in arrears on all loan notes. 
Under IFRS, in the case of both the September 2000 and October 2003 US$ borrowing arrangements, the value of the underlying US$ borrowing
is presented in this borrowings note and the value of the related cross-currency interest rate swaps is presented separately within derivative financial
instruments in Note 21. For management purposes, the value attributed to the portion of the swap arrangements that converts US$ borrowings into
euro borrowings is viewed as part of the group’s net debt, as analysed below.

Change in accounting policy
Following the transition to IFRS, the group adopted IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial Instruments:
Measurement and Recognition from 1 January 2005. In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, First Time Adoption of IFRS, the group
has applied the exemption permitting the group not to adopt the standards in the comparative period ended 31 December 2004 and therefore
these standards have been applied prospectively from 1 January 2005. From a presentational perspective, the 2004 comparatives are stated in
accordance with the UK GAAP standard FRS 13, Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments. The nature of the changes arising from the changes in
accounting policy are described further below.
Forward exchange contracts
The group utilises forward exchange contracts to hedge the potential variability in cash flow arising from highly probable forecast sale transactions
due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Until 31 December 2004 under UK GAAP , the value of these instruments was not recognised until the hedged transactions took place. Following
adoption of IAS 39 as at 1 January 2005, these contracts are recorded at each balance sheet date at their fair value on the balance sheet. Assuming
the hedge is effective, any change in the fair value of the forward exchange contracts is recognised in the hedging reserve in equity until the point
at which the hedged transaction occurs, at which time any amount recognised in the hedging reserve is recycled through the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is recognised in the income statement immediately. As at 1 January 2005, following the change
in accounting policy described, an asset of £0.8m was recognised in the balance sheet, with a corresponding entry in the hedging reserve.
SPECTRIS 32-76  3/4/06  9:18 pm  Page 55 56 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005
Notes to the accounts continued
21 Derivative financial instruments continued
The fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding as at 31 December 2005 is a liability of £0.6m of which £0.5m has been debited to the
hedging reserve and £0.1m debited to the income statement. These contracts mature over periods not exceeding 12 months. A summary of the
movements in the hedging reserve during the year is presented below.

The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data.
Cross-currency interest rate swaps
As described in Note 20, the group has taken out cross-currency interest rate swaps to effectively convert fixed interest US$ borrowings into fixed
interest euro borrowings. These ‘synthetic’ euro borrowings act as a natural hedge of the net assets of the group’s European businesses.
The value of the group’s cross-currency interest rate swaps can effectively be split into two components: a portion that is attributable to converting
a US$-denominated borrowing liability into a euro-denominated borrowing liability (the currency portion) – the value of this portion changes as
currency exchange rates change; and a portion that is attributable to converting fixed rate US$ interest payments into fixed rate euro interest
payments (the interest portion) – the value of this portion of the swap changes as US$ variable interest rates, euro variable interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates change.
Until 31 December 2004 under UK GAAP , the combined instruments were accounted for as if they were straightforward fixed interest euro
borrowings and were designated as a hedge of the group’s net investment in its European businesses. The effect of this accounting policy was that
the currency portion of the swaps was effectively recognised within the carrying value of borrowings on the balance sheet and the interest portion
of the swap was not recognised on the balance sheet. Any exchange gain or loss on retranslation of the borrowings was recognised in equity. 
The fair value of the entire cross-currency swap was disclosed in the accounts.
From adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, the underlying US$ borrowings are required to be presented separately in the balance sheet from the cross-
currency interest rate swaps. In addition, the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is required to be recognised in full on the balance
sheet. Following adoption of IAS 39 as at 1 January 2005, the previous UK GAAP carrying value of the affected 2000 and 2003 unsecured loan
note borrowings (underlying US$ borrowings and currency portion of the swap) of £120.5m was replaced with the underlying US$ borrowings of
£90.6m and total liability value of the cross-currency interest rate swap of £37.5m. The net effect of this change was to reduce net assets by
£7.6m with a corresponding entry in reserves.
At 31 December 2005, the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swap is a liability of £24.7m. The reduction in value is primarily attributable
to the strengthening of the US$ during the year. The table below shows the movements on the total value of the cross-currency interest rate swap
during the year and also how it is attributed to its currency and interest portions.

At 31 December 2005 (16.0) (8.7) (24.7)
The combination of the underlying US$ borrowings and cross-currency interest rate swap has been designated as a net investment hedge of the
group’s net investment in its European businesses. However the interest portion of the swap is ineffective in this hedging relationship. Accordingly,
the change in value of the currency portion of the swap is recognised together with the change in value of the underlying US$ borrowings in
reserves, and the change in value of the interest portion of the swap is recognised in the income statement within financing costs.
The fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps is determined using discounted cash flow techniques based on readily available market data.
The key terms of the cross-currency interest rate swaps are set out below. The principal borrowing amounts match exactly with the related
unsecured loan note borrowings as described in Note 20.

Average rate options
Historically the group has used zero cost average rate options to manage, to a greater or lesser extent, both transactional and translational foreign
currency exposures.
Until 31 December 2004 under UK GAAP , the value of these instruments was recognised in the period they were intended to cover as a hedge.
Following adoption of IAS 39 from 1 January 2005, the fair value of these instruments is required to be recognised on the balance sheet. Since
these instruments do not meet IAS 39’s hedge accounting criteria, any change in the fair value of the instruments is recognised in the income
statement. As at 1 January 2005, following the change in accounting policy described, an asset of £1.7m was recognised on the balance sheet,
with a corresponding entry in reserves.
At 31 December 2005, all outstanding instruments expired with a nil value. The change in fair value during the year ended 31 December 2005
of £1.7m has been recognised in the income statement within financing costs.

Currency exposure of monetary assets and liabilities
The following summary shows the net unhedged assets and liabilities of group companies at 31 December 2005 that are not denominated in their
functional currency and therefore give rise to exchange gains and losses which are recognised in the income statement.

Reorganisation provisions relate to committed restructuring plans in place within the business and represent the directors’ best estimate of the cost
to complete the restructuring. Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course
of business and included within the group’s standard terms and conditions. Warranty commitments typically apply for a 12-month period, with the
occasional extension up to 36 months. The provision represents the directors’ best estimate of the group’s liability based on past experience. Other
provisions represent the directors’ best estimate of settling various potential claims against the group arising in the ordinary course of business.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain pending the outcome of ongoing negotiations.
25 Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using the current corporate tax rate in the relevant local
jurisdiction.

Notes to the accounts continued
25 Deferred tax continued
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets where it is
probable that these assets will be recovered. Tax losses do not expire.
No deferred tax liabilities have been provided in respect of the unremitted earnings of non-UK subsidiaries. The amount of such unremitted earnings
is estimated to be a retained profit of £353m (2004: £351m).
Deferred tax assets estimated at £4.2m (2004: £10.7m) have not been recognised due to the degree of uncertainty over both the amount and
utilisation of the underlying tax losses and deductions in certain jurisdictions. There is no associated expiry date with the unrecognised deferred
tax assets in respect of tax losses.
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period are shown below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where
there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

26 Share capital and reserves continued
Other reserves
Movements in reserves are set out in the Reconciliation of movement in capital and reserves in Note 27. The retained earnings reserve includes
own shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust (see Note 29). The nature and purpose of other reserves forming part of equity are as follows:
Translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign
subsidiaries, including gains or losses arising on net investment hedges.
Hedging reserve
This reserve records the fair value of forward exchange contracts where they are designated in effective cash flow hedge relationships.
Merger reserve
This reserve arose on the acquisition of Servomex Limited in 1999, a purchase satisfied substantially by the issue of share capital and therefore
eligible for merger relief under the provisions of section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.
Capital redemption reserve
This reserve records the historical repurchase of the group’s own shares.

28 Share-based payments
The Executive Share Option Scheme and Save As You Earn share option schemes were set up in order to provide executives and selected employees
with options to purchase ordinary shares in the company. Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, exercise prices are determined according to the
mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before the date of grant. Share options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme are
also subject to performance criteria, being the fulfilment of earnings growth targets. Options vest after a period of three years, and have a maximum
term of ten years. 
Under the Save As You Earn scheme, equity shares are issued following a vesting period of three years. Options may be exercised during a six-month
period following the vesting date, and exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price prevailing on the day before
the date of grant. There are no performance criteria associated with options granted under the Save As You Earn scheme.

Share options are valued using a stochastic option pricing model, with support from an independent remuneration consultant. No performance
conditions were included in the calculation of fair value. For options granted in 2005 and 2004, the fair value per option granted and the
assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:

Fair value per option 19.6% 23.2% 31.9% 28.9%
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last 6 years. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk-free
rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life. 
The group recognised total expenses of £0.3m related to equity settled share-based payment transactions in 2005 (2004: £0.4m). 
29 Own shares held by Employee Benefit Trust
The own shares reserve forms part of retained earnings and represents the cost of shares in Spectris plc purchased in the market and held by the
Spectris plc Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) to satisfy options under the group’s share option schemes (see Note 28).

The EBT holds ordinary 5p shares in Spectris plc for the purpose of satisfying obligations under the 1996 Executive Share Option Plan for the benefit
of the group’s employees. The EBT held 1.1 million shares at 31 December 2005 (2004: 3.2 million) at a cost of £5.0m (2004: £14.2m). The market
value of the EBT’s shares at 31 December 2005 was £7.2m (2004: £12.3m).
The purchase of the shares on the open market is funded by loans directly from Spectris plc. Dividend income in excess of 0.01p per share on the
shares held by the EBT has been waived by the Trust and is therefore not included in the group’s income statement. Interest and administration costs
of the EBT are charged to the profit and loss account of the company for the year.

36 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued
Notes to the IFRS transition reconciliations
a) Deferred and current taxes
Deferred tax on US goodwill – goodwill from the acquisition of
US businesses previously written off to reserves under UK GAAP
is deductible for US tax purposes; under IAS 12 this gives rise to
a deferred tax asset. Under UK GAAP the current tax deduction
obtained each year gave rise to a deferred tax liability.
At 31 December 2004, the deferred tax liability attributable to
US goodwill under UK GAAP was £17.6m (1 January 2004: £17.6m).
Under IFRS this has been eliminated and replaced with a deferred tax
asset of £11.0m (1 January 2004: £13.5m), a combined adjustment
of £28.6m (1 January 2004: £31.1m).
The impact on the income statement in the year ended 31 December
2004 was an increase in the taxation charge of £0.2m. The remaining
movement of £2.3m between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2005
represents foreign exchange movements on the asset, and this is
recorded in reserves.
Goodwill reduction – when a deferred tax asset is recognised following
a business acquisition, IAS 12 requires that goodwill arising on the
acquisition be reduced by a corresponding amount, with the reduction
in goodwill charged to the income statement. Under UK GAAP , the
group recognised a deferred tax asset of £12.2m at 31 December 2004
(1 January 2004: £nil), relating to tax losses brought forward from a
prior acquisition that took place in 2000. The corresponding
adjustment to goodwill, a reduction in carrying value of £12.2m
at 31 December 2004 (1 January 2004: £nil), has been made under
IFRS and is included in operating costs in the income statement.
Deferred tax asset on pension scheme deficit – under IFRS, the
deferred tax asset arising on the defined benefit pension scheme deficit
must not be included within the pension scheme deficit as previously
was the case under UK GAAP . Accordingly, a deferred tax asset
of £6.7m (1 January 2004: £5.7m) has been reclassified from retirement
benefit scheme obligations to deferred tax assets in the balance sheet.
There was no impact on the income statement.
Current tax – the 2004 current tax debtor and creditor have been
restated to better reflect the 2005 current tax debtor and creditor.
The debtors and creditors of companies forming local tax groupings
have now been netted off to give a net debtor or creditor for the
relevant jurisdiction. The reclassification at 31 December 2004 was
a decrease in tax recoverable, and a corresponding increase in current
tax payable of £14.6m.
Other tax adjustments – the non-tax IFRS adjustments outlined below
have been tax effected as at 31 December 2004. The impact on the
balance sheet at 31 December 2004 was an increase in net assets of
£1.1m (1 January 2004: £1.0m). The impact on the tax charge in the
income statement in the year ended 31 December 2004 was a credit
of £0.1m.
b) Revenue recognition
IAS 18, Revenue is similar to the UK GAAP treatment for revenue
recognition in many respects, although it contains specific additional
guidance, such as on accounting for contracts that include installation
elements. Following a review of existing policies this gives rise to some
subtle differences in the timing of accounting for certain transactions.
The net deferral of revenue and associated costs in the balance sheet
at 31 December 2004 was £2.3m (1 January 2004: £2.1m). Of this 
deferral, £0.3m (1 January 2004: £0.2m) reduces inventory, £0.1m
(1 January 2004: £0.2m) increases trade and other receivables, and
£2.1m (1 January 2004: £2.1m) is included within other payables. In the
income statement at 31 December 2004, this movement was recognised
as a reduction in turnover of £0.1m and an increase in costs of £0.1m.
c) Employee benefits
Pensions – Spectris adopted the UK GAAP standard FRS 17, Retirement
Benefits in 2001, and therefore the adoption of IAS 19, Pensions and
Other Post-Retirement Benefits does not result in significant adjustments
for the accounting for pensions. The group will continue to recognise
immediately any variations in the scheme deficit or surplus in full in a
statement of recognised income and expense, outside of the income
statement, as permitted by IAS 19.
IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements requires that items of income
and expense are not presented on a net basis in the income statement
where no legal right of set-off exists. As a result of this, the finance costs
associated with the retirement benefit scheme have been restated on
a gross basis on the face of the income statement. This has the effect
of increasing financial income at 31 December 2004 by £3.7m, and
increasing financial costs by £3.7m. There is no overall impact on the
result for the year to 31 December 2004.
Holiday pay – IAS 19 requires short-term accumulating benefits such as
holiday pay entitlement and sick pay to be accrued over the period in
which the entitlement is earned. The additional liability in the balance
sheet at 31 December 2004 is £1.1m (1 January 2004: £1.1m). There was
no impact on the income statement for the year to 31 December 2004.
d) Dividends
IAS 10, Events After the Balance Sheet Date requires that dividends
declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a
liability at that balance sheet date as the liability does not represent a
present obligation as defined by IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities
and Contingent Assets. Under IFRS, dividends are shown as a deduction
from reserves; therefore the income statement no longer shows the
deduction of dividends. The balance sheet adjustment at 31 December
2004 was a reduction in liabilities of £12.4m (1 January 2004: £11.2m). 
e) Intangible assets
IAS 38, Intangible Assets requires that goodwill is not amortised. Instead it
is subject to an annual impairment review. As the group has elected not
to apply IFRS 3, Business Combinations retrospectively to acquisitions prior
to 1 January 2004, the UK GAAP goodwill balance at 31 December 2003
(£226.4m) has been included in the transitional IFRS balance sheet and is
no longer amortised. The goodwill amortisation in the year to
31 December 2004 of £13.0m under UK GAAP has been reversed,
resulting in a reduction in operating costs of £13.0m. The related
exchange adjustment associated with the reversal of amortisation
increased goodwill by a further £0.5m (1 January 2004: £nil).
The group made four bolt-on acquisitions of businesses during 2004.
These acquisitions included the purchase of finite-lived intangible
assets not previously recognised under UK GAAP. Under IFRS, these
intangible assets are reclassified out of goodwill, and amortised over
their useful economic lives. The reclassified intangible assets are being
amortised over various periods not exceeding five years, depending
on their nature; the corresponding amortisation charge for the year
to 31 December 2004 was £1.2m, included within operating costs.
The balance sheet reclassification of goodwill to intangibles arising
from 2004 acquisitions as at 31 December 2004 was £5.8m.
Notes to the accounts continued
SPECTRIS 32-76  3/4/06  9:18 pm  Page 68 Spectris plc annual report and accounts 2005   69
f) Share-based payments
IFRS 2, Share-based Payments requires that an expense for share options
granted be recognised in the financial statements based on their fair
value at the date of grant. This expense is recognised over the vesting
period of the options. The charge to the income statement for the year
to 31 December 2004 was £0.4m, included within operating costs. As
this transaction is settled in equity, there is a net nil effect on the
balance sheet.
g) Provisions
Under IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements the group is required
to present balance sheet amounts according to whether the item is
current or non-current. Under UK GAAP , provisions were not split
between amounts due in less than one year and amounts due in more
than one year. Accordingly, the £9.5m of provisions under UK GAAP
at 31 December 2004 have been reclassified so that £7.0m is classified
as a current liability and £2.5m is classified as a non-current liability.
h) Trade and other payables
A reclassification of £4.3m from current liabilities to non-current
liabilities has been made at 31 December 2004 to better reflect the
nature of certain amounts. There is no impact on the income statement.
Explanation of material movements to the cash flow
statement for 2004
There is no overall impact on the movement in cash and cash
equivalents at 31 December 2004. Within the cash flow statement,
there are reclassifications between captions for the Employee Benefit
Trust and corporation tax. Movements of £0.2m in the Employee
Benefit Trust were previously categorised within capital expenditure,
under IFRS they are now included within financing. Corporation tax
paid of £7.7m is reclassified from its own sub-heading under UK GAAP
to within ‘Cash flows from operating activities’ under IFRS.

Notes to the company’s accounts
37 Accounting policies
The separate financial statements of the company are presented as
required by the Companies Act 1985. As permitted by that Act, the
separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom. In accordance
with the exemption provided by section 230 of the Companies Act
1985, the company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
Basis of accounting
The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis, except that
derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value as described in
the change in accounting policy paragraph below. The accounts reflect
the adoption of FRS 20, Share-based Payments, FRS 21, Events after the
Balance Sheet Date, FRS 23, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange
Rates, FRS 25, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, FRS 26,
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and FRS 28,
Corresponding Amounts, as described further below.
Changes in accounting policy
Share-based payments
The company has adopted FRS 20, Share-based Payments from
1 January 2005. There was no impact on the balance sheet at 
1 January 2005.
The fair value of employee share option grants is calculated at grant
date. The resulting cost is charged to the profit and loss account over the
vesting period of the plans. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect
expected and actual levels of options that vest, except where forfeiture is
only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Events after the balance sheet date
The company has adopted FRS 21, Events after the Balance Sheet Date
from 1 January 2005. This means that dividends are now recognised
in the period when they are declared. The balance sheet adjustment
at 31 December 2004 was a reduction in liabilities of £12.4m
(31 December 2003: £11.2m).
The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates
The company has adopted FRS 23, The Effects of Changes in Foreign
Exchange Rates from 1 January 2005. There was no impact on the
financial statements.
Corresponding amounts
The company has adopted FRS 28, Corresponding Amounts from
1 January 2005. This standard contains provisions regarding the content
of comparative information, and accordingly the only changes to the
financial statements arising from this standard are the provision of prior
year information where this has not been required.
Derivative financial instruments
The company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the
group’s exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising
from operating and financing activities. In accordance with its treasury
policy, it does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes.
Following the adoption of FRS 26, Financial Instruments:
Measurement, the company has changed its accounting policies in
respect of derivative financial instruments with effect from 1 January
2005. In accordance with FRS 26, the comparative results for the year
ended 31 December 2004 have not been restated.
Cross-currency interest rate swaps
The company takes advantage of cross-currency interest rate swaps for
some of its US$ denominated private placement borrowings. The swaps
have the effect of converting fixed rate US$ borrowings into fixed rate
euro-denominated borrowings. 
Until 31 December 2004 under UK GAAP , the combined instruments
were accounted for as if they were straightforward fixed interest euro
borrowings. The effect of this accounting policy was that the currency
portion of the swaps was effectively recognised within the carrying
value of borrowings on the balance sheet and the interest portion of
the swap was not recognised on the balance sheet. Any exchange gain
or loss on retranslation of the borrowings was recognised in the profit
and loss account. The fair value of the entire cross-currency swap was
disclosed in the accounts.
From adoption of FRS 26, the underlying US$ borrowings are required
to be presented separately in the balance sheet from the cross-currency
interest rate swaps. In addition, the fair value of the cross-currency
interest rate swap is required to be recognised in full on the balance
sheet. All changes in value are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The financial impact of this change in accounting policy is identical
to that set out in Note 21 of the group’s consolidated financial
statements prepared under IFRS, except that the company does not
seek to hedge account for any changes in fair value of the financial
instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are recognised
in the company’s profit and loss account.
Average rate options
Average rate options are transacted to provide a hedge against the
group’s overall exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
In the comparative period ended 31 December 2004, the value of
these instruments is not recognised in the balance sheet or profit and
loss account until the accounting period the instruments were intended
to cover as a hedge. From adoption of FRS 26 as at 1 January 2005,
these instruments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with any
gain or loss being recognised in the profit and loss account.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are
translated at the exchange rate ruling at that date with any exchange
differences arising on retranslation being recognised in the profit and
loss account. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historic cost. Depreciation is calculated
to write off the difference between the cost or valuation of fixed assets
and their residual value over their estimated useful lives on a straight-
line basis at the following rates per annum:
Leasehold improvements 5 years
Office equipment 3 years

Notes to the company’s accounts continued
37 Accounting policies continued
Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate,
provisions for impairment.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost as reduced by
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes
into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and
accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance
sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Leasing
Annual payments under operating leases are charged to the profit and
loss account on an accruals basis.
Post-retirement benefits
The company participates in group operated defined contribution and
defined benefit pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held
separately from those of the company in independently administered
funds. The company is unable to identify its share of the group defined
benefit scheme’s underlying assets and liabilities and therefore accounts
for it as a defined contribution scheme. The amounts charged against
profits represent contributions payable to the schemes in respect of
the accounting period.
Cash flow statement
The company has not presented a separate cash flow statement in
accordance with the exemption provided by FRS 1 (Revised), as its
cash flows are included within the cash flows of the group, as set
out elsewhere in this Annual Report.

restated prior year balance sheet. Full details of share options currently in issue, including those issued during the year, together with information
regarding the basis of calculation of the share-based payment expense, is contained in Note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.

49 Pensions
Certain of the company’s employees participate in the Spectris Pension Plan, a UK multi-employer defined benefit scheme. Further details of
the group’s scheme are contained in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The company is unable to identify its share of the Plan’s
underlying assets and liabilities and therefore accounts for the scheme as a defined contribution scheme. In accordance with the Schedule of
Contributions in place for the Spectris Pension Plan for the financial year ending 31 December 2005, employer contributions of 11% p.a. of
pensionable salaries plus £480,000 p.a. were due. The actuary certified in 2005 that this level of contributions was adequate for the purposes
of the minimum funding requirement. Contributions paid in that year to the Spectris Pension Plan were £0.5m (2004: £0.5m) and to defined
contribution plans were £0.3m (2004: £0.4m).

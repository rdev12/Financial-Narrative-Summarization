at 2009 year end, the Group had 65 staff working from 
premises in l ondon, Monaco, a ntibes, palma, Barcelona 
and a presence in the Gulf. t he scope of operations 
stretches worldwide, in particular to Europe, n orth 
a merica, r ussia, the pacific and the Caribbean. 
t he companies within YCO Group collectively offer  
the widest range of services in the industry and the 
Group therefore competes against brokerage houses, 
management companies, crew recruitment agencies,  
fuel providers, provisioners and chandleries globally.
Service S 
ycO 
YCO, the largest subsidiary, with 50 staff, divides its 
service offering between three main areas: brokerage, 
management and crew recruitment. 
t he YCO Brokerage division deals with superyacht sales 
transactions and charters, and the commission based 
model has the potential to generate the highest profits  
of the Group. YCO may represent both sides of 
transactions, but more often represents Buyers. YCO 
Brokerage currently has a presence in l ondon, Monaco 
and the Gulf, although the company handles transactions 
anywhere in the world and has clients based globally. 
YCO Management provides stable monthly revenue 
streams. t he team of 23 operates a Management 
program which allows Owners and Captains of 
contracted yachts to subscribe to any of a number of 
individually priced services. t he project Management 
service for yachts under construction or undergoing a 
refit can be provided onsite at the shipyard or from  
the YCO Management offices in Monaco and the Gulf.

YCO Crew r ecruitment provides crew search and 
placement services for superyachts on a pay-per-
placement basis. YCO Crew is one of the most  
prominent agencies in Europe, and operates from 
a ntibes and palma. at inception in 2007, YCO invested 
heavily in developing software which facilitates  
advanced registration and search facilities. t he database 
has several thousand qualified yacht crew registered.

Yacht Fuel Services was founded over 20 years ago as  
a fuel brokerage for yachts worldwide. l ongstanding 
relationships with the world’s major producers of  
marine fuel, offer YFS yachts access to premium grade 
yacht fuel, helicopter fuel, oil and lubricants. In addition 
to competitive pricing, the company aims to distinguish 
itself from competition by offering credit terms, free 
voyage planning and providing fuel in more remote 
cruising areas. YFS operates from l ondon headquarters 
and in France, but has delivered fuel worldwide in 2009. 
yacht hE lp gRO up 
Yacht Help Group provides provisions, spare parts, crew 
assistance, shipyard logistics and tax/customs consultancy. 
r evenue is generated on margins for resale items and 
fees for services.
YHG offices are strategically positioned in the key 
yachting locations of a ntibes, palma and Barcelona. In 
palma, YHG is one of the only companies to offer this 
breadth of service and in France the market is less well 
established, with fewer competitors. In Barcelona, YHG 
is considered a leading supplier due to excellent relations 
with local shipyards and competitive prices. 06
What a RE  
cE nt Ral a g Ency y achts?
While any brokerage house can sell or charter any yacht on the market to its clients,  
the majority of yachts available for sale or charter have central agency (ca) agreements in place  
with one or two named brokerage houses. the ca takes on the responsibility and associated cost  
of managing and marketing the yacht’s sales and charter activities. 
ca yachts do not provide visible revenue in a specified period, however upon their sale or charter  
(even if achieved by a third party) the central agent will receive a guaranteed portion of the commission. 
a large number of good quality ca yachts can improve the company’s visibility in the  
marketplace, however there is an additional cost of sales and marketing, which is not  
applicable when representing only the Buyer.  OVERVIEW

2009 was a year of significant change at YCO Group.
a gainst a background of challenging market conditions, 
the Board undertook an extensive restructuring 
programme resulting in an integrated business with a 
strengthened service offering. t he restructuring will also 
enable the Group to expand the business effectively,  
as appropriate, as market conditions improve.
Significant savings have also been made in operational 
overheads and the turnaround has resulted in a maiden 
profit being reported for the year. t he Board expects 
that the full benefits of these savings will be gained  
during 2010.
t he Board is satisfied that the businesses throughout  
the Group are now managed more efficiently in terms  
of both costs and operations. However, efforts are 
ongoing to further improve the Group’s efficiency and  
to reduce its cost base, in addition to strengthening  
the service offering and to continue to keep the Group 
moving ahead in its marketplace.
l ed by our new CEO, Charlie Birkett and YCO Managing 
partner and YCO Group Executive d irector Gary 
w right, who are both very experienced in the  
superyacht industry, the outlook for 2010 is encouraging 
as the world emerges from a challenging economic 
climate. w e are witnessing signs of a gradual recovery, 
from which we expect the luxury travel and tourism 
market to benefit.
I would like to thank my fellow Board members and all 
the Group’s employees for their support and hard  
work in achieving the Group’s impressive turnaround. 
w ith an enhanced starting position for 2010, improved 
operations and an established philosophy of corporate 
control and responsibility, we approach the year ahead

OVERVIEW 10
In 2009, the Group successfully achieved a turnaround to 
report a maiden profit for the year following the losses 
reported for both 2008 and the first half of 2009.
key factors driving the performance recovery have been:
successful completion of Group restructuring at both ■ ■
corporate and management level
reductions within the business cost base ■ ■
strengthened teams and expanded operations in ■ ■
brokerage.
a s a result, the Group exceeded the Board’s expectations 
in Yacht Brokerage, which generates the highest margins, 
while increasing our market share in Yacht Management.
t he Group has also continued to reinvest in corporate 
structure and It systems to ensure that it is well placed 
and well structured to leverage the anticipated upturn in 
the market.
r eview of Bu Sine SS o peration S:
BROkER ag E
t he Board was prudent in its expectations for 2009, in 
anticipation of the effects of the economic downturn. 
However the Group took the opportunity to strengthen 
the team, introduce a specialist division handling luxury 
sailing yachts and continue to develop advanced customer 
management systems.
d uring 2009, YCO Brokerage was involved in two of  
the most prominent superyacht sales in the industry.
manag EmEnt
YCO Management operates from two offices with 23 staff, 
generating revenue from contracted monthly retainers  
for Yacht Management, project Management and from 
additionally priced one-off services and consultancy.
YCO Management continued to develop systems and 
services in accordance with its strategy, to ensure its 
clients receive the best possible service. t he division 
completed the roll-out of the (client management 
software) YCO l Iv E to all yachts and introduced the 
YCO v ISa debit card.
a s a result, and due to the increased number of existing 
yacht owners looking for improved cost control,  
YCO Management continued to grow the number of 
contracted yachts.
cREW R Ec Ru Itm Ent
In a highly competitive market, YCO Crew lowered its 
fees to remain competitively priced. a s a result of  
this reduction in margins, combined with a less active 
marketplace, management took measures to reduce 
overheads and to recalibrate the business. t he division 
remains under review as part of the wider ongoing 
restructuring programme.
yacht f u El sERVI c Es
Operating with four staff from headquarters in l ondon 
with an office in the South of France, Yacht Fuel Services 
generates revenue through the sale of fuels and lubricants 
to superyachts.
w hile YFS benefited from a fall in fuel prices, it was 
affected by reduced movement of yachts and fewer 
trans-atlantic crossings. t he Company took steps at the

beginning of the year to reduce marketing costs in 
preparation for the adverse trading conditions.
YFS maintained its strong position in the market, making 
multiple deliveries to 240 unique yachts of over 30 
metres. Increased margins helped to offset a reduction  
in tonnage sold, and overall the division performed in line 
with management’s expectations.
yacht hE lp gRO up
at the beginning of the year, Yacht Help Group operated 
from three offices with 15 permanent staff, generating 
revenue through the supply of concierge services and 
provisions to superyachts.
d uring the year, the division suffered from the reduced 
number of yachts in transit. a s a result of this the decision 
was taken to reduce the workforce to 10 full time staff, 
with a stronger focus on developing business in the key 
locations of a ntibes and Barcelona.
In particular, the shipyard based provisioning and 
concierge services performed strongly during the year 
and these will continue to be developed as a key area of 
the business in the future.
Summary
It has been the Board’s priority to take the necessary steps in 
2009 to ensure that the Group emerges from the economic 
downturn a stronger and more efficient business and one 
which is well placed to deliver future growth.
In what has been the most challenging of environments, 
the results for 2009 have demonstrated significant 
progress. r ecognition for this achievement must go to 
the whole YCO Group team, as it is the hard work of all 
st Rat Eg y & s t REngths

of our employees which has enabled the restructuring 
of the Group to be achieved so successfully.
o utlook YCO Group continues to benefit from income from 
sales completed in the latter part of 2009 and has 
achieved some smaller transactions in the first part of 
2010 which are encouraging.
t he Group’s diverse business model and complementary 
revenue streams have also been a decisive factor in  
the Group’s turnaround during 2009, in what was a 
challenging market.
w hile it is clear that the market has shown some signs 
of recovery, the Board still expects continuing pressure 
on fees and commissions, therefore it will continue to 
focus on the cross-selling of the Group’s services whilst 
seeking to improve margins.
t he Group will continue to seek to improve its  
service offering and to invest in marketing initiatives,  
It and finance reporting systems, as well as looking  
to reduce corporate overheads further, where 
appropriate. t here are consolidation opportunities in 
the market and the Board is considering its approach  
to growth and investigating possible future expansion 
opportunities.
t he completed restructuring programme gives the 
business a great opportunity, with a strengthened 
management and service offering, to increase our share 
of the superyacht services market going forward. t his 
combined with the continued, gradual recovery of the 
market leads us to approach the future with optimism. 12
review of B u Sine SS an D future 
Development S
BROkER ag E
a s expected, 2009 was a more difficult climate for yacht 
sales and charter than 2008, which was an exceptional 
year for the industry as a whole and for YCO. Following 
a slow start in the first half, the industry reported a 
general improvement in the second half of the year, as is 
typical. However, with few or no sales reported as a 
direct result of any of the major yacht shows (Monaco, 
Fort l auderdale, a bu d habi), the superyacht brokerage 
industry was certainly more subdued in 2009 than in 
2008. at YCO, this general downturn was reflected in 
reduced charter enquiries and sales leads. 
t he company continued its investment in improving 
Cr M systems in order to systemise and regulate  
Client prospecting and create a platform to stimulate 
new business. presence has been expanded into l ondon 
and the Gulf, and with strengthened brokerage teams  
in Monaco, notably including a new division ‘YCO Sail’, 
specialising exclusively in luxury sailboats. 
post period, this expansion has resulted in improved 
charter figures for Summer 2010 and the company 
continues to focus on improving performance in this area 
of the business. 
manag EmEnt
Management offers stability and visibility and in a climate 
which may be challenging for brokerage, there is potential 
for growth as Owners look to professional management 
as a means of ensuring efficient and cost effective 
operation and maintenance of the vessel. 
t he company continues to invest in developing and 
upgrading YCO l Iv E, and post period, restructuring is 
underway to improve efficiency and communications, 
creating an organisational model which will allow for 
continued expansion as the number of yachts under 
management increases.

the first real-time, online yacht management system in the world, ycO lIVE was designed and developed  
by ycO as a tool to enable Owners, captains and yacht managers to access vital information and 
documentation – from any computer, anywhere in the world, at any time.
With the increasing number of certificates, licenses and regulations for large yachts and their crew, the 
burden of paperwork involved can be a drain for onboard resources. as vessels are constantly on the 
move, the transmission of documents from one place to another is not always a practical possibility. 
storing all data for a yacht in one constantly accessible area, ycO lIVE provides the link between the yacht,  
the owner’s office and the managers, ensuring a clear and efficient line of communication at all times. 
an in-house team of software technicians is continually developing and upgrading the ycO lIVE system, 
which is operational for all ycO yachts. 
yc O has and will continue to invest also in implementing advanced and professional It systems for 
brokerage, crew recruitment and accounting, to allow for smooth and efficient growth in the future.  16

a s a result of the economic downturn, 2009 saw fewer 
experienced and senior crew members looking to change 
positions. Fewer yachts operating commercially also meant 
reduced demand for additional crew in the traditionally 
busy charter seasons, particularly winter in the Caribbean. 
a gainst this backdrop, YCO Crew reduced the workforce 
from 6 to 4 and took steps to reduce marketing spend 
and other overheads.
t he company is now taking steps to further consolidate 
business costs and leverage cross selling opportunities 
within the Group, to enable the division to operate even 
in a reduced market.
yacht f u El sERVI c Es
t he results for the year are all the more pleasing given  
they were achieved against the current economic climate. 
t he revenue decreased mainly from the weakened Euro 
and u S d ollars in the year, however the company is still 
debt-free and maintains a positive cash flow.
t he decrease in the oil price has encouraged customers. 
a s such, the Company maintains its position as one  
of the largest suppliers of marine fuel to superyachts  
in the world.
t he demand for marine fuel for superyachts remains 
consistent and the company hopes to increase the 
number of yachts fuelled from cross-selling between 
YCO Group companies.

w ith fewer yachts operating there was reduced 
provisioning and concierge demand in palma and the 
newly opened office in a ntibes. However, this and the 
lack of migration to the Caribbean was to the benefit  
of YHG in Barcelona, which relies on shipyard trade.
Having reduced the workforce, the company hopes  
to expand operations through strategic partnerships, 
which may provide the added benefits of regular business 
and cost reduction opportunities, while growing specific 
areas which are performing well. 
In 2010, Barcelona has continued to perform well, and

Director’s r eport
for the year en DeD 31 December 2009
The directors present their report with the financial statements of the Company and 
the Group for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Principal Activity
The principal activity of the Group in the year under review was the supply of services 
and marine fuel to the world’s superyachts.
Review of Business and Future Developments
A detailed appraisal of business developments is given in the Business Review on pages 
12 to 17.
Key Risks and Uncertainties
The directors are optimistic about the business development in 2010. However, this is 
dependent upon factors such as oil supply, volatility of the US$ and Euro exchange 
rates and global economic stability. The exchange rate risk is partly mitigated by buying 
and selling in the same currency.

The profit for the year is £10,953, which has been allocated against reserves.  
No dividends will be distributed for the year ended 31 December 2009.

Financial Instruments
The Group does not have formal policies on interest rate risk or foreign currency  
risk. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings 
that are denominated in a currency other than pound sterling (£). The Group maintains 
a natural hedge that minimises the foreign exchange exposure by matching foreign 
currency income with foreign currency costs.
The Group does not consider it necessary to enter into foreign exchange contracts in 
managing its foreign exchange risk resulting from cash flows from transactions 
denominated in foreign currency, given the nature of the business for the time being.
The Group prepares periodic working capital forecasts for the foreseeable future, 
allowing an assessment of the cash requirements of the company, to manage liquidity 
risk. The directors have considered the risk posed by liquidity and are satisfied that 
there is sufficient growth and equity in the company. The Group has an overdraft 
facility with the bank for £300,000 and is being charged at an interest rate of 4.25% per 
annum above HSBC’s sterling base rate, as published from time to time. The overdraft 
facility is due for renewal in December 2010.
Going Concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors consider that the Company and the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. This is reflected in note 1 to the financial statements.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use 
in the European Union. The financial statements are required by law to give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that year. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are 
required to 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
> >
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
> >
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
> >
to presume that the company will continue in business. 
to follow IFRS as adopted by the European Union
> >
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the 
Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and as regards the Group Article 4 of the IAS regulations. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
Statement as to Disclosure of Information to Auditors
So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by 
Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006) of which the company’s auditors are unaware, 
and each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in 
order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
company’s auditors are aware of that information
Auditors
In accordance with section 485 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution that Jeffreys 
Henry LLP, be reappointed as auditors of the company will be put to the Annual 
General Meeting.
On Behalf of The Board:
C Birkett – Chief Executive Officer
Date: 19 May 2010  22
c orporate g overnance r eport
for the year en DeD 31 December 2009
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance to 
commensurate with the Group’s size and the interests of shareholders. As the Group 
grows, policies and procedures that reflect the Principles of Good Governance and 
Code of Best Practice as published by the Committee on Corporate Governance 
(commonly known as the “Combined Code”) will be developed. So far as is practicable 
and appropriate, taking into account the size and nature of the Company, the Directors 
will take steps to comply with the Combined Code.
The Board of Directors 
The Board comprises of three Executive Directors and one Non-Executive Director. 
All the Directors served throughout the year. The Directors’ biographies are set out 
on page 18 and demonstrate a range of relevant experience. N Miller and P Shea 
resigned as directors in the year.
 
The Board meets at least four times a year as issues arise which require Board attention. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specially referred to it for decision. The 
Directors are responsible for the management structure and appointments, considering 
strategy and policy, approval of major capital investments and transactions, and 
responsible for significant financing matters. 
The Board has established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee 
which roles and responsibilities are discussed below. 
Audit Committee 
An Audit Committee has been established and currently comprises of P Jay who has 
considerable and relevant financial experience. 
The Audit Committee, which has Terms of Reference agreed by the Board meets at 
least twice a year and is responsible for ensuring that the integrity of the financial 
information reported to the shareholders and the systems of internal controls. This 
committee provides an opportunity for reporting by the Company’s auditors.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring in discussion with the auditors the 
integrity of the financial statements and announcements of the Company; reviewing 
the Company’s internal financial controls and risk management systems; reviewing and 
monitoring the external auditor’s independence, objectivity and effectiveness of the 
audit process taking into consideration relevant UK and other relevant professional and 
regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee is also responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board to be put to shareholders for their approval in general 
meeting in relation to the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external 
auditor and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external 
auditor. Other responsibilities include reviewing the Company’s internal audit function, 
and where there is no internal audit function and considering annually whether there is 
a need for an internal audit function and making recommendation to the Board, and to 
review arrangements by which the staff of the Group will be able to raise concerns 
about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters related 
to the Group. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, which meets at least twice a year, consists of P Jay and 
C Smith. Based on the Terms of Reference approved by the Board, the Remuneration 
Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with the Board the framework 
or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman and 
other members as it is designated to consider. It is also responsible for setting the 
remuneration for all Executive Directors, the Chairman and the Company Secretary; 
to recommend and monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior 
management; and determining targets for any performance-related pay schemes 
operated by the Group. The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for 
determining the policy and scope of pension arrangements for each Executive Director 
and for ensuring that contractual terms on termination and any payments made are fair 
to the individual and the Company. The Remuneration Committee will determine the 
terms and conditions of service of Executive Directors. This includes, agreeing the 
policy for authorising claims for expenses from the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Chairman, and within the terms of the agreed policy, recommending the total individual 
remuneration package of each Executive Director including, where appropriate 
bonuses, incentive payments and share options. 
Relations with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are very important and therefore are given a 
priority. The Company maintains a website www.ycogroup.com for the purpose of 
improving information flow to shareholders as well as potential investors. It contains 
the information about the Company’s activities and the interim report. Shareholders 
are welcome to enquire on any matter relating to the business and their shareholdings. 
The Company encourages the shareholders to attend the Annual Meeting at which 
they will be given the opportunity to put questions to the Chairman and other members 
of the Board.
Internal financial control 
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Company’s system of 
internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. They are designated to safeguard 
the assets of the Company and to ensure the reliability of the financial information for 
both internal use and external publication. The controls that include inter alia financial, 
operational and compliance matters and management are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. A system of internal control can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance that material financial irregularities will be detected of that risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives is eliminated. The Board has considered the need for an 
internal audit function but because of the size and nature of its operations does not 
consider it necessary at the current time.

General Information
YCO Group PLC is a company incorporated in England and Wales and quoted on the 
Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. The address of the 
registered office is disclosed on the inside back cover of the financial statements. The 
principal activity of the Group is described on page 20. The Company changed to its 
present name on 16 July 2009 upon the successful reorganisation of the Group.
1. Accounting Policies
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Group is a 
going concern. When assessing the foreseeable future, the directors have looked at a 
period of twelve months from the date of approval of this report. 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are set out in the Chief Executive Officer’s 
statement, Business Review and Directors Report on pages 12 to 17 and 20 to 21. In 
addition note 21 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; and its 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, show that the group should be able to operate within the level of 
its current facility. The Group will open negotiations with the bank in due course and has 
at this stage not sought any written commitments that the facility will be renewed. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the annual report and financial statements.
Were the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern, adjustments would have 
to be made to the balance sheet of the Group to reduce balance sheet values of assets 
to their recoverable amounts, to provide for future liabilities that might arise and to 
reclassify non-current assets and long-term liabilities as current assets and liabilities. 
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards and IFRIC interpretations issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial 
statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. 
t he following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the 
ﬁrst time for the ﬁnancial year beginning 1 January 2009.
IAS 1 (revised), ‘Presentation of financial statements’. The revised standard prohibits 
> >
the presentation of items of income and expenses (that is ‘non-owner changes in 
equity’) in the statement of changes in equity, requiring ‘non-owner changes in equity’ 
to be presented separately from owner changes in equity. All ‘non-owner changes in 
equity’ are required to be shown in a performance statement.
Entities can choose whether to present one performance statement (the statement of 
comprehensive income) or two statements (the income statement and statement of 
comprehensive income).
The Group has elected to present two statements: an income statement and a 
statement of comprehensive income. 
IFRS 8, ‘Operating segments’. IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14, ‘Segment reporting’. It requires 
> >
a ‘management approach’ under which segment information is presented on the 
same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting 
provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker 
has been identified as the executive committee that makes strategic decisions.
The operating segments have changed in 2009 to reflect the Group’s reportable 
segments under IFRS 8, which are support services and client services. Support services 
relate to the goods and services provided to the yacht to enable the yacht to operate 
(ie: marine fuel and provisioning). Client services relate to the services provided on 
behalf of client (ie: yacht management, yacht sales, yacht purchase, yacht charter, 
charter marketing, crew recruitment, new construction and project management.
Information regarding the Group’s reportable segments is presented in Note 2. 
Amounts reported for the prior year have been restated to conform to the requirements 
of IFRS 8.
Goodwill is allocated by management to groups of cash-generating units on a segment 
level. The change in reportable segments has not resulted in any additional goodwill 
impairment. There has been no further impact on the measurement of the Group’s 
assets and liabilities. Comparatives for 2008 have not been restated.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been 
issued, but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2009 and have 
not been early adopted:
IFRS 2 (amendment), ‘Share-based payment’ (effective from 1 January 2009). It 
> >
deals with vesting conditions and cancellations. It clarifies that vesting conditions are 
service conditions and performance conditions only. Other features of a share-
based payment are not vesting conditions. These features would need to be included 
in the grant date fair value for transactions with employees and others providing 
similar services; they would not impact the number of awards expected to vest or 
valuation there of subsequent to grant date. All cancellations , whether by the entity 
or by other parties, should receive the same accounting treatment. The Group will 
apply IFRS 2 (amendment) from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU. 
It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.

yco group p Lc annua L report & accounts 2009
IFRS 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’ and consequential amendments to IAS 27, 
> >
‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’, IAS 28, ‘Investments in associates’ 
and IAS 31, ‘Interests in joint ventures’, effective prospectively to business combinations 
for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting 
period beginning on or after 1 July 2009. Management is assessing the impact of the 
new requirements regarding acquisition accounting, consolidation and associates on 
the group. The Group does not have any joint ventures.
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business 
combinations, with some significant changes. For example, all payments to purchase a 
business are to be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent 
payments classified as debt subsequently re-measured through the statement of 
comprehensive income. There is a choice on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to 
measure the minority interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the minority 
interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. All acquisition-related costs 
should be expensed. The Group will apply IFRS 3 (revised) to all business combinations 
from 1 January 2010.
IAS 27 (revised), ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’, (effective from 1 
> >
July 2009). The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions with non 
controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control and 
these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses. The standard 
also specifies the accounting when control is lost. Any remaining interest in the 
entity is remeasured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. 
The Group will apply IAS 27 (revised) prospectively to transactions with non-
controlling interests from 1 January 2010.
IAS 38 (amendment), ‘Intangible Assets’. The amendment is part of the IASB’s 
> >
annual improvements project published in April 2009 and the Group will apply IAS 
38 (amendment) from the date IFRS 3 (revised) is adopted. The amendment clarifies 
guidance in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset acquired in a business 
combination and it permits the grouping of intangible assets as a single asset if each 
asset has similar useful economic lives. The amendment will not result in a material 
impact on Group’s financial statements.
FRIC 17, ‘Distributions of non-cash assets to owners’, effective for annual periods 
> >
beginning on or after 1 July 2009. This is not currently applicable to the Group, as it 
has not made any non-cash distributions.
IFRIC 18, ‘Transfers of assets from customers’, effective for transfers of assets 
> >
received on or after 1 July 2009. This is not relevant to the Group, as it has not 
received any assets from customers.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are 
mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2009, but are not 
currently relevant for the Group:
IAS 23 (amendment), ‘Borrowing costs’.
> >
IAS 32 (amendment), ‘Financial instruments: Presentation’.

IFRIC 13, ‘Customer loyalty programmes’.

IFRIC 15, ‘Agreements for the construction of real estate’.

IFRS 7 (disclosure amendment); ‘Financial instruments; fair value measurement and

Consolidation
subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which YCO Group PLC has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 
one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group 
controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to YCO Group PLC. They are de-consolidated from the date that 
control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries 
by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets 
given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of 
exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any 
minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s 
share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of 
acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the 
difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between 
Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered 
an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries 
have been changed or adjusted upon consolidation where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Intangible assets
(a) g oodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the 
Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary or associate at 
the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in ‘intangible 
assets’. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is included in ‘investments in associates’ 
and is tested for impairment as part of the overall balance. Separately recognised 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses 
on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the 
entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. 
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or Groups of cash-generating 
units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill 
arose. The Group allocates goodwill to each business segment in each country in which 
it operates. 36
n otes to the f inancia L statements 
continue D
(b) t rademarks and Licences
Acquired trademarks and licences are shown at historical cost. Trademarks and licences 
have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of 
trademarks and licences over their estimated useful lives.
Licences 20% on cost
(c) software
Acquired software and websites are shown at historical cost. They have a finite useful 
life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated 
using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of software and website over their 
estimated useful lives.
Software 15% – 20% on cost
(d) product development
Product development expenditure is capitalised when it is considered that there is a 
commercially and technically viable product, the related expenditure is separately 
identifiable and there is reasonable expectation that the related expenditure will be 
exceeded by future revenues. Following initial recognition, product development are 
carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment 
losses. The useful lives of these intangible assets are assessed to have finite life. 
Amortisation is charged on assets with finite lives, this expense is taken to the income 
statement. Useful lives are also reviewed on an annual basis. Product development cost 
will not be amortised whilst the project is still in its development phase. Once the 
development is completed, the costs is transferred to software as an intangible 
assets. 
impairment of n on-f inancial a ssets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to 
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to 
amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is 
recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the 
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating 
units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed 
for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
property, plant and equipment
Tangible non-current assets are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical 
cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. 
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate 
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. 
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and 
maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial Year in which 
they are incurred. Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to 
write off each asset over its estimated useful life. 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 5% – 35% on cost
Motor vehicles – 16% – 25% on cost
The asset’s residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed, and adjusted if 
appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable value. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by 
comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within other 
(losses) or gains in the income statement. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts 
included in other reserves are transferred to retained earnings.
r evenue r ecognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the 
sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is 
shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales 
within the Group.
f unctional c urrency t ranslation
i) f unctional and presentation c urrency
Items included in the financial statements of the Group are measured using the currency 
of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional 
currency), which is mainly Euros (€). The financial statements are presented in Pounds 
Sterling (£), which is the Group’s presentation currency.
ii) t ransactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the presentational currency using 
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and 
losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the income statement. 
iii) g roup c ompanies
The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the currency of 
a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the 
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing 
rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(b) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange 
rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect 
of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses 
are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
(c) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. financia L statements
37
yco group p Lc annua L report & accounts 2009
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment 
in foreign operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as 
hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity. When a foreign 
operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in 
equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are 
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differed from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items 
of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The entity’s liability for current tax 
is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred t ax
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted 
for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a 
business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) 
that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the 
deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
o perating Leases
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at their 
fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of 
financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are treated as reduction 
of the lease obligation on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are 
recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to 
qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s 
general policy on borrowing costs (see below). Contingent rentals are recognised as 
expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
Rental leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are 
retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating 
leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income 
statement.
segment reporting
The Company has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 1 January 
2009. IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal 
reports about components of the Company that are regularly reviewed by the chief 
operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess 
their performance. In contrast, the predecessor Standard (IAS 14 Segment Reporting) 
required an entity to identify two sets of segments (business and geographical), using a 
risks and returns approach, with the entity’s ‘system of internal financial reporting to 
key management personnel’ serving only as the starting point for the identification of 
such segments. Following the adoption of IFRS 8, the identification of the Group’s 
reportable segments has changed. See details in Note 2.
c ash and c ash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks, other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, 
and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities 
on the balance sheet.
inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined 
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The cost of finished goods and work in 
progress comprises raw materials and other direct costs. It excludes borrowing costs. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less 
applicable variable selling expenses. 
t rade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A 
provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will 
enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments is 
considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
t rade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the 
proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income 
statement over the year of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional 
right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance 
sheet date. 38

f inancial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, 
trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and 
trade and other payables.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for 
instruments not at fair value through profit or loss, any directly attributable transactions 
costs, except as described below. Subsequent to initial recognition non-derivative 
financial instruments are measured as described below.
A financial instrument is recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised if the Group’s contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if the Group transfers the 
financial assets to another party without retaining control or substantially all risks and 
rewards of the asset. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted 
for at trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits itself to purchase or sell the 
asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Group’s obligations specified in the 
contract expire or are discharged or cancelled. 
f air values 
The carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities such as cash and cash equivalents, 
receivables and payables of the Group at the balance sheet date approximated their fair 
values, due to relatively short term nature of these financial instruments.
The Company provides financial guarantees to licensed banks for credit facilities 
extended to a subsidiary company. The fair value of such financial guarantees is not 
expected to be significantly different as the probability of the subsidiary company 
defaulting on the credit lines is remote.
share-based compensation
The fair value of the employees, directors and suppliers services received in exchange 
for the grant of the options and warrants are recognised as an expense. The total 
amount to be expensed over the vesting year is determined by reference to the fair 
value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions 
(for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are 
included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At 
each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that 
are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if 
any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to 
share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options and warrants are 
exercised.
share c apital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown 
in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
c ritical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Group to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical 
experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed 
below:
(a) impairment of g oodwill
The Group is required to test, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. 
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of 
a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows. 
Actual outcomes could vary.
(b) impairment of intangibles (other than g oodwill)
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review for 
impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based on value in use 
calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates.
(c) impairment of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review 
for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based on value in use 
calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates.
(d) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is provided so as to write down the assets to their residual values over 
their estimated useful lives as set out above. The selection of these residual values and 
estimated lives requires the exercise of management judgement.
(e) share-based compensation
The fair value of options and warrants are determined by reference to the fair value of 
the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for 
example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are 
included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At 
each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that 
are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if 
any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. financia L statements

2. Segment Analysis
In prior years, segment information reported externally was analysed on the basis of 
the types of goods supplied and services provided by the Group’s operating divisions 
(i.e. marine fuel and support services). However, information reported to the Group’s 
chief operating decision maker for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment 
of segment performance is more specifically focussed on the category of goods and 
services. The principal categories are support services and client services. The Group’s 
reportable segments under IFRS 8 are therefore as follows:
Support services relate to the goods and services provided to the yacht to enable the 
yacht to operate (ie: marine fuel and provisioning). 
Client services relate to the services provided on behalf of client (ie: yacht management, 
yacht sales, yacht purchase, yacht charter, charter marketing, crew recruitment, new 
construction and project management.
Information regarding the Group’s reportable segments is presented below. Amounts 
reported for the prior year have been restated to conform to the requirements of  
IFRS 8.
The chief operating decision maker internal report is based on business segment, which 
consists of support services and client services.

The Group also has estimated trading losses from foreign subsidiaries of £515,000 
(2008 – £434,000). The deferred tax asset not provided at 28% on the grounds that

7. Profit of Parent Company
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the 
parent company is not presented as part of these financial statements. The parent 
company’s loss for the financial year was £169,779 (2008 – Loss of £576,904). 
8. Earnings Per Share
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. For diluted 
earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted 
to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has two 
classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares being those share options granted to 
employees and suppliers where the exercise price is less than the average market price 
of the Group’s ordinary shares during the year and the shares to be issued to satisfy the 
deferred consideration on the acquisition of a subsidiary. 
Details of the adjusted earnings per share are set out below:

The acquisition of YCO S.A.M includes its subsidiary undertakings YCO S.A.R.L., YCO 
Yacht Limited, YCO Limited and YCO London Limited.
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that the 
goodwill may be impaired, by considering the net present value of discounted cash 
flows forecasts. If an indication exists an impairment review is carried out. At the year 
end, there was no indication of impairment of the value of goodwill.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (CGU) identified according 
to the country of operation and business segment.

calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by 
management covering a four year period. Cashflow beyond four year period are 
extrapolated using the price earnings ratio to determine the terminal value. 42

21. Risk and Sensitivity Analysis
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: interest rate risk, liquidity 
risk, foreign currency risk, capital risk and credit risk. The Group’s activities also expose 
it to non-financial risks: market risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme 
focuses on unpredictability and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the 
Group’s financial performance. The Board, on a regular basis, reviews key risks and, 
where appropriate, actions are taken to mitigate the key risks identified.
Interest rate and foreign currency risk
The Group does not have formal policies on interest rate risk or foreign currency risk. 
However, the Group’s exposure in these areas (as at the balance sheet date) 
was minimal.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that 
are denominated in a currency other than pound sterling (£). The Group maintains a 
natural hedge that minimises the foreign exchange exposure by matching foreign 
currency income with foreign currency costs.
The Group does not consider it necessary to enter into foreign exchange contracts in 
managing its foreign exchange risk resulting from cash flows from transactions 
denominated in foreign currency, given the nature of the business for the time being.
The net unhedged financial assets and liabilities of the Group that are denominated in 
its functional currency are as follows:

Euro (€)  0.89 0.79 0.90 0.97
United States Dollars (US$)  0.64 0.54 0.63 0.69
Liquidity risk
The Group prepares periodic working capital forecasts for the foreseeable future, 
allowing an assessment of the cash requirements of the company, to manage liquidity 
risk. The directors have considered the risk posed by liquidity and are satisfied that 
there is sufficient growth and equity in the company. The Group has an overdraft 
facility with the bank for £300,000 and is being charged at an interest rate of 4.25% per 
annum above HSBC’s sterling base rate, as published from time to time, which is 
currently at 0.5%. The overdraft facility is due for renewal in December 2010.
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as 
a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other 
stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Market risk
The market may not grow as rapidly as anticipated. The Group may lose customers to 
its competitors. The Group’s major competitors may have significantly greater financial 
resources than those available to the company. There is no certainty that the company 
will be able to achieve its projected levels of sales or profitability.
Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other 
receivables. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counter parties are 
banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The 
Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade. The amounts presented in the 
balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment 
is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experiences, 
is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The Group has no 
significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of 
counter parties and customers.
22. Financial Commitments
Operating lease commitments
The Group leases office premises under a non-cancellable operating lease agreement, 
which contains various escalation clauses and renewal rights. The lease expenditure is 
charged to the income statement during the year as incurred. At the balance sheet date 
the Group was committed to payments under the operating lease agreement 
as follows:

Introduction
Abcam has performed well in the 
financial year ended 30 June 2011 
against a background of uncertainty in 
our core market and we have continued 
to make significant strides in pursuit of our 
strategic objectives. We continue to take 
market share in our core primary antibody 
business and have further broadened our 
range of other reagents involved in protein 
research, not least through the acquisition 
of MitoSciences. With our extensive market 
presence and adaptable distribution 
platform, we are ideally placed to build 
on this success.
Strategy and outlook
A significant proportion of our 
customers are universities and other 
centres of research excellence which rely 
on government funding. For several years 
we have expressed caution that the way 
in which Western governments adjust their 
spending patterns may affect our business. 
It has become apparent during the year 
that it is not only actual reductions that 
have an impact on researchers’ spending, 
but the threat of cuts can be sufficient to 
cause a reaction as well. As noted in our 
interim report, we saw this in the UK earlier 
in the year, and we have seen a similar 
effect in the US more recently as a result 
of the protracted discussions on addressing 
their economic situation.
Elsewhere, areas of Europe have been 
impacted to a lesser degree and we are 
encouraged to see that China continues 
to show strong growth. Performance in 
Japan has also remained strong, despite 
the disruption caused by the earthquake 
and subsequent tsunami. This validates 
our continued focus on international 
expansion to progressively reduce our 
exposure to any one region.
Decisions have been taken recently by 
governments such as in the US, to reduce 
their funding for research and others may 
follow. Whilst this will present challenges 
for our business there is little experience 
to draw on as to what its impact may be 
on our growth. The strength of our business 
model, which enables us to make rapid 
additions to the catalogue and deliver 
high quality products, has allowed us to 
gain market share and grow strongly even 
when increases in funding budgets have 
been modest. For example, in the US the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) budget 
increased by a compound annual average 
of around 2% between 2005 and 2010 
(excluding the stimulus to the US economy 
during 2009/10 from the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act 2009 (ARRA)), during 
which time Abcam’s sales in the US grew 
by a compound annual rate of almost 29%. 
We also have a degree of defensibility as 
sellers of consumables rather than large 
ticket items, which are more likely to 
be affected.
Trading in the new financial year reflects the 
market conditions above, however, revenue 
growth continues and profits are on track 
to meet consensus market expectations.
As explained in more detail in the 
Chief Executive Officer’s Review, the Board 
is implementing a strategy of extending 
our product offerings into fields adjacent 
to antibodies, under the wider umbrella 
of protein research tools. These additional

areas will be accessed by OEM deals and 
where appropriate by acquisition, such was 
the case with MitoSciences, which brings 
both new products and a development 
capability. We believe that these strategies 
will ensure that Abcam in the long term 
continues to grow faster than the markets 
in which it operates.
Corporate governance
Abcam values corporate governance 
highly and this is reflected in our 
governance principles, policies and 
practices. The Board believes that effective 
corporate governance will assist in the 
delivery of our corporate strategy, the 
generation of shareholder value and the 
safeguarding of shareholders’ long-term 
interests. We are committed therefore, 
wherever it is reasonably practicable, 
to ensure that the Group is managed in 
accordance with the principles set out 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
as appropriate to the Group considering 
its size and stage of development.
Directors
After helping to guide Abcam through 
a period of rapid growth over the last five 
years, Tim Dye and Mark Webster have 
both decided to step down from the Board 
after next month’s Annual General Meeting 
(AGM). Consequently, the opportunity 
has been taken to review the balance 
of financial, sector specific and general 
business skills represented on the Board 
and I am very pleased to announce that 
Tony Martin, who has wide life science 
research tools experience, will be joining 
as a Non-Executive Director later this 
month. We have also identified that 
the Company would benefit from the 
appointment of a Non-Executive Director 
with broad eCommerce experience and 
we hope to be able to announce another 
appointment soon.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
Tim and Mark for the tremendous contribution 
they have each made to Abcam’s success.
Dividends
The Board announced in the Company’s 
interim results its intention to increase 
the dividend distribution ratio to 40% of 
post-tax profit, in light of the strong cash flow 
and continued success of the Group. An 
interim dividend of 1.45 pence per share 
was paid in April 2011 and consequently 
the Directors are recommending a final 
dividend of 3.80 pence per share, making 
a total of 5.25 pence for the year, an increase 
of 31.1% on that paid last year. Subject 
to shareholder approval at the AGM 
in October, the final dividend will be paid 
on 25 November 2011 to shareholders 
on the register on 4 November 2011.
Investing  
in talent
Our people are our biggest asset and investment in 
the learning and development of staff continues to be 
significant. This year we implemented a Management 
Framework training programme to develop leadership 
skills in the business. We conduct an annual staff survey 
and are delighted to have over 96% participation. 
Stakeholders
Once again I would like to extend my thanks 
to our staff on which Abcam’s success is 
built and offer a warm welcome to the 
Group to the employees of MitoSciences. 
We would also like to thank all our other 
stakeholders – customers, suppliers and 
shareholders – whose continued support 
also contributes to our success.

Business review: Chief Executive Officer’s review
Jonathan Milner Chief Executive Officer
I am delighted to report on another 
successful year for Abcam. Total sales 
for the year were £83.3m (2010: £71.1m), 
including £0.2m from our new subsidiary 
MitoSciences, which was acquired on 
23 May 2011. This represents organic 
growth of 16.9%, or 16.8% on a constant 
currency basis, assuming exchange rates 
had been the same as those recorded 
throughout the prior year.
Our strategy is to deliver profitable 
growth by:
 > introducing high quality products to 
our catalogue to continue to enhance 
the breadth of the product range, 
as well as increasing our range of 
primary antibodies;
 > continuing to increase the validation 
information on the products in the 
catalogue from as many relevant 
sources as possible; 
 > extending our geographic penetration; and
 > further improving our customer service 
and support.
During the year we have made significant 
progress on all these fronts. Our aim is to 
continue to build on our success within the 
“Our aim is to continue to build on our 
success within the primary antibody market, 
whilst using our established market reach and 
distribution platform to achieve strong growth 
in related life science tools markets.”
 > Organic revenue growth of 16.9%, 
with non-primary antibody products 
now representing 8.5% of total sales.
 > Successful acquisition and integration 
of MitoSciences, with over 200 
products added to our catalogue 
within six weeks of acquisition.
 > 10,642 products added to the 
catalogue in the year, generating 
£2.8m of sales.
 > Redesign of the public website 
homepage to support more product 
ranges and better identify and 
present cross-selling opportunities.
 > Increase of over 100% in the 
number of images added to the 
data in our catalogue.
 > Continue to focus on geographic 
expansion in markets where 
government research funding is 
increasing and on building out the 
extended catalogue both organically 
and perhaps through M&A activity.

primary antibody market, whilst using our 
established market reach and powerful 
distribution platform to achieve strong 
growth in related life science tools markets. 
The drive for efficiency improvements is core 
to the way we operate and, despite increasing 
the proportion of non-antibody products 
that we handle, we were able to take 
advantage of the operational gearing in the 
business to increase profit before tax by 
25.1% to £32.3m (2010: £25.8m) before 
costs of £0.2m associated with the acquisition 
of MitoSciences. EPS increased by 23.0% 
to 13.23 pence (2010: 10.76 pence).
Market review
Figure 1 overleaf outlines the revenues 
derived from each region in Sterling, as 
well as underlying currencies, giving year 
on year growth rates.
Sales in The Americas grew by 16.0% 
to $58.3m (2010: $50.2m), representing 
44.2% of our total sales for the year. After 
an unusually strong first half of our fiscal 
year we have seen more cautious spending 
amongst academic researchers which 
reduced growth in the second half. A large 
proportion of US research funding is provided 
by the NIH and we believe that this caution 
was caused by uncertainty surrounding the 
outcome of central government negotiations 
on the setting of the NIH budget.
The relationship between US funding 
and its impact on Abcam’s sales is 
complex and we have grown for many 
years significantly ahead of NIH’s budget 
levels, increases in which have been 
modest. Furthermore, as a provider of 
research tool consumables, Abcam can 
expect to be less affected by reductions 
in the NIH budget than, for example, those 
companies supplying more expensive 
laboratory equipment. 
The total budget for life science NIH 
research was around $30.3bn in the 
calendar year 2009, $31.2bn in 2010 
and is estimated to be $30.9bn in 2011. 
The outlook for NIH funding thereafter is 
likely to be caught up in budget reviews 
by the recently established Joint Select 
Committee on Deficit Reduction, which 
is charged with substantially reducing 
the US deficit over the next ten years.
Continued growth: what we're doing
Introducing new 
products to complement 
our existing range
This year we added more than 3000 non-primary 
antibody products to the catalogue and have 
successfully launched a number of new 
product ranges.
Through our proven OEM model, we are able to 
source popular research tools that complement 
our existing catalogue and consolidate products 
into distinct ranges for easy use by researchers. 
Customer adoption rates to new products have 
been high; utilising existing marketing channels 
and our geographic reach we were able to grow 
sales of non-primary antibody products by over 
50% over the year.
Our target going forward is to increase sales 
of non-primary antibodies so they represent 
over 10% of overall sales.  Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 12
Business review continued: Chief Executive Officer’s review
These figures exclude the ARRA stimulus 
to the US economy during 2009/10, which 
provided around $10.4bn to NIH funding. 
It is difficult to determine whether, or to 
what extent, Abcam’s sales increased 
as a consequence of ARRA, although it is 
possible given that grants typically run for 
two to three years, that some of these 
funds are still being spent. 
As well as adding new high quality 
products and a proven assay development 
capability, the acquisition of MitoSciences 
will also enable us to consolidate our 
customer service and technical support 
functions on the West Coast in Eugene, 
Oregon. Based on our earlier success 
we will, however, retain our marketing 
presence in California.
Sales to Europe grew by 13.3% to 
€25.5m (2010: €22.5m), representing 
26.3% of our total sales for the year. 
Our main European markets continue 
to be Germany and France, both of which 
performed satisfactorily. The rest of Europe 
is made up of a number of smaller 
markets, many of which also performed 
acceptably. A notable exception is Italy 
where a combination of new administrative 
requirements and disappointing local 
distributor performance, which has since 
been addressed, led to a reduction in year 
on year sales of 9.8%. Our focus remains 
on providing high levels of customer 
support, including in local language for 
the larger European countries if there is 
sufficient potential in the market to justify it. 
During the year we added customer support 
in Spanish.
We had a successful year in the UK where 
uncertainty caused by the government’s 
spending review negatively impacted on 
sales in the first half of the year. Sales 
growth subsequently improved in the 
second half to give total sales for the year 
of £6.3m (2010: £5.6m), representing 
growth of 10.8%. The UK accounted for 
7.5% of total Group sales.
Our business in Japan has been remarkably 
robust in the face of the adversities caused 
by the earthquake and tsunami which hit the 
country in March. This is due in no small 
part to the dedicated and steadfast way our 
staff performed during very difficult times. 
The directly affected area in the North of 
the country represented around 5% of our 
Japanese business but, despite widespread 
disruption, we were trading again with the 
rest of the country within a few days. 
During the year we also increased the 
coverage of our overall product range 
which is available in Japan and are very 
happy to report sales growth of 20.4% to 
¥1,183m (2010: ¥983m). This represented 
10.8% of our total Group sales for the year.
In Hong Kong and China we now 
have distributor arrangements in the key 
cities that are the centres for life science 
research. Our focus now is to build on 
these relationships and to improve 
customer service. Initiatives undertaken 
during the year include increasing 
the marketing materials available in 
Mandarin and reorganising our logistics 
arrangements into China, allowing us 
to ship directly into Beijing and cut our 
delivery times to customers. We continue 
to expect China to be a strong growth 
prospect for us in the coming financial 
year and we have a number of options for 
better supporting sales in the region under 
consideration, including holding inventory 
in the region. Sales to China increased to 
HK$48.1m (2010: HK$34.3m), representing 
a growth rate of 40.1% and now accounting 
for 4.7% of Group sales.
Sales to the Rest of the World, predominantly 
the remainder of South East Asia, increased 
by 27.4% to $8.6m (2010: $6.8m), 
representing 6.5% of total sales for the year. 
Our local team based in Hong Kong is now 
managing our Asia Pacific business, which is 
mostly served through our distributor network. 
Whilst we have had some tremendous 
success such as in South Korea, trading in 
Singapore, which represents less than 1% 
of our total sales, has been more difficult, with 
little growth in the year due to government 
spending cuts.
All the regional sales figures above exclude 
sales of $0.3m made by MitoSciences, 
which was acquired in May this year. We 
are delighted to have acquired a company 
with skilled personnel in assay development 
capability and a product pipeline to build 
on its existing high quality mitochondrial 
research tools portfolio. The integration of 
the business has gone well and over 200 
MitoSciences products went live in the 
Abcam catalogue at the beginning of July. 
I have personally met the MitoSciences 
team in Oregon and was extremely 
impressed; again I would like to take this 
opportunity to welcome them to Abcam 
and thank them for their continuing 
commitment to the Abcam mission.

Continued growth: what we’re doing
Focus on adding 
product data
A key differentiator for Abcam is the technical 
data that supports our products and a focus on 
adding value through product features continues 
to be a core element of the business strategy. 
Working with our in-house laboratory, this 
year we implemented a rigorous product 
characterisation project that tested over 3,000 
antibodies in a combination of applications 
such as Western blot and immunohistochemistry. 
To meet customer demand and market trends 
we will extend testing to include more applications, 
such as flow cytometry, which also complement 
our extended product offering. 
In addition to in-house testing, we are also 
able to characterise products through third 
party collaborations and we continue to work 
with our suppliers to ensure data is made 
available at the source. 
“We are delighted at the 
rate we are able to test 
products and how quickly 
this new data becomes 
available on the website 
and impacts sales. Following 
the success of this project, 
we are implementing 
similar testing for new 
product types.”

Catalogue growth and diversification
We have increased the number of products 
in the catalogue by 16.9% during the year 
to 73,652, of which over 57,000 are 
primary antibodies. Of the 10,642 new 
products, 7,000 are primary antibodies 
from our supplier base and almost 500 
were our own produced antibodies. In 
addition to adding over 1,500 secondary 
antibodies, we have continued to extend 
the breadth of antibody-related reagents 
we offer such as ELISA kits, IHC reagents, 
and proteins, the additions of which in the 
period totalled almost 1,600 products.
New products added during the year 
contributed £2.8m to sales in total, 
representing 3.4% of total sales. We 
expect sales of these products to grow 
as they mature on the catalogue and 
as information is added to them.
eCommerce and marketing
As our main sales tool, the performance 
of the website is key to our success and 
we have continued to invest to improve 
its security, accessibility and functionality. 
During the year we completed an exercise 
involving the relocation of our servers to a 
market-leading hosting facility in order to 
improve website scalability and resilience 
and to further reduce downtime. 
We have also invested in the website 
specifically to promote non-primary 
antibody products more effectively, whilst 
also launching a record number of these 
products. Consequently we have seen 
an increase in data sheet viewings for 
non-primary antibody products of over 
60% in the year. Indeed, the transitioning 
from ‘the largest catalogue of the best 
antibodies in the world’ to a company 
with the potential to become a world 
leader in all protein research tools is 
underway as can be seen in changes to 
the public website where the homepage 
has been redesigned to support more 
product ranges and better identify and 
present cross-selling opportunities.
Our conference programme continues 
to attract the key leaders in the fields 
with 200 key opinion leaders presenting 
cutting edge discoveries to over 2,000 
delegates. In total we held 18 conferences 
in 13 locations across all our core focus 
areas. Of particular note was our first

Continued growth: what we’re doing
Developing our business 
through communication
Sound market intelligence and customer insight remain 
critically important to making well informed business 
decisions on new products and initiatives. 
We have a dedicated market research team who 
conduct web and phone based surveys, as well 
as in-person customer interviews. In addition to 
monitoring customer satisfaction levels of products 
and services, this team examines the viability of 
new markets and monitors Abcam’s core business. 
Information is shared across business units and 
we ensure customer feedback is acted upon. 
A key strength is the speed with which we are able 
to identify and assess opportunities and implement 
business strategies.  Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

cancer and metabolism conference 
relevant for our MitoSciences range and 
our epigenetics conferences which have 
a reputation as second to none. New for 
the year was the introduction of a webinar 
series of online technical seminars and 
tutorials. They complement our traditional 
conference programme and both combined 
are highly effective tools in staying close 
to our customers to guide product 
development, improve our service 
offering and sell more products. 
Our production facility
Having units in stock available for 
immediate shipment is a key component 
in our objective to improve delivery times 
for customers. To that end we have focused 
this year on a project to increase stock 
levels for our own produced antibodies, 
with the aim of holding sufficient levels to 
meet at least two years’ worth of sales for 
a targeted list covering most of our own 
manufactured products. This aim is to 
reduce the risk of not having sufficient 
stock on hand to fulfil orders directly and 
also means that we can improve production 
efficiencies by being able to schedule 
production well in advance of the stock 
being required. The project has gone well 
and is expected to be completed during 
the 2011/12 financial year.
Production in the year was again at record 
levels and improvements to our processes 
saw better project success rates and yields, 
resulting in lower unit costs. In particular 
we have also introduced new innovative 
screening technology which has been 
applied very successfully to the production 
of antibodies, particularly those which 
have historically been harder to make. 
The facility is also heavily involved in our 
strategy of adding data to the catalogue 
from a range of sources. In the year under 
review the number of images added by 
the facility or specifically commissioned 
from third parties increased by over 100%, 
thanks to a major focus on increasing our 
in-house capability.
Efficiency initiatives 
We continue to drive for more efficiency in 
the business and this year was no exception. 
We are investing in two new Compound 
machines to enable us to increase our 
“Secondary antibodies 
are a natural extension 
to the catalogue. 
To understand customer 
perception of products 
in this range and their 
purchasing behaviours, we 
worked with the market 
research team to identify 
opportunities. We have 
since sourced additional 
products to support the 
portfolio; these are 
already on the catalogue 
and selling well.”

Continued growth: what we’re doing
Acquisition of  
MitoSciences
This year Abcam acquired MitoSciences, a leading 
provider of mitochondrial research tools based in Eugene, 
USA. Their 200 products include high performance 
monoclonal antibodies and related products for use 
in metabolism research, which complements Abcam’s 
existing product range and customer base in this area.
MitoSciences has heavily invested in R&D and is known 
for high quality, easy to use and sophisticated assay 
products. The acquisition extends Abcam’s manufacturing 
and product development capabilities and supports our 
brand repositioning beyond antibodies. 
Combined with Abcam’s existing product range and 
global market reach, together we are a leading provider 
of tools for metabolism research worldwide.
“The integration of 
MitoSciences has been smooth, 
from both an internal systems 
perspective and customer 
experience. Products were 
available via our website 
within six weeks. We share 
the same values of product 
quality and customer support 
excellence which has also 
made transitioning easy.”
Elodie Giuge, Corporate Projects Manager
“The MitoSciences team is 
delighted with the level of 
integration we have been 
able to achieve in such a 
short time. As well as aligning 
our systems and strategy, 
we have worked to promote 
effective communication 
between offices. We all look 
forward to a very successful 
future ahead.”

product handling capacity, one each in the 
UK and the US. One of these was delivered, 
installed and commissioned before the year 
end, and the other will be brought into use 
early in 2011/12. Together, these machines 
almost double our minus 20 degree storage 
capacity, the temperature at which the 
majority of our finished goods are held.
It has taken many years of process 
improvement to achieve the high levels 
of efficiency at which we operate our 
primary antibody business. The introduction 
of more new products to the catalogue 
presents challenges to which we are 
applying many of the techniques we 
have developed over time, to limit any 
adverse impact on overall efficiency.
Strategic development 
We believe that Abcam has the right 
strategy and positioning in the market 
to develop its world-leading antibody 
business into a broadly based global 
life science tools company, delivering 
sustainable value creation for researchers 
and shareholders. Our success to date 
has been built on promoting feedback 
to identify our customers’ requirements 
and adapting our business to fulfil these 
in as efficient a way as possible, whilst 
offering the broadest range of the highest 
quality products, coupled with the best 
customer service and support. This approach 
is ongoing and we continue to improve 
our offering, for example, by extending our 
product performance guarantee this year 
from four to six months from delivery. 
We are proud of the fact that in feedback 
over 92% of our customers rate our service 
as good or excellent.
Our plan to build out from this position 
is already bearing fruit and non-primary 
antibody product sales grew by over 
50% in the year, now representing 8.5% 
of total sales. These early successes in 
protein research products that sit alongside 
antibodies on the research bench are 
extremely encouraging and justify our faith 
in our expansion strategy. We are therefore 
excited about our prospects in building out 
the extended catalogue both organically 
through partnering and perhaps through 
M&A activity.
However, we should not be blind to the 
challenges that lie ahead. Over 80% of our 
sales are funded by public money, mainly 
through research grants, and we have seen 
cuts in public spending in order to reduce 
budget deficits, especially in the US and 
the UK, which will provide headwinds for 
Abcam in the short to medium term. 
Although the world economic climate 
looks uncertain for the next few years, the 
fundamentals of the markets that Abcam 
serves remain the same. The inexorable 
rise in mankind’s desire for knowledge 
about how cells function and how they 
go wrong in disease will continue to drive 
demand for high quality validated research 
tools. Abcam remains perfectly positioned 
to be able to meet that demand. 
Abcam continues to focus on geographic 
expansion in markets where funding is 
increasing, such as China, and on selling a 
greater breadth of products required by our 
customers to carry out their protein research. 
The commitment and excellence of 
Abcam’s staff continually impresses 
and delights me. Again I would like to 
warmly thank all our staff worldwide for 
their commitment to Abcam’s success 
both now and into the future.
Finally, we must never forget that our 
customers’ continuous drive for discovery, 
and Abcam’s enabling products, services 
and technologies that help facilitate that 
discovery, remain central to our past and 
future success. Our staff, together with our 
products, services and technologies, are 
central to achieving our goal of enabling 
our customers to discover more.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The Group’s management uses KPIs to 
monitor the progress of the business. 
Our KPIs are detailed on pages 02 and 03.
Revenue
The Group had another good year, 
recording revenues of £83.3m. Before the 
sales contribution from MitoSciences of 
£0.2m ($0.3m), this represents growth 
of 16.9%. Sterling was relatively stronger 
overall in the second half of the year against 
the currencies in which we sell and this 
cancelled out the revenue boost which 
was reported in the first half. Consequently 
sales growth was 16.8% on a constant 
currency basis (i.e. if exchange rates for 
the foreign currencies in which the Group 
sells had remained unchanged from 2010). 
The weighted average exchange rates 
applied to sales in the year are shown 
in Figure 2 below.
Gross margin
Total gross profit increased by 18.2% 
over the prior year. During the year we 
were successful in effectively managing 
increases in our average selling prices, 
whilst controlling costs from suppliers 
and our own production costs. Gross 
margins reported for the period were 
67.3% (2010: 66.7%), which comprised 
an increase of 1.0% in underlying margin, 
which was partially offset by a year on year 
reduction of 0.4% from the impact of 
Product Line Acquisition (PLA) agreements. 
Going forward the effect of PLA contracts 
is expected to be minimal.
“The Group had another good year, recording 
revenues of £83.3m and an increase in total gross 
profit by 18.2% over the prior year. We were successful 
in effectively managing increases in our average 
selling prices, whilst controlling costs from suppliers 
and our own production costs.”
 > Total revenue of £83.3m, driven 
by organic sales growth of 16.8% 
on a constant currency basis.
 > Total gross profit increased by 
18.2% over the prior year, giving 
a margin of 67.3%.
 > Continued tight management 
of costs including in the purchase 
of OEM products, further 
improvements in production 
efficiency and the benefits 
of economies of scale.
 > Basic EPS increased 23.0% to 
13.23 pence (2010: 10.76 pence).
 > Cash generation continues to 
be strong, with operating cash 
inflows of £25.5m, at 30.6% 
of Group revenue.

 Hong Kong Dollar 0.4%
 Sterling 22.4%
There was a positive impact on margin 
resulting from the weaker rates for the 
US Dollar, which was the transactional 
currency for 50.8% of sales in the year 
but for 66.7% of the costs of units sold in 
the year. This was matched by a reduction 
in margin from movements in our other 
trading currencies, to give an overall neutral 
effect on margins from exchange rates 
over the year. 
The pie charts on the left show 
the contribution of each currency to 
revenue and cost of sales in 2010/11.
Administration and management expenses
Prior to the inclusion of foreign 
exchange gains of £0.8m (2010: £0.4m)
and costs associated with the acquisition 
of MitoSciences of £0.2m (2010: £nil), 
administration and management 
expenses increased by £3.2m to £21.7m 
(2010: £18.5m), as summarised 
in Figure 3 below.
The underlying costs remained unchanged 
since the prior year as a percentage of sales, 
at 26.0%. The main movements in costs 
arose as a result of:
 > an increase of £1.8m in salaries as 
a result of a 20% increase in average 
headcount (excluding laboratory 
staff and staff joining the Group from 
MitoSciences), in particular to increase 
staff resources in the Company’s 
marketing and IT functions, with an 
emphasis on supporting new product 
areas, and in customer services;
 > a 40% increase (£0.3m) in the  
share-based payments charge as a 
result of the increase in headcount 
and the extension of the Long-Term 
Incentive Plan to senior managers;
 > a 55% increase (£0.5m) in marketing 
costs, a large proportion of which related 
to the launching of new products; and
 > a charge of £0.3m (2010: £nil) relating 
to external due diligence and consultancy 
costs associated with a potential acquisition 
which did not proceed during the first 
half of the year.
Research and development expenditure
Research and development (R&D) 
expenditure relates to the development 
of new polyclonal and monoclonal 
products, as well as costs incurred in 
searching for and developing production 
process improvements.
R&D expenditure decreased by 12.7% 
in the year to £3.2m (2010: £3.7m). 
This reflects a significant exercise 
undertaken in the year to identify cost 
savings by renegotiating certain supply 
contracts, as well as fewer projects having 
been undertaken in the year. It is anticipated 
that R&D expenditure will remain at broadly 
the same level for the coming year.
Since the Company’s R&D expenditure 
does not meet the requirements to be 
capitalised as an intangible asset, the 
costs are expensed through the income 
statement as incurred.

Profit
After adding back the ongoing  
share-based payments charge, gains 
on foreign currencies and the costs of 
the MitoSciences acquisition, operating 
profit expressed as a percentage of sales 
was 38.7% (2010: 36.6%), including a 
broadly neutral impact of exchange rates. 
This strong performance reflects continued 
tight management of costs including in 
the purchase of OEM products, further 
improvements in production efficiency 
leading to lower costs for our own products, 
and the benefits of economies of scale. 
Going forward, the introduction of new 
products which are likely to have lower 
gross margins and be less efficient 
to handle, and more overseas expansion 
in lower margin territories such as the 
Far East, will limit the opportunity 
for further operational gearing.
Investment revenue increased in the year, 
reflecting the slightly higher rates available 
in the market and the growing cash balances.
Tax
The consolidated tax charge for the year 
was £8.3m representing an effective tax 
rate of 25.9%. This reflects the 75% uplift 
in tax credits, increasing to 100% uplift 
from 1 April 2011, arising from the qualifying 
R&D undertaken in the period, as well as 
the reduction in the main rate of corporation 
tax from 28% to 26% from 1 April 2011.
The government has announced that the 
R&D tax credit uplift will increase from 
100% to 125% and the main rate of 
corporation tax will decrease from 26% 
to 25% from 1 April 2012, which we are 
expecting will serve to slightly reduce our 
Group effective tax rate for 2011/12.
Looking further ahead, we expect to 
no longer meet the government’s definition 
of a small or medium sized enterprise for tax 
purposes from 2012/13 onwards, and will 
therefore only qualify for the R&D tax credit 
allowance for large companies, which is 
currently 30%. The effect of this on our 
Group effective tax rate will be partially 
offset by the 1% reductions in the main 
rate of corporation tax per annum, currently 
planned to reach 23% with effect from 
1 April 2014.
Capital expenditure
Figure 4 below summarises the additions of 
property, plant and equipment in the year.
Additions of property, plant and equipment 
increased by 16.2% compared to the prior 
year, before accounting for those assets 
brought in as part of the MitoSciences 
acquisition. A new Compound machine 
was purchased within the year, costing 
£224,000, and another is planned for early 
2011/12. As detailed in the Chief Executive 
Officer’s Review, together these machines 
will almost double our minus 20 degree 
storage capacity, the temperature at which 
the majority of our finished goods are held.
We continue to invest in our facilities to 
enable the continuing growth of the Company 
and, therefore, anticipate that our capital 
expenditure in 2011/12 will increase to 
accommodate the following planned projects:
 > the purchase of an additional Compound 
machine as outlined above;
 > the redesign of our UK laboratory 
facility and expansion of the MitoSciences 
laboratory space to adequately 
accommodate planned production 
levels and other laboratory-based 
testing requirements;

to enhance the capacity and efficiency 
of this area of operations;
 > the relocation of each of our Japanese and 
Hong Kong offices to larger premises; and
 > a continuing investment in the renewal 
of computer equipment.
Inventories
The level of inventories increased by 
15.9% in the year, after deducting £0.2m 
held by MitoSciences. This is slightly below 
the growth in sales and reflects the strategy 
adopted during the year to increase the 
levels of own produced inventory to the 
equivalent of two years’ sales for most 
lines, in order to provide better security 
of supply for customers and improve 
production efficiencies. This initiative is 
well under way and should be completed 
during the 2011/12 financial year.
Our systems enable strong inventory 
control and we intentionally increased 
inventory in the final quarter of 2009/10 
to increase the percentage of orders which 
we can fulfil directly from stock, which has 
been maintained at over 79.0% for the 
year (2010: 76.5%). The success of this 
exercise means that we are planning to 
extend this further in the 2011/12 
financial year.
In addition to growth broadly in line 
with sales, inventory levels are expected 
to increase over time as more products 
manufactured by MitoSciences are launched 
and once we have established a stock location 
in China, which is planned during the 
2011/12 financial year. 
Receivables
We have strong debtor control processes 
and exercise tight credit control. Debtor days 
at the year end were 35.0 (2010: 32.6). 
The majority of sales continue to be on credit 
and we would expect to see a gradual trend 
of increasing debtor days over time, in line 
with practice in local markets, as the 
geographic spread of sales widens.
Payables 
Trade and other payables rose by 20.3% 
from £6.9m to £8.3m. This figure includes 
deferred income of £0.9m (2010: £1.3m), 
including £0.6m of the cash incentive of 
£1.1m received on entering into a new 
lease for the head office during 2009

(2010: £0.8m), which is to be credited to 
profit and loss over the life of the lease. 
The main contributor to the total increase 
in payables over the prior year was trade 
payables, which increased by 38.3% to 
£3.5m (2010: £2.6m) due to the timing 
of payments to our suppliers around the 
year end.
Cash flow
A summary of the Group’s cash flow during 
the year is shown in Figure 5 above.
The Group’s cash generation continues 
to be strong, with operating cash inflows 
of £25.5m, at 30.6% of Group revenue. 
Consequently, after a net payment of 
£2.4m for the acquisition of MitoSciences 
(after adding back the cash acquired on 
acquisition of £0.1m), dividends amounting 
to £7.9m and other financing and 
investing activities, the Group’s cash 
and short-term deposits increased 
during the year by £15.3m. 
The short-term deposits are cash deposits 
held with major UK banks, which had a 
maturity date of over three months when 
the deposit was made.
EPS
Including costs of acquisition of 
£0.2m, diluted EPS increased by 23.5% 
to 12.98 pence (2010: 10.51 pence), 
whilst basic EPS also increased 23.0% 
to 13.23 pence (2010: 10.76 pence). 
The increase in basic and diluted EPS 
reflects the increase in profit, higher effective 
tax rate and increase in the weighted average 
number of shares issued during the year 
including 279,521 shares issued as 
partial consideration on the acquisition 
of MitoSciences.
Currency exposure
The Group continues to generate 
significant amounts of US Dollars, Euros 
and Japanese Yen in excess of payments 
in these currencies and has arrangements 
in place to reduce the exposure to currency 
fluctuations by selling forward a proportion 
of the surpluses generated. Details of these 
contracts are set out in note 25.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
25
The Directors present their Annual Report on the affairs of the Group, together with the financial statements and the Independent 
Auditor’s Report, for the year ended 30 June 2011. The Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 32 to 38 forms part of 
this report. Although not required to do so by the AIM listing rules, the Directors have provided corporate governance disclosures 
with this report in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 (the Code).
Principal activities
Abcam is a producer and distributor of high-quality research-grade antibodies and associated protein research tools. Antibodies and 
associated protein research products are essential tools for life scientists enabling them to analyse components of living cells at the 
molecular level. 
The Group sells through the internet to customers across the world and now has an online catalogue of products sourced from over 
300 of the world’s leading manufacturers, academic laboratories and institutes and the Group also has its own production facilities. 
The catalogue includes a growing range of non-primary antibody products such as proteins, peptides, lysates, immunoassays and 
other kits. Products are available for life-science research and are distributed to academic and commercial users. A highly developed 
eCommerce platform, which includes regional websites for the Chinese and Japanese markets, allows customers to access up-to-date 
and detailed technical product data sheets.
The subsidiary undertakings principally affecting the profits or net assets of the Group in the year are listed in note 19 to the 
financial statements. 
Business review
The information that fulfils the requirements of the Companies Act for a business review to be included within the Directors’ Report 
can be found on pages 8 to 21 and is deemed to be incorporated in this report by this reference.
Information about the use of financial instruments by the Company and its subsidiaries is given in note 22 to the financial statements. 
Details of significant events since the balance sheet date are contained in note 34 to the financial statements.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. 
Risk management policies are constantly reviewed, taking into account market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Board 
formally reviews the Group’s risk register twice a year.
Like every business, the Group faces risks in the undertaking of its day-to-day operations and in pursuit of its longer-term objectives. 
Further information on those risks and how they are managed by the Group is set out on the following pages.
Further additional information on the Group’s financial risk management strategy can be found in note 25 to the financial statements.
Directors’ report 26 Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Issue Risk Mitigation
Government 
funding
Over 80% of Abcam’s sales are funded by public 
money, mainly through research grants. Any reduction 
in grant funding by central governments to address 
fiscal deficits is likely to have some impact on the 
level of demand for Abcam’s products.
One of Abcam’s key long-term strategic objectives is to 
continue to expand its geographic diversity, particularly 
in markets where government funding is increasing, 
such as China.
In addition, Abcam’s products are used as research 
tool consumables within laboratories, so its sales are 
likely to be more resilient when budgets are cut than 
equipment manufacturers, for example, whose 
customers may be more unlikely to obtain approval 
for large capital investment projects.
Competition There are several hundred antibody suppliers around 
the world. These include companies ranging from 
dedicated antibody suppliers to large multi-national 
companies selling broad ranges of other products in 
addition to antibodies. Abcam’s rapid growth may 
attract new competitors and/or stimulate existing 
competitors, some of which have greater financial, 
marketing and technological resources than Abcam, 
to invest further in their offerings to the market.
Abcam already sources products from many of the 
world’s leading suppliers and, in response to this 
risk, continues to build its supplier and product 
base, invest in the functionality of its website and 
its operational capability. The challenges for a 
competitor would include establishing a suitably 
large catalogue of products with proven validation  
in research, sold under an established and successful 
brand, and if they were to follow Abcam’s supply 
model, building relationships with a broad range 
of high quality suppliers.
Supplier 
relationships
Abcam may lose a supplier if, for example, that 
supplier’s business strategy changed or it was no 
longer willing or able to continue to provide products.
Abcam has over 300 suppliers and has had 
relationships with many of them for several years, 
with growing levels of sales, which makes this less 
likely. If this were to occur Abcam often has several 
antibodies to the same target and whilst each is 
unique, in the event of a particular product no 
longer being available, Abcam would look to offer 
customers alternative products from within the 
catalogue. In the 2011 financial year no supplier 
accounted for more than 5% of revenue.
Abcam has its own production capability which 
could also be utilised to generate alternative products. 
Products from the facilities currently contribute 
approximately 17% of total Group revenue.
Intellectual 
property
Research antibodies are not typically protected by 
intellectual property rights and the market can be 
characterised as having relatively low barriers to 
entry in this regard. However, where such rights are 
claimed to be the subject of third party patents or 
other proprietary rights, Abcam may be the subject 
of infringement actions or proceedings. 
Abcam believes that its principal protection in 
the market lies with its business model rather than 
through intellectual property rights. The breadth of 
highly specified products in its catalogue, its ability 
to add products quickly and cheaply, its extensive 
supplier base and its own production capability 
and brand, each act as significant barriers to entry 
for competitors.
In addition, Abcam has no single product dependency; 
for example, its biggest selling product accounts for 
less than 1% of Group revenues, meaning that any 
infringement actions are likely to have a minimal 
impact on sales.
International trade 
regulation
The Group’s activities involve importing and exporting 
its products across many international borders. Any 
changes to the regulations covering such movements 
might have an effect on the Group’s trading activities.
Abcam closely monitors any changes to international 
import and export regulations and seeks to adapt its 
procedures wherever possible to ensure that the 
movement of products is not affected, whilst 
maintaining compliance with such regulations.

Issue Risk Mitigation
Infrastructure Abcam operates in a market which it has been able 
to exploit through the use of online and eCommerce 
based systems. These systems need to be robust, 
efficient and scalable in order for the Group to continue 
to manage its growth. The risks here are both from 
the infrastructure and organisation of the IT systems, 
as well as the ability of Abcam’s products to be found 
by online users through popular internet search engines.
The Group invests extensively in its IT systems both 
from a scalability and security point of view, as well 
as from usability aspects. Abcam uses a global 
content delivery partner to increase both the reliability 
and access speed for viewing the majority of its 
static site content. Dynamic content is served from 
an external, fully supported data centre. The Group 
outsources regular security penetration testing on its 
website from a third party and pays considerable 
attention internally to the search engine optimisation 
and usability of the website through user testing, 
feedback and surveys.
Staff recruitment 
and retention
The contribution made by Abcam’s highly skilled 
and dedicated staff has been, and will continue 
to be, important to Abcam’s future success. As the 
Group’s profile grows it is important that it is able 
to continue to recruit and retain high calibre staff.
Abcam places great emphasis on open 
communication with employees, including 
quarterly Group-wide meetings, weekly office 
meetings and regular staff committee meetings. 
There are also share ownership schemes and 
profit share arrangements, with rewards based 
on seniority within the business.
Abcam also looks to create a supportive 
working environment: employees are provided 
with significant opportunities for learning and 
development and are encouraged to provide 
feedback on this via an annual staff survey. 
Distributor 
relationships
In certain areas of the world Abcam works through 
third party distributors who undertake marketing 
support activities and provide local logistical 
support. Consequently Abcam is dependent on 
them fulfilling these roles in an effective and 
efficient manner so as to enable sales to continue 
to grow in these regions. The distributors act as 
customers and therefore represent a financial risk 
for uncollected account balances.
Abcam has a team dedicated to maintaining close 
relationships with our distributors. They typically 
work on annual contracts and there is a detailed 
qualification process which they are required to go 
through before being appointed. Outside of Japan, 
where we sell directly to sub-dealers, distributor 
sales amounted to around 10% of total sales in 
the 2011 financial year and no single distributor 
accounted for more than 3% of total sales.
Product 
defensibility
It is possible that new technologies may emerge 
in the future as viable alternatives to the use of 
antibodies in protein detection.
In order to mitigate this risk Abcam has many 
contacts in the industry and dedicates resource 
specifically targeted at this area. In this way, Abcam 
looks to stay abreast of technological developments 
in the field as far as is practicable, with the aim of 
positioning the Group to exploit the commercialisation 
of such technologies if they appear.
Financial The Group has significant operations outside the UK 
and as such is exposed to exchange rate fluctuation, 
in particular the strength of Sterling relative to the 
US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen. Although there 
are natural hedges in place due to the fact that the 
Group is able to utilise a proportion of its income 
in foreign currencies to pay for outgoings in those 
currencies, in particular the US Dollar, the Group 
generates surpluses of each currency.
The Board’s policy is to sell forward some of the 
expected surplus in order to reduce the short-term 
exposure. However, longer-term movements in 
the relative strength of Sterling will impact the 
Group’s profits. 28 Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Dividends
As detailed in the Chairman’s Review, the Directors recommend a final dividend of 3.800 pence (2010: 2.922 pence*) per ordinary 
share, to be paid on 25 November 2011 to shareholders on the register on 4 November 2011. Together with the interim dividend 
of 1.450 pence per share paid on 15 April 2011, this makes a combined dividend for the year of 5.250 pence (2010: 4.006 pence*). 
*  To aid comparison, the prior year dividends on each 1 pence ordinary share have been restated as the equivalent dividend upon each 0.2 pence ordinary share, 
to take account of the five for one share sub-division which took effect on 15 November 2010.
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital 
during the year, are shown in notes 26 and 27. The Company has one class of ordinary share which carries no right to fixed income. 
Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general provisions 
of the Company’s Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders 
of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 32. The voting rights in relation to the shares held by the Abcam Employee 
Share Benefit Trust are exercised by the trustees. 
The sub-division of each 1 pence ordinary share into five new ordinary shares of 0.2 pence each was approved by shareholders at 
the Company’s AGM in November 2010 and became effective on 15 November 2010. The sub-division was proposed by the Board 
with the objective of improving the liquidity and marketability of the ordinary shares of the Company by reducing the market price 
of an ordinary share and increasing the number of shares in issue.
Appointment and authority of Directors
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Companies 
Act and related legislation and, although not obliged to do so as an AIM listed company, has chosen to follow the principles set out in 
the Code wherever possible. The Articles themselves may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders. The powers of Directors 
are described in the main Board terms of reference, copies of which are available on request, and the Corporate Governance Statement 
on pages 32 to 38.
Change of control
All of Abcam’s equity-based plans contain provisions relating to a change of control. Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), outstanding 
awards would normally be released on a change of control, subject to satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time. In addition, 
depending on the achievement of performance conditions, other share-based payment arrangements may vest on change of control 
but this is subject to the approval and exercise of the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Company is not party to any agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following 
a takeover bid. There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss 
of office or employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Directors
The Directors who served throughout the year were as follows:
Mike Redmond 
Jonathan Milner 
Jeff liffe 
Jim Warwick 
Tim Dye 
Peter Keen 
Tony Kouzarides 
Mark Webster
Brief biographical descriptions of the Directors are set out on pages 22 and 23.
Two Directors will be retiring and offering themselves for re-election at the AGM to be held in October 2011:
 > Tony Kouzarides who has been a Non-Executive Director for over nine years and retires in line with the principles set out in the Code; and
 > Jim Warwick who last stood for re-election in 2008 and retires by rotation as required by the Company’s Articles of Association.

Directors continued
Tim Dye and Mark Webster will be retiring at the conclusion of this year’s AGM, as discussed in the Chairman’s Report on pages 6 and 7.
Following performance evaluation, the Chairman has determined that each individual continues to demonstrate commitment to his 
role and to display effective performance; he is therefore recommending re-election of all Directors offering themselves for re-election 
at this year’s AGM.

account of the five for one share sub-division which took effect on 15 November 2010.
There have been no changes in the Directors’ interests in shares of the Company between 30 June 2011 and 12 September 2011.
Directors’ share options
Details of Directors’ share-based options and awards and shares conditionally awarded through the Share Incentive Plan are provided 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 39 to 48.
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its Directors which were made during the reporting 
period and these remain in force at the date of this report.
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s policy is to settle terms of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of each transaction, ensure that suppliers 
are made aware of the terms of payment and abide by the terms of payment, provided that the goods or services have been supplied 
in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. Trade creditors of the Group at 30 June 2011 were equivalent to 37 days 
purchases (2010: 29 days), based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during the year.
Charitable and political donations and community support
Abcam participates actively in the community of entrepreneurial businesses clustered around Cambridge, UK. The Company supports 
the Cambridge Network, the University of Cambridge and the Judge Business School both by giving talks and presentations on its business 
as well as hosting projects for MBA students. Abcam takes students from secondary education on work experience programmes as well 
as occasional international exchange students on placement.
The Group encourages employees to get involved in local charitable activities; a maximum of 0.1% of the previous year’s pre-tax profit 
is allocated for charitable donations, split between each of the Group’s offices. The donations are allocated by a committee of staff volunteers 
working within guidelines set down by the Directors. Included in the figures below is an additional one-off donation of £10,000 to the 
Japanese earthquake appeal and the Board wishes to thank its Japanese employees, who have continued to work with spirit and 
dedication to ensure Abcam’s service to its customers has been maintained despite the adverse conditions they faced.
The Group made no political donations during the year (2010: £nil) and made charitable donations of £35,825 (2010: £15,401), 
principally to children’s and local charities serving the communities in which the Group operates.  30 Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

No shares were purchased under the above authority during the year under review. 
Corporate, social and ethical policies
Abcam recognises the importance of balancing the interests of its customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers and the communities 
in which it operates. Management of the environmental and social issues that play a part in the business is a key factor in the Group’s 
strategy for success and in the practice of good corporate governance.
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has continued to keep them informed on matters affecting 
them as employees and on the various factors affecting the performance of the Group. This is achieved through regular formal and 
informal meetings and weekly e-newsletters distributed by each of the regional offices. Employee representatives are consulted regularly 
on a wide range of matters affecting their current and future interests. 
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the applicant concerned. 
It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled employees should, as far as possible, be 
identical to that of other employees. The Group needs highly qualified staff and does not see age, colour, disability, ethnic origin, gender, 
or political or other opinion as a barrier to employment.
The Group aspires to carry out its business to the highest of ethical standards, treating employees, suppliers and customers in a professional, 
courteous and honest manner. The Group has an ethical policy which is reviewed by the Board and which is applied to its products. 
This includes reviewing and, where appropriate, visiting our suppliers to check the standards they follow in their products and services.
Health and safety and environment
Abcam provides and maintains a safe and healthy working environment, equipment and systems for all employees together with 
information, training and supervision as may be needed for this purpose. 
Compliance with legislation is the Group’s minimum requirement; however, our aim is to achieve higher standards as best practice 
demands. The Group is committed to an annual audit process by external safety advisors in order to understand and maximise our 
performance, demonstrate best practice to all stakeholders and identify areas for targeted improvements. Core skills are identified 
and training programmes developed to ensure these are in place.

Health and safety and environment continued
Health and safety in the Group is ultimately the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer. The management structure for health and 
safety is run by a Safety & Facilities Specialist and is supported through a Group Steering Committee whose membership includes the 
Chief Operating Officer, Scientific Director, Head of Corporate Services and representatives from all Abcam regional offices. The safety 
structure encompasses employees from all areas of the business and promotes ownership of health and safety across its wide remit.
A rigorous occupational health scheme is in place and we look to promote a positive and proactive safety culture. Our reporting 
system for absence promotes the best use of resources and there have been no RIDDOR reportable accidents or instances of ill 
health over the past year. 
Abcam seeks, wherever possible, to minimise its impact on the environment for the benefit of its employees and the public at large. 
The Group is committed to complying with environmental regulations and encourages and supports its employees in achieving this.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out 
in the Business Review on pages 8 to 21. Notes 21, 24 and 25 include a description of the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure 
to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources and through a diverse customer base is subject not only to the Western economies 
but also Japan, China and, to a lesser extent, South America. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed 
to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain global economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Auditor
Each of the Directors of the Company at the date on which this report was approved confirms that: 
 > so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
 > the Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office as auditor and a resolution to re-appoint them will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM.
Approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by:
Mike Redmond
Chairman
12 September 2011 32 Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
The Directors believe that effective corporate governance, appropriate to the Group considering its size and stage of development, will 
assist in the delivery of corporate strategy, the generation of shareholder value and the safeguarding of shareholders’ long-term interests. 
The Directors are committed therefore, wherever it is reasonably practicable, to ensure that the Group is managed in accordance with 
the principles set out in the Code. Therefore, although not required to do so by the AIM listing rules, the Directors have provided corporate 
governance disclosures with this report in line with guidance contained within the Code.
Directors
Board effectiveness
The Board’s role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership of the Company within a framework of prudent and effective controls which 
enables risk to be assessed and managed. 
The Board holds full meetings every month, with attendance required in person one month and via telephone the next month. 
The principal matters that it considers are as follows: 
 > monthly management accounts, KPIs and performance against budget;
 > regular reviews of R&D, operations and product sourcing;
 > regular reviews of strategic objectives and Group priorities;
 > the annual Group budget and revised forecasts;
 > reporting including statutory accounts, dividend policy, dividend payments and the AGM;
 > performance of the Board and sub-Committees;
 > reports of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees;
 > an annual review of risk-management strategy and controls and a six-monthly review of the risk register;
 > matters relating to the Company’s obligations as an AIM listed company; 
 > determination of the remuneration policy for the Directors and other senior executives; and
 > management of funds and major capital expenditure, including proposals for mergers or acquisitions of other companies 
or product lines.
The Board has a policy, which is reviewed at least annually, to set out which matters are reserved for the decision of the Board and 
those to which the Executive Directors need not refer for approval. This policy also identifies those matters regarding which full delegation 
to a Board Committee is not normally permitted because a final decision is required to be taken by the whole Board. 
The Board delegates day-to-day responsibility for managing the Group to the Executive Management Team (EMT) and has a number 
of other Committees, details of which are set out on the following pages.
Matters which the Board considers are suitable for delegation to a Board Committee are contained within each Committee’s terms 
of reference, which are available on the Company’s investor relations website, www.abcamplc.com.

Directors continued
Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are vested in separate individuals, each with clear allocation of accountability 
and responsibility. 
The main responsibilities of the Chairman include:
 > leadership of the Board and creating the conditions for overall Board and individual director effectiveness and a constructive 
relationship with good communications between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors;
 > ensuring that the Board as a whole plays a full and constructive part in the development of strategy and overall commercial objectives;
 > ensuring that there is effective communication with shareholders;
 > promoting the highest standards of integrity, probity and corporate governance throughout the Company, particularly at Board level; and
 > ensuring that the performance of the Board as a whole, its committees, and individual directors is formally and rigorously evaluated 
at least once a year.
The main responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer include:
 > proposing and developing the Company’s long-term strategy and overall commercial objectives to ensure the Company’s position 
remains differentiated, in conjunction with the EMT;
 > ensuring initiatives for long-term growth are appropriately championed and resourced within the Company in the short term;
 > managing the EMT; 
 > leading the communication programme with shareholders and analysts; and
 > fostering good relationships with key stakeholders.
Executive Management Team
The EMT is responsible for developing and implementing the strategy approved by the Board. In particular, the EMT is responsible for 
ensuring that the Group’s budget and forecasts are properly prepared, that targets are met and for generally managing and developing the 
business within the overall budget. Variations from the budget and changes in strategy require approval from the main Board of the Group. 
The EMT, which meets on a weekly basis, comprises the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, 
the Chief Technology Officer, the Scientific Director, the Commercial Director and the Head of Corporate Services; meetings are attended 
by other senior operational personnel, as appropriate. 
Board balance and independence
The Board comprises the Chairman, three full-time Executive Directors and four Non-Executive Directors. Brief biographical details 
of all members of the Board are set out on pages 22 and 23.
In order to assist in securing the recruitment and retention of high calibre Non-Executive Directors, prior to the flotation of the 
Company in 2005, the Company granted options to Non-Executive Directors to acquire shares in the Company in addition to fees. 
In the period since listing on AIM, no equity-based incentives have been granted to Non-Executive Directors and there are no plans 
for any such grants in the future. At the end of the year, the only Non-Executive Director with a small number of unexercised share 
options is Tony Kouzarides. These options are not subject to any performance conditions.
The holding of share options by Non-Executive Directors could be, amongst other things, relevant in determining whether a  
Non-Executive Director is independent. The Board has determined that it does not believe that the holding of share options by 
Tony Kouzarides detracts from his independent status. Tony Kouzarides is therefore considered by the Board to be independent, 
notwithstanding the fact that he has served on the Board for more than nine years, since he demonstrates a continuous independence 
in character, judgement and behaviour in all Board matters. The Board considers Mike Redmond, Peter Keen and Tim Dye to be 
independent within the meaning of the Code. Mark Webster is not deemed to be independent because he has been employed by 
the Company in an executive capacity during the last five years. Peter Keen has been identified as the Senior Independent Director, 
who provides a communication channel between the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, and is available to discuss matters 
with shareholders if required.
All Directors have completed conflicts of interest questionnaires and any planned changes in their directorships outside the Group 
are notified to the Board. None of the relationships declared are considered to be of a material nature to Abcam’s business, and 
none are therefore deemed to impact on the independence of the Directors. The conflicts register is reviewed at Board meetings on 
alternate months.
The beneficial interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company are set out in the Directors’ Report. In the opinion of the 
Board, these shareholdings do not detract from the Non-Executive Directors’ independent status. 34 Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Directors continued
Board balance and independence continued
The Board has considered the overall balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors and believes that the structure of the 
Board and the integrity of each Director ensures that there is no one individual or group dominating the decision making process. It is 
intended that the Board reflects a balance between financial, sector specific and general business skills, with a highly experienced team 
leading the business in both Executive and Non-Executive roles. Following a review of Board membership during the year, it was identified 
that the Company would benefit from experience at the Non-Executive Director level of the life-science tools market and businesses with 
a strong eCommerce component. This has led to the forthcoming appointment of Tony Martin, as detailed in the Chairman’s Review and 
in the Nomination Committee report below, and the planned recruitment of a further Director with broad eCommerce experience.
Information and professional development
Before each meeting the Board is provided with information concerning the state of the business and its performance in a timely 
manner, in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties. 
Non-Executive Directors have the opportunity to influence agendas for Board discussions and to ensure the amount of time spent 
reviewing strategic and operational issues is appropriately balanced. In the event that Directors are unable to attend a meeting or a 
conference call, they receive and read the papers for consideration at that meeting and have the opportunity to relay their comments 
and, if necessary, to follow up with the Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer after the meeting. 
Directors receive appropriate induction on joining the Board, tailored to their specific requirements, the aim of which is to introduce 
them to key executives across the business and to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the Group and its activities. 
The Group has a commitment to training and all Directors, Executive or Non-Executive, are encouraged to attend suitable training 
courses at the Group’s expense. Regular updates on corporate governance are also provided to the Board by the Group’s advisors.
Performance evaluation
The Board undertakes a regular evaluation of its own performance. This review involves detailed interviews with each Director and covers 
the functioning of the Board as a whole, the operation of each of the Committees, succession planning and process and practicalities.
The review undertaken in 2011 concluded that the Board and its individual members continues to perform effectively in an 
environment where there is constructive challenge from the Non-Executive Directors and operates within a framework of sound 
governance and practices which, wherever it is reasonably practicable, are consistent with the principles set out in the Code.
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the Annual Report and Accounts and the interim financial information, and for 
ensuring they present a balanced assessment of the Group’s position. Drafts of these reports are provided to the Board in a timely manner 
and Directors’ feedback is discussed and incorporated where appropriate, prior to publication.
Internal control
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for safeguarding the shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets and has applied 
principle C.2 of the Code by establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks the Group 
faces. The Board regularly reviews the process, which has been in place from the start of the year to the date of approval of this report 
and which is in accordance with revised guidance on internal control published in October 2005 (the Turnbull Guidance). 
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring the Group maintains an adequate system of internal control and risk management 
and for reviewing its effectiveness, whilst the implementation of internal control systems is the responsibility of management. The Group 
has implemented an internal control system designed to help ensure:
 > the effective and efficient operation of the Group by enabling management to respond appropriately to significant risks to achieving 
the Group’s business objectives;
 > the safeguarding of assets from inappropriate use or from loss and fraud and ensuring that liabilities are identified and managed;
 > the quality of internal and external reporting;
 > compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with internal policies on the conduct of the Group’s business; and
 > the ability to recover in a timely manner from the effects of disasters or major accidents which originate outside the Group’s direct control.
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risks inherent in a fast-moving business and can, therefore, provide 
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Corporate governance statement continued Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Overview Business review Governance Financial statements

Accountability and audit continued
Internal control continued
In compliance with provision C.2.1 of the Code, the Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control. 
The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management. It is based 
principally on reviewing reports from management to consider whether significant risks are identified, evaluated, managed and controlled 
and whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The Board has also 
performed a specific assessment for the purpose of the Annual Report. This assessment considers all significant aspects of internal control 
arising during the period covered by this report. The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities. 
During the course of its review of the system of internal control, the Board has not identified nor been advised of any failings 
or weaknesses which it has determined to be significant. 
Whilst the Group does not currently have a separate internal audit function, an Internal Controls Committee, consisting of key members 
of the finance team, meets on a monthly basis, with other operational managers attending where necessary. A rolling internal audit of key 
processes has been implemented and is carried out by members of the finance team. The results are reviewed by the Internal Controls 
Committee and the Audit Committee and the necessary actions taken to rectify any control deficiencies identified. 
The Audit Committee reviews the need for a separate internal audit function on an annual basis and has concluded that, despite 
the rate of growth in recent years, the structure of the Group and the level of control exercised by the management team are currently 
sufficient, such that an internal audit function continues to be neither necessary nor cost effective at this time. The Directors have 
taken steps to ensure that the Group has an appropriate control environment for its size and complexity. The management team will 
ensure that the internal control environment develops with the size of the Company, with respect to the identification, evaluation and 
monitoring of risk.
Whistleblowing procedures
The Group operates a whistleblowing policy which provides for all employees to raise concerns about any unethical business practices, 
fraud, misconduct or wrongdoing to senior management in strict confidence. They can do so without fear of recrimination and the 
Audit Committee receives any such confidential reports. There were no whistleblowing reports throughout 2010/11 and none up to 
the date of this report.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The Board believes it is important to have open communications with shareholders. To this end, the Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer, working in consultation with the Company’s corporate and PR advisors, make themselves available and 
expect to meet with shareholders at least twice a year.
Where appropriate the Company also consults with major shareholders on significant issues.
Members of the Board develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders through any direct contact that may be initiated 
by shareholders, or through analysts’ and brokers’ briefings. The Board also receives feedback from the Group’s broker and financial 
PR advisor who, in turn, obtain feedback from analysts and brokers following investor roadshows.
Constructive use of the AGM
The Board actively encourages participation at the AGM, which is the principal forum for dialogue with private shareholders. 
A presentation is made outlining recent developments in the business and an open question-and-answer session follows to 
enable shareholders to ask questions about the business in general.

and are then referred to the Board for approval. 36 Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
The Audit Committee continued
Summary of the role of the Audit Committee continued
The Committee has responsibility for the following matters: 
 > monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial 
performance and reviewing significant financial reporting judgements contained therein before they are submitted to the Board 
for final approval;
 > reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s financial reporting and the internal control and risk management policies and systems;
 > reviewing annually the need for an internal audit function;
 > making recommendations to the Board, for a resolution to be put to shareholders for their approval in general meeting, on the 
appointment of the external auditor and the approval of the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditor;
 > reviewing and monitoring the external auditor’s independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into 
consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements; 
 > developing and implementing a policy on the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services, taking into account 
relevant guidance regarding the provision of non-audit services by the external audit firm; and
 > reviewing the arrangements by which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties.
The Audit Committee is required to report its findings to the Board, identifying any matters on which it considers that action 
or improvement is needed, and make recommendations on the steps to be taken.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The members of the Audit Committee are shown on page 35. Membership of the Committee is reviewed by the Chairman of the 
Committee and the Group Chairman at regular intervals and they recommend new appointments to the Nominations Committee 
for onward recommendation to the Board. 
The Audit Committee is required to include one financially qualified member (as recognised by the Consultative Committee of 
Accountancy Bodies). Currently the Audit Committee Chairman, Peter Keen, fulfils this requirement. Peter is deemed by the Board 
to have recent and relevant financial experience as he is a qualified chartered accountant with more than 25 years’ experience in the 
financing and management of biotechnology companies. He is currently chairman of Oval Medical Technologies Ltd and Exosect Limited 
and a Non-Executive Director of Ark Therapeutics Group plc and the Biotech Growth Trust plc.
All Audit Committee members are expected to be financially literate. The Board expects the Audit Committee members to have 
an understanding of:
 > the principles of, contents of, and developments in financial reporting, including the applicable accounting standards 
and statements of recommended practice;
 > key aspects of the Group’s operations including corporate policies, Group financing, products and systems of internal control;
 > matters that influence or distort the presentation of accounts and key figures;
 > the principles of, and developments in, company law, sector-specific laws and other relevant corporate legislation;
 > the role of internal and external auditing and risk management;
 > the regulatory framework for the Group’s businesses; and 
 > environmental and social responsibility best reporting practices.
Meetings
The Audit Committee is required to meet two times per year and has an agenda linked to events in the Group’s financial calendar. 
The agenda is predominantly cyclical and is therefore approved by the Audit Committee Chairman on behalf of his fellow members. 
Each Audit Committee member has the right to require reports on matters of interest in addition to the cyclical items. During the 
period under review the Committee has met twice on a formal basis and a number of times informally. 
The Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operations Officer, the Financial Controller and senior representatives 
of the external auditor attend Audit Committee meetings by invitation in order to ensure that all the information required by the Audit 
Committee for it to operate effectively is available. Representatives of the Group’s external auditor meet with the Audit Committee at least 
twice a year without any Executive Directors or other Company management being present.

The Audit Committee continued
Overview of the actions taken by the Audit Committee to discharge its duties
During the year under review, the Audit Committee has:
 > reviewed the June 2010 report and financial statements and the December 2010 half-yearly financial report. As part of this review, 
the Committee received a report from the external auditor on their audit of the Annual Report and financial statements and review of the 
half-yearly financial report;
 > reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and disclosures made in the Annual Report and financial statements 
on this matter;
 > reviewed and agreed the scope of the audit work to be undertaken by the auditor;
 > agreed the fees to be paid to the external auditor for their audit of the June 2010 financial statements and December half-yearly report;
 > considered a report from the Internal Controls Committee on their review of the effectiveness of controls across the Group 
and received a report on management action taken in response to the recommendations arising from this report; and
 > reviewed its own effectiveness.
External auditor
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, implementation and monitoring of the Group’s policy on external audit.
Deloitte LLP has been the Group’s auditor since it listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2005. The external auditor is required 
to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group and subsidiary audits every fifth year end and the current lead audit partner has 
been in place since 2 November 2009. The Audit Committee considers that the relationship with the external auditor is working well 
and remains satisfied with their effectiveness. Accordingly, the Audit Committee has not considered it necessary to date to require 
the firm to tender for the audit work.
There are no contractual obligations restricting the Group’s choice of external auditor. The Audit Committee also keeps under review 
the value for money of the audit. The Committee has discussed with the external auditor the firm’s independence and has received 
and reviewed written disclosures from the external auditor as required by the Auditing Practices Board’s International Standard on 
Auditing (ISA) (UK and Ireland) 260 “Communication of audit matters to those charged with governance”. Through this process, 
the Committee has concluded that the auditor is independent.
The Group’s regular tax compliance work is carried out by Deloitte and tax advisory work is carried out by the auditor only in 
cases where that firm is best suited to perform the work in a cost-effective manner, given their familiarity with the Group’s business. 
A breakdown of fees paid to the auditor can be found in note 9 to the financial statements. 
Following the above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP is re-appointed at the forthcoming AGM 
in October 2011.

 > keeping up to date with and being fully informed about strategic issues and commercial changes affecting the Company 
and the market in which it operates.
The terms of reference of the Committee can be found on the Company’s investor relations website, www.abcamplc.com. The terms 
of appointment of all Non-Executive Directors will be available for inspection at the forthcoming AGM in October 2011.
Succession planning
A detailed exercise was carried out during the year to review the succession plans for each of the Executive Directors, EMT members 
and key individuals reporting into them. An assessment was made of the impact on the business if particular roles were to become 
vacant and plans drawn up as to how these should be filled, on both short and long-term bases as appropriate.
Re-election of Directors
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment and to re-election thereafter at intervals 
of no more than three years. Non-Executive Directors who have served longer than nine years are subject to annual re-election. 
Notwithstanding the above rules, a minimum of one-third of the Directors must retire by rotation each year.
The names of Directors submitted for re-election at this year’s AGM are provided in the Directors’ Report on page 28 and their 
biographical details are shown on pages 22 and 23.
The Company’s detailed policies with regards to re-election of Directors are set out within its Articles of Association which are available 
for download from the Company’s investor relations website, www.abcamplc.com.
Recruitment of new Board members
The process adopted by the Committee to identify a candidate for a specific vacancy is, in the first instance, to determine whether 
any individuals known to the Board would be suitable for the role. If no candidates can be identified through this process, or if the 
Committee believes that the process would be improved by the involvement of other candidates, then an external search consultancy 
will be approached. Short-listed candidates are interviewed by all members of the Committee and other Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors as the Committee deems appropriate. Once a suitable candidate has been identified and references taken, the Chairman 
of the Committee will recommend to the Board that the Company make a formal offer of employment to the candidate.
Candidates are selected on merit against objective criteria, with consideration given to the amount of time the appointee will have 
available to devote to the job.
During the year, a review of the balance of skills and experience within the current Board structure was undertaken. The Company 
has grown significantly and rapidly over the 13 years since its inception and the existing Directors have provided ample support 
for these achievements. As the Company now enters its next phase of growth, it was concluded that it is now important to increase 
the knowledge base of the Board by appointing two new Non-Executive Directors with specific knowledge and experience of the 
life-sciences research tools sector and eCommerce trading respectively.
For the former role, Dr Tony Martin was known to members of the Committee, so no external search firm was deemed necessary and 
his appointment was recommended to the Board. 
Tony holds a PhD in Immunology and has more than 20 years’ experience in providing life-science and medical diagnostic companies 
counsel on a range of strategic, management and funding matters. He is the founder and managing partner of TMA Consultants, an 
organisation that specialises in providing business planning and interim management for biotechnology companies. Most recently he 
served as chairman of Molecular Insight Pharmaceuticals Inc., a NASDAQ quoted biopharm company specialising in new radiotherapies 
for heart disease and cancer and is currently chairman of Sphere Medical Holding plc, Wound Solutions Ltd, Phico Therapeutics Ltd

This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. 
Although not required by the AIM listing rules to provide all the information detailed below, the Directors have chosen to apply 
the principles relating to Directors’ remuneration disclosures in the Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report 
will be proposed at the AGM of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditor to report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and to state 
whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations. The report 
has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.

Remuneration Committee
The Group has a Remuneration Committee (the Committee), chaired by Peter Keen, which wherever possible follows the principles 
of the recommendations of the Code. The Committee consists of three independent Non-Executive Directors including the Company 
Chairman. None of the Committee have any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests of a material 
nature to Abcam’s business arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.

The Committee is responsible for the following matters:
 > setting the individual remuneration packages for the Chairman and the Executive Directors, within the overall remuneration policy 
determined by the Board;
 > determining targets for any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Company and to ask the Board, when appropriate, 
to seek shareholder approval for any long-term incentive arrangements;
 > ensuring that total individual remuneration packages are sufficient to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and that 
performance-related elements of remuneration form a significant proportion of the total remuneration package and are designed 
to align their interests with those of shareholders;
 > ensuring that contractual terms on termination are fair to the individual and the Company and do not have the effect of rewarding 
poor performance;
 > obtaining, reviewing and having regard to the conditions of service and remuneration levels of competitor companies;
 > being aware of, and advising on, any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Group; and
 > ensuring that all relevant statutory and/or regulatory provisions regarding disclosure of remuneration (including pensions) are fulfilled.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is a matter for the Chairman and the Executive Directors.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available for inspection on the Company’s investor relations website, www.abcamplc.com.

Remuneration Committee continued
Independent consultants were retained in the prior year to advise on remuneration policy and to benchmark the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration against that of a comparator group of companies.
Their recommendations on salary and bonus arrangements were considered and, following consultation with major shareholders, 
were implemented with effect from 1 July 2010. Awards were also made to members of the senior management, including the 
Executive Directors, under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and other equity-based incentive schemes as detailed below.
For future years the Committee will ensure that:
 > it maintains a competitive package of total compensation, commensurate with comparable packages available in similar 
companies; and
 > the interests of the Executive Directors are closely aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders through the provision  
of share-based incentives.
Where appropriate, independent advice will be sought to confirm these objectives are being met.
Remuneration policy for the Executive Directors
The Committee aims to set levels of remuneration for Executive Directors that are sufficient to attract, retain and motivate Executive 
Directors of the calibre required to deliver the business strategy. Individual remuneration packages are structured to align rewards 
with the performance of the Company and the interests of the shareholders and that are appropriate for the size and complexity 
of the Group. No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration. The main principles are to:
 > ensure that salaries are set at a market competitive level by benchmarking against appropriate external comparators;
 > support a high performance culture by rewarding performance with commensurate reward;
 > maintain an appropriate balance of fixed and performance-related pay which delivers over the short, medium and longer-term, 
with the balance becoming more long-term and more highly performance-related with seniority;
 > align long-term rewards with shareholders by taking account of measures that reflect shareholder interests; and
 > ensure that the overall package reflects market practice and takes account of levels of remuneration elsewhere in the Group.
The policy is that a substantial proportion of the package should be performance-related. The following chart illustrates the proportion 
of the remuneration package provided in 2010/11 comprising fixed and variable elements of remuneration:
 
* On-target bonus was at 52.5% of bonusable salary.
**  The value of the LTIP is based on the value of the award made in 2010/11 and assumes that the market value of the shares will be equal on the date of release to the 
value on the date of award. The on-target calculation assumes that 50% of the LTIPs will be released based on satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions.

Remuneration policy for the Executive Directors continued
The following table provides a summary of the key elements of the remuneration package:
Element Purpose Operation
Salary To provide competitive fixed remuneration that will 
attract and retain key employees and reflect their 
experience and position in the Company.
Reviewed every twelve months.
Benchmarked against appropriate 
market comparators.
Linked to individual performance contribution 
and current market conditions.
Annual bonus To incentivise achievement of annual objectives 
which support both the short and long-term strategy 
of the Company.
Maximum bonus potential is set having considered 
market levels.
Majority of the bonus is based on key elements of 
the Company’s financial performance, the balance 
being based on individual targets.
Equity-based 
incentives
To incentivise executives to achieve superior returns 
to shareholders over a three-year period. 
To retain key individuals and align interests 
with shareholders.
Share awards are made annually to senior 
executives and other senior management and 
are based on a combination of TSR and EPS 
targets over a three-year period.
Benefits To provide competitive benefits that will attract and 
retain key employees and reflect their experience 
and position in the Company.
A flexible benefits/salary sacrifice scheme is in 
place, allowing all employees, including Executive 
Directors, to choose a variety of benefits to suit 
individual needs, including pension contributions 
and various insurances.
The Company recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive Directors of other companies and that this 
can help broaden the skills and experience of a Director. Subject to confirmation that such appointments will not impair the Directors’ 
ability to perform his duties, Executive Directors are normally permitted to accept external appointments with the prior approval of the 
Board and may retain the fees for such appointments.
Basic salary
The Executive Directors’ basic salaries are reviewed at least annually by the Committee, with any revisions normally becoming effective 
on 1 July each year, taking into account individual performance, market conditions and the level of increases applicable to other employees 
in the Company. 
Salaries are benchmarked against comparable roles in companies of a similar market capitalisation and against similar roles in 
companies within the industry sector. The independent consultants’ report, which was commissioned to assist the review ahead 
of the 2010/11 financial year, concluded that the salaries of the Executive Directors had fallen below those of a comparator group of 
companies. In light of the Group’s strong performance in recent years, the need to maintain competitive packages and, after consultation 
with the Company’s major shareholders, the Committee approved salary increases to take effect from 1 July 2010 to the lower quartile 
level of the comparator group. This resulted in a realignment of Executives’ salary levels and, having regard to current market conditions, 
it has been agreed that salaries for 2011/12 will remain unchanged, however, as detailed below the maximum bonus potential has 
been increased.
The salaries for the Executive Directors for the financial years of 2011/12 and 2010/11 are as follows:
           2011/12 2010/11 
           £000 £000 
Jonathan Milner          310* 310*
Jeff liffe           220 220
Jim Warwick          232 232
*  For the 2010/11 and 2011/12 years, Jonathan Milner has waived a £100,000 increase in salary and has done so again for 2011/12. His base salary will therefore remain 
at £210,000 in 2011/12 and, as in 2010/11, his bonus arrangements and other benefits will be based on the £310,000 figure.
Executive Directors’ service contracts, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the forthcoming AGM 
in October 2011.  42 Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Annual bonus payments
The bonus payable to Executive Directors is based on the financial performance of the Group and the achievement of individual 
performance targets related to the strategic objectives for each individual. The Committee establishes the objectives that must 
be met for each financial year. The maximum bonus and the proportion paid for on-target performance are considered in the light 
of market practice for companies of a similar size and industry sector. 
For the 2010/11 year the maximum bonus was 100% of salary, with 52.5% of salary payable for on-target performance. Targets were 
based on both corporate and individual objectives. 85% of the bonus opportunity was based on corporate performance, as measured 
by a target profit figure and 15% on achievement of individual strategic objectives. No payment was due under the profit-based bonus 
if profit was less than 95% of target and the maximum payment was due at 115% of target. Due to continuing strong performance 
and progress in the year, the bonus for 2010/11 exceeded on-target levels, representing 62.7% of salary.
Following an independent review and benchmarking exercise, the Executive Directors’ salaries were increased in 2010/11 to 
lower quartile levels against a comparator group. Having regard to current market conditions, it has been agreed that salary levels 
in 2011/12 will remain unchanged and that performance will be incentivised by increasing the bonus potential from 100% to 110% 
of salary. The full bonus would be payable on the achievement of stretching EPS targets (for 77.3% of the award) and personal targets 
(for 22.7% of the award), including the successful execution of strategic initiatives. No payment will be due under the EPS-based bonus 
if EPS is less than 95% of target and the maximum payment will be due at 110% of target. The total on-target bonus will be increased 
to 57.5% of basic salary.
Equity-based incentives
Equity-based incentives are issued to the Executive Directors on a regular basis. In the period since listing on AIM, no equity-based 
incentives have been granted to Non-Executive Directors and there are no plans for any such grants in the future.
The Abcam plc 2005 Plan
The Abcam plc 2005 Plan (the Plan) was adopted prior to flotation in 2005 and amended in 2008 to make it more tax efficient 
for US-based employees. All options granted under the Plan since flotation have been based on outperformance of the FTSE AIM 
All-share index measured on the third anniversary of the date of grant. If the target is achieved, then options will be exercisable during 
the next seven years, subject to the rules of the scheme. If the target is not met at the third anniversary, then performance will be 
monitored on certain dates over the next twelve months. If the target is met on any of those dates, then the options become exercisable. 
If the target is not met on any of those dates, the options will lapse on the fourth anniversary.
In the year under review no options were granted under the Plan to the Executive Directors.
The following graph shows the performance against the FTSE AIM All-share index for the options issued since flotation which have yet 
to vest and which have not been forfeited subsequently. If all the options had crystallised at 26 August 2011 then all performance 
conditions in relation to the options would have been met. Details of these options are set out in note 32 to the financial statements.

Equity-based incentives continued
SAYE scheme
The Company has also established a non-discretionary HMRC-approved SAYE scheme in which all UK employees, including the 
Executive Directors, can participate. Under this scheme, employees contract to save any amount, up to a maximum of £250 per month, 
of their post-tax earnings for a period of either three or five years. At the time of entering the contract the Company offers the employee 
the option to acquire shares, using the money that has been saved over the life of the contract. The price at which the shares could 
be purchased is the market value of the shares on the date immediately preceding the offer, less a discount of 20%. The take-up under 
the scheme was relatively low when the most recent offer was made in 2008, since many employees were already at the allowable 
investment limits. No options were granted under the SAYE scheme in the year under review and there is no intention to grant SAYE 
options in 2011/12.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP includes performance conditions which comply with guidelines and best practice governing the grant of share-based 
incentives in a listed company, to the extent to which the Committee considers such practice to be appropriate to the Group. 
The maximum level of award (being the aggregate market value of shares subject to the award at the date of grant) that can 
be granted to an eligible employee under the LTIP in any financial year is limited to 150% of that employee’s salary.
Under the LTIP , performance share awards made to the Executive Directors in 2010/11 took the form of conditional share awards and 
are subject to achievement over three years of two separate conditions; the first condition applying to 50% of the shares subject 
to each award and the second condition applying to the remaining 50%.
The Total Shareholder Return (TSR) condition
In respect of the first 50% of each award (the TSR Awards), the number of shares that will vest will depend on the Company’s 
TSR performance as compared to a comparator group of companies (the Comparator Group):
 > where the Company’s TSR is below the 50th percentile, none of the TSR Awards will vest;
 > where the Company’s TSR is at or above the 75th percentile of the Comparator Group, all of the TSR Awards will vest; and
 > where the Company’s TSR is between the 50th and the 75th percentile, the proportion of the TSR Awards that will vest will 
be calculated on a straight-line basis from 30% at the 50th percentile and rising to 100% at the 75th percentile.
The EPS condition
In respect of the second 50% of each award (the EPS Awards), the number of shares that vest will depend on the EPS growth 
of the Company over the vesting period:
 > at an average of less than 15% growth per annum, equating to 52.1% growth over the period, none of the EPS Awards will vest;
 > at average growth per annum of 20%, equating to total growth of 72.8%, the EPS Awards will vest in full; and
 > at growth rates between these two figures, the EPS Awards will vest proportionately.
The Company regularly monitors its performance against these conditions.
The following table illustrates the percentage of TSR and EPS Awards which would have vested if the awards had crystallised 
as at 30 June 2011.

Unaudited information continued
Equity-based incentives continued
Long-Term Incentive Plan continued
The EPS condition continued
There are no companies quoted in the UK which undertake similar activities to Abcam with a similar customer base, size and growth 
profile and so even with external assistance it has become more difficult over time to construct an appropriate Comparator Group. 
Following discussion with external advisors, the Committee believes that given Abcam’s continued growth in the last few years and 
market capitalisation, it would now be more appropriate to use the FTSE 250 as the Comparator Group. Following dialogue with the 
Company’s major shareholders, the Committee will be using this new Comparator Group for the TSR Awards in 2011/12.
For the 2011/12 LTIP awards, the basis for assessment of TSR performance against the new Comparator Group will remain the same 
and the basis of vesting for the EPS Awards will also remain unchanged, including the specific targets of 15% and 20%, which the 
Committee believes have become even more challenging when compared to prior years.
SIP
Abcam operates an HMRC-approved SIP for all UK employees. Under the SIP, awards are made as follows:
Free share awards
Annual awards are made to UK-based staff, with a market value of up to £3,000 each. Awards take the form of a conditional 
entitlement to shares and will vest after three years’ continuous employment with the Company.
Partnership and matching share awards
All UK-based employees are given the opportunity to invest up to £1,500 per annum to acquire new shares in the Company at market 
value. If these shares are held for three years and the employee remains employed by the Company during that time then they will also 
receive an additional share for each share acquired.
The Abcam 2009 Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The Group operates an HMRC-approved CSOP for UK-based employees of the Company, with a maximum of £30,000 of market 
value options granted per employee. In 2010/11 options granted under the CSOP to the senior management of the Company, including 
the Executive Directors, vest on the same basis and with the same performance conditions as those granted under the LTIP and it is 
intended that this will also be the case in 2011/12.
Share options granted under the CSOP to other employees of the Group (excluding Executive Directors) vest on the same basis 
as those under the Plan, being outperformance of the FTSE AIM All-share index.
Pension contributions and other benefits
The Company operates a flexible benefits scheme for all UK-based employees; for the Executive Directors, the Company contributes 
12% of basic salary into this scheme. The employee can choose how to spend this contribution amongst the specific benefits available 
and also has the option to sacrifice an element of basic pay to make additional pension contributions into the Company’s money purchase 
pension scheme or to purchase other benefits. As a result of the salary sacrificed and used to purchase additional pension contributions, 
the Company’s National Insurance liability is reduced and the benefit of this reduction is added as an additional contribution to each employee’s 
pension fund. This amount is included within the employer’s pension contribution figures disclosed in the table of remuneration details 
on page 46.
Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of six months’ 
notice. However, it may be necessary occasionally to offer longer notice periods to new Directors. All Executive Directors currently have 
contracts which are subject to six months’ notice by either party.

The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association and 
is based on information on fees paid in similar companies and the skills and expected time commitment of the individual concerned. 
Neither the Chairman nor the Non-Executive Directors have any right to compensation on the early termination of their appointment.
In addition to the basic fees, additional fees for committee duties are paid to reflect the extra responsibilities attached to these roles. 
Since the Company’s listing on the AIM market in 2005, the Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Group’s incentive 
or share schemes and are not eligible to join the pension scheme. Nor do they receive any other benefits. The fees are reviewed in July 
of each year and fees for 2010/11 and 2009/10 are shown in the table below:

  As previously described, the Directors are remunerated through the Company’s flexible benefits scheme under which they can elect to switch basic salary into 
pension contributions and other benefits. The basic salary entitlement of each Executive Director during the year was: Jonathan Milner £210,000, Jeff liffe £220,000 
and Jim Warwick £232,000. For the 2011 financial year, Jonathan Milner waived an increase in salary of £100,000 (2010: £25,000) which would have taken his 
salary up to £310,000. For the 2010 and 2011 financial years his bonus and benefits were based on £210,000 and £310,000 respectively.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements
49
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements under 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. Under Company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 > properly select and apply accounting policies;
 > present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 > provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 > make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements differs from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
 > the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 > the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 50
We have audited the financial statements of Abcam plc for the year ended 30 June 2011 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated and parent company Statements of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and parent company Statements 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and parent company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and parent company Cash Flow Statements 
and the related notes 1 to 35. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 > the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2011 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 > the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 > the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 > the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 > certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Other matters
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006 that would have applied were the Company a quoted company.
Although not required to do so, the Directors have voluntarily chosen to make a Corporate Governance Statement detailing the extent 
of their compliance with UK Corporate Governance Code. We reviewed:
 > the Directors’ statement, contained within the Directors’ Report, in relation to going concern; 
 > the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and
 > certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration.

Overview Business review Governance Financial statements

1. General information
Abcam plc (the Company) is incorporated in the UK under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office 
is 330 Cambridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4 0FL, UK.
The Group is a producer and distributor of high quality research-grade antibodies and associated protein research tools. The Group 
operates through its parent company Abcam plc and through its wholly owned subsidiaries Abcam Inc, Abcam KK, Abcam (Hong 
Kong) Limited and MitoSciences Inc, allowing it to serve a global customer base of over 88 countries.
2. Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted and have affected the amounts 
reported in these financial statements:
Standards affecting the financial statements
IFRS 3 (2008) Business Combinations
IAS 27 (2008) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
These standards have introduced a number of changes in the accounting for business combinations when acquiring a subsidiary 
or an associate. IFRS 3 (2008) has also introduced additional disclosure requirements for acquisitions. See note 30 for more details.
Standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position
The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had 
any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions 
and arrangements.
IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners
The Interpretation provides guidance on when an entity should recognise a non-cash dividend payable, how to measure the dividend 
payable and how to account for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets distributed and the carrying amount of the 
dividend payable when the payable is settled.
The following amendments were made as part of Improvements to IFRSs (2009).
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment
IFRS 2 has been amended, following the issue of IFRS 3 (2008), to confirm that the contribution of a business on the formation of a 
joint venture and common control transactions is not within the scope of IFRS 2. The Group has not entered into such transactions 
therefore the amendment does not impact these financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 17 Leases
IAS 17 has been amended such that it may be possible to classify a lease of land as a finance lease if it meets the criteria for that 
classification under IAS 17. The Group continues to classify the lease of land and buildings as an operating lease and therefore this 
amendment does not impact these financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement
IAS 39 has been amended to state that options contracts between an acquirer and a selling shareholder to buy or sell an acquiree that 
will result in a business combination at a future acquisition date are not excluded from the scope of the standard. The Group has not 
entered into any such contracts and therefore this amendment does not impact these financial statements.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements

2. Adoption of new and revised standards continued
Standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position continued
Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement continued
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied 
in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9 (November 2009, revised October 2010)  Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement
IFRS 10 (May 2011)    Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 11 (May 2011)    Joint Arrangements
IFRS 12 (May 2011)    Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities
IFRS 13 (May 2011)    Fair Value Measurement
IAS 27 (May 2011)     Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 (May 2011)     Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
Amendments to IFRS 7 (October 2010)   Transfers of Financial Assets
Amendments to IAS 12 (December 2010)   Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets
Amendments to IFRS 1 (December 2010)   Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-Time Adopters
Improvements to IFRSs (May 2010)
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact 
on the financial statements of the Group.
3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments. 
The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand Pounds (£000) except 
when otherwise indicated. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out in the next few pages.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
made up to 30 June each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date 
that control ceases. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies 
in line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary 
is the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Business combinations continued
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that meet the recognition 
criteria under IFRS 3 (2008) are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, except that:
 > Deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured 
in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively;
 > Liabilities or equity instruments relating to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are 
measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and
 > Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale 
and Discontinued Operations are measured as per that Standard.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. Where applicable, cost is adjusted to reflect changes 
in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments. Cost also includes direct attributable costs of investment.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of 
the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is reviewed and tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods. Gains and losses on the 
disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating 
units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. 
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is 
an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount 
of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the 
other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods 
and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are despatched and title has passed.
Sales of goods that result in award credits for customers, under the Abpoints Scheme, are accounted for as multiple element revenue 
transactions and the fair value of the consideration received or receivable is allocated between the goods supplied and the award 
credits granted. The consideration allocated to the award credits is measured by reference to their fair value – the amount for which 
the award credits could be sold separately. Such consideration is not recognised as revenue at the time of the initial sale transaction 
but is deferred and recognised as revenue when the award credits are redeemed and the Group’s obligations have been fulfilled.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, 
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that 
asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Revenue derived from the Company’s conferences is recognised when the conference is held; however, it is not material. Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 62
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position 
of each Group company are expressed in Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for 
the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet 
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to the rates prevailing at the balance 
sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing 
at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:
 > exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see below under financial instruments/
hedge accounting); and
 > exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned 
nor likely to occur, which form part of the net investment in a foreign operation, and which are recognised in the foreign currency 
translation reserve and recognised in profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the results of the operations of the Company’s overseas subsidiaries, 
Abcam Inc, Abcam KK, Abcam (Hong Kong) Limited and MitoSciences Inc, are translated at the monthly average exchange rates during 
the period and their balance sheets at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the translation of 
the opening net assets and results of operations are classified as equity and recognised in the Group’s foreign currency translation reserve.
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to  
state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the nature of the 
Group’s obligations under the schemes is equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes some items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that 
are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Taxation continued
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, 
in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line 
method, on the following bases:
Office equipment, fixtures and fittings 20% per annum
Laboratory equipment 20% per annum
Computer equipment 33% per annum
Hybridomas 33% per annum
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Intangible assets
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is recognised as an asset if and only if it meets the recognition criteria set out in 
IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Payments made to acquire software, distribution rights and contract-based intangibles from third parties are capitalised at cost and 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated minimum useful lives. The minimum useful life is determined to be three years 
in the case of software, the term of the deal in the case of distribution rights and the length of the contract for contract-based intangibles.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for 
impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced 
to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct 
labour costs and an attributable portion of production overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition. Cost is calculated using the standard cost method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price 
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, 
slow moving or defective items where appropriate. Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 64
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Trade payables
Trade payables are measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments
Forward contracts are used by the Group to manage its exposure to the risk associated with the variability in cash flows in relation 
to both recognised assets or liabilities and forecast transactions.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to 
their fair value at each balance sheet date. A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative 
with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately 
unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the income 
statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 
twelve months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within twelve months. Other derivatives are presented as current 
assets or current liabilities.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain derivatives as either hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency risk 
of firm commitments (cash flow hedges).
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the 
hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is effective 
in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is included in the ‘administration and 
management expenses’ line of the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, 
in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity 
and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected 
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. In accordance with IFRS 1, IFRS 2 has been applied to all 
grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 July 2006.
Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option, SIP and LTIP . Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined 
at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on 
the Group’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value of options issued under the Group’s share option schemes is measured by the use of the Monte Carlo Simulation.
Fair value of the awards under the Group’s LTIP is measured by the use of the Monte Carlo Simulation for the TSR portion and the 
Black Scholes Model for the EPS portion.
Fair value of an equity-settled payment under the SIP is measured as the face value of the award on the date of grant.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. Charges made to the income statement in respect of share-based payments are 
credited to retained earnings.
The Group operates an employee benefit trust as part of its incentive plans for employees. All assets and liabilities of the trust are 
recorded in the balance sheet as assets and liabilities of the Company until such time as the assets are awarded to the beneficiaries. 
All income and expenditure of the trust is similarly brought into the results of the Company.
Own shares
Own equity instruments which are acquired are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the income 
statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount 
and the consideration is recognised in reserves.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as at the date of reporting the financial statements, and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenditure during the year. In preparation of the consolidated financial statements, estimates 
and assumptions have been made by the Directors concerning the fair value of share options, the estimated useful lives of fixed assets, 
accruals and provisions required, the carrying value of investments, the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the carrying value of goodwill 
and other intangible assets and other similar evaluations. Actual amounts may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of intangibles
As part of the business combination during the year, the Group acquired a contract-based intangible asset. The Group reviews the carrying 
amount of all intangible assets held at each balance sheet date and no impairment was considered necessary for this asset. However, subsequent 
to the review in the prior year of the remaining product line acquisition deals resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss, a further 
loss of £38,000 has been recognised at the balance sheet date (2010: £147,000).
Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis or more frequently when there are indications of possible 
impairment. The impairment review requires a value in use calculation of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. 
In estimating the value in use, management is required to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows attributable to the 
cash-generating unit and to choose an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The carrying 
amount of goodwill at 30 June 2011 was £2,062,000 (2010: £nil). Further details are given in note 16.
Fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments
As described in note 25, the Directors use their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not 
quoted in an active market. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied. For derivative financial instruments, 
assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. Other financial instruments are 
valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on assumptions supported, where possible, by observable market prices or rates. Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 66
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Valuation of own manufactured inventory
The standard costs used for the valuation of own manufactured inventory require a number of assumptions concerning the allocation 
of overheads. These assumptions are based primarily on management’s estimates of time spent in each relevant area of activity and 
normal levels of activity.
Provision for slow moving or defective inventory
The provision for slow moving or defective inventory is based on management’s estimation of the commercial life and shelf life 
of inventory lines. In assessing this, management takes into consideration the sales history of products and the length of time 
that they have been available for resale.
5. Income statement for the Company
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own income statement 
for the year. Abcam plc reported a profit for the year ended 30 June 2011 of £23,929,000 (2010: £20,626,000).
6. Revenue
An analysis of the Group’s revenue, all of which derives from continuing operations, is as follows:
           Year ended Year ended 
           30 June 30 June

Investment revenue         11  398 184
           83,670 71,290
7. Operating segments
Products and services from which reportable segments derive their revenues 
The Directors consider that there are no identifiable business segments that are engaged in providing individual products or services 
or a group of related products and services that are subject to risks and returns that are different to the core business. The information 
reported to the Group’s Chief Executive Officer, who is considered the chief operating decision maker, for the purposes of resource allocation 
and assessment of performance is based wholly on the overall activities of the Group. The Group has therefore determined that it has 
only one reportable segment under IFRS 8, which is ‘sales of antibodies and related products’. The Group’s revenue and results and 
assets for this one reportable segment can be determined by reference to the Group’s income statement and balance sheet.
The Group has no individual product or customer which comprises more than 10% of its revenues.

At the balance sheet date, the Group and Company had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under 
non-cancellable operating leases, all of which relate to land and buildings, which fall due as follows:

The above table reflects the committed cash payments under operating leases, rather than the expected charge to the income statement 
in the relevant periods. The effect on the income statement will differ to the above figures to the extent of the amortisation of a £1.1m lease 
incentive received on signing of a new lease in 2008/09, and also the amortisation of the rent-free period included in the same lease agreement. 
The expected charge in 2011/12 on these operating leases is expected to be £1.2m for the Group and £0.4m for the Company.

Corporation tax is calculated at 27.5% (2010: 28%) of the estimated assessable profit for the year. Taxation for other jurisdictions 
is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
In March 2011, the UK Government announced a reduction in the standard rate of UK corporation tax to 26% effective 1 April 2011 
which became substantively enacted in March 2011.

13. Tax continued
The UK Government also announced a further reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax to 25% effective 1 April 2012 
which was substantively enacted in July 2011, and has proposed further reductions by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014. 
These further tax rate reductions had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore have not been 
reflected in these financial statements.
The effect of these tax rate reductions on the deferred tax balance will be accounted for in the period in which the tax rate reductions 
are substantively enacted.
The impact of the rate reduction, which will be reflected in the next reporting period, is estimated to reduce the UK deferred tax asset 
and liability provided at 30 June 2011 by £102,000 and £17,000 respectively.
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows:

* Comparatives have been rebased to reflect the five for one share sub-division which took place on 15 November 2010.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated on the same basis as basic EPS but with a further adjustment for the weighted 
average shares in issue to reflect the effect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The number of dilutive potential ordinary shares is 
derived from the number of share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the 
Company’s ordinary shares during the year. Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 70

Goodwill has been allocated to one cash-generating unit (CGU) being the MitoSciences business acquired on 23 May 2011 (see note 30).
The Group performs an annual test for impairment or more frequently if there are any indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions considered most sensitive for 
the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and anticipated movements in selling prices and direct 
costs during the period.
Management has projected cash flows based on financial forecasts over a period of four years. No growth rate has been used in the 
extrapolation of cash flows beyond the four years. A discount rate of 11% has been estimated using pre-tax rates that reflect current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
Management has performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions mentioned above. The results of this analysis indicate that 
reasonable changes in the key assumptions would not result in the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount. 
As such, no impairment of goodwill has been recognised at the balance sheet date.

The amortisation period for the upfront licence fees and software is three years. The amortisation period for the distribution rights and 
contract-based intangibles is the term of the agreement. After reviewing the circumstances surrounding the remaining product line acquisition 
deals, it was considered that the carrying value of certain of these intangible assets was no longer supportable due to a concern over the 
security of supply of products subject to those agreements. An impairment loss of £38,000 (2010: £147,000) has been recognised 
in the year to take account of the recoverable amount of the contracts.
The contract-based intangible relates to an agreement with the University of Oregon, under which the university supplies monoclonal 
antibodies to MitoSciences, who has full rights and entitlement to commercially exploit these materials in exchange for an ongoing fee. 
The remaining amortisation period is 13 years, being the remaining term of the agreement. Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 72

Trade receivables
The average credit period taken for sales is 35.0 days (2010: 32.6 days). No interest has been charged on the receivables. 
Trade receivables are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience. 
The Group and Company have provided fully for all receivables over 90 days past due because historical experience is such that 
receivables that are past due beyond 90 days are generally not recoverable. Trade receivables between 30 days and 90 days are 
provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods determined by reference to past default experience.
Credit limits for each customer are reviewed on a monthly basis. No customer represents more than 5% of the total balance 
of trade receivables.
The analysis below shows the balances included in debtors which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group or Company 
has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. Neither the 
Group nor Company holds any collateral or other credit enhancements over these balances, nor do they have a legal right to offset 
against any amounts owed to the counterparty.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group and Company consider any change in the credit quality of the receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base 
being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance 
for doubtful debts.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so. The following is the analysis 
of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for financial reporting purposes:

The deferred tax liability of £430,000 (2010: £nil) has been recognised in relation to the acquired contract-based intangible asset as a 
result of the acquisition of MitoSciences Inc (note 30). Amounts released from this liability during the period were £3,000 (2010: £nil), 
representing the decrease of the deferred tax liability in line with amortisation charged against the carrying value of the associated 
intangible asset.

At the balance sheet date, there are no aggregate temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which 
a deferred tax liability has not been recognised (2010: £nil). No temporary differences exist in the current year as a result of a change 
to the UK tax legislation which largely exempts dividends from UK tax if received on or after 1 July 2009. The Directors believe that all 
dividends to be paid by the Company’s subsidiaries will meet the criteria for exemption from UK tax.

         8,335 6,866 7,336 6,066
Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. At 30 June 2011, the 
Group had an average of 37 days of purchases (2010: 29 days) outstanding in trade creditors (excluding accruals and deferred income). 
Most suppliers do not charge interest for the first 60 days of the invoice. The Group has financial risk management policies in place 
to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit time frame. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other 
payables approximates to their fair value.
The deferred creditor represented the earn-out payable on sales of products under a distribution agreement. The liability has now 
been fully satisfied.
25. Financial instruments
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the 
return to stakeholders. The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the equity 
holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity 
instrument are disclosed in note 3. Foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and the yield 
curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of these contracts. Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 78

* Financial liabilities at amortised cost within trade and other payables consist of trade payables, intercompany payables, other taxes and other payables.
The Directors consider there to be no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the Group’s financial assets and 
liabilities at the balance sheet date. This is because most of the financial assets and liabilities are short term.
Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value have been classified using a fair value hierarchy 
that reflects the significance of the inputs used in measuring the fair value of those instruments. The fair value hierarchy has the 
following levels:
 > Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities;
 > Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 > Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable market inputs).
The Group’s derivatives meet the definition of Level 2, as outlined above. There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year.
Risk in relation to the use of financial instruments
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group or the 
Company. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across diverse geographical areas. The Group does not 
have a significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition 
of accounts receivable and consideration is given as to whether there is any impairment in the value of any amounts owing.
The standard payment terms for receivables other than intra-group balances are 30 days. Any variation in these terms requires authorisation 
by senior management. Year-end debtor days are 35.0 days (2010: 32.6 days). All overdue debts are provided for where collectability 
is considered doubtful or the value of the debt is impaired. Objective evidence of impairment could include the Group’s past experience 
of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 35.0 days, 
as well as observable changes in international or local economic conditions.
The standard payment terms for intra-group receivables are 45 days. There is not considered to be any risk of impairment of these 
receivables unless the financial assets of the entity holding the corresponding liability are impaired. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high  
credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. Funds are split between at least two institutions.

25. Financial instruments continued
Risk in relation to the use of financial instruments continued
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
The Group enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sales of goods and services 
denominated in US Dollars, Euros and Japanese Yen.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Group’s policy is to maintain natural hedges 
where possible, by matching foreign currency revenue and expenditure. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved 
policy parameters utilising forward exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date, 
not denominated in the local functional currency, are as follows:
 Liabilities  Assets
         30 June 30 June 30 June 30 June 
         2011 2010 2011 2010 
         £000  £000  £000  £000
Euros         (179) (202) 2,493 1,944
US Dollars        (2,074) (1,144) 6,030 5,593
Japanese Yen        (49) (30) 1,794 1,279
Hong Kong Dollars        (4) — 56 55
         (2,306) (1,376) 10,373 8,871
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group’s principal functional currency is Sterling. The Group is mainly exposed to US Dollars and Euros but has an increasing 
exposure to Japanese Yen. Since opening an office in Hong Kong, the Group is also exposed to Hong Kong Dollars. This exposure 
is not considered material and hence is not included in the analysis below. 
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to an 8% increase and decrease in the Sterling exchange rate against the relevant 
foreign currencies on the Group’s profit before tax and equity. 8% represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible 
change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items 
and forward exchange contracts in the balance sheet at the end of the relevant accounting period and adjusts their translation at the 
period end for an 8% change in foreign currency rates. It does not represent the overall impact on Group profitability if the exchange 
rate sensitivity had been applied through the reporting period. A positive number indicates an increase in profit or equity.
 Yen currency impact  Euro currency impact  US Dollar currency impact
       2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 
       £000  £000  £000  £000  £000  £000
Effect of an 8% strengthening in relevant exchange rate on:
Profit or loss      — — — — — 237

Profit or loss      — — — (1) — (279)
Other equity      (478) (453) (1,532) (1,234) (922) (697)
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign exchange risk since it is limited to the 
year-end exposure and does not reflect the exposure during the year. 
Forward exchange contracts
It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated sales transactions 
out to 15 months within 30% to 80% of the exposure generated. Upon maturity of a forward exchange contract, the Group may enter 
into a new contract designated as a separate hedging relationship.
Foreign currency forward contracts are valued using quoted forward exchange rates and the yield curves derived from quoted interest 
rates matching maturities of the contracts. Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 80

Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk 
management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, continuously monitoring cash flows 
and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group and Company hold cash deposits at call or with a maturity of up to twelve months. At 30 June 2011, the average maturity 
of balances was 83 days (2010: 146 days) of fixed rate deposits not sensitive to changes in interest rates. Sufficient funds are readily 
available to the Company to meet operational requirements.
Trade payables are normally payable within 30 days of invoice and the standard payment terms for intra-group receivables are 45 days.

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
An increase of 0.25% in the average interest rate during the year would have resulted in an increase in interest received by the Group 
of £120,000 (2010: £82,000) and by the Company of £115,000 (2010: £78,000). A decrease of 0.25% in the average interest rate 
during the year would have resulted in a reduction in interest received by the Group of £120,000 (2010: £82,000) and by the Company 
of £115,000 (2010: £78,000). There would have been no effect on equity reserves.
The average cash and short-term deposits balance throughout the year has been used as the basis for the calculations. A 0.25% 
increase or decrease in interest rates represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 82

30. Acquisition of subsidiary
On 23 May 2011, the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of MitoSciences Inc for total consideration of US$6.0m 
(£3.7m). Total consideration comprised US$4.2m (£2.6m) cash and 279,521 Abcam plc ordinary shares of 0.2 pence with a fair value 
of US$1.8m (£1.1m) based on the rolling five day average price of 397.1 pence per share terminating three days prior to completion. At the 
balance sheet date a further $0.06m (£0.04m) cash consideration had been recognised as a result of adjustments made following 
the post-acquisition completion review.
MitoSciences Inc based in the USA, is recognised as one of the leading providers of mitochondrial research tools focusing on areas 
of metabolism and apoptosis. The acquisition supports the Group’s strategy of becoming the global leader in protein research tools and will 
serve to enhance the exceptional range of such products available to new and existing customers. The combined entity will be a market 
leader in mitochondrial research and will extend the Group’s manufacturing and product development capability, particularly in the 
exciting area of assay development.  Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

The goodwill of £2,062,000 arising from the acquisition represents the acquired product pipeline opportunities, expanded customer 
base and a highly knowledgeable workforce. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition-related costs totalling £202,000 are included within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the 
year ended 30 June 2011. Further acquisition-related costs of £49,000 have been incurred since the balance sheet date.
The fair value of trade and other receivables is £194,000 which includes trade receivables with a fair value of £190,000 and a gross 
contractual value of £203,000 of which £13,000 is expected to be uncollectable.
During the period from the date of acquisition to the balance sheet date, MitoSciences Inc contributed £162,000 to the Group’s 
revenue from sales to third parties and £31,000 to the Group’s profit before tax.
If MitoSciences Inc had been consolidated from 1 July 2010, Group revenues for the year would have been £84,758,000 and Group 
profit before tax £32,048,000, after amortisation of intangibles. Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 86

32. Share-based payments
Equity-settled share option scheme
The Company operates a number of share option schemes for certain employees of the Group. The share-based payments charge 
relates to option awards from the EMI scheme, Unapproved Share Option Plan, the Abcam Inc share scheme, the Abcam 2005 
share option scheme, the SAYE scheme, the Abcam Company Share Option Plan (CSOP), the LTIP and the SIP. Option grants 
under each scheme have been aggregated.
The vesting period for grants under the SAYE scheme is either three years or five years, as selected by the employee at the date of grant. 
Those options with performance criteria vest when the criteria are met. The vesting period for all other options is from one to three years. 
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee 
leaves the Group before the options vest.
The volatility of the options is based on the long-term average volatility in the share price of five quoted companies that are considered 
to have a reasonable comparability with Abcam plc. The dividend yield is based on Abcam’s actual dividend yield in the past.
The risk free rate is the yield on UK Government Gilts at each date of grant. The employee exercise multiple is based on published 
statistics for a portfolio of companies. The employee exit rate is based on management’s expectations and, in accordance with IFRS 2, 
is applied after vesting.
The Group recorded a total share-based payments expense of £1,146,000 in the year (2010: £826,000), of which £985,000 
(2010: £702,000) was included within administration and management expenses and £161,000 (2010: £124,000) was included 
within R&D expenses. Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

SIP
All UK-based employees are eligible to participate in the SIP whereby employees buy shares in the Company. These shares are called 
Partnership Shares and are held in trust on behalf of the employee. For every Partnership Share bought by the employee the Company 
will give the employee one share free of charge (Matching Shares), provided the employee remains employed by the Company for a 
period of at least three years. The employees must take their shares out of the Plan on leaving the Company and will not be entitled to 
the Matching Shares if they leave within three years of buying the Partnership Shares. In addition, the Company can also award employees 
up to a maximum of £3,000 of shares (Free Shares). There are no vesting conditions attached to the Free Shares, other than being 
continuously employed by the Company for three years from the date of grant.

For the purposes of IFRS 2 the fair value of these Matching Shares and Free Shares is determined as the market value of the shares at 
the date of grant. No valuation model is required to calculate the fair value of awards under the SIP. The fair value of an equity-based 
payment under the SIP is the face value of the award on the date of grant because the participants are entitled to receive the full value 
of the shares and there are no market-based performance conditions attached to the awards.
The Group recognised a total expense of £264,000 (2010: £195,000) related to Matching and Free Share awards in the year.
LTIP
The Company approved a new LTIP in 2008. Vesting of performance share awards made under this scheme to the executive management 
team is conditional upon achievement of two separate performance conditions. Full details of these performance conditions are shown 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. In 2010, LTIP awards were also made to members of senior management, in addition to the 
executive management team. Vesting of awards made in 2010 to senior management were conditional on market-based performance 
criteria and calculated using the Monte Carlo model. Vesting criteria for awards made in 2011 to senior management were aligned 
with those awarded to the executive management team. Awards made in 2008 were nil cost options which vest, subject to achievement 
of the relevant performance conditions, after three years, and can be exercised over the following seven years. All other awards made 
under this scheme are conditional share awards with a fixed term of three years. Save as permitted in the LTIP rules, awards lapse on 
an employee leaving the Company.

33. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes
The UK-based employees of the Company have the option to be members of a defined contribution pension scheme managed by a third 
party pension provider. For each employee who is a member of the scheme the Company will contribute a fixed percentage of each 
employee’s salary to the scheme. The only obligation of the Group with respect to this scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in the US (with the exception of MitoSciences Inc, whose retirement benefit scheme will 
be introduced in the next financial year), Japan and Hong Kong are members of state-managed retirement benefit schemes operated 
by the governments of the US, Japan and Hong Kong respectively. The subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage 
of payroll costs to the retirement benefit schemes to fund the benefits. The only obligation of the Group with respect to the retirement 
benefit schemes is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to the income statement in respect of these schemes during the year ended 30 June 2011 was £1,132,000 
(2010: £1,049,000). As at 30 June 2011 contributions of £76,000 (2010: £80,000) due in respect of the current reporting period 
had not been paid over to the schemes.
34. Events after the balance sheet date
Business combination
On 12 September 2011, the Group completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of Ascent Scientific Ltd, a specialist provider 
of biochemical tools based in the UK. Total consideration of £10m comprised of £6m cash and £4m of Abcam plc ordinary shares 
of 0.2 pence.
Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the date these financial statements were authorised for issue, the fair values of the 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are yet to be finalised. 
Founded in 2005, Ascent Scientific Ltd has focused on building a range of high quality biochemicals for use by scientific researchers. 
Their range of over 400 products includes receptor ligands, ion channel modulators, enzyme inhibitors and apoptosis and cell cycle tools. 
Products are produced both in-house and through outsourced manufacturing. Currently headquartered in Bristol, UK, the company 
employs 25 staff globally. In the year ended 31 July 2011 the company had product revenues of £1.4m.
The acquisition further extends the Group’s product portfolio and is in line with the strategy of becoming the world’s leading supplier 
of protein research tools.  Abcam plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 92

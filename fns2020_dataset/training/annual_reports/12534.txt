PREMIER TODAY
We operate through three business units; North Sea, Asia and
Middle East-Pakistan. Each has a strategy designed to maximise
the opportunities available in these highly prospective regions
of the world. Each has demonstrated marked progress against
its strategy during 2009, with a doubling in production in the
North Sea through the acquisition of Oilexco; record production
in Pakistan combined with new exploration acreage in Egypt;
and significant progress on development projects and exploration
programmes in Asia.
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
The company is set to double in size as major
development projects come on-stream in the North
Sea and Asia. These will take the company to its
stated production target of 75,000 boepd. With more
than one billion potential barrels of prospective
resources in the portfolio to be drilled in the next five
years, and ongoing work to identify new areas in
which to bring to bear Premier’s particular skills and
expertise, the company is well-placed to deliver
substantial growth into the future.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Financial and operating performance
Despite low oil and gas prices in the early part of the year, increased production, supported
by price recovery in the second half, generated sales revenues of US$621.1 million in 2009
(2008: US$655.2 million). Average production for the year rose 21 per cent to 44,200 barrels
of oil equivalent per day (boepd) (2008: 36,500 boepd) taking into account both the
Oilexco North Sea Ltd (Oilexco) acquisition and continuing strong demand in both
Singapore and Pakistan for our gas production.
Operating cash flow after tax was US$347.7 million (2008: US$352.3 million) more than
covering exploration and development investments of US$303.1 million (2008: US$217.3 million).
Two significant acquisitions were completed during the year: Oilexco for US$505 million
and Delek Energy (Vietnam) LLC (Delek) for US$72 million. These were funded by a
combination of new equity (US$252 million), an increase in bank borrowings and existing
cash resources. As a result, pro forma net debt at year-end stood at US$245.4 million (2008:
US$117.3 million – net cash).
Profits after tax were at record levels of US$113.0 million (2008: US$98.3 million) benefiting
from the acquisition of significant UK tax allowances during the year. Operating profits for
the year were US$169.7 million (2008: US$261.7 million).
Oil and gas proven and probable reserves increased to 255 million barrels of oil equivalent
(mmboe) (2008: 228 mmboe). Contingent resources are 213 mmboe (2008: 154 mmboe),
resulting in a 23 per cent increase in reserves and resources to 468 mmboe (2008: 382
mmboe). This included 60 mmboe acquired with the Oilexco acquisition in the UK.
Considerable progress was made in advancing our major development projects. The
wellhead platforms for the Chim Sáo and Gajah Baru projects in Vietnam and Indonesia
respectively are progressing well through their construction phases and the Chim Sáo jacket
will begin moving to its offshore location shortly. Development drilling will commence later
this year on both projects. Our first development project from the Oilexco portfolio, the UK
Huntington field, is also progressing well. We have a number of North Sea projects, in both
the UK and Norway, which are targeted for development approval during 2010.
Our exploration programme in 2009 delivered five successes from nine exploration and
appraisal wells. Notably, this included two successes drilled from our first two wells in
Norway and the Cá Rˆ o `ng –
Do
? -
discovery in Vietnam, which opens up a large and unexplored
area on the Vietnamese/Indonesian border. A series of successful wells on the NW Gemsa
permit in Egypt led to a profitable exit through a sale of our 10 per cent interest in the
block. Our programme of wells in Norway and in Asia continues in 2010.
“Premier offers material and profitable future
growth for shareholders through a reliable and
long-life production base, good quality projects
under development and in the pre-development
phase and an exciting exploration programme,
in areas we know well.” 03
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Our efforts to maintain the highest levels of health, safety and environmental performance
have continued, as supported by our industry leading statistics. In the International
Association of Oil and Gas Producers’ safety performance indicators report, Premier’s
drilling function was ranked number one across the industry for the lowest total recordable
injury frequency. We were also ranked in the top quartile for production operations. We
have retained our inclusion in the FTSE4Good Index.
Shareholder returns
Despite the significant volatility in equity markets and in the price of oil, Premier’s share
price increased by 12 per cent during the year, after adjusting for the rights issue completed
in May. Over the five-year period to 31 December 2009, Premier’s share price has increased
by 109 per cent.
Board change
I was delighted to take over Chairmanship of your company with effect from 15 October
2009. I would like to pay tribute to the achievements and leadership of Sir David John, who
retired after 11 years as Chairman of the company. Premier is extremely well positioned to
grow its production base, engage in further development projects and add material
reserves through exploration. The quality and potential of its asset position is a tribute to
the hard work of my predecessor and the high calibre team here at Premier.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Group strategy
Five years ago, the then new management team established a number of strategic
objectives for future growth of the business:
• Increasing our production from 33 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (kboepd)
(2005) to 50 kboepd;
• Monetising previously discovered resources through commercial negotiation and field
development;
• Adding to the portfolio of development projects and discoveries through exploration
success;
• Seeking value-adding acquisitions in core areas; and
• Creating strong regional businesses with full capability in production, development and
exploration operations.
Over the subsequent five-year period, Premier has made significant strides in meeting all
these objectives:
• 2009 production averaged 44.2 kboepd, exceeding 50 kboepd in the second half of the
year. Projects now under development are expected to add a further 25 kboepd by 2012;
• Booked 2P reserves have increased by 45 per cent and reserves and resources have
more than doubled over the five-year period;
• Premier’s Chim Sáo discoveries in Vietnam in 2006 and 2007 have been followed up with
2009 successes in Vietnam and Norway. Further drilling in Norway and Vietnam and
other exploration targets in the UK and Indonesia are included in the 2010 programme;
• Acquisitions in 2006/7 and in 2009, coinciding with periods of relatively low oil prices,
have been completed successfully in the UK, Indonesia and Vietnam; and
• The North Sea and Asia regional businesses are well-established. We are actively seeking
opportunities to extend from our Pakistan business base across the Middle East region.
“2009 was a year of important acquisitions,
increasing production, great strides in our
development projects and successful
exploration drilling. We have a busy and
exciting programme for 2010 which will
continue to build on our three growing
regional businesses.”
Simon Lockett
Chief Executive 05
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Building on the existing strategy, we expect significant further growth over the coming years:
• A production target of 75 kboepd from existing projects by 2013;
• The potential to add significant further production in the medium-term from projects
currently within the pre-development portfolio;
• An exploration programme, targeting reserve additions of 200 mmboe net to Premier,
from existing geological areas of expertise; and
• Acquisition and new venture activity which will provide future growth potential based
on existing skills within the group.
We expect to maintain a conservative balance sheet through the investment cycle,
facilitating our growth opportunities.
Regionally, our established business units have their own forward plans and strategies:
Asia
In Asia, we seek to develop the full potential for our
Natuna Sea and North Sumatra gas positions in
Indonesia and our growing presence in the Nam Con
Son Basin in Vietnam. Our well-established presence
in the region will allow us to bring relationships,
knowledge and technical skills to new business
opportunities in the area.
Middle East-Pakistan
We seek to maximise the value of our high quality
Pakistan producing gas fields, extending our technical
skills to new regional opportunities, including with our
regional joint venture partner, Emirates International
Investment Company LLC (EIIC).
North Sea and West Africa
Following the Oilexco acquisition and the successful start to our Norwegian exploration
programme, we plan to build on our existing producing asset base and operating capability
by bringing forward discovered reserves into the development portfolio and by exploiting
exploration opportunities in our core areas of the UK Central North Sea and the Norwegian
North Sea. 06

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (continued)
Neil Hawkings
Operations Director
OPERATIONS REVIEW
Production, development and reserves
A strong increase in production was achieved in 2009, principally due to the acquisition of
the Oilexco producing assets completed in May 2009. Significant progress on the
development portfolio was also achieved with both Gajah Baru in Indonesia and Chim Sáo
in Vietnam achieving final project approvals. Both projects are now in the construction
phase with expected first oil and gas in 2011. Existing producing fields, together with new
production from our development projects will keep the company on track to achieve our
75,000 boepd target in the medium-term.
In line with guidance, average working interest production for the full year was 44.2 kboepd
(2008: 36.5 kboepd) of which 7.4 kboepd came from the former Oilexco production portfolio
acquired on 21 May 2009. Also in the UK, the Kyle and Wytch Farm fields performed
strongly though the Scott field remained at 2008 levels, underperforming somewhat due to
facilities issues. Production in other areas remained steady, as strong gas demand and good
production performance were experienced in both Pakistan and Indonesia/Singapore.

Total 44,200 36,500 40,150 31,750
In the wake of the global financial crisis and the significant fall in oil prices, cost levels in the
industry also fell. The company achieved material development project cost reductions by
optimising and retendering the Chim Sáo and Gajah Baru projects. Both these projects are
now under construction with first production scheduled for 2011. Further progress on our North
Sumatra Block A project in Indonesia could not be achieved because of a delay in the
Production Sharing Contract (PSC) extension. This is expected to be resolved shortly but has
caused first gas to be delayed to 2012. Premier and its partners are working on a fast track 07

solution to develop the Huntington field in the UK, a former Oilexco asset. Floating Production, Storage
and Offtake vessel (FPSO) tenders are being evaluated, alongside tie-back options to nearby
infrastructure, with concept selection expected imminently followed by sanction in the third quarter
of 2010. First oil is targeted for 2012.
As at 31 December 2009 proven and probable reserves, on a working interest basis, based on Premier
and operator estimates were 255 mmboe (2008: 228 mmboe). These reserves comprised 32 per cent
liquids and 68 per cent gas. The equivalent volume on an entitlement basis amounted to 229 mmboe
(2008: 198 mmboe) using a price assumption of US$75 per barrel (bbl) Brent (2008: US$60/bbl Brent).
Booked reserve additions were driven principally by the acquisitions of Oilexco and Delek during the
year. Contingent resources at year-end increased by 59 mmboe to 213 mmboe (2008: 154 mmboe)
driven by resources within the acquired portfolios and by new resources added with the discoveries
at Grosbeak in Norway and Cá Rˆ o `ng –

In Asia, we are seeking to develop the full potential of our Natuna Sea and North Sumatra gas
positions in Indonesia and our growing presence in the Nam Con Son Basin in Vietnam. Our well
established presence in the region allows us to bring relationships, knowledge and technical skills
to all business opportunities in the area.
Indonesia
During 2009, the Premier-operated Natuna Sea Block A in Indonesia sold an overall average of
153 billion British thermal units per day (BBtud) (gross) from its gas export facility (up 8 per cent
on 2008), whilst the non-operated Kakap Block contributed a further 42 BBtud (gross). Liquids
production from the Block A Anoa field averaged 1,920 barrels of oil per day (bopd) (gross) and
the Kakap fields 3,540 bopd (gross). Overall, net production from Indonesia amounted to
11,050 boepd (2008: 11,700 boepd) on a working interest basis.
Significant progress has been made on the Gajah Baru project, the first of three fields to be
developed to supply additional gas to Singapore and Batam under three new gas sales agreements
(GSAs) signed in 2008 and reported previously. A second tender for the Engineering, Procurement,
Construction and Installation (EPCI) contract was completed on 16 March 2009 with resultant gross
costs savings of approximately US$100 million. Total capital expenditure for the Gajah Baru project
is forecast at around US$700 million (gross). Maximum routine gas sales will be in the order of 140
million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) and recoverable reserves from the three new fields are
expected to be 500 billion cubic feet (bcf).
Fabrication of both the wellhead platform jacket and deck continue in Batam. The project was 33
per cent complete at year-end for the construction phase, slightly ahead of schedule. Development
well drilling is scheduled to commence in October 2010 and the project remains on track to deliver
first gas on schedule in October 2011.
On the non-operated North Sumatra Block A, following approval of the Plan of Development for
the Alur Siwah, Alur Rambong and Julu Rayeu gas fields in 2008, Front End Engineering Design
(FEED) studies were completed in 2009 and work continues on optimising the project prior to EPCI
bids. Negotiation of fully-termed agreements for use of ExxonMobil facilities for transportation of
gas and liquids continued. However, the Ministerial Decree relating to the PSC extension remains
unsigned; the delay is impacting the project schedule with first gas scheduled for 2012 from Alur
Rambong and 2013 from Alur Siwah. 08
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (continued)
Vietnam
Substantial progress was made during the year with the Chim Sáo development. The lower
oil prices at the end of 2008 prompted a review of the Chim Sáo project in which the well
design and producing facilities were optimised, lowering capital expenditure estimates, and
a new FPSO supply contract was negotiated. The re-designed project has all the necessary
partner and government approvals and the prime contracts for EPCI, FPSO and the drilling
rig have been executed. At year-end, the Chim Sáo platform jacket was 83 per cent
complete and its topsides 51 per cent complete, on schedule to allow the main facilities to
be installed in summer 2010. Work on the conversion of the Lewek Emas into an FPSO
commenced in the Keppel shipyard. Development drilling is expected to start in mid-2010
and the FPSO to be installed in the second quarter of 2011. First oil production is forecast
for mid-2011. Project costs are in line with budget.
PetroVietnam Exploration Production Corporation (PVEP) exercised its back-in right for a
15 per cent equity in Block 12W in April 2009. Premier increased its interest in the block
to 53.125 per cent through the acquisition of Delek which completed in July 2009.
India
No progress has been made in 2009 with the Government of India in signing the Ratna
licence. Premier will close its representative office in Delhi in 2010.
North Sea and West Africa
The acquisition of Oilexco in May 2009 significantly increased Premier’s presence in the
North Sea, adding some 60 mmboe of reserves and resources and a capable operating
team in the UK. The acquired assets have been integrated with our existing UK portfolio
and are managed from the new Premier office in Aberdeen, which opened in December.
Premier’s office in Stavanger in Norway continues to focus on the current Norwegian
exploration programme and the integration of our significant technical database across the
North Sea. The North Sea business unit also manages our remaining assets in West Africa.
UK
Total North Sea production was 16,200 boepd for 2009 (2008: 9,300 boepd), of which 7,400
boepd was generated by the acquired Oilexco portfolio. This represents production from
the acquisition completion date of 21 May 2009, averaged over the full year.
There has been a strong underlying performance from Wytch Farm and Kyle, both of which
performed ahead of expectations in 2009. The Wytch Farm oil field contributed 2,770 boepd
net production to Premier, representing a 7 per cent reduction on last year but still producing
ahead of expectations. The operator has temporarily suspended further drilling on Wytch
Farm while the inventory of future drilling targets is upgraded. It is anticipated that investment
in drilling will resume in early 2011. Production from Kyle was 2,660 boepd (2008: 2,500
boepd) without significant field investment during 2009.
The Scott field produced 3,240 boepd (2008: 3,525 boepd) under-performing expectations
as a result of both facilities issues and the failure of the first of the four well infill programme.
Two of the successful infill wells produced relatively high levels of hydrogen sulphide (H
2
S)
and at the end of 2009 the operator was focusing on the management of H
2
S levels.
In the area surrounding the Scott field, Premier is co-operating with other interest owners to
progress the development of a series of discoveries over the Scott facility. The partners in
Bugle agreed to drill an appraisal well which was spudded in February 2010. Premier will
have a 50 per cent equity share in Block 15/23d which contains the original Bugle discovery.
The cost of the well is shared equally with the participants in the neighbouring Block
15/23c. If successful, the Bugle field will be tied back to Scott along with the smaller
Blackhorse discovery. 09
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Premier took control of the Balmoral Floating Production Vessel (FPV) following the Oilexco acquisition,
and as a result of detailed analysis three key risers were replaced during the annual shut-down
period, as part of a longer-term replacement programme which will be completed in 2011.
Further work was carried out on the Balmoral platform to increase the capacity of the gas lift, power
generation and water handling systems. The Burghley field will be tied into these facilities in the
third quarter. Premier is working on a Balmoral field infill opportunity that will be matured in 2010.
Following the acquisition of the Oilexco portfolio, Premier successfully negotiated a new contract
with Sevan Marine ASA pertaining to the Shelley field. The Sevan Voyageur FPSO was hooked up
to the field and commenced production on 6 August at an initial rate of 11,000 boepd. At year-end
the rate had dropped to around 2,200 boepd. It is anticipated that the field abandonment will
commence in 2010.
On the Huntington development project, FPSO bids were received in December and are
currently being evaluated along with tie backs to infrastructure in the vicinity. It is expected that the
development concept will be selected imminently, with project sanction occurring before year-end
2010. It is anticipated that Premier will hold the dominant equity position in the field.
Norway
On the Frøy project in Norway, the joint venture pursued two new work programmes. The first
was to re-evaluate the stand-alone development concept in the light of substantial changes in the
contractor market which occurred as a result of the financial crisis in 2008 and the related drop in oil
price and industry activity. This work indicated that a reduction in costs is feasible, and is now being
pursued in the 2010 work programme. In parallel, the joint venture entered into an area co-operation
study with Statoil and Total who also hold reserves in the area. This study was recently completed
and may lead to further consideration of tie-back opportunities and potentially a joint project for
Frøy with one or more other fields. Given successful outcomes of the work on either option, a
project sanction decision could be taken in 2010 with first oil targeted for 2013.
Mauritania
In Mauritania, 2009 production from the Chinguetti field averaged 950 boepd net to Premier (2008:
950 boepd, net), higher than earlier expectations. The operator continues to assess production
performance from the field.
The joint venture partnerships are currently in discussions with the Mauritanian Government to
extend the existing PSCs covering the remaining potential in the area. In particular, the operator is
undertaking gas development studies for the Banda and Tevet fields, including potential domestic
gas markets, with the aim of concluding this work during 2010. The operator is also re-evaluating
the Tiof field development concept options.
Middle East-Pakistan
Our Middle East-Pakistan business unit seeks to maximise the value of our high quality Pakistan
producing gas fields and to extend our technical skills to new regional opportunities, including with
our regional joint venture partner, EIIC. The joint venture company, PREMCO, is based in Abu Dhabi.
Pakistan
Average production of 15,720 boepd in 2009 surpassed the previous record average production
of 14,550 boepd in 2008 by 8 per cent. Gas demand in 2009 increased year-on-year and was
met primarily from additional production capacity at the Zamzama and Bhit/Badhra fields. This
was achieved through new infill wells, gas plant expansions and shorter maintenance periods.
The Qadirpur gas field produced an average of 4,150 boepd in 2009 (2008: 4,060 boepd). The
project to enhance Qadirpur plant capacity was commissioned in January 2009 and has resulted
in reduced maintenance downtime. A compression project was initiated in 2009 to mitigate the
declining field deliverability. Completion is expected by August 2010. As scheduled, permeate
gas of low heating value will be supplied to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd from February 2010, 10
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (continued)
for utilisation at Engro’ s newly constructed power plant near Qadirpur. This supply of permeate
gas will also reduce the quantity of gas flared at the Qadirpur field. Additional stand-by
permeate compressors will be installed at Qadirpur during 2010, to ensure continuous
supply of the permeate gas. During 2009, eight new production wells were successfully drilled
and connected to the production system (including production from the SML horizon of the
Qadirpur Deep-1 exploration well).
The Kadanwari gas field produced an average of 1,250 boepd in 2009 (2008: 1,225 boepd).
The K-14B well was completed and tied into the system in 2009, helping to sustain field
production levels in the year. As a result of successful negotiations with the government, the
Kadanwari lease expiry date was extended for a further 10 years (to 2022), whilst capping
the gas price at an equivalent price of US$8.50 per million British thermal units. The lease
extension will now allow full exploitation of the discovered gas reserves. Two additional
wells, K-19 and K-20, were also drilled during 2009. K-19 has discovered new gas and came
on-stream in March 2010 with an initial flow-rate of 22 mmscfd. K-20 did not initially flow
due to tight reservoir properties but following fracturing has shown positive results.
The Zamzama gas field produced an average of 6,890 boepd in 2009 (2008: 6,075 boepd).
After modifications, the Phase-2 plant was re-commissioned in March 2009 and achieved
production of 127 mmscfd of High Calorific Value gas. Further modifications were planned
for November 2009 to increase the capacity to 150 mmscfd, but these have been deferred
to April 2010, in order to maximise gas revenues during the high winter gas demand
period. The Zamzama North well (commissioned in March 2009), as well as two infill wells
drilled during the year, were tied into the production system, resulting in 13 per cent higher
production in 2009 than in 2008.
The Bhit/Badhra gas fields produced an average of 3,430 boepd in 2009 (2008: 3,190 boepd).
The increase was due to higher available plant capacity, as well as acceptance by the buyer
of some sales gas at slightly less than specification, in order to satisfy their own commitments
during the high gas demand in winter. The drilling of the Bhit-10 well in April 2009 and
installation of wellhead compressors on some wells allowed field deliverability to be
maintained at a high level. The Bado Jabal-1 exploration well did not encounter commercial
gas in its primary targeted zones and was side-tracked to be completed as an additional
producer in the Badhra gas field (from the existing Mughalkot reservoir). First gas was
achieved in March 2010.
FEED was completed in 2009 for the Zarghun South gas field development. First gas is
scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2011. Substantially all of Premier’s capital and operating
costs for its 3.75 per cent working interest are carried by the operator.
Egypt
First oil was achieved at the end of February 2009 from two Al Amir SE wells on the NW
Gemsa licence in Egypt. This was followed by successful appraisal of the Al Amir SE area
and the exploration discovery at Geyad on the same block. In total, the block produced an
average of 2,880 bopd (gross) for the period to 23 December 2009. On this date, Premier
completed the sale of its 10 per cent interest in the permit to Sea Dragon Energy Inc for a
final consideration of US$14.8 million, recording a profit on sale of US$8.4 million. 11

EXPLORATION REVIEW
Exploration is a fundamental part of Premier’s growth strategy with a target to add over
200 mmboe of net 2P reserves by 2015. The exploration strategy is to focus on areas
and geological themes where Premier has demonstrable skills and expertise, namely the
exploration of rift basins in Asia and the North Sea, and onshore fold-belt provinces,
as exemplified by Premier’s acreage in Pakistan and Eastern Indonesia.
In 2009, Premier participated in nine exploration and appraisal wells of which five were
successful. Successes included the new oil and gas discoveries at Cá Rˆ o `ng – Do
? -
(Vietnam)
and Grosbeak (Norway), appraising the resource base in the Bream discovery (Norway),
and step-out drilling adding reserves to the Kadanwari field (Pakistan).
Premier continues to acquire the best quality data sets in support of the exploration and appraisal
drilling campaigns, and in 2009 acquired over 1,800km² of 3D to advance the interpretations in
preparation for 2010/2011 drilling in Vietnam and Indonesia. The acquisition of Oilexco presented
an opportunity to purchase 3D data sets across the UK Central North Sea which, when combined
with the Premier data sets in Norway, have established a competitive seismic database across the
whole of the Central North Sea (UK and Norway). In support of the longer-term growth ambitions,
three new licences were acquired in the UK sector of the Central North Sea.
The 2009 exploration and appraisal programme delivered a contingent resource base of
approximately 29 mmboe, subject to further appraisal, at an overall success rate of 55 per cent.
Asia
Vietnam
Cá Rˆ o `ng –
Do
? -
(CRD), the first well drilled by Premier in Block 07/03, intersected approximately
90m net oil and gas pay within multiple stacked reservoir layers, two of which were tested
and flowed oil at a combined rate of 3,265 bopd plus 8.1 mmscfd gas, through a 48/64”
choke, with no water production.
Premier acquired and processed 1,006km² 3D seismic over the eastern third of Block 07/03
to determine future exploration and appraisal activity. Premier’s second exploration well
Cá Rˆ o `ng Vàng, located 6km from CRD, was drilled to a total depth of 3,980m BRT and
intersected the reservoir intervals on prognosis. However, wireline logging indicated the
well did not encounter significant hydrocarbons and the well was plugged and abandoned.

Exploration Director 12
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
The results of the wells are now being integrated with the 3D seismic to determine the best
location to appraise CRD and to identify future exploration drilling targets for 2011 drilling.
During 2009, Pan Pacific Petroleum (Vietnam) Pty Ltd acquired 5 per cent and PVEP acquired
10 per cent of Premier’s equity in Block 07/03 in consideration of their funding part of
Premier’s residual 30 per cent interest of the CRD well. Both transactions will require
approval from the Government of Vietnam, which was requested in early 2010.
Elsewhere in Vietnam, the Block 12W exploration acreage outside the Chim Sáo and Dua
field areas was surrendered in November 2009 at the end of the statutory exploration period,
and planning started for the acquisition of 3D seismic data on Block 104-109/05 in 2010.
Indonesia
On the Premier-operated Tuna Block, plans have been updated following the success
in Premier’s Vietnam Block 07/03 immediately to the north in the Nam Con Son Basin.
Following interpretation of the 2,400km 2D, an 850km
2
3D seismic survey was acquired
in September 2009. Interpretation of this survey is ongoing. Prospect selection will follow,
ahead of drilling two exploration wells in 2010.
On Natuna Sea Block A, a five-year exploration plan has been developed for the block,
and due to re-phasing of the nearby development drilling programme, the Anoa Deep
exploration well will now be drilled in 2011.
Elsewhere, on the Japex-operated Buton Block, the 250km 2D seismic survey begun in
2008 was completed by mid-year. Prospect maturation is currently under way and a well is
planned for the fourth quarter of 2010. On the Medco-operated North Sumatra Block A,
further work to define prospects for drilling in 2011 is ongoing.
Premier continues to review opportunities to expand its acreage position in Indonesia
and joint study activities under three agreements with Migas, the Indonesian government
authority, in North Merak (offshore Java), East Asahan (onshore Sumatra) and East
Bangkanai (onshore Kalimantan) were completed in 2009. The East Bangkanai review
has justified follow-up work to be completed in early 2010.
Philippines
In the non-operated SC43 licence, Premier relinquished its 21 per cent participating interest
and withdrew from the licence at the end of 2009.
North Sea and West Africa
UK
The Oilexco acquisition significantly increased Premier’s UK exploration portfolio to a total
of 38 blocks. From this expanded portfolio, Premier plans to drill three exploration and
appraisal wells in 2010. The Bugle North well is in licence P815, Block 15/23d, and spudded
in February. Catcher is a Paleocene amplitude play in licence P1430, Block 28/9 and is due
to spud in April. Premier is in advanced discussions with an interested party to farm down a
15 per cent equity in Block 28/9 as part of ongoing portfolio management activity. Premier
will retain a 35 per cent equity in the licence.
In early 2010 Premier secured a 50 per cent equity and operatorship of Block 22/19c
containing the Oates and Bowers prospects. Block 22/19c covers an extension of the prolific
Paleocene Forties reservoir unit, 10km south of the Huntington development. A well on the
Oates prospect will spud in June 2010.
Premier was awarded two further licences as part of the UK 25th Licence Round. The two
licences awarded were P1628, Block 29/7b near the Kyle field and P1559, Block 15/23e,
adjacent to the Scott/Telford production facilities. Block 29/7b contains the Paleocene
prospects Gladius and Scutum, whilst Block 15/23e has the Upper Jurassic Cornet and
Corniche prospects.
Premier is now looking to the UK 26th Licence Round, announced in February 2010, as an
opportunity to grow the UK exploration portfolio for future drilling campaigns in 2011 and beyond.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (continued) 13
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Norway
In 2009, Premier participated in its first two exploration and appraisal wells in Norway, both of which
were successful. The programme is continuing into 2010.
On PL407, an appraisal well on the Bream field was drilled and penetrated 18.5m net pay and
tested at a maximum flow rate of 2,516 boepd. This has provided sufficient information for the joint
venture to start development planning, and the concept screening phase was completed in 2009.
A decision on commerciality and further progression of the project will be taken in 2010. On the
nearby Premier-operated PL406 licence, preparations were advanced for the drilling of the
Gardrofa prospect in the third quarter of 2010.
On PL378, a discovery was made at Grosbeak. The well encountered oil and gas pay in the Brent
and Sognefjord formations respectively. Preliminary recoverable volumes range from 25 to 190
mmboe. The Grosbeak discovery will be appraised in the fourth quarter of 2010, and an exploration
well will be drilled to test the adjacent Gnatcatcher prospect.
Since year-end, a well on the Greater Luno prospect on PL359 encountered oil shows but has been
plugged and abandoned as a non-commercial well. On PL374S, a well on the Blåbaer prospect
proved oil in the Lower Jurassic reservoir rocks, which is being appraised with a sidetrack well.
Premier continues to evaluate options to grow the exploration portfolio in Norway and the APA
and Norway 21st Licence Rounds will be reviewed in 2010.
Congo
On the Premier-operated Marine IX licence, the Frida exploration well was drilled to a target depth
of 3,250m. Wireline logging indicated that the well did not encounter significant hydrocarbons, and
the well was plugged and abandoned. In advance of the well, Premier reduced its equity in the
block to 31.5 per cent and consequently reduced the net financial exposure in the well to US$8.4
million. The results of the Frida well are being incorporated into the existing 3D seismic database
prior to deciding whether to enter the next exploration phase in the fourth quarter of 2010.
SADR
Premier awaits resolution of sovereignty issues before pursuing exploration activities in this
prospective area. The four SADR licences currently remain in force majeure.
Middle East-Pakistan
Pakistan
The K-19 exploration step-out well was drilled in the non-operated Kadanwari lease. The well
encountered 12m of high quality net gas pay in the E-sand interval of the Lower Goru formation.
The E-sand interval tested gas at a maximum flow rate of 31 mmscfd at a flowing wellhead pressure
of 3,743 psig with a 40/64” choke. The well was tied into the system in March and is producing gas
at a rate of 22 mmscfd.
The Bado Jabal-1 exploration well was drilled in 2009 in Area A of the Badhra Block, as a
deepening to the Mughalkot reservoir development well. This 5,000m deep well identified both
Lower Goru and Chiltan target formations, but commercial quantities of gas were not encountered.
Since year-end, a well targeting the Pirkoh limestone in the Qadirpur licence has been drilled. It
reached target depth in March and is being plugged and abandoned as a dry hole.
Egypt
In the non-operated NW Gemsa licence, a well on the Geyad prospect in May encountered oil-
bearing sands in the Kareem formation and the field commenced production shortly thereafter.
The Shehab-1 prospect on the same block was dry. Due to the lack of materiality of the block to
Premier as a whole, Premier’s 10 per cent equity in the licence was sold for a consideration of
US$14.8 million in December 2009.
Egypt continues to represent a target growth area for the company, and consistent with our focus on rift
basin geology Premier successfully bid for the South Darag Block, in the Gulf of Suez, in the Egyptian
General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) 2009 Bid Round. The block is in the process of being awarded
to Premier subject to formal government approvals. A work commitment comprising seismic
reprocessing, geological and geophysical studies will be carried out during the initial exploration period. 0

Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Economic environment
The early part of 2009 was a turbulent period for the world economy, the global capital
markets and for oil and gas prices. Brent oil prices opened the year at US$35/bbl but
recovered quickly, peaking at US$79/bbl in December and averaging US$62/bbl for the year.
The crisis in the financial services industry had more far-reaching consequences and access
to capital for many smaller companies in the oil and gas sector remained challenging.
Premier was able to take advantage of its strong balance sheet and continued access
to capital to conclude successfully two material acquisitions during this period.
The sharp deterioration in the oil price environment during the second half of 2008 led
to reduced levels of activity in the industry and downward pressure on exploration and
development costs during 2009. Premier was able to capture the benefits of falling costs
in rig rates and project construction costs, and cost levels have now stabilised.
Income statement
Production levels in 2009, on a working interest basis, averaged 44,200 boepd compared to
36,500 boepd in 2008, an increase of 21 per cent. On an entitlement basis, which under the
terms of our PSCs allows for additional government take at higher oil prices, production was
40,150 boepd (2008: 31,750 boepd). Realised oil prices, before hedging, averaged
US$66.3/bbl compared with US$94.5/bbl for 2008.
Gas production averaged 156 mmscfd (2008: 148 mmscfd) during the year or approximately
61 per cent of total production. Average gas prices for the group were US$5.18 per
thousand standard cubic feet (mscf) (2008: US$6.57/mscf). Gas prices in Singapore, which
are linked to High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO) pricing, in turn closely linked to crude oil pricing,
averaged US$11.0/mscf (2008: US$15.2/mscf) for the year.
Total sales revenue from all operations was US$621.1 million (2008: US$655.2 million)
with higher production largely offsetting the decline in commodity prices. Cost of sales
was US$361.4 million (2008: US$317.6 million). Unit operating costs were higher at US$12.2
per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) (2008: US$9.5/boe) reflecting the higher than average
costs of production associated with the acquired assets in the UK North Sea.

Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Amortisation includes the effect of an impairment charge, as a result of a reserves downgrade,
of US$24.0 million in respect of the Chinguetti field in Mauritania. Underlying unit amortisation
(excluding impairment) rose to US$9.6/boe (2008: US$8.0/boe). Exploration expense and pre-
licence exploration costs amounted to US$57.0 million (2008: US$42.9 million) and US$20.3 million
(2008: US$15.8 million) respectively. Exploration expense includes all costs relating to dry holes
drilled in 2009 and the write-off of previously capitalised exploration costs relating to PSC B in
Mauritania, amounting to US$19.2 million. Net administrative costs were stable at US$18.3 million
(2008: US$17.2 million) despite our growing presence in Aberdeen, Norway and Vietnam.
In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 3 – ‘Business Combinations’,
we have included in the income statement for the year an amount of US$11.6 million, representing
the excess of fair values recorded in respect of the Oilexco North Sea Ltd (Oilexco) acquisition over
and above cost. These fair values were reviewed at year-end to reflect the additional information
which has become available concerning conditions that existed at the date of acquisition. For this
purpose, values were only allocated to assets with booked proven and probable reserves. A
deferred tax asset of US$140.8 million was also recorded on the acquisition, reflecting the future
value of UK corporation tax allowances acquired with Oilexco.
Operating profits were US$169.7 million (2008: US$261.7 million). Finance costs, net of interest
revenue and other gains were US$28.7 million (2008: US$12.4 million) reflecting the increase in
borrowings arising from our acquisition and capital investment programmes. Pre-tax profits were
US$79.9 million (2008: US$277.6 million) after charging mark to market revaluation of the group’s
hedges of US$61.1 million (2008: US$28.3 million, gain).
Current tax charges in 2009 of US$48.2 million (2008: US$192.9 million) are significantly lower due
to the utilisation of acquired tax allowances in the UK. The current tax charge has also been more
than offset by a deferred tax credit representing the value of future tax allowances in the UK. The
net tax credit is US$33.1 million (2008: US$179.3 million, charge). The additional deferred tax asset
recognised at year-end is based on a long-term oil price of US$70/bbl. US$275 million of UK tax
allowances remain unrecognised at year-end. Profit after tax is therefore a record US$113.0 million
(2008: US$98.3 million) resulting in basic earnings per share of 104.1 cents (2008: 99.0 cents, restated).
Cash flow
Cash flow from operating activities, before movements in working capital, amounted to US$453.5
million (2008: US$478.1 million). After working capital items and tax payments, cash flow from
operating activities was US$347.7 million (2008: US$352.3 million) despite the fall in oil and gas
prices. Cash flow from the Oilexco producing assets was consolidated from completion of the
acquisition on 21 May 2009.
Capital expenditure in 2009 for exploration and development activities totalled US$303.1 million
(2008: US$217.3 million).

FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
Acquisitions and disposals
The group completed two very significant acquisitions during the year and also initiated
a number of disposals of assets which were not material for our operations. On 25 March 2009,
Premier announced the acquisition of Oilexco for US$505 million. Oilexco was a company
active in the UK Central North Sea which had been placed into administration by its lending
banks on 7 January 2009. The acquisition provided the group with a significantly greater
presence in the North Sea, adding a material package of assets comprising existing
producing fields, development projects of existing discovered reserves and a portfolio of
exploration prospects, together with high quality UK operatorship capabilities. The group
funded the acquisition and associated costs by way of:
• a 4 for 9 rights issue of new Ordinary Shares at a price of 485 pence per share, raising
gross proceeds of approximately £171 million (US$252.2 million);
• new credit facilities comprising initially of a US$175 million 18-month bridge facility,
a US$225 million three-year revolving credit facility and US$63 million and £60 million
(US$97 million) three-year letter of credit facilities; and
• the groups existing cash resources.
The acquisition was completed on 21 May 2009 for a final consideration of US$500.7 million,
after certain working capital adjustments for transactions between the effective date and
completion. Total consideration, as disclosed in the financial statements, of US$574.2 million
includes US$63.0 million of cash paid by the group, which is held in trust for future
abandonment obligations, and direct acquisition costs of US$10.5 million.
On 20 July 2009, the group announced that it had completed the acquisition of Delek Energy
(Vietnam) LLC (Delek), the holding company for a 25 per cent interest in Block 12W in the
Nam Con Son Basin, offshore Vietnam. The purchase price for the interest was US$72
million in cash which after completion adjustments amounted to US$83.9 million. Future
payments of up to a total of US$10 million are contingent on the development of new fields
in Block 12W other than Chim Sáo. Following completion of the Delek acquisition and the
exercise of PetroVietnam Exploration Production Corporation’s (PVEP) back-in right to
acquire a 15 per cent interest in the PSC, Premier’s interest in the block increased from an
initial 37.5 per cent to 53.125 per cent.
On 19 August 2009, the group announced the sale of its 10 per cent non-operated interest
in the NW Gemsa licence, onshore Egypt. The licence contained the producing Al Amir
field and the 2009 discovery at Geyad. On 22 December 2009 the transaction was
completed for an adjusted price of US$14.8 million in cash.
On 19 November 2009, Premier announced the sale of its 6.45 per cent equity interest in
the Janice/James fields for a production royalty interest. The acquirer, Maersk Oil, will
assume future operating costs, capital expenditure and abandonment obligations of the
assets. The transaction was completed on 5 March 2010.
At the same time, Premier also announced that it had reached agreement for the sale of
certain UK blocks containing the Caledonia field, the Sheryl discovery and the Catcher
prospect for a consideration of US$12 million in cash and future contingent payments of
US$13 million. The acquirer failed to achieve the necessary UK regulatory approvals and the
agreement was terminated. Discussions continue with potential purchasers of the group’s
interest in the Caledonia field. 17

Cash and cash equivalents of US$250.6 million excludes an amount of £43.0 million (US$70.2 million)
held in an abandonment trust and classified in the balance sheet under trade and other receivables.
It is anticipated that this cash will be replaced by bank letters of credit following the resolution of
certain tax issues regarding the winding-up of the trust.

Long-term borrowings are made up of convertible bonds and bank debt. The bonds have a par
value of US$250 million and a final maturity date of 27 June 2014. Following the rights issue in
April 2009, the bonds carry an adjusted equity conversion price of £13.56 per share.
New credit facilities of US$550 million were arranged in connection with the acquisition of Oilexco.
During subsequent syndication and the restructuring of the 18-month bridge facility, the total facility
size was increased to US$789 million with a maturity of 31 March 2012. As at 31 December 2009,
drawn borrowings were US$353 million and issued letters of credit/bank performance bonds were
US$126 million. Undrawn borrowing facilities were US$328 million which, together with cash on
hand or held in escrow, amounted to US$649 million.
Financial risk management
Consistent with its conservative financial approach, the Board’s policy continues to be to lock in oil
and gas price floors for a portion of expected future production at a level which protects the cash
flow of the group and is consistent with the business plan. These floors are supplemented by
forward sales to meet other short-term financial objectives. Floors are purchased for cash or via
collars, funded by selling caps at a ceiling price when market conditions are considered favourable.
All transactions are matched as closely as possible with expected cash flows to the group; no
speculative transactions are undertaken.
During 2009, oil price collars for 2.5 million barrels (mmbbls) matured at a cost of US$nil (2008:
US$8.1 million). At year-end, a total of 8.3 mmbbls of Dated Brent oil were hedged via collars for
the period to end-2012 with an average floor price of US$49/bbl and an average cap of US$84/bbl.
This volume represents approximately 41 per cent of the group’s expected liquids production over
the period.
During the year, gas price collars for 120,000 metric tonnes of HSFO matured. No changes were
made to the group’s existing gas hedges during the year which cover approximately 400,000
metric tonnes, representing approximately 22 per cent of expected Indonesian gas production for
the period to June 2013. 18
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
In connection with the Oilexco acquisition, 1.3 mmbbls of oil were sold forward at an
average price of US$55.0/bbl. Subsequent to year-end a further 1 mmbbls were sold
forward at an average price of US$83.5/bbl. From 1 January 2010 therefore, forward sales
of oil amounting to 1.4 mmbbls or 20 per cent of expected 2010 liquids production were in
place with an average weighted price of US$76.0/bbl. In aggregate, cash premia of
US$12.5 million were paid during 2009 to put in place new hedges or enhance existing ones.
Premier’s gas hedging is required to be marked to market at the balance sheet date. The
aggregate valuation is a US$29.8 million liability (2008: US$2.9 million) generating
a US$26.9 million charge in the income statement.
Oil hedges have typically been incorporated within the pricing terms of physical offtake
agreements for the underlying oil production avoiding the requirement to revalue the
hedges at year-end. At the time of the Oilexco acquisition however, it was not possible
to embed new hedges within the terms of existing offtake agreements. Accordingly, a
charge of US$29.0 million is recorded in the 2009 income statement. From 1 January 2010,
following new offtake arrangements, further revaluations over the life of these hedges will
not impact the income statement, and the existing provision of US$29.0 million will be
credited to income in the years 2010 and 2011.
Premier operates and reports in US dollars. Exchange rate exposures relate only to local currency
receipts and expenditures within individual business units. Local currency requirements are
acquired on a short-term basis. The group recorded a gain of US$2.8 million on such
short-term hedging during 2009 (2008: US$2.5 million, loss).
Cash balances are invested in short-term bank deposits and AAA rated liquidity funds,
subject to Board approved limits and with a view to minimising counter-party risks.
The group undertakes a significant insurance programme to reduce the potential impact
of the physical risks associated with its exploration, development and production activities.
In addition, business interruption cover is purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from
producing fields.
Going concern
The group monitors its capital position and its liquidity risk regularly throughout the year to
ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet forecast cash requirements. Sensitivities are run
to reflect latest expectations of expenditures, forecast oil and gas prices and other negative
economic scenarios to manage the risk of funds shortfalls or covenant breaches and to
ensure the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Further details of the group funding
facilities and liquidity position are included in the financial statements and related notes.
Despite economic volatility, the directors consider that the headroom provided by the
available borrowing facilities gives them confidence that the group has adequate resources
to continue as a going concern. As a result they continue to adopt the going concern basis
in preparing the 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Business risks
Premier is an international business which has to face a variety of strategic, operational,
financial and external risks. Under these distinct classes, the company has identified certain
risks pertinent to its business including: exploration and reserve risks, loss of key human
resources, drilling and operating risks, security risk in areas of operation, costs and
availability of materials and services, economic and sovereign risks, market risk, foreign
currency risk, loss of or changes to production sharing or concession agreements, joint
venture or related agreements, and volatility of future oil and gas prices. 19
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Effective risk management is critical to achieving our strategic objectives and protecting our assets,
personnel and reputation. Premier manages its risks prudently by maintaining a balanced portfolio,
through compliance with the terms of its agreements and strict application of appropriate policies
and procedures, and through the recruitment and retention of highly skilled individuals throughout
the organisation. Further, the company has mitigated risks by focusing its activities mainly in known
hydrocarbon basins in jurisdictions that have previously established long-term oil and gas ventures
with foreign oil and gas companies, existing infrastructure of services and oil and gas transportation
facilities, and reasonable proximity to markets.
A summary of the principal risks facing the company and the way in which these risks are mitigated
is provided in this report and also on the company’s website (www.premier-oil.com).

Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
SOCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Premier is committed to applying the high ethical standards necessary to maintain our
reputation as a world-class operator in oil and gas. Our reputation for doing the right thing
enables us to access new licences, enter new countries, build lasting relationships with
the local communities and ultimately secure the licence to operate. We have policies and
procedures in place to ensure that our investment and operational decisions take appropriate
account of the impacts that may arise from our activities.
Premier carries out independent audits of its policies to ensure compliance with the requirements
of the following bodies: the Global Reporting Initiative; International Petroleum Industry
Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary
Sustainability Reporting; the Carbon Disclosure Project; FTSE4Good; and the United Nations
Global Compact (of which Premier is signatory). In 2009, areas for improvement were identified
relating to policy statements on political donations, a global pay and benefits framework, security
services and human rights, as well as aspects of community engagement including prior and
informed consultation and the existence of appropriate grievance mechanisms. Steps are being
taken to strengthen existing policy statements and our alignment with global standards.
We report below on how we have applied and delivered against our stated policies in 2009,
and we explain any areas where we have not complied.
Further details on our policies, procedures and performance reports are available on our
website (www.premier-oil.com).
Social responsibility
Corporate social responsibility policy
We recognise that we have a corporate social responsibility towards a diverse group of
stakeholders including shareholders, customers, employees, business partners, local
communities and society at large, including special interest groups that represent public interest
concerns, such as non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Our investment decisions take
account of economic, environmental and social impacts and their management. The interests
of shareholders do not necessarily take precedence over the interests of other stakeholder
groups and our business strategy is designed to promote social justice in the workplace and in
our external relationships in the countries where we operate.
In all its operations, the company will always comply with local laws and regulatory
requirements, and make representations to the relevant authorities if it believes that policies
and practices of host governments undermine our policies. We undertake environmental and
social impact assessments prior to undertaking any new investment and evaluate these
impacts regularly to ensure that they are responsibly managed on an ongoing basis. We
expect our contractors, suppliers, joint venture and alliance partners to respect our policies.
Their concurrence with the principles upheld by our policies is an important factor in our
decision to form or remain in a relationship with them.
It is our policy to support social investment, in partnership with professional social development
organisations, government agencies and local NGOs, that contribute to the sustainable
development goals of the communities and countries where we operate. It is our policy that
all our business activities will be undertaken so that they contribute to sustainable
development goals and do not detract from them.
There were no reported violations of this policy in the review period.
Human rights policy
Our human rights policy is based on the fundamental rights pronounced in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and is guided by those rights enshrined in the core labour
conventions of the International Labour Organisation. These rights are to be protected and
promoted throughout Premier’s business operations and in our relations with both business
and local community partners. The scope of our policy includes the rights of our employees –
their health and safety as well as their security arrangements and working conditions – and
the development rights of our external stakeholders, in particular local communities. 21
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Where appropriate, we will also use our legitimate influence to promote human rights outside of our
areas of operation.
There were no reported violations of this policy in the review period.
Employment and social justice in the workplace policy
We aim to provide our staff with safe working conditions as well as just and competitive conditions
and terms of employment. This means respect for the individual regardless of ethnic origin, creed,
age or gender. We are an equal opportunities employer. We try to recruit, train and promote from
within the country of operation. We respect the right of individual employees to join a legitimate
trade union and ensure that employees have access to fair grievance procedures. Through training
and appraisal, we encourage staff to develop their own professional skills to the mutual advantage
of both the individual and company.
Any employee who has a concern regarding the application of this policy can make use of the
company’s grievance policy.
All employees must be responsible for the following:
• co-operate with any measures introduced to ensure equal opportunity;
• report any suspected discriminatory acts or practices;
• not to induce or attempt to induce others to practice unlawful discrimination;
• not to victimise anyone as a result of them having reported or provided evidence of discrimination;
• not to harass, abuse or intimidate others on account of their race, creed, colour, etc.; and
• not to canvass job applicants in an attempt to discourage them from applying or taking up a post.
Where there has been a clear breach of the equal employment opportunities policy, disciplinary
procedures will follow. Serious offences will be dealt with as gross misconduct.
There were no reported violations of this policy in the review period.
Business ethics and conduct policy
Integrity, honesty and fairness are fundamental to the way we conduct our business. Bribery is
unacceptable in any form. Premier staff should avoid accepting hospitality or gifts that might
appear to place them under an obligation. All business transactions must be properly recorded
and accounted for. We expect the same ethical standards to be applied in all of our business
relationships in all areas of operation and we promote our business ethics and conduct policy
with all of our business associates.
Premier’s whistleblowing policy enables our employees, contractors and agency workers to voice
their concerns without fear of recrimination if they feel that the company or anyone working on behalf
of the company has not acted in accordance with our business ethics and conduct policy. The policy
includes the option for concerned individuals to utilise the services of an independent third party
service provider, which can be contacted confidentially and anonymously. The service is contactable
24 hours a day, seven days a week.
During 2009 there was one minor incident in Indonesia which was the subject of detailed investigation.
Health, safety, environment and security policy
We recognise our responsibility to operate with proper regard for the environment and for the health
and safety of people who may be affected, directly or indirectly, by our operations. We believe that
effective health, safety, environmental and security performance is a key objective, equal to all other
key business objectives. Our health, safety, environment and security policy requires the identification
of risks to people, local biodiversity and physical assets arising from our operations, and then to manage
these risks to levels that are as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP), in line with our legal and other
obligations and our strategy for continual improvement. It is the responsibility of every employee to
comply with this policy and to assist in its implementation. As part of our commitment to continuous
improvement, we systematically monitor our performance, including our emergency preparedness. 22

SOCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW (continued)
Occupational health and safety performance
In 2009 we continued to deliver outstanding safety performance. Our production operations
in Indonesia and our global drilling operations achieved excellent results and our recently
acquired assets in the North Sea also performed well but incurred one LTI. During this period
we conducted offshore drilling operations in Vietnam and Congo, offshore seismic surveys in
Vietnam and Indonesia, and project construction work onshore in Vietnam and Indonesia
without significant injury.
We worked 3.8 million man-hours in 2009 of which 0.25 million were in drilling. As a group we
have beaten our LTI target every year for the last five years and in 2009, with an actual
LTI/RWDC frequency of 0.55, outperformed the industry average of 1.3. We benchmark our
total recordable injury frequency performance against the 40 other companies submitting data
to the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP) and we anticipate achieving
upper quartile performance for 2009.
2009 2008 2007 2006 2005
Number of LTIs 2 13 42
Number of RWDCs – –4 –1

Total recordable injuries* 1.1 0.8 3.4 2.5 3.7
* per million man-hours worked.
We have been certified to OHSAS 18001 since 2004 for global drilling and since 2006 for
Indonesian production operations. We underwent a number of OHSAS 18001 surveillance
audits on our drilling and production operations during 2009 and we are pleased to report
that both retained their OHSAS 18001 certification. We are now working to certify the
Balmoral production facilities to this standard.
Process safety performance
Our project development teams in Vietnam and Indonesia have remained committed to
inherently safe design and continue to show tenacity in balancing safety, environmental and
production considerations with economic investment and control over operating costs.
Premier recognises that process safety requires a different management regime and in this
respect we have UK-style safety cases in place for all of our operated production facilities
worldwide. Our recent review of Anoa showed that personnel risks are better than best
practice. We conducted a similar review of our Balmoral facility in the North Sea and
confirmed that the risk levels met the UK statutory requirement. In completing these safety
case reviews we have confirmed that clear criteria have been established with which to
determine whether the safety performance standards are met, and are now verifying
performance through regular monitoring by an independent verification body.
With respect to our new development projects, Gajah Baru in Indonesia and Chim Sáo in
Vietnam, we utilise our established project safety review process to confirm that specific
process safety criteria are being met during the concept selection, design, construction,
installation and commissioning phases, and will meet our safety standards before they enter
operation. At various stages of the process, numerous technical safety studies are prepared
to evaluate all major potential process risks. The results of these studies are fed into a formal
quantitative risk assessment (QRA) which considers the prevention, detection, control,
mitigation and emergency response measures necessary to reduce risks to personnel to meet
industry best practice, and to ensure that they are ALARP . This QRA and ALARP justification,
together with the associated performance standards for all safety critical equipment, are
presented in the safety case. 23
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
We apply the same rigour to our drilling activities and conduct an independent assessment of the
condition, functionality and maintenance regime of all safety critical equipment on any rigs we contract.
Environment
We conduct an environmental impact assessment for each new known operated activity such as
drilling a well or developing a production facility. This process identifies all impacts and how they
may affect the local ecology. We then look at each impact to see whether it is significant and what
more we might reasonably do to reduce it further. We applied this process to production operations,
conducting an environmental ALARP assessment for our Anoa production operations in Indonesia.
We are planning to conduct an assessment for our newly acquired production assets in the
North Sea.
We have been ISO 14001 certified since 2004 for our global drilling operations and 2006 for
Indonesian production operations. In 2009 we retained our production certification in Indonesia, had
existing certification assigned to us on the Balmoral facility in the North Sea following acquisition, and
began the certification process for both our Indonesia and Vietnam project developments. Our global
certification in drilling was temporarily suspended due to non-compliance but was reinstated
following revisions to our management systems.
Environmental performance
We report environmental performance in line with IPIECA Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on
Voluntary Sustainability Reporting and benchmark our environmental performance by contributing
our data to an industry database compiled and published by the OGP .
Operated assets 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005
Greenhouse gases
(tonnes per thousand tonnes of production) 171 167 171 232 209
Oil spills (tonnes) 1.5 – 13.7 3.9 –
Oil in produced water (parts per million) 19 23 20 21 23
Energy use
(gigajoules per tonne of production) 1.7 2.0 1.8 1.9 1.8
Emissions
We calculate our greenhouse gas (CO
2
equivalent) emissions both for operated assets and on an
equity basis for production across our global portfolio. Up until this year our emissions came mainly
from flaring on the Anoa field in Indonesia. Our 2009 data includes emissions from our new facilities
at Balmoral from the time of acquisition in May, and also from Shelley which commenced production
in August. Despite this our operated field emissions for 2009 are in line with those reported in the
previous two years at 171 tonnes per thousand tonnes of production. This is mainly due to our efforts
to reduce flaring successfully achieving a marked reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on Anoa.
Spills and discharges
There was no significant change in the volume of produced water discharged from our Anoa
production facilities from 2008 to 2009 (477,000 tonnes), with an average concentration of oil in
produced water of 22.5 parts per million (ppm), well within the Indonesian government standard of
40 ppm. Since acquiring Balmoral we have improved oil in water discharge concentrations from
approximately 40 to 14 ppm. Our group combined oil in water discharge across our operated assets
was 19 ppm, down from 23 ppm in 2008.
In 2009 there were seven reported hydrocarbon spills to the environment across our global drilling
and production operations, all of which were minor. The total volume of spills was 1.5 tonnes.
Resource use
The main sources of energy that power our facilities are fuel gas and diesel. Our energy use has
been consistent over the last few years and remains in the range of 1.7 to 2.0 gigajoules per tonne
of production. 24

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
The role of our Board and compliance
The overall purpose of the Board is to represent the company’s owners, ensure that the company’s strategic objectives are properly
pursued and that the major business risks are actively monitored and managed. This goes beyond regulatory compliance and puts
the interests of our shareholders as the Board’s primary focus.
The company has established procedures and policies to ensure compliance with the Combined Code (the Code). The company has
complied throughout the accounting period with provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code, except where reported below. While
this is an important exercise, the Board does not believe that good governance can be defined merely in terms of compliance with
a set of rules.
The Board
The Board of Directors comprises the Chairman, Chief Executive, four other executive directors and five independent non-executive
directors. Biographical details of each, including membership of Board committees are set out in the Board of Directors section.
Details of the executive directors’ service contracts and the non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are laid out in the
Remuneration Report.
Premier is an international business which has to manage a variety of political, technical and commercial risks. It is therefore important
that the Board contains the appropriate mix of skills and experience to meet these challenges. Premier’s Board has such a mix.
Selection of suitable non-executive directors is a matter for Board approval following recommendations made by the Nomination
Committee.
The non-executive directors bring independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, performance and resources, including key
appointments and standards of conduct.
We require that our non-executive directors are free from any relationship or circumstances that could materially interfere with the
exercise of their independent judgement. The Board has determined that each of the non-executive directors, with the exception
of the Chairman, is independent.
New directors receive a full induction to the company. This consists of information covering the operations of the Board as well as
meetings with the Board, Chief Executive and other executive directors. All non-executives have direct contact with the company’s
senior executives between Board meetings and also visit the company’s operations in order to familiarise themselves with its activities
and to meet and engage with staff.
The company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in place, and details of the policy are given to new directors on
appointment.
Matters Reserved for Board Decision are laid down in writing, including the appointment of the Company Secretary who is
responsible for ensuring that Board procedures and rules are applied. A copy of the Matters Reserved for Board Decision can be
found on the company’s website (www.premier-oil.com). Formal procedures are in place to enable individual Board members to take
independent advice where appropriate.
The Board is responsible for overall group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects,
the overall group debt and equity structure and consideration of significant financing matters. The Board has continued to focus its
efforts in 2009 on strategic issues which will create shareholder value, monitoring performance against agreed objectives and
planning future business opportunities.
The Board meets at least eight times each year and in addition a regular update conference call takes place in the months when no
formal meeting is scheduled. The agenda for each Board meeting is set by the Chairman in consultation with the Chief Executive and
the Company Secretary. Board members receive a monthly report of the company’s activities which incorporates an update on
progress against objectives and the management of business risks.
Formal procedures are in place to ensure the Board’s powers of authorisation of conflicts or potential conflicts of interest of directors
are operated effectively. The Board determined that during 2009 these procedures were enforced and adhered to appropriately.
The Chairman
The Chairman’s role is part-time and he is a non-executive director. His key responsibility is the leadership of the Board, ensuring its
effectiveness on all aspects of its role and setting its agenda. Between Board meetings the Chairman is responsible for ensuring the
integrity and effectiveness of the Board/Executive relationship. This is effected through regular contact with the Chief Executive
between Board meetings, as well as contact with other Board members, shareholders, joint venture partners and host governments.
In 2009, the new Chairman visited several of the company’s overseas operations to meet local management and senior industry and
government representatives. He also met with a number of institutional investors. The Chairman and the non-executive directors
meet periodically without the executive directors present and the non-executive directors meet once a year without the Chairman.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and their responsibilities are clearly established, set out in writing and agreed
by the Board.
Mr M W Welton also chairs the board of Southern Water Services Ltd. 27
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Senior independent director
Mr J R W Orange is Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the company’s senior independent non-executive director. He is
available to shareholders who have concerns that cannot be resolved through discussion with the Chairman or Chief Executive.
Whilst Mr J R W Orange’s service on the Board exceeds the term of nine years suggested by the Code, the Board considers that as a
result of his experience, his long-term perspective of Premier’s business and his independence of spirit and objectivity of mind, his
contributions are of great value as an independent director.
Re-election of directors
In accordance with the company’s Articles of Association one third of directors retire each year, with their reappointment being
subject to the approval of shareholders. This requires directors to submit themselves for re-election at least every three years. In
addition, any non-executive director having held office for more than nine years is subject to re-election on an annual basis.
Board committees
The Board has established Audit and Risk, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. Each committee has formal terms of
reference approved by the Board which can be found on the company’s website (www.premier-oil.com). The Company Secretary
provides advice and support to the Board and all Board committees. Board committees are authorised to engage the services of
external advisers as they deem necessary.

Executive Committee
The Board has delegated the day-to-day running of the group to the Chief Executive who has established an Executive Committee to
assist him in this role. The Committee is made up of each of the executive directors and the Company Secretary. The Executive
Committee is chaired by the Chief Executive.
The responsibilities of the Executive Committee include the development of group strategy for approval by the Board, portfolio
management and the delivery of performance against the targets set by the Board. At its meetings it reviews health, safety,
environmental and security performance and operational business performance reports.
Three regional business units – North Sea and West Africa, Middle East-Pakistan and Asia – manage the geographical spread of
business in the group. Each business unit is headed by a regional business unit manager who delivers against specific strategies and
performance targets set by the Executive Committee. 28
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT (continued)
Internal control
The Board is responsible for developing, maintaining and regularly reviewing the group’s system of internal controls including those
related to financial reporting. This system is designed to meet the particular needs of the group but by their nature can only provide
reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The key procedures in the control system have been in
place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Management of business risks – This is an ongoing process, in accordance with the Turnbull guidance, that identifies, evaluates and
manages risks faced by the group. This is based on each business unit and corporate function producing a risk matrix which identifies
the key business risks, the probability of those risks occurring, their impact if they do occur and the actions being taken to manage
those risks to the desired level. Risk acceptance and reduction objectives are defined with particular attention given to safety and
environmental factors, and applied to ensure that the risks are at a level that is as low as reasonably practicable.
The directors receive assurance directly from the business units and functional management through the completion of annual
declarations confirming compliance with the group’s policies, procedures and risk management processes. These processes are
designed to manage rather than eliminate risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
Monitoring – A business management system (BMS) is in force which regulates a wide range of day-to-day activities both in the UK
and overseas offices, including environmental controls, health and safety regulations and political risks. Part of this BMS is a
documented review and assurance activity, which deals with the risk review and audit processes. The purpose of the risk review
process is to identify the significant risks to the business, rate them consistently, and ensure we have mitigating measures in place to
manage them. The purpose of the audit process is to ensure that the policies and procedures within the BMS are being adhered to.
The Group Health, Safety, Environment and Security Manager is currently accountable for the overall running of the process with the
Group Financial Controller specifically responsible for the financial aspects. However, the group has now considered it appropriate to
appoint a full-time Operational Audit and Risk Control Manager, reporting directly to the Chief Executive, who will assume
responsibility for this process. It is anticipated that this appointment will be made in the first half of 2010.
The effective operation of internal control procedures is reviewed by planned audits. In addition, audits of joint venture operations
are carried out by our joint venture partners as well as audits of our joint venture partners where they operate.
A process of business control reviews has been developed and implemented across the group. This process is designed, inter alia,
to provide assurance to the Board that the company is embedding effective risk management into its operations. The report of each
review is presented to the Audit and Risk Committee. A rolling three-year plan to cover all operations is in place.
During 2009, a number of financial control and operational reviews were carried out. All recommended actions following these
reviews are being implemented.
During 2009, the key business risks and internal control weaknesses identified were formally discussed by the Executive Committee
and the Board on a periodic basis. This process will continue during 2010.
The Board receives regular reports on any major problems that have occurred and how the risks have changed over the period under
review.
Management structure – The Board has overall responsibility for the group and there is a formal schedule of matters specifically
reserved for decision by the Board. Each executive director has been given responsibility for specific aspects of the group’s affairs.
The executive directors together with the Company Secretary constitute the Executive Committee which normally meets weekly.
Delegation of authority – Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the group as part of corporate accounting and through
an authorisation manual which sets out, inter alia, delegated authority levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures.
Quality and integrity of personnel – The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards and
subsequent training.
Financial reporting – The company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and processes that pertain to the
maintenance of financial records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and the assets or liabilities
position at a given balance sheet date. Directors, through the Audit and Risk Committee, have conducted an assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Internal Control Revised Guidance for Directors on the
Combined Code. Based on this assessment, the directors have determined that the company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective during 2009.
Budgetary process – There is a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual budget approved by the Board covering capital
expenditure, cash flow, the income statement and balance sheet. Monthly results are reported against budget, and revised forecasts
for the year are prepared regularly. Separate approval processes and limits are in place for unbudgeted expenditure items.
Investment appraisal – The group has clearly defined procedures for capital expenditure. These include authority levels, commitment
records and reporting, annual budget and detailed appraisal and review procedures. The authority of the directors is required for key
treasury matters including changes to equity and loan financing, interest rate and foreign currency policy including foreign currency
hedging, oil price hedging, cheque signatories and opening of bank accounts. Comprehensive due diligence work is carried out if a
business or an asset is to be acquired. 29
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Internal control (continued)
During 2009, the Board reviewed the group’s system of internal controls and is satisfied that all the controls in place are appropriate
to provide reasonable assurance against any material misstatement or loss. The review is conducted on a regular basis and changes
are made to internal control systems to address any new risks or exposures arising as a result of changes to the business or the
business environment.
Board performance evaluation
An evaluation of the performance of the Board, its committees, the individual directors and the Chairman, was conducted following
the appointment of the new Chairman.
The Board and committee evaluations were facilitated by the Chairman and comprised a written questionnaire and a series of one-to-
one interviews with all directors. The questionnaire and interviews covered a number of key areas including strategy, succession
planning, Board size and composition, risk management and the relationship between the Board and management. The results of
the reviews were then considered by the Chairman and discussed by the Board as a whole.
The performance of individual non-executive directors was evaluated by the Chairman, with input from the committee chairmen and
the other directors. The performance of the Chief Executive and other executive directors was evaluated by the Chairman and non-
executive directors.
The directors have concluded that, following this evaluation, the Board and its committees operate effectively and also consider that
each director is contributing effectively and demonstrates commitment to the role.
Communication with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given significant attention. Extensive information about the group’s activities is provided in the
Annual Report and Financial Statements, the Interim Report, Trading Updates and Interim Management Statements. The company
has also produced a summary review document in each of the last seven years highlighting Premier’ s capabilities and operations.
These documents are available to all shareholders. The company’ s website (www.premier-oil.com) also provides detailed information
on the group’s activities.
In accordance with current regulations, the company uses its website as its default method of publication for statutory documents to
reduce printing costs and help benefit the environment.
The company operates a process of deemed consent; shareholders are given 28 days to indicate whether they wish to continue
receiving hard copies of all statutory documents by post, before being deemed as consenting to web-based communications.
Consenting shareholders are sent notification in the post each time the company places a statutory document on its website.
All new shareholders receive hard copies of statutory documents until the next deemed consent process is undertaken.
Shareholders can request all future communications to be sent by post, or request a hard copy of a particular document which has
been published on the company’s website (www.premier-oil.com).
The company promotes the use of the online shareholder services at www.premier-oil-shares.com. On this website, shareholders are
able to access their shareholding, update their address or submit queries on their account directly to the company’s Registrars.
Shareholders also have the ability to vote online prior to the 2010 Annual General Meeting (AGM). The share portal also encourages
shareholders to register to receive communications by e-mail, rather than by post, thus further reducing the number of documents
printed and distributed. Shareholders who have registered receive an e-mail notifying them when the company has added a statutory
document to its website. For each new registration processed, the company will donate £1 to PURE the Clean Planet Trust, a UK
charity dedicated to combating climate change.
The company has posted on its website, guidelines advising shareholders of how to deal with potential scams, where shareholders
may have received unsolicited phone calls concerning investment matters, often where callers have stated they work for a subsidiary
of, or on behalf of, the company. Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at discount, or
offers of free analysis reports, as the company does not retain the services of any such business for these purposes.
There is regular dialogue with institutional investors, and the Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director, who are the directors
responsible for dealing with shareholders, ensure that other members of the Board receive full reports of these discussions. Enquiries
from individuals on matters relating to their shareholding and the business of the group are welcomed and are dealt with in a timely
manner. All shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM to discuss the progress of the group.

AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for:
• monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the company and formal announcements relating to the company’s
financial performance and reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements contained therein;
• reviewing the company’s internal financial and operational control and risk management systems, details of which are given in
the Corporate Governance Report;
• reviewing accounting policies, accounting treatments and disclosures in financial statements to ensure clarity and completeness;
• overseeing the company’s relationship with its external auditors, including making recommendations as to the appointment or
reappointment of the external auditors, reviewing their terms of engagement and monitoring their independence; and
• reviewing the effectiveness of the company’s whistleblowing procedures.
The Audit and Risk Committee comprises only non-executive directors. Its members are Messrs D C Lindsell (Chairman), J Darby,
J R W Orange and M Romieu. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. The Board considers Mr D C Lindsell and
the other members of the Committee to have the relevant commercial, financial and accounting experience to assess effectively the
complex financial reporting, risk and internal control issues relevant to the company.
The Committee engages the services of external advisers as they deem necessary in the furtherance of their duties at the company’s
expense. No external advisers materially assisted the Committee during the year.
Minutes of Committee meetings are distributed to all Board members, all of whom are invited to attend meetings since the Board
believes that the work of the Committee is increasingly important for all Board members.
The Committee is satisfied that it receives sufficient, reliable and timely information from management in order to enable it to fulfil its
responsibilities.
The Committee met five times in 2009. In January it considered accounting and reporting issues relating to the full year results in
March. In March it reviewed the full year results and annual report, and its annual assessment of the effectiveness of internal control to
enable the Board to make its statement on internal control in the Corporate Governance Report. In July it considered accounting and
reporting issues relating to the half year results, and in August it reviewed the half year results. In 2009 an additional meeting was held
in March which considered accounting issues relating to the acquisition of Oilexco. Group internal control reviews performed during
the year and any ensuing recommendations are also considered at the January and July Board meetings.
More specifically, the responsibilities of the Committee were discharged as follows:
• the Committee reviewed the risk management process designed to identify the key risks facing the group and how these risks
were being managed, and reviewed the findings from financial and operating controls reviews carried out during the year
together with progress in implementing any required improvements. It also reviewed the effectiveness of the group’s internal
controls and disclosures made in the Annual Report and Financial Statements;
• the Committee reviewed the findings from the external auditors’ audit of the 2008 financial statements and their 2009 interim
review, and the audit plan for the 2009 audit. The fee proposals for the audit and interim review were reviewed and agreed, and
the Committee reviewed the scope and fees for non-audit assignments awarded to the external auditors to satisfy itself that the
assignments concerned did not give rise to threats to the auditors’ independence and objectivity;
• the Committee met with the Finance Director and external auditors as part of the interim and final financial statements review
and approval process. The Committee considered assumptions about the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty, as
well as the most appropriate treatment and disclosure of any new or judgemental matters that may have a significant effect on
amounts in the financial statements; and
• the performance and effectiveness of the Committee was reviewed as part of the Board performance evaluation process. The
Committee was considered to be operating effectively and in accordance with the Financial Reporting Council Guidance on
Audit Committees. 31
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Internal audit
The Committee also carried out its annual review into whether it is appropriate for the company to establish an internal audit
function. The Board places great emphasis on the importance of risk management and control at all operating levels in the business
and is confident that this culture is in place. The Committee took account of the fact that the company obtains independent
confirmation of its internal controls from a variety of sources; these include joint venture and government audits and the use of
specific reviews using third-party specialists. The Committee also took account of the business controls reviews and risk management
process, more fully described in the Corporate Governance Report. The Committee concluded that while at this time there was no
need for a dedicated internal financial audit resource it is now appropriate to appoint an Operational Audit and Risk Control Manager
who will have prime responsibility for managing the operational audit and control review process. It is anticipated that this
appointment will be made in the first half of 2010.
External auditor
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) was initially appointed external auditor of the company in 2004.
The Audit and Risk Committee regularly reviews the issue of the independence of the external auditors. This review considers the
overall relationship between the auditors and the company, based on feedback from the company’s finance team and from the
auditors, and the nature and extent of non-audit services provided by the auditors, and takes account of the safeguards established
by the auditors against loss of audit independence, including rotation of the audit partner and other key members of the audit team.
Deloitte are required to confirm to the Committee that they have both the appropriate independence and objectivity to allow them
to continue to serve the members of the company. The Committee also requires the external auditor to confirm that in providing
non-audit services, it complies with Ethical Standards of the UK Auditing Practices Board. This confirmation was received for 2009.
By order of the Board
D C Lindsell
Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee
24 March 2010 32
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
COMPANY RISK FACTORS
Risk factors
Premier is an international business which has to face a variety of strategic, operational, financial and external risks.
Premier’s business, financial standing, results and reputation may be impacted by various risks. Not all of these risks are within the
company’s control and the company may be affected by risks other than those listed below.
Clear responsibility
The Board is responsible for overall group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditure projects,
corporate costs and significant financing matters and the management of risks. The Board recognises that risk is inherent across
Premier’s operations, and all activities are subject to an appropriate review to ensure that risks are identified, monitored and if
possible, managed.
Risk management process
Premier has an established business management system which includes an integrated risk management process for identifying,
evaluating and managing risks faced by the group. This is based on each business unit and corporate function producing a risk matrix
which identifies the key business risks – strategic, operational, financial and external – the probability of those risks occurring, their
impact if they do occur and the actions being taken to manage those risks to the desired level. Risk acceptance and reduction
objectives are defined with particular attention given to reducing them to as low as reasonably practicable. These risk matrices are
updated on a regular basis and made available to the Executive Committee.
Key risks facing Premier, their potential impacts and our responses are outlined below. Effective risk management is critical to
achieving our strategic objectives and protecting our assets, personnel and reputation. Premier manages its risks by maintaining a
balanced portfolio, through compliance with the terms of its agreements and application of appropriate policies and procedures and
through the recruitment and retention of skilled individuals throughout the organisation.
Key business risks
Reserve replacement
Future oil and gas production will depend on our access to new reserves through exploration, negotiations with governments and
other owners of reserves, and acquisitions. Failures in exploration or in identifying and finalising transactions to access potential
reserves could slow our oil and gas production and replacement of reserves. Premier manages these risks by proactive project
planning and milestone driven performance criteria. For exploration, effective peer reviews and thorough diligence on new areas
allow us to mitigate risk of failure.
Competition
Premier operates in a very challenging business environment and faces competition on access to exploration acreage, gas markets,
oil services and rigs, technology and processes and human resources.
Production
The delivery of Premier’s production depends on the successful development of its key projects. In developing these projects we face
numerous challenges. These include uncertain geology, availability of technology and engineering capacity, availability of skilled
resources, maintaining project schedules and managing costs, as well as technical, fiscal, regulatory, political and other conditions.
Such potential obstacles may impair our delivery of these projects and, in turn, our operational performance and financial position
(including the financial impact from failure to fulfil contractual commitments related to project delivery).
Health, safety, environment and security (HSES)
Given the range of Premier’s operated and joint venture production operations globally, our HSES risks cover a wide spectrum.
These risks include major process safety incidents; failure to comply with approved policies; effects of natural disasters and
pandemics; social unrest; civil war and terrorism; exposure to general operational hazards; personal health and safety; and crime.
The consequences of such risks materialising can be injuries, loss of life, environmental harm and disruption to business activities.
Depending on their cause and severity, they can affect Premier’s reputation, operational performance and financial position. Premier
has an effective and comprehensive HSES management system to mitigate this risk and support safe and secure execution of all
critical operating activities.
Reputation
Premier strives to be a good corporate citizen globally and has strong and positive relationships with the governments and
communities in the countries where we do business. This is important for maintaining our licence to operate and our ability to secure
new resources. Our business principles govern how Premier conducts its affairs. Failure – real or perceived – to follow these principles,
or any of the risk factors materialising, could harm our reputation, which could impact our licence to operate, financing and access to
new opportunities. 33
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Human resources
Premier’s key human resources are essential for the successful delivery of its projects and continuing operations. Loss of personnel
to competitors or our inability to attract quality human resources could affect our operational performance and growth strategy.
Premier has created salary, bonus and long-term incentive arrangements designed to incentivise loyalty and good performance.
Commodity prices
Oil and gas prices are affected by global supply of and demand for these commodities. Factors that influence these include
operational issues, natural disasters, weather, political instability or conflicts and economic conditions or actions by major oil-
exporting countries. Price fluctuations can affect our business assumptions and can impact investment decisions and financial
position. Premier manages this risk with an oil and gas hedging programme to underpin our financial strength and capacity to fund
our future developments and operations.
Financial discipline
Premier has established financial policies and processes to ensure that it is able to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and
financial capacity and to manage the level of assessed risk associated with the financial instruments. A detailed set of financial and
treasury policies and a delegation of authority manual are also in place to reasonably protect against risk of financial fraud in the group.
All major investment decisions taken consider an appropriate financial benchmark to secure against downside risk of such investments.
The group also undertakes an insurance programme to reduce the potential impact of the physical risks associated with exploration
and production activities. In addition, business interruption cover is purchased for a proportion of the cash flow from producing fields.
Cash balances are invested in short-term deposits with minimum A credit rating banks, AAA managed liquidity funds and A1/P1
commercial paper subject to Board approved limits.
Further information on financial instruments and financial risk factors can be found in note 17 in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.
Host government – political and fiscal risks
Premier operates in some countries where political, economic and social transition is taking place. Developments in politics, laws and
regulations can affect our operations and earnings. Potential developments include forced divestment of assets; limits on production
or cost recovery; import and export restrictions; international conflicts, including war; civil unrest and local security concerns that
threaten the safe operation of company facilities; price controls, tax increases and other retroactive tax claims; expropriation of property;
cancellation of contract rights; and environmental regulations. It is difficult to predict the timing or severity of these occurrences or
their potential effect. If such risks materialise they could affect the employees, reputation, operational performance and financial
position of the group.
Joint ventures and partners
Inherently, oil and gas operations globally are conducted in a joint venture environment. Many of our major projects are operated by
our partners. Our ability to influence our partners is sometimes limited, due to our small shares in major non-operated development
and production operations. Non-alignment on various strategic decisions in joint ventures may result in operational or production
inefficiencies or delay. Premier mitigates this risk by continuous and regular engagement of its partners in operated and non-
operated projects. 34
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Nomination Committee meets as and when required and comprises Messrs M W Welton (Chairman), J Darby, S C Lockett,
J R W Orange and Professor D G Roberts. Sir David John retired from the Committee on 15 October 2009. The Board considers the
membership of the Nomination Committee to be in compliance with the Combined Code.
The Committee met three times in 2009. Formal meetings are held to consider standing items of business; there is also a significant
level of ad hoc discussion between members of the Committee, particularly when a recruitment exercise is taking place.
The role of the Nomination Committee includes:
• reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and to make recommendations to the Board with regard to any
adjustments that are deemed necessary. This requires an ongoing assessment of the appropriate skills-mix required at Board
level in light of the strategy of the company in the medium-term;
• responsibility for identifying and nominating candidates, subject to Board approval, to fill Board vacancies as and when they
arise and to prepare a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment; and
• the assessment of time required to fulfil the role of Chairman, senior independent director and non-executive director, ensuring
that current members of the Board have devoted sufficient time to their duties and that any candidates have sufficient time to
undertake the roles.
During 2009, the primary work of the Committee has been the process to select a successor to Sir David John who decided to stand
down as Chairman of the Board. For this purpose, Mr J R W Orange, as senior independent non-executive director, chaired the
Committee. The process concluded with the announcement in September 2009 that Mr M W Welton would take over as Chairman
of the Board on 15 October 2009.
The Nomination Committee, together with the Board, addresses the company’s succession plans both for members of the Board and
senior management. The appointment of Mr M W Welton to the Board in June 2009 and his subsequent appointment as Chairman in
October has helped to maintain the balance of the Board in light of Sir David John’s retirement.

schemes during the year.
The AGM held in 2009 authorised the purchase by the company of up to 17,197,320 shares and this authority will remain available

abide by the terms of payment. At 31 December 2009 the group had trade creditors totalling US$56.5 million (2008: US$50.3 million).
Hedging and risk management

made in note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to various financial instruments and exposure of the
group to price, credit, liquidity and cash flow risk.
Subsequent events
There are no significant subsequent events to report.
Donations
During the year the company made charitable contributions amounting to US$33,919 (2008: US$41,578). No political contributions
were made during the year (2008: US$nil).
Significant agreements – change of control
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the company such as commercial
contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease arrangements and employees’ share plans. None of these are considered to be
significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the group as a whole.
Furthermore, the directors are not aware of any agreements between the company and its directors or employees that provide for
compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Going concern
After making enquiries and in light of the group’s available loan facilities, the group budget for 2010 and the medium-term plans, the
directors have reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. The
going concern basis for the financial statements has therefore continued to be adopted. Further details are set out in the Financial Review.
Auditors
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this Annual Report and Financial Statements confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006. A resolution
to reappoint Deloitte LLP as auditors will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.

REMUNERATION REPORT
Compliance
This report has been prepared in accordance with schedule 8 of the Companies Act 2006 and the Large and Medium-Sized
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. As required, this report is being put to shareholders at the
forthcoming AGM for an advisory vote.
The sections within this report that have been audited by Deloitte LLP are indicated.
Throughout 2009 the company complied with the provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Code) regarding
best practice on the design of performance-related remuneration.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) normally meets at least four times a year and determines the remuneration of the
executive directors and senior management. The Committee is composed entirely of non-executive directors and comprises
Mr J R W Orange, who chairs the Committee and is the company’s senior independent non-executive director, and Messrs J Darby,
D C Lindsell and Professor D G Roberts. The Board considers that the membership of the Committee is compliant with the Code
recommendations, on the basis that it considers Mr J R W Orange to be independent, notwithstanding his length of service.
Mr M W Welton, the company’ s Chairman, is not a member of the Committee, but attends meetings by invitation. Mr S C Lockett is
not a member of the Committee but attends meetings by invitation, except when his own remuneration is being discussed, to ensure
that the Chief Executive is fully aware of discussions concerning remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of its most
senior management.
No director of the company is involved in determining his own remuneration. The determination of the remuneration of the non-
executive directors is a matter reserved for Board decision.
The Committee acts within its agreed written terms of reference and complies with the relevant provisions of the Code in
implementing its remuneration policy. The terms of reference are published on the company’s website (www.premier-oil.com).
The role of the Committee includes:
• considering and determining the remuneration policy for the Chairman, executive directors and senior management;
• within this agreed policy, considering and determining the total compensation package of each executive director of the company;
• considering and advising on the general principles under which remuneration is applied to employees of the company;
• determining the quantum and performance conditions for awards to be made under the company’ s long-term incentive schemes; and
• determining the policy for pension arrangements, service agreements and termination payments to directors and senior management.
The principal focus of the Committee in 2009 has been to ensure that the remuneration packages of the senior executives are set at
levels which are sufficient to retain and attract high quality individuals in what remains a competitive market.
The Committee takes independent advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street, a leading firm of remuneration consultants, which is
appointed as an adviser to the Committee. Hewitt New Bridge Street is a trading name of Hewitt Associates Ltd who do not provide
any other services to the company. During the period under review, the Committee sought the assistance of the Chairman and the
Chief Executive on matters relating to directors’ and senior management’s performance and remuneration.

Total shareholder return (continued)
The mid-market closing price of the company’s shares at 31 December 2009 was £11.05 (31 December 2008: £9.85). The intra-day
trading price of the company’s shares during 2009 was between £5.93 and £14.33.
The report is divided into two parts:
Part A, which is not subject to audit, provides an overview of the company’s current remuneration policy for all employees including
the executive directors.
Part B, which is audited, shows how the remuneration policy has been applied to executive directors for the year under review and
contains tables detailing the directors’ emoluments for the year ended 31 December 2009, their accrued pensions and their interests
under the company’s long-term incentive arrangements.
Part A: Remuneration policy
The company’s remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages which ensure that employees are fairly and responsibly
rewarded for their contributions. The Committee supports the principle of superior remuneration for superior performance. The aim
is to provide remuneration packages which are sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the quality
required to achieve the group’s objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value. The Committee takes account of the level of
remuneration paid to all employees for comparable positions in similar companies within the industry, as well as pay and conditions
throughout the remainder of the group.
The main components of executive directors’ remuneration are basic salary, an annual performance-related cash and share bonus
scheme with a deferred element, benefits, eligibility to participate in the company’s long-term incentive schemes (and all-employee
share schemes) and pension provision. The underlying principle of the company’s remuneration policy is to find an appropriate
balance between fixed and performance-related elements. In respect of its senior management, the approach is that the greater part
of total remuneration should be delivered through performance-related incentives. These incentive schemes are designed to align
the interests of executives with those of shareholders and establish a clear link between pay and performance.
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the
company’s remuneration policy will not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible
behaviour. More generally, the Committee will ensure that the overall remuneration policy does not encourage inappropriate
operational risk.
The Committee intends to undertake a review of the company’s remuneration structure during 2010 to ensure that it continues to
support the business strategy and fairly rewards employees for their performance.
Base salary
The remuneration policy applied to executive directors is to position base salaries between the median and upper quartile for
comparable positions in similar companies within the industry. All other employees receive a competitive salary, which targets a salary
level positioned at the upper quartile for comparable positions in companies within the industry. The objective is to ensure that the
base salary, when taken together with the rest of the package, provides a competitive but performance-driven remuneration package.
The Committee believes that this positioning is appropriate given the competitive marketplace that exists within the industry in which
it operates. While salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, the performance of the company and the performance of the
individual, the Committee would not regard this element of remuneration as directly performance-related.
The salaries of the executive directors as at 1 January 2010 are as follows:
Percentage
Salary increase
Position (£) from 2009
S C Lockett Chief Executive 435,000 0.0
R A Allan Director – Asia 300,000 0.0
A R C Durrant Finance Director 320,000 0.0
N Hawkings Operations Director 300,000 0.0
A G Lodge Exploration Director 300,000 9.1
In light of the conditions in the wider economy, the Committee concluded that it was appropriate for the base salaries of the majority
of executive directors to remain unchanged for 2010. Mr A G Lodge received a salary increase in recognition of his development in
his role since appointment in April 2009. The increase of 9.1 per cent brings his salary into line with that of the Operations Director
and Director – Asia.
Base salary is supplemented by a number of additional non-pensionable incentive plans, which are designed to reward employees
for their performance against challenging corporate objectives which support the long-term growth of the company and focus
strongly on creating long-term value. Each element is discussed in detail below. 40

REMUNERATION REPORT (continued)
Annual bonus scheme
A discretionary bonus, which is non-pensionable, may be paid to all employees on the achievement of a challenging range of
corporate targets that are set by the Committee each year. The total annual bonus potential for executive directors is 100 per cent of
base salary. Other employees can earn an annual bonus payment of up to a maximum of 45 per cent of base salary.
An essential element of the company’s policy is that, in addition to being an incentive to enhance short-term performance, annual
bonuses should also operate to enhance long-term performance and be an effective recruitment and retention mechanism in a
competitive market environment. Accordingly, a proportion of all employees’ bonuses may, at the discretion of the Committee, be
paid as shares, the receipt of which is deferred for three years. For executive directors’ annual bonuses, the Committee’s policy is that
50 per cent is payable immediately in cash, and the remaining half is payable in shares and deferred for three years.
For executive directors only, the deferred element of the annual bonus is contingent upon the relevant beneficiary remaining in
employment for the three years from the date of the award, but is not dependent on any further performance-related measures.
The annual bonus scheme for the 2010 financial year has a similar structure to that of 2009 and the same maximum award level.
The performance measures for 2010 are a combination of targets relating to production and development; finance and organisation;
exploration; and health, safety, environment and security. The weighting for each target will be determined by the Committee shortly
after the publication of the 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Long-term incentives
The company currently operates an all-employee Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), a Share Incentive Plan, a Save As You Earn Scheme
for UK-based and expatriate employees only and a historical Asset and Equity Plan (AEP). The Committee also has the discretion to
grant Conditional Share Awards to new employees.
Details of the Share Incentive Plan, the Save As You Earn Scheme and the AEP are set out in Part B of this report.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The LTIP , an all-employee plan, was approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGM. The first awards were made in 2009 and will mature
at the end of 2011.
The LTIP has been introduced to meet the following objectives:
• to provide a long-term all-employee scheme, which motivates all employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total
remuneration package; and
• to create a balance between rewarding employees for delivering returns to shareholders through absolute share price growth
and rewarding operational performance through comparative TSR performance. Absolute share price performance provides
alignment between the interests of shareholders and employees via share price performance. Comparative TSR was selected as
the other performance condition as it ensures that the company has delivered competitive returns with respect to the company’s
most relevant competitors over the performance period, irrespective of general market conditions and movements in the oil price.
Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements: Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a
three-year performance period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period,
commencing at the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards. The performance
period for Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards will usually run from 1 January, but in the case of awards granted in
2009, the performance period runs from 1 June 2009 to 31 December 2011.
Equity Pool Award
The Equity Pool Award comprises a number of participation points which are allocated to employees at the discretion of the
Committee. The performance condition relating to the Equity Pool Award requires the compound annual growth in the company’s
market capitalisation over the performance period to be at least 10 per cent. If it is, a notional pool of value will be created as follows:
Notional pool of value created as a percentage of the increase
Compound annual growth in the equity pool in the compound annual growth
Less than 10 per cent 0 per cent
10 per cent 1 per cent
More than 10 per cent but less than 20 per cent Between 1 per cent and 2.5 per cent on a straight-line basis
20 per cent or more 2.5 per cent 41
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Equity Pool Award (continued)
The Committee must also be satisfied that the notional pool of value to be created on the above basis is reflective of the underlying
financial and operational performance of the company. In their assessment, the Committee will take account of, amongst other things:
• return on invested capital;
• reserve replacement;
• cash flow;
• earnings per share;
• health and safety;
and may scale back the size of the notional pool accordingly in the event that overall performance is unsatisfactory.
The notional pool of value will be allocated to employees pro-rata to the number of participation points they hold and converted into
a number of shares. The maximum benefit that an individual may receive will normally be limited to 100 per cent of salary, except
where the compound growth rate exceeds 20 per cent, in which case the Committee may increase the limit on such a proportionate
basis as it determines to be fair and reasonable.
Performance Share Award
The Performance Share Award is over a number of Ordinary Shares in the company, with a value on grant of up to 150 per cent of
salary, and is subject to a TSR performance condition.
Performance shares will not vest unless the company’s TSR performance over the three-year performance period is at least at the
median of a comparator group comprising approximately 35 listed companies in the oil and gas sector, whereby the shares subject to
the Performance Share Award will vest as follows:
TSR position of the company relative to the comparator group Percentage of shares which vest
Below median 0 per cent
Median 25 per cent
Between median and up to upper quartile Between 25 per cent and 100 per cent on a straight-line basis
Within upper quartile 100 per cent
The number of shares arising out of the vesting of an employee’ s Equity Pool Award and Performance Share Award will be aggregated
and 50 per cent of those shares will be transferred to the employee while the balance will be deferred (the Deferred Award). For
executive directors and certain other members of senior management there is a compulsory deferral period of three years, in return
for the grant of a Matching Award over further shares. For all other employees the Deferred Award will vest six months after their
deemed grant date, unless the employee elects to defer the vesting for three years in return for a grant of a Matching Award.
Matching Awards
The maximum number of shares subject to a Matching Award shall not exceed 250 per cent of the number of shares subject to the
relevant Deferred Award. Matching Awards are subject to a TSR performance condition on the same terms as those applying to the
Performance Share Awards except that full vesting will only occur if the company’s TSR relative to the comparator group is at a
position within the upper decile. If the company’s TSR is at least at the median of the comparator group then the shares subject to the
Matching Award will vest as follows:
TSR position of the company relative to the comparator group Percentage of shares which vest
Below median 0 per cent
Median 25 per cent
Between median and up to upper decile Between 25 per cent and 100 per cent on a straight-line basis
Within upper decile 100 per cent
Details of the awards granted to executive directors under this plan are set out in Part B: Outstanding long-term incentive awards. 42

Executive directors’ contracts of service
Details of the service contracts of the executive directors of the company are as follows:
Unexpired term
Contract date Notice period of contract Potential termination payment
S C Lockett 9 December 2003 12 months Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits
R A Allan 9 December 2003 12 months Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits
A R C Durrant 1 July 2005 12 months Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits
N Hawkings 23 March 2006 12 months Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits
A G Lodge 20 April 2009 12 months Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits
Save for automatic termination when each executive director becomes 60 years of age, the executive directors have rolling service
contracts and are subject to re-election by shareholders under the company’s Articles of Association and the provisions of the Code.
The service contract of each executive director may be terminated on 12 months notice in writing by either side, in accordance with
current market practice. In such an event, the compensation commitments in respect of their contracts could amount to one year’s
remuneration based on base salary, annual bonus and benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period. There are
provisions for earlier termination by the company in certain circumstances. If such circumstances were to arise, the executive director
concerned would have no claim against the company for damages or any other remedy in respect of the termination. There are no
other provisions, such as liquidated damages clauses, which expressly provide for compensation in the event of early termination or
enhanced provisions in the event of a change of control. The Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment
made to a departing executive director and would consider each case on an individual basis.
External appointments
Executive directors are entitled to accept non-executive appointments outside the company providing that the Board’s approval is
sought. Mr A R C Durrant currently holds one external non-executive directorship with Clipper Windpower plc and is entitled to retain
the fees earned connected therewith (2009: US$64,860 and 2008: US$76,300).
Non-executive directors
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment, which are all effective for a period of three years (subject to reappointment
by the members in General Meeting), all of which have a notice period of three months. Messrs M W Welton, J R W Orange and
Professor D G Roberts have letters of appointment issued on 23 September 2009. Mr J Darby has a letter of appointment dated
1 September 2007 and Messrs D C Lindsell and M Romieu have letters of appointment dated 17 January 2008.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any bonus plan or share incentive programme operated by the company and are not
entitled to pension contributions or other benefits provided by the company.
The company’s Articles of Association provide that the remuneration paid to non-executive directors is to be determined by the
Board within the limits set by the shareholders. Fees for non-executives are reviewed at least every two years, having regard to the
size of the company and the time commitments of the non-executives. The basic fee for each of the non-executive directors
(excluding the Chairman) at the end of 2009 was £40,000 per annum. An additional fee of £8,000 per annum is paid per committee
chairmanship. Mr J R W Orange is provided with an additional set fee of £2,000 per annum in respect of his position as senior
independent non-executive director. Mr M W Welton, as Chairman, receives a fee of £150,000 per annum.
As for 2009, the Board has decided not to increase the fees for non-executive directors for 2010, but has agreed to review them for 2011. 43

REMUNERATION REPORT (continued)
Pension schemes
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme in the UK, together with a defined benefit pension scheme – the
Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan (the Scheme). The Scheme was closed to new members in 1997. Mr S C Lockett is
a member of the Scheme, subject to the earnings cap. The Scheme is a funded, registered final salary scheme, which provides a
pension on broadly a fiftieths accrual basis of up to two-thirds salary at the normal pension age of 60. Benefits are actuarially reduced
on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of inflation or 5 per cent per annum.
The company has operated its own cap on pensionable earnings since April 2006, when the external cap was removed. In the
Scheme, the cap is determined at 1 January each year and, for the year to 31 December 2009, this was set at £117,600 increasing to
£123,600 for the year to 31 December 2010. In the company’s money purchase pension arrangement, the cap is determined at 6 April
each year and, for 2008/09 this was set at £117,600 increasing to £123,600 for April 2009/10.
The company has agreed to provide Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant, N Hawkings and A G Lodge with a pension
substantially as if they were contributing members of the Scheme and, in regard to service completed subsequent to their
appointment as directors, not subject to the earnings cap (‘the pension promise’). The additional value of this target pension
provision, relative to the standard terms applied to employees, is made available at the directors’ option in the form of either an
enhanced scale of pension contributions or a non-pensionable salary supplement. As at the year-end, Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan
and N Hawkings had elected to receive pension contributions. Mr A R C Durrant had elected to receive a salary supplement and
Mr A G Lodge had elected for a combination of the two. Messrs A R C Durrant and A G Lodge received a salary supplement, during
2009, of £56,736 and £22,540 respectively.
Messrs R A Allan, N Hawkings and A G Lodge are members of the company’ s group personal pension plan. During 2009, the company
contributed £24,420, £24,420 and £12,927 respectively to this plan on their behalf. In addition, in respect of the pension promise, the
company contributed £36,080 into each of Messrs R A Allan and N Hawkings’ pension funds with the group personal pension plan.
Mr S C Lockett has established his own personal pension plan, to which, during 2009, the company contributed £56,280 in regard to
the pension promise. This is in addition to the company contributions paid into the Scheme on his behalf.
The accrued pension entitlements of the directors who were members (or deemed members) of the Scheme during 2009 are as follows:

Notes:
– The amounts of accrued pension under (a) and (c) represent the accrued pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
– The transfer values under (b), (d) and (f) have been calculated in line with the Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) (Amendment) Regulations 2008
(SI 2008/1050).
– The principal reasons for the increases under (e) are changes in financial assumptions used to calculate the transfer values.
– The amounts under (f) represent the increase in value of the directors’ benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the year,
of the excess of the end-year accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits (as revalued by price inflation) less contributions by the directors.
– The values stated above correspond with the target level of final salary pension provision; in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are principally
established through individual money purchase arrangements and salary supplements. Thus, in the case of Mr A R C Durrant, who has elected not to receive
enhanced pension contributions, the company’s pension obligation will be met entirely by the payment of salary supplements.
– In addition to the current provision noted above, Mr R A Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of a prior service period with the
company between September 1986 and November 1999.
– Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions; none of the directors have elected to do so.

Annual bonus scheme
Following a review of the 2009 targets (as published in the 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements), the Committee agreed that the
health, safety, environment and security target (10 per cent of the total maximum award) had been achieved, and agreed a 75 per cent
award out of the maximum 90 per cent in relation to the finance and organisation, production and development, exploration and new
business targets. This resulted in a total award of 85 per cent of salary (42.5 per cent paid as cash and 42.5 per cent deferred in shares
as indicated above) for performance against the above targets (2008: 55 per cent of salary, paid as 27.5 per cent cash and 27.5 per
cent deferred shares).

Outstanding long-term incentive awards
Asset and Equity Plan (AEP)
The AEP expired in 2009 and the award granted in 2008, which will mature at the end of 2010, is the last award remaining under the
plan. The AEP has two plans: the asset pool and the equity pool. The asset pool is created by reference to the increase in the net
asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity pool is created by reference to the increase in equity
value per share of the company over a three-year period. In both cases, no pool is created where the compound annual growth in the
relevant measure (asset value or share price) is below 10 per cent per annum. At 10 per cent compound growth per annum, 1 per cent
of the growth becomes the pool. At 20 per cent compound growth per annum, 2.5 per cent of the growth becomes the pool. The
size of the pool increases on a straight-line basis between these two points. In addition, the vesting of awards is subject to the
Committee being satisfied that there has been satisfactory improvement in the performance of the company.
In relation to the 2006 AEP Award (based on performance over 2006, 2007 and 2008), an independent external valuation of the asset
pool was undertaken and the Committee determined the 2006 vesting level as set out in the table below. 50 per cent of the awards
were released in cash and 50 per cent in deferred shares. The minimum vesting threshold for the equity pool was not achieved,
resulting in this part of the award lapsing. 46

Details of outstanding AEP Awards
2007 award
As at 31 December 2009, a total of 5,840.67 participation points have been allocated under the 2007 award. 829.50 participation points
have been awarded since the date of grant, as time-apportioned compensatory awards to employees who have joined the company
during the three-year performance period and 491.80 participation points have been forfeited due to participants leaving the
employment of the company. The increase in aggregate participation points reflects the decision to extend the award to all global
employees. The executive directors have been allocated the following points under the 2007 award:
Number of participation points

R A Allan 210
A R C Durrant 210
N Hawkings 210
A G Lodge

46.7
Notes:
1. Mr A G Lodge received compensatory points under the 2007 award following his appointment to the Board on 20 April 2009.
The equity pool of the 2007 award was calculated by comparing the market value calculated by reference to the average share price
for the three months prior to the date of award (1 January 2007), with the market value similarly calculated to 31 December 2009.
The minimum vesting threshold for the equity pool was not achieved, resulting in this part of the award lapsing.
An independent external valuation of the asset pool of the 2007 award will take place following the publication of the year-end
results. If it is determined that the minimum vesting threshold has been achieved, half of any executive director’s vested award will be
received in shares and the other half in the form of an award of Deferred Shares, which will vest three years later.
2008 award
As at 31 December 2009, a total of 7,252.60 participation points have been allocated under the 2008 award. The executive directors
have been allocated the following points under the 2008 award:

comparator group of approximately 35 listed companies in the oil and gas sector. Full vesting requires upper decile performance.
* The number of Deferred Shares and Matching Award shares awarded under the AEP in 2007, 2008 and 2009 were adjusted following the rights issue which took
place in May 2009. The adjusted numbers are quoted in the table above. 48

Conditional Share Awards
Mr A G Lodge was awarded a Conditional Share Award equivalent in value to the shares he forfeited at his employer when he left to
join the company. This award was considered essential to induce Mr Lodge to join the company. Vesting of the awards is contingent
on Mr Lodge remaining in employment at the vesting date, but is not dependent on any further performance-related measures.

Share option schemes
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003
Options granted under the scheme are normally exercisable not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse (unless
previously exercised) on their tenth anniversary. No payment was made for the grant of an option. Options cannot normally be
exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved, however the grant to Mr N Hawkings was made as part
of his recruitment terms, where it was agreed that the grant would not be subject to any pre-vesting performance conditions. The
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 has expired.

Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2003
Under this scheme, UK-based and expatriate employees, including executive directors, with six months or more continuous service
are invited, within a period of 42 days of the announcement of the annual results, to join the scheme. Employees may save between
£5 and £250 per month, through payroll deduction for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at a
market value set at the time of invitation discounted by up to 20 per cent. The Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2003 expired in
2009 and was replaced by the Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2009, which was approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGM.

Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Under this plan, UK-based and expatriate employees, including executive directors, may make contributions to acquire shares in the
company (Partnership Shares). If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares, the company currently matches the number of
Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares (Matching Shares), on a one-for-one basis. Should an employee leave the SIP
scheme before the end of the three-year holding period they will lose the right to the Matching Shares, unless they leave due to
injury, redundancy, TUPE transfer, retirement, death or the sale of the company.
In the case of the award of Matching Shares, the company has not required performance criteria to be fulfilled, as the purpose of the
plan is to encourage all employees to become shareholders in the company.
The company invites all company employees to make contributions to acquire Partnership Shares on a monthly basis. During 2009,
Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant, N Hawkings and A G Lodge contributed the maximum monthly amount of £125 to the plan.
Shares held beneficially in this plan by the directors during the financial year were as follows:

Sourcing of shares and dilution limits
The company uses the Premier Oil plc Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy the obligations of the Executive Share Option Scheme, the AEP ,
the LTIP and the directors’ deferred bonus shares. Future obligations will be met using a combination of market purchases, financed
by the company, and newly-issued shares. The number of shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust as at 31 December 2009 was
1,077,711 (31 December 2008: 863,339). The company’s share plans comply with recommended guidelines on dilution limits.

Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements and the Remuneration Report in accordance
with applicable law and regulations.
Group financial statements
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are required
to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union (EU) and Article 4 of the International Accounting Standards (IAS) Regulation. IAS 1 – ‘Presentation of Financial
Statements’ requires that IFRS financial statements present fairly for each financial year the group’s financial position, financial
performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in
accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International
Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances,
a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, directors are also required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable
information; and
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the group’s financial position and financial performance.
Parent company financial statements
The directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent company financial statements
are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company. In preparing these financial statements, the
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the company and enable them to ensure that the parent company financial statements comply with the Companies Act
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company’s
website (www.premier-oil.com). Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:
1. the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU for the
group and UK GAAP for the company give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the
group and company, respectively, and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
2. the business review, which is incorporated into the Report of the Directors, includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the group and company and the undertakings included in the consolidation
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.

Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
General information
Premier Oil plc is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The address of the
registered office is Premier Oil plc, 4th Floor, Saltire Court, 20 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh, EH1 2EN. The principal activities of the
company and its subsidiaries (the group) are oil and gas exploration and production in the North Sea and West Africa, Asia and
Middle East-Pakistan.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars since that is the currency in which the majority of the group’s transactions are
denominated.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards were adopted by the group for the financial year
beginning 1 January 2009:
• IFRS 8 – ‘Operating Segments’. IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 – ‘Segment Reporting’. It requires a ‘management approach’ under which
segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes. This has not resulted in a
change in the number of reportable segments presented. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the
internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
• IAS 1 (revised 2007) – ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’. The revised standard requires the separate presentation of owner
and non-owner changes in equity by introducing the statement of comprehensive income. The statement of total recognised
income and expense is no longer presented. Whenever there is a restatement or reclassification, an additional balance sheet, as
at the beginning of the earliest period presented, will be required to be published. There was no effect on the group’s reported
income or net assets as a result of the adoption of this revised standard.
• IAS 23 (revised 2007) – ‘Borrowing Costs’. The amended standard requires borrowing costs related to the acquisition,
construction or production of a qualifying asset to be capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs should
be expensed as incurred. The adoption of this standard has not had any impact on the accounting policies applied by the group.
• Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments (Amendments to IFRS 7 – ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’). The
amendments to IFRS 7 expand the disclosures required in respect of fair value measurements and liquidity risk. The group has
elected not to provide comparative information for these expanded disclosures in the current year in accordance with the
transitional reliefs offered in these amendments.
• ‘Classification of Rights Issues – Amendment to IAS 32’. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after
1 February 2010, with early adoption permitted. The group has elected to adopt the amendment in advance of the effective
date and, as required by IAS 8 – ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’, has applied the amendment
retrospectively. The amendment requires that rights issues, options or warrants to acquire a fixed number of the entity’s own
equity instruments for a fixed amount of any currency are equity instruments if the entity offers the rights issues, options or
warrants pro rata to all of its existing owners of the same class of its own non-derivative equity instruments. The offer of rights by
Premier Oil plc to its shareholders on 25 March 2009 was accounted for as an equity instrument, as required by the amendment,
in the consolidated financial statements of the group.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the group has not applied the following standards and interpretations
which are in issue but not yet effective:
• IFRS 1 (amended)/IAS 27 (amended) – ‘Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate’
• IFRS 3 (revised 2008) – ‘Business Combinations’
• IAS 27 (revised 2008) – ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’
• IAS 28 (revised 2008) – ‘Investments in Associates’
• IFRIC 17: ‘Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners’
• Improvements to IFRSs (April 2009)
The directors do not expect that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on
the financial statements of the group.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as endorsed by the Council of the European Union.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of financial instruments and
certain oil and gas properties at the transition date to IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Further information relating to the going concern
assumption is provided in the Report of the Directors.
The principle accounting policies adopted are set out on the following pages.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 52
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial
and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess/deficiency of the cost of acquisition over/below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as
goodwill/excess of fair value over cost. The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values of
the assets and liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement from the effective date of
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with
those used by other members of the group.
All significant inter-company transactions and balances between group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Interest in associates
An associate is an entity in which the group has a long-term equity interest and over which it has significant influence, but not control,
through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Interests in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the group’s share of the net
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Any excess/deficiency of the cost of acquisition
over/below the group’s share of the net fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the associate at the
date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill/excess of fair value over cost.
Where a group entity transacts with an associate of the group, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the group’s
interest in the relevant associate.
Interest in joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to
joint control.
Where a group company undertakes its activities under joint venture arrangements directly, the group’s share of jointly controlled
assets and any liabilities incurred jointly with other venturers are recognised in the financial statements of the relevant company and
classified according to their nature.
Liabilities and expenses incurred directly in respect of interests in jointly controlled assets are accounted for on an accrual basis.
Income from the sale or use of the group’s share of the output of jointly controlled assets, and its share of joint venture expenses,
are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transactions will flow to/from the group and their
amount can be measured reliably.
Joint venture arrangements which involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to
as jointly controlled entities. The group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using proportionate consolidation – the
group’s share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of jointly controlled entities are combined with the equivalent items in the
consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Where the group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the group’s
interest in the joint venture.
Sales revenue and other income
Sales of petroleum production are recognised when goods are delivered or the title has passed to the customer.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
Oil and gas assets
The company applies the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation (E&E) costs, having regard to the
requirements of IFRS 6 –’Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’.
(a) Exploration and evaluation assets
Under the successful efforts method of accounting, all licence acquisition, exploration and appraisal costs are initially capitalised
in well, field or specific exploration cost centres as appropriate, pending determination. Expenditure incurred during the various
exploration and appraisal phases is then written off unless commercial reserves have been established or the determination
process has not been completed. 53
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Oil and gas assets (continued)
Pre-licence costs
Costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area are expensed directly to the income statement as they
are incurred.
Exploration and evaluation costs
Costs of E&E are initially capitalised as E&E assets. Payments to acquire the legal right to explore, costs of technical services and
studies, seismic acquisition, exploratory drilling and testing are capitalised as intangible E&E assets.
Tangible assets used in E&E activities (such as the company’s vehicles, drilling rigs, seismic equipment and other property, plant
and equipment used by the company’s exploration function) are classified as property, plant and equipment. However, to the
extent that such a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that consumption is
recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset. Such intangible costs include directly attributable overhead, including the
depreciation of property, plant and equipment utilised in E&E activities, together with the cost of other materials consumed
during the exploration and evaluation phases.
E&E costs are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities.
Treatment of E&E assets at conclusion of appraisal activities
Intangible E&E assets related to each exploration licence/prospect are carried forward, until the existence (or otherwise) of
commercial reserves has been determined subject to certain limitations including review for indications of impairment. If
commercial reserves have been discovered, the carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant E&E assets, is then
reclassified as development and production assets. If, however, commercial reserves have not been found, the capitalised costs
are charged to expense after conclusion of appraisal activities.
(b) Development and production assets
Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the
commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding
commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets, as outlined in accounting policy (a) above.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly
attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Depreciation of producing assets
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated generally on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method
by reference to the ratio of production in the year and the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into account future
development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation
purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other reserves.
Pipelines are depreciated on a unit-of-throughput basis.
(c) Impairment of development and production assets
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase
indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the present
value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. The cash generating unit
applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single
cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depreciation. Where conditions giving rise to
impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of
any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
(d) Acquisitions, asset purchases and disposals
Acquisitions of oil and gas properties are accounted for under the purchase method where the transaction meets the definition
of a business combination.
Transactions involving the purchase of an individual field interest, or a group of field interests, that do not qualify as a business
combination, are treated as asset purchases irrespective of whether the specific transactions involved the transfer of the field
interests directly or the transfer of an incorporated entity. Accordingly, no goodwill and no deferred tax gross up arises, and the
consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities purchased on an appropriate basis.
Proceeds on disposal are applied to the carrying amount of the specific intangible asset or development and production assets
disposed of and any surplus is recorded as a gain on disposal in the income statement. 54
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Inventories
Inventories, except for petroleum products, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Petroleum products and under
and overlifts of crude oil are recorded at net realisable value, under inventories and other debtors or creditors respectively.
Tax
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable
profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill/excess of
fair value over cost or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction
that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and
interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable
right to set off corporation tax assets against corporation tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax
authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Translation of foreign currencies
In the accounts of individual companies, transactions denominated in foreign currencies, being currencies other than the functional
currency, are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates
prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the
dates of the transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the income statement. Non-monetary assets held at historic cost
are translated at the date of purchase and are not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are generally translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Exchange
differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are
recognised as income or as expenses in the year in which the operation is disposed of.
Group retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-
managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the group’s obligations under
the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at
each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income. Past
service cost is also recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a
straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of plan assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is
limited to unrecognised past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Royalties
Royalties are charged as production costs to the income statement in the year in which the related production is recognised as income.
Leasing
Rentals payable for assets under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 55
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the group’ s balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges,
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income
statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not
settled in the year in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments
The group uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
interest rates and oil price fluctuations.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs. Derivatives are subsequently carried at fair
value. Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are recorded as
financial income or expense in the year in which they arise.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types. Fair value hedges are hedges of particular risks
that may change the fair value of a recognised asset or liability. Cash flow hedges are hedges of particular risks that may change the
amount or timing of future cash flows. Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity are hedges of particular risks that may change the
carrying value of the net assets of a foreign entity.
T o qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability of occurrence,
hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. If these conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge
accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no hedging
relationship. In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income or expense.
For qualifying fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded at its previous
carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Any changes in the fair values are
reported in financial income or expense.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any change in fair value that is an
effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported in financial income. If the hedging relationship
is the hedge of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction, the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging
instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in the initial carrying value of the asset or liability at the time it is
recognised. For all other qualifying cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been
recorded in equity are included in financial income at the time when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
For qualifying hedges of net investment in a foreign entity, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any
change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity.
Any remaining ineffective portion is recorded in financial income or expense where the hedging instrument is a derivative and in
equity in other cases. If the entity is disposed of, then the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been
recorded in equity are included in financial income at the time of the disposal.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with
unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement. Embedded derivatives which are closely related to host contracts,
including in particular price caps and floors within the group’s oil sales contracts, are not separated and are not carried at fair value.
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing
parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated transaction costs
that would be incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as option pricing models and
estimated discounted values of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand. Cash equivalents comprise
funds held in term deposit accounts with a maturity not exceeding three months. 56
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Share-based payments
The group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 – ‘Share-based Payment’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has
been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005.
The group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments
are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period,
based on the group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Monte Carlo simulation. The main assumptions are provided in note 19.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance
sheet date for cash-settled, share-based payments.
Convertible bonds
The net proceeds received from the issue of convertible bonds are split between a liability element and an equity component at the
date of issue. The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-
convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the liability
component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, is included in equity and is not re-
measured. The liability component is carried at amortised cost.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying
amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate, at the time of issue, for
similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this amount and the interest paid is
added to the carrying amount of the convertible bonds.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Details of the group’s significant accounting judgements and critical accounting estimates are set out in these financial statements
and include:
• carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets (note 8);
• carrying value of property, plant and equipment (note 9);
• proved and probable reserves estimates (note 9);
• decommissioning costs (note 16);
• derivative financial instruments (note 17);
• share-based payments (note 19);
• pensions (note 23); and
• acquisition of subsidiaries (note 25). 57

6. Tax (continued)
The weighted average rate is calculated based on the tax rates weighted according to the profit or loss before tax earned by the
group in each jurisdiction. The change in the weighted average rate year-on-year relates to the mix of profit and loss in each
jurisdiction. The standard tax rate of UK ring fence profits is 50 per cent.
There are no significant unrecognised temporary differences associated with undistributed profits of subsidiaries, associates
and joint ventures. The amount of unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the balance sheet in the
absence of suitable ring fence and non-ring fence forecast profits is US$367.1 million in the UK (2008: US$6.8 million). This gives
rise to a potential deferred tax asset of US$163.3 million (2008: US$1.9 million).
7. Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary
Shares in issue during the year. The denominators for the purposes of calculating both basic and diluted earnings per share for
the prior year have been adjusted to reflect the bonus element related to the rights issue in 2009.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows:
Weighted average
Profit after tax number of shares Earnings per share
2008 2008
2009 2008 2009 (restated) 2009 (restated)
$ million $ million million million cents cents

Outstanding share options – – 0.2 0.8 * *
Diluted 113.0 98.3 108.8 100.1 103.9 98.2
* The inclusion of the outstanding share options in the 2009 and 2008 calculations produces a diluted earnings per share. The outstanding share options
number includes any expected additional share issues due to future share-based payments. At 31 December 2009 9,337,340 (2008 restated: 9,337,340)
potential Ordinary Shares in the company that are underlying the company’s convertible bonds and that may dilute earnings per share in the future have not
been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they are anti-dilutive for the year to 31 December 2009.
In accordance with IAS 33 – ‘Earnings per Share’ the comparatives have been restated to take into account the rights issue by the
company during 2009.

the income statement as exploration expense unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not
completed and there are no indications of impairment. The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying
value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain. 66

Other fixed assets include items such as leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
The impairment loss relates to the Chinguetti field in Mauritania. The impairment charge was calculated by reference to an
assessment of the future discounted cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves measured
against the carrying value of the asset. The future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10 per cent.
Estimates involved in impairment measurement include estimates of commercial reserves, future oil and gas prices, costs and
timing which are inherently uncertain.
Amortisation and depreciation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas
production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis at the end of the
period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis. Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of
underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are
inherently uncertain. Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its
estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants. However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be
recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the field’s life. 67

Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
14. Borrowings (continued)
Convertible bonds
In June 2007, the group issued bonds at a par value of US$250 million which are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the company
at any time from 6 August 2007 until six days before their maturity date of 27 June 2014.
At the initial conversion price of £15.82 per share there were 8,003,434 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds.
In April 2009 the conversion price was adjusted from £15.82 per share to £13.56 per share, as a result of the company’s 4 for 9
rights issue of new Ordinary Shares. At the adjusted conversion price of £13.56 per share there are 9,337,340 Ordinary Shares
of the company underlying the bonds.
If the bonds have not been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will be redeemed at par value on
27 June 2014. Interest of 2.875 per cent per annum will be paid semi-annually in arrears up to that date.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bonds were split between a liability element and an equity
component at the date of issue. The fair value of the liability component was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate
for similar non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value
assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, was
included in equity reserves.
Issue costs were apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative
carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component was charged directly against equity.

Interest charged 14.6 14.2
Interest paid (7.2) (7.1)

The total interest charged for the year has been calculated by applying an effective annual interest rate of 6.73 per cent
(2008: 6.73 per cent) to the liability component for the period since the bonds were issued. The non-cash accrual of interest
will increase the liability component (as the cash interest is only paid at 2.875 per cent) to US$250 million at maturity.
There is no material difference between the carrying amount of the liability component of the convertible bonds and their fair
value. This fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate.

The company currently operates an Asset and Equity Plan to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the
business and the market value of the company over a three-year period. Further details of this plan are disclosed in note 19.
The decommissioning provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs relating to the UK, West Africa, Pakistan
and Vietnam oil and gas interests, which are expected to be incurred up to 2031. These provisions have been created based on
Premier’s internal estimates and, where available, operator’s estimates. Based on the current economic environment,
assumptions have been made which the management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, actual
decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required,
which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on
when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates. This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which
are inherently uncertain.
17. Financial instruments
Hedging instruments
The group’s activities expose it to financial risks of changes, primarily in oil and gas prices but also foreign currency exchange
and interest rates. The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives
is governed by the group’s policies and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of
financial derivatives.
It is group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the group. The
group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures. Premier undertakes oil and gas price hedging
periodically within Board limits to protect operating cash flow against weak prices.
Oil and gas hedging is undertaken with collar options, swaps and embedded hedges in long-term crude offtake agreements.
The embedded hedges in long-term crude offtake agreements are not fair valued as they qualify for ‘own-use’ exemption under
IAS 39 – ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. Oil is hedged using Dated Brent oil price options. Indonesian
gas is hedged using HSFO Singapore 180cst which is the variable component of the gas price.
Oil production
a) During the year additional hedges, using both collars and swaps, were undertaken, which both enhanced existing collars and
covered a portion of the additional production acquired from the acquisition of Oilexco. Total premia of US$12.5 million were
paid for the collars.
b) Forecast production for 2010 is now 69 per cent hedged, for 2011 it is 45 per cent hedged and for 2012 it is 14 per cent. For
the year 2010, 1.4 mmbbls are hedged at an average swap rate of US$75.63/bbl. In addition 3.24 mmbbls for each of 2010
and 2011 are hedged at a floor of US$51.2/bbl and average cap of US$80.0/bbl. For 2012, 1.8 mmbbls are hedged at an
average floor of US$39.3/bbl and an average cap of US$100.0/bbl. 71
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
17. Financial instruments (continued)
c) Two offtake agreements have been entered into in which the parameters of the above collars are embedded. These
agreements are as follows:
(i) Offtake agreement effective from 1 July 2008 for four and a half years; and
(ii) A new offtake agreement effective from 1 January 2010 for two years.
These agreements have the effect of replacing the original financially-settled hedges previously in place for the period
covered by collars.
d) Deferred revenue of US$54.1 million (2008: US$33.6 million) has been created due to first-day gains arising from offtake
agreements and related options. This deferred revenue will be amortised over the life of each individual offtake agreement.
For the year ended 31 December 2009 a total of US$8.5 million (2008: US$4.3 million) was released to the income statement
in respect of this deferred revenue.
During the year oil hedges matured generating a cash cost of US$15.0 million (2008: US$8.1 million). An unrealised fair value loss
was calculated on the swaps for the year of US$9.8 million (2008: US$nil) which has been recognised directly in equity reserves as
the swaps are 100 per cent effective under hedge accounting rules.
Indonesian gas production
Production from 2010 to mid-year 2013 is now 22 per cent hedged with a floor of US$250.0 per metric tonne (mt) and a cap of
US$500.0/mt.
During the year gas hedges matured generating a cash cost of US$nil (2008: US$7.8 million). While all hedges were assessed
to be effective, all movements in the fair values have been recognised in the income statement, as all such movements relate
to the time-value portion of hedges under IAS 39 – ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.

The fair values, which have been determined from counterparties with whom the trades have been concluded, have been
recognised in the balance sheet in trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.
The key variable which affects the fair value of the group’s hedge instruments is market expectations about future commodity
prices. The following illustrates the sensitivity of net income and equity to a 10 per cent increase and a 10 per cent decrease
in this variable:

10 per cent decrease (17.2) (11.2) (28.4)
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities
During the year US$150 million of long-term bank borrowings were swapped from floating rate to fixed rate at an average fixed
rate of 1.58 per cent. Interest is payable on a six-monthly basis and receives US$ 3-month LIBOR on a quarterly basis which
matches the payment timing and interest basis of the long-term bank borrowings.
The fair value of this option at 31 December 2009 was a liability of US$0.8 million. This has been recognised directly in equity
reserves.
The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the group as at 31 December was:

The impact of foreign exchange and interest rate sensitivity analyses is immaterial to the group’s results.
Borrowing facilities
The group has committed borrowing facilities of US$693 million and letter of credit facilities of £60 million (US$97.2 million), in

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction, other than in a forced
or liquidated sale. Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values. The estimated fair values have been
determined using market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Values recorded are as at the balance sheet
date, and will not necessarily be realised. Non-interest bearing financial instruments, which include amounts receivable from
customers and accounts payable are recorded materially at fair value reflecting their short-term maturity and are not shown in
the above table. 17. Financial instruments (continued)
Credit risk
The group’s credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and its bank deposits. The amount of receivables presented in the
balance sheet is net of allowances for doubtful receivables which were immaterial in 2009 and 2008. The group does not require
collateral or other security to support receivables from customers or related parties. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative
financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with at least single A credit ratings assigned by international
credit rating agencies.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The ageing profile of the group’s trade and other receivables and trade and other payables as at 31 December, including the
related interest amounts, was:

Currency risk
To cover sterling exposures an amount of £123.8 million was purchased with forward contracts during the year (2008: £105.0
million). Premier’s activities are largely conducted in US dollars. All borrowings at year-end were denominated in US dollars to
match the currency of the assets.
Liquidity risk
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk
management framework for the management of the group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management
requirements. The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and borrowing facilities by
continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and
future capital and operating commitments.

The concept of authorised share capital was abolished under the Companies Act 2006 with effect from 1 October 2009. Accordingly,
amendments to the company’s Articles of Association will be presented to the shareholders for approval at the 2010 AGM.
Rights issue
On 25 March 2009, the company announced its proposal to raise approximately £171 million (US$252.2 million) by way of a fully
underwritten rights issue. Under the proposal, the company offered its shareholders the opportunity to acquire 4 new Ordinary
Shares for every 9 Ordinary Shares held at a price of 485 pence per new Ordinary Share. The proposal was subject to
authorisation by shareholders which was obtained at a General Meeting held on 20 April 2009. The offer period commenced on
21 April 2009 and closed for acceptance on 6 May 2009. Dealing in the new shares began on 7 May 2009.
Share-based payments
£12,113 (US$19,651) of Ordinary Shares were issued during 2009 relating to the company’s share option plans. There has been no
new issue of shares in relation to the Asset and Equity Plan or the Long Term Incentive Plan. 19. Share capital (continued)
Share option plans
The company has share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the company’s shares have been granted to
certain executives and employees. Options granted are normally exercisable not less than three years after their grant and will
lapse on their tenth anniversary. Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the
scheme. Employees can save to a maximum of £250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years,
after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares. If an employee agrees
to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares
(Matching Shares), on a one-for-one basis.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £2.04. The options
outstanding at 31 December 2009 had a weighted average exercise price of £4.72 and a weighted average remaining
contractual life of 2.8 years.
The fair value of the options granted during the year was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and is not
material.
The group recognised a cost of US$27.3 million and US$20.1 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions
in 2009 and 2008 respectively.
Asset and Equity Plan
The Asset and Equity Plan is designed to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the business and the market
value of the company over a three-year period and is operated by reference to two bonus pools – an equity bonus pool and an
asset bonus pool. The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company
over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity market value per share of
the company over a three-year period.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows:
Volatility: 30.9% to 31.5%
Risk free rate of interest: 4.4% to 4.9%
Historic market value growth factor: 99.0% to 109.0%
For the asset bonus pool a discounted cash flow model based on the average oil price over the period is used to calculate the
final value of the pool and to estimate the value of future asset bonus pools.

Long Term Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was introduced to provide a long-term all-employee scheme which motivates all employees
and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package. Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements:
Equity Pool Awards, Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance period, and a potential
Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at the end of the three-year
performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan and of the
Performance Share Awards.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows:
Volatility: 40.0%
Risk free rate of interest: 3.3%
Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.29
For the year ended 31 December 2009, the total cost recognised by the company for long-term incentive arrangements is
US$46.1 million (2008: US$25.6 million), with a cumulative liability on the balance sheet of US$28.4 million (2008: US$16.3 million).
A credit of US$27.3 million has been recorded in equity (2008: US$20.1 million) for all equity-settled payments for the group. Like
other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time
spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc group. Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly
attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the income statement as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or
general and administration costs.
Ordinary Shares
The rights and restrictions attached to the Ordinary Shares are as follows:
Dividend rights
The rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other in relation to dividends.
Winding up or reduction of capital
On a return of capital on a winding up or otherwise (other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares) the rights of
the holders of Ordinary Shares to participate in the distribution of the assets of the company available for distribution shall rank
pari passu in all respects with each other.
Voting rights
The holders of Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at any General Meeting of the company.

Funded benefit schemes
The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK – The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan (the
Scheme). The Scheme was closed to new members (aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits) in 1997 and a
new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started. Both schemes are funded by the payment of
contributions to separately administered trust funds. As a consequence of being closed to new entrants, the current service costs
of the Scheme under the IAS 19 – ‘Employee Benefits’ valuation will increase as the members approach retirement.
The pension costs for the Scheme are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary. The most recent formal
valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2008 using the Attained Age Method and a market-related funding basis, of which the
principal financial assumptions were investment return: 5.9 per cent pa, salary growth: 5.4 per cent pa and pension increases: 3.4
per cent pa. The market value of the Scheme’s assets was £14.9 million and, on the specific method and assumptions adopted,
the assets covered 91 per cent of the members’ accrued benefits based on projected pensionable salaries. The current Schedule
of Contributions was effected in October 2008. The employer contributes at a rate of 25 per cent of pensionable salaries with no
additional monthly amounts. The employer expects to contribute £98,000 to the Scheme in 2010.
The following figures have been prepared in compliance with IAS 19 – ‘Employee Benefits’ by an independent actuary on the
basis of membership data current as at 31 December 2009 but taking account of pension increases effected on 1 January 2010.
The benefit obligations and service cost have been measured using the Projected Unit Credit Method and the pension expense
has been assessed on the basis that the group adopts the policy of fully recognising actuarial gains and losses during the period
in which they arise.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows:

Percentage of Scheme assets 7% (25%) (1%) 1% 8%
Unfunded benefit schemes
In Indonesia the group operates a Service, Severance and Compensation pay scheme under a Collective Labour Agreement with
the local workforce. This is an unfunded post-employment defined benefit scheme in nature.
In addition, the group is paying an unfunded pension to a former director of the company in regard to which annual increases
and a reversionary spouse’s pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Scheme’s pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2009 of the
future payments projected to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million (2008: US$0.8 million). A total loss
of US$0.1 million (2008: gain of US$0.3 million) was recognised directly in equity reserves during the year.
Defined contribution benefit scheme
The group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme. The only obligation of the group with respect to the
retirement benefit scheme is to make specified contributions. Payments to the defined contribution scheme are charged as an
expense as they fall due. The total cost charged to income of US$2.0 million (2008: US$2.2 million) represents contributions
payable to these schemes by the group at rates specified in the rules of the scheme.
24. Related party transactions
Transactions between the company and its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, which are related parties, have been
eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.

25. Acquisition of subsidiaries
On 21 May 2009 the Premier Oil plc group, through its subsidiary Premier Oil Group Ltd, completed the acquisition of the entire
issued share capital of Oilexco North Sea Ltd (ONSL) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Oilexco North Sea Exploration Ltd (ONSEL).
The group funded the acquisition and associated costs by way of:
• a 4 for 9 rights issue of new Ordinary Shares at a price of 485 pence per share to raise gross proceeds of approximately
£171 million (US$252.2 million);
• new credit facilities consisting initially of a US$175 million 18-month bridge facility, a US$225 million three-year revolving credit
facility and US$63.0 million and £60 million (US$97 million) three-year letter of credit facilities; and
• the group’s existing cash resources. 25. Acquisition of subsidiaries (continued)
ONSL is an oil and gas exploration and production company active in the UK, with its producing properties located in the UK
Central North Sea. The acquisition has provided the group with a greater presence in the North Sea, strengthening the group’s
existing operations in that area by adding a material package of assets comprising existing producing fields, development
projects of existing discovered reserves and a portfolio of exploration prospects, together with high quality UK operatorship
capabilities.
The transaction has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting with an effective date of 21 May 2009, being the
date that the group gained control of ONSL. The fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities have been reassessed since
the half year, to reflect additional information which has become available concerning conditions that existed at the date of
acquisition in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 – ‘Business Combinations’. The final fair values, together with the changes
since the half year, are set out in the following table:

Total consideration* (574.1) (0.1) (574.2)
Excess of fair value over cost** 66.3 (54.7) 11.6
* Total consideration also includes US$63.0 million of cash paid by the group which is held in trust for future abandonment obligations, and direct acquisition
costs of US$10.5 million.
** This excess of fair value over cost has been recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement for the year under review, and has been offset
by related acquisition expenses of US$6.0 million.
The principal adjustments from the half year valuation were a reduction in the carrying value of the Shelley field in oil and gas
properties, recognition of additional pre-acquisition receivables and determination of fair value for inventories acquired on
completion.
The final payments made by the group at completion amounted to US$500.7 million, after adjusting for certain payables,
receivables and other items which have occurred between the effective date and completion.
ONSL and ONSEL contributed US$1.0 million to revenue and US$24.0 million to profit before tax for the period between the
date of acquisition and the half yearly balance sheet date. On 1 July 2009, the assets were transferred from ONSL into another
group company as part of an internal restructuring of the group.
If the acquisition of ONSL had been completed on the first day of the financial year, group sales revenues for the year would
have been US$686.4 million. As the acquired subsidiary was in administration prior to the acquisition, it is impracticable to
calculate a fair estimate of cost of sales, and hence it is not possible to provide a pro forma profit before tax amount for the
combined group since 1 January 2009. Similarly appropriate amounts are not available for carrying values of assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities immediately prior to the acquisition.
Due to the inherently uncertain nature of the oil and gas industry the assumptions underlying the final assigned values are
judgemental in nature.

1. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared
under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Further information relating to the going concern
assumption is provided in the Report of the Directors.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and
the preceding year.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Pension costs
The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered
fund. The scheme was closed to new members (aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits) in 1997. The company
accounts for pension costs in line with Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 17 – ‘Retirement Benefits’.
The amounts charged to operating profit regarding the defined benefit scheme are the current service costs and gains and
losses on settlements and curtailments. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the
benefits have vested. If the benefits do not vest immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs.
The interest costs and the expected return on the assets are shown as a net amount of other financial costs or credits adjacent
to interest. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair values and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the Projected Unit
Credit Method, and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent
currency and term to the scheme liabilities.
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date. The resulting defined benefit
asset or liability, net of related deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the balance sheet.
Foreign exchange
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of the
transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year-end are reported at the rates of
exchange prevailing at the year-end. Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the dates of the
transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow statement
No cash flow statement is prepared for the company under FRS 1 – ‘Cash Flow Statements’ as the cash flows of the company
have been included in the group cash flow statement of Premier Oil plc.
Related party transactions
The company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 – ‘Related Party Disclosures’ with regard to the
non-disclosure of transactions between group companies.
Share-based payments
The company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 – ‘Share-based Payment’. In accordance with the transitional provisions,
FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The company issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the company’s estimate of shares
that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the binomial model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each
balance sheet date for cash-settled share-based payments.
Sales revenue
Sales of petroleum production are recognised when goods are delivered or the title has passed to the customer.
Tax
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the
tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 86
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2009
1. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date
where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to
receive more tax, with the following exceptions:
• provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates
and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable; and
• deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will
be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Fixed assets
Oil and gas assets
(a) Development and production assets
Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing
the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly
attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and
decommissioning.
Depreciation of producing assets
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated generally on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production
method by reference to the ratio of production in the period and the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into
account future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation
purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other reserves.
Pipelines are depreciated on a unit-of-throughput basis.
(b) Impairment of development and production assets
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase
indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying amount is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the
present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. The cash
generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be
grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
(c) Decommissioning
Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full at the commencement of oil and gas production. The amount recognised
is the present value of the estimated future expenditure. A corresponding tangible fixed asset is also created at an amount
equal to the provision. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production facilities. Any change
in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the fixed asset.
Stock and underlift
Non-production related stocks are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Under and overlifts of crude oil are
recorded at market value.
Derivative financial instruments
The company accounts for derivative financial instruments in line with FRS 25 – ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and
Presentation’ and FRS 26 – ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’.
The company uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its exposure to oil price fluctuations. All derivatives
are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs. Derivatives are subsequently carried at fair value. All changes in fair
value are recorded as financial income or expense in the year in which they arise.
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable and
willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated
transaction costs that would be incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as
option pricing models and estimated discounted values of cash flows. 87

2. Profit for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account
for the year. Premier Oil plc reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2009 of US$23.1 million (2008: profit of
US$87.0 million).

Amortisation and depreciation for oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas
production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis at the end of the
period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis. Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of
underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are
inherently uncertain. Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its
estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants. However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be
recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the field’s life.
On 30 June 2009, the company’s interest in the Kyle field was transferred to another group company.

The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK – The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan
(the Scheme). The Scheme was closed to new members (aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits) in 1997
and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started. Both schemes are funded by the payment of
contributions to separately administered trust funds. As a consequence of being closed to new entrants, the current service costs
of the Scheme under the FRS 17 – ‘Retirement Benefits’ valuation will increase as the members approach retirement.
The pension costs for the Scheme are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary. The most recent formal
valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2008 using the Attained Age Method and a market-related funding basis, of which the
principal financial assumptions were investment return: 5.9 per cent pa, salary growth: 5.4 per cent pa and pension increases: 3.4
per cent pa. The market value of the Scheme’s assets was £14.9 million and, on the specific method and assumptions adopted,
the assets covered 91 per cent of the members’ accrued benefits based on projected pensionable salaries. The current Schedule
of Contributions was effected in October 2008. The employer contributes at a rate of 25 per cent of pensionable salaries with no
additional monthly amounts. The employer expects to contribute £98,000 to the Scheme in 2010.
The following figures have been prepared in compliance with FRS 17 – ‘Retirement Benefits’ (incorporating the amendment
announced in December 2006) by an independent actuary on the basis of membership data current as at 31 December 2009 but
taking account of pension increases effected on 1 January 2010. The benefit obligations and service cost have been measured
using the Projected Unit Credit Method. 90

Unfunded pensions
In addition, the company is paying an unfunded pension to a former director of the company in regard to which annual increases
and a reversionary spouse’s pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Scheme’ s pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2009 of the future
payments projected to be made in respect of unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million (2008: US$0.8 million). A total loss of US$0.1 million
(2008: gain of US$0.3 million) was recognised directly in the statement of total recognised gains and losses during the year.
10. Capital commitments and guarantees
At 31 December 2009 the company had commitments for performance guarantees totalling US$0.1 million (2008: US$nil), US$nil
as retainer fees for its alliance partners (2008: US$0.1 million) and customs guarantees of US$nil (2008: US$0.3 million).
The company, together with certain subsidiary undertakings, has jointly guaranteed the group’s borrowing facilities consisting of
a US$388 million revolving credit facility, a £60 million (US$97.2 million) letter of credit facility and a US$175 million term loan and
US$130 million revolving credit facility, all maturing in March 2012 (2008: US$275 million and £53 million (US$77 million)). 92

The concept of authorised share capital was abolished under the Companies Act 2006 with effect from 1 October 2009. Accordingly,
amendments to the company’s Articles of Association will be presented to the shareholders for approval at the 2010 AGM.
Rights issue
On 25 March 2009, the company announced its proposal to raise approximately £171 million (US$252.2 million) by way of a fully
underwritten rights issue. Under the proposal, the company offered its shareholders the opportunity to acquire 4 new Ordinary
Shares for every 9 Ordinary Shares held at a price of 485 pence per new Ordinary Share. The proposal was subject to authorisation
by shareholders which was obtained at a General Meeting held on 20 April 2009. The offer period commenced on 21 April 2009
and closed for acceptance on 6 May 2009. Dealing in the new shares began on 7 May 2009.
Share-based payments
£12,113 (US$19,651) of Ordinary Shares were issued during 2009 relating to the company’s share option plans. There has been no
new issue of shares in relation to the Asset and Equity Plan or the Long Term Incentive Plan.
Share option plans
The company has share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the company’s shares have been granted to
certain executives and employees. Options granted are normally exercisable not less than three years after their grant and will
lapse on their tenth anniversary. Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the
scheme. Employees can save to a maximum of £250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years,
after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares. If an employee agrees to
buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares
(Matching Shares), on a one-for-one basis.

11. Share capital (continued)
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £2.04. The options outstanding
at 31 December 2009 had a weighted average exercise price of £4.72 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.8 years.
The fair value of the options granted during the year was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and is not material.
The company recognised a cost of US$27.3 million and US$20.1 million related to equity-settled share-based payment
transactions in 2009 and 2008 respectively.
Asset and Equity Plan
The Asset and Equity Plan is designed to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the business and the market
value of the company over a three-year period and is operated by reference to two bonus pools – an equity bonus pool and an
asset bonus pool. The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company
over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity market value per share of
the company over a three-year period.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows:
Volatility: 30.9% to 31.5%
Risk free rate of interest: 4.4% to 4.9%
Historic market value growth factor: 99.0% to 109.0%
For the asset bonus pool a discounted cash flow model based on the average oil price over the period is used to calculate the
final value of the pool and to estimate the value of future asset bonus pools.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was introduced to provide a long-term all-employee scheme which motivates all employees
and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package. Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements:
Equity Pool Awards, Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance period, and a potential
Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at the end of the three-year
performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan and of the
Performance Share Awards.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows:
Volatility: 40.0%
Risk free rate of interest: 3.3%
Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.29
For the year ended 31 December 2009, the total cost recognised by the company for long-term incentive arrangements is
US$26.0 million (2008: US$12.8 million), with cumulative liability on the balance sheet of US$11.1 million (2008: US$9.5 million).
A credit of US$27.3 million has been recorded in equity (2008: US$20.1 million) for all equity-settled payments of the group. Like
other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent
by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc group. Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable
to capital projects and part is charged to the profit and loss account as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general
and administration costs. 94

In June 2007, Premier Oil Finance (Jersey) Ltd, a 100 per cent subsidiary of the company, issued convertible bonds at a par value
of US$250 million. These bonds are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the company at any time from 6 August 2007 until six
days before their maturity date of 27 June 2014.
At the initial conversion price of £15.82 per share there were 8,003,434 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds. In
April 2009 the conversion price was adjusted from £15.82 per share to £13.56 per share, as a result of the company’s 4 for 9 rights
issue of new Ordinary Shares. At the adjusted conversion price of £13.56 per share there are 9,337,340 Ordinary Shares of the
company underlying the bonds.
If the bonds have not been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will be redeemed at par value on
27 June 2014. Interest of 2.875 per cent per annum will be paid semi-annually in arrears up to that date. 95

PREMIER TODAY
We operate through three business units; North Sea, Asia and
Middle East-Pakistan. Each has a strategy designed to maximise
the opportunities available in these highly prospective regions
of the world. Each has demonstrated marked progress against
its strategy during 2009, with a doubling in production in the
North Sea through the acquisition of Oilexco; record production
in Pakistan combined with new exploration acreage in Egypt;
and significant progress on development projects and exploration
programmes in Asia.
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE
The company is set to double in size as major
development projects come on-stream in the North
Sea and Asia. These will take the company to its
stated production target of 75,000 boepd. With more
than one billion potential barrels of prospective
resources in the portfolio to be drilled in the next five
years, and ongoing work to identify new areas in
which to bring to bear Premier’s particular skills and
expertise, the company is well-placed to deliver
substantial growth into the future.

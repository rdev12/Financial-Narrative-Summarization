CENTAMIN AT A GLANCE
Centamin’s principal asset, the Sukari Gold Mine, began production 
in 2009 and is the first large scale modern gold mine in Egypt, with 
production ramping up towards c.500,000 ounces per annum by 2017.
process plant
The Sukari plant processed 10.6Mt of ore in 2015, a 26% 
increase on 2014 (8.4Mt), reflecting the steady ramp up 
in ore throughput following completion of the Stage 4 
expansion during 2014. The total annual processed tonnes 
were 6% above nameplate capacity of 10 million tonnes 
per annum (Mtpa). Productivity continued to increase 
throughout the year, with 2.76Mt processed during the 
fourth quarter, achieving the plant’s minimum expected 
long‑term rate of 11Mtpa.

open pit
The open pit delivered total material movement of 
57,766kt for the year, an increase of 28% on the prior 
year. This increase was related to improved fleet utilisation 
and productivity, together with incremental blasting rates 
following the increased daily usage of ammonium nitrate 
(“AN”) from October 2014.
Underground
Ore production from the underground mine was a record 
1,158kt, a 20% increase on 2014. The average head grade 
was 6.5g/t.
A total of 8,501m of development was completed, of which 
6,864m was mineralised (5,389m in Amun, and 1,466m in 
Ptah) and associated with stoping blocks to be mined over 
the coming years. Centamin plc Annual report 2015

CENTAMIN AT A GLANCE continued
exploration focused growth
There are a number of regional prospects within the Sukari 
exploitation lease which offer potential for satellite deposits 
to feed the existing processing plant.
Sukari Hill exploration
Drilling from underground remains a focus of the Sukari 
exploration programme as ongoing development improves 
access to test the potential high‑grade extensions of the 
deposit. The Sukari Hill ore body has not yet been closed 
off at depth and further underground drilling will take 
place during 2016, predominantly from the Amun and 
Ptah declines.
In addition, there are a number of regional prospects 
within the Sukari exploitation lease which offer potential 
for satellite deposits to feed the existing processing plant. 
Exploration of these prospects continues.
Burkina Faso
The strategy for 2015 was to continue to systematically 
explore and drill‑test the numerous targets along the 
160km strike length of greenstone belt contained within 
our extensive 2,200km
2
 licence holding. This will lead to 
further drilling and resource development during 2016. The 
main focus of the exploration programme is to discover and 
define areas of near‑surface and high‑grade mineralisation.
A signed ministerial decree approving the Tiopolo mining 
licence, which hosts the existing indicated resource of 
1.92 million ounces and inferred resource of 1.33 million 
ounces, was issued on 5 March 2015. A deferral was 
granted by the Ministry of Mines and Energy in November 
2015 in order to continue exploration, as provisioned in the 
Burkina Faso Mining Code.

During 2015 Centamin has maintained 
its strategic focus on generating 
shareholder returns and value‑accretive 
growth, despite the continued gold 
price weakness and widespread 
challenges across the industry. 
Our flagship Sukari Gold Mine has 
continued to deliver substantial free 
cash flows, driven by a sixth successive 
year of production growth and industry 
competitive costs.
The strong performance of our core 
asset, together with the Company’s 
robust financial position, allowed 
the board of directors to approve an 
interim 2015 payment of 0.97 US cents 
per share (versus a 2014 interim 
payment of 0.87 US cents per share). 
I am now pleased to announce 
the approval of a final dividend for 
2015 of 1.97 US cents per share. 
This represents a full year payout of 
approximately US$33.7 million, which 
sits at the top end of our dividend 
policy to pay out 15‑30% of our net 
free cash flow.
As noted at the beginning of the 
year, the open pit operation at Sukari 
progressed through the next stage 
of pit development in line with the 
long‑term mine plan, resulting in 
below reserve‑average grades during 
much of 2015. The underground 
and processing operations offset 
these lower grades from the open 
pit in the first half of the year, with 
above‑forecast levels of productivity 
driving gold production in excess of 
our initial guidance. Sukari continued 
to perform well during the second 
half, and full‑year production of 
439,072 ounces was within the 
revised guidance range of 430,000 to 
440,000 ounces (originally 420,000 
ounces). There was a strong end to 
the year as the fourth quarter saw 
plant throughput reach our minimum 
expected long‑term rate of 11 million 
tonnes per annum, being 10% above 
nameplate capacity.
Full‑year cash operating costs 
improved to US$713 per ounce from 
US$729 per ounce in 2014, mainly 
driven by the decrease in fuel price, 
although marginally above guidance of 
US$700 per ounce despite the higher 
production than originally forecast. 
It is pleasing to note the fourth quarter 
cash operating cost of US$667 per 
ounce, which points towards the 
potential for Sukari to deliver 
highly‑competitive cash margins, 
as productivity and cost efficiencies 
are the focus over the coming years. 
All‑in sustaining costs (“AISC”) of 
US$885 per ounce were below our 
original forecast of US$950 per ounce, 
mainly due to the rescheduling of 
certain sustaining capital cost items, 
as highlighted in the third quarter 
results statement, as well as the 
higher production.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Our growth strategy seeks to create 
shareholder value by taking projects 
through the mining value chain: 
exploration, development and 
operations.

Blast hole drill rigs in  
place in the open pit
In May 2015, Centamin detailed 
its five‑year production and cost 
guidance following completion of 
construction and commissioning of 
the Stage 4 plant expansion in the 
prior year. A seventh year of growth is 
forecast for 2016, with production of 
470,000 ounces at a cash operating 
cost of US$680 per ounce and AISC 
of US$900 per ounce. Further growth 
is expected in 2017 with an annual 
production rate of approximately 
500,000 ounces per annum, with 
AISC continuing to trend downwards 
below US$900 per ounce. Continued 
optimisation and increases in 
productivity over the medium term, 
in particular within the processing and 
underground mining operations, offer 
good potential for further production 
growth and reductions in cash costs 
and AISC. 
2015 revenues of US$508 million were 
up 8% year‑on‑year as an 8% fall in 
realised gold prices were offset by a 
17% increase in gold sales. EBITDA 
decreased by 9% to US$152 million, 
mainly due to a reduction of gross 
operating margin as a result of 
the drop in gold price, and also 
an increased cost associated with 
changes in production inventories.
Profit before tax of US$58.4 million 
was down 28% on 2014 and earnings 
per share for 2015 was 4.51 US cents, 
compared with 7.21 US cents in 2014. 
The reduction in profit was mainly due 
to the decreased operating margin and 
also a US$6.3 million write‑off following 
our decision towards the end of the 
year to cease exploration in Ethiopia. 
During the year the Company incurred 
an income tax charge of US$6.8 million 
in relation to foreign exchange gains 
on its cash holdings within Australia.
Centamin remains committed to its 
policy of being 100% exposed to 
the gold price through its unhedged 
position, and its balance sheet remains 
strong with zero debt. We ended the 
year with US$230.7 million in cash, 
bullion on hand, gold sales receivables 
and available‑for‑sale financial assets. 
This is a material increase over the 
US$162.8 million at the end of 2014 
and highlights the potential of the 
business to continue self‑funding its 
next stages of growth from cash flows 
whilst maintaining a commitment to 
dividend payments.
Centamin made continued progress 
during 2015 in developing its 
longer‑term growth objectives. 
At Sukari, the total combined 
open pit and underground mineral 
reserve estimate increased, net 
of mining depletion, by 7% to 
8.8Moz, continuing to support our 
expectation for a mine life in excess 
of 20 years. Whilst the increase was 
partly due to lower operating costs 
associated with reduced fuel prices, 
it is pleasing to note that drilling from 
underground continues to improve 
the resource categories of our gold 
asset base and thereby increases 
the underground component of the 
reserve. The underground operation 
is an important value‑driver for our 
business and we expect further 
substantial growth of the reserve over 
the coming years as development and 
exploration continues. Centamin plc Annual report 2015

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT continued
With the downturn in gold prices 
having resulted in a significant 
curtailment of industry spending on 
exploration, Centamin is in a strong 
position to continue investing in its 
long‑term growth throughout the 
cycle. Beyond Sukari we are focused 
on our extensive licence holdings 
within Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. 
Whilst these districts hold potential for 
several deposit types, our immediate 
objective is to discover and define 
areas of near‑surface and high‑grade 
economic mineralisation. In this 
respect, positive results during 2015 
have seen a number of priority areas 
emerge which will remain the focus for 
resource growth during 2016. I look 
forward to updating you further in due 
course with our progress in unlocking 
the Company’s next stage of growth 
from these highly prospective regions.
Whilst disciplined and sustainable 
growth on our existing projects remains 
a key focus, we continue to evaluate 
opportunities to grow through the 
acquisition of projects which offer the 
potential for the Company to deliver 
on its strategic objectives.
Developments in the two litigation 
actions, Diesel Fuel Oil and Concession 
Agreement, are described in further 
detail in note 20 to the financial 
statements. In respect of the latter, the 
Company continues to believe that 
it has a strong legal position and, in 
addition, that it will ultimately benefit 
from law no. 32 of 2014, which came 
into force in April 2014 and which 
restricts the capacity for third parties to 
challenge any contractual agreement 
between the Egyptian government 
and an investor. This law, whilst in force 
and ratified by the new parliament, is 
currently under review by the Supreme 
Constitutional Court of Egypt. 
After a series of delays and 
adjournments, the Concession 
Agreement appeal has now been set 
down for judgment on 24 May 2016. 
If the judgment is a final judgment, the 
Company expects it will be in its favour. 
However, it has been advised that 
the Egyptian legal system allows for 
the possibility of an interim judgment 
staying the appeal until the Supreme 
Constitutional Court has ruled on the 
validity of law no. 32. 
The group continues to benefit from 
the full support of the Ministry of 
Petroleum and the Egyptian Mineral

both in the Concession Agreement 
appeal and at the operational level. 
As part of our long‑term strategy, we 
look forward to continuing to share the 
benefits of the Company’s substantial 
investment in Egypt as the Sukari 
operation sets the stage for a new era 
of gold mining in the country.

At the start of the year, Andrew Pardey 
was appointed as chief executive 
officer (“CEO”) and joined the board 
as an executive director from 1 
February 2015. Andrew has been a 
driving force behind Sukari’s growth 
into one of the world’s leading gold 
mines and Centamin’s development 
from a junior exploration company into 
one of the largest gold producers in 
North Africa. I am pleased to report 
that during Andrew’s first year as 
CEO, the Company has continued 
to develop and has realised its next 
stages of growth, whilst maintaining 
its strategic focus on cash flows, 
shareholder returns and social 
responsibility.
I would also like to take this 
opportunity to welcome Ross Jerrard 
as our new chief financial officer 
(“CFO”), effective 18 April 2016. 
Ross joins Centamin from Deloitte 
Australia, where he was a partner 
with over twenty‑two years’ audit and 
advisory experience, specialising in 
the resources industry. He has worked 
in southern Africa and the Middle 
East, including a three‑and‑a‑half‑year 
period based in Egypt, servicing 
a range of multinational and 
natural resources companies. This 
appointment follows the resignation 
of Pierre louw, who will hand over 
responsibilities in April 2016. We thank 
Pierre for his service and wish him all 
the best in his future endeavours.
I would like to close by thanking all 
those at Sukari, in Alexandria, Burkina 
Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Jersey and Perth 
for their efforts in 2015 as Centamin 
continued on its journey to becoming 
an established, cash‑generative and 
growing gold producer.
Your Company remains well positioned 
to deliver outstanding shareholder 
returns in the coming years. I look 
forward to updating you further 
over the course of 2016, and would 
welcome you to join us at our AGM, 
which this year will be held in Jersey 
on 11 May 2016.
This strategic review, progress on 
strategy, key performance indicators 
and business model together form 
the strategic report, which has been 
approved by the board of directors.

CHIEF ExECuTIvE OFFICER’S REPORT
I am pleased to report that, during 
2015, Centamin has continued 
to prosper under adverse market 
conditions. The Company continues 
to achieve positive results through 
its core strategic focus on creating 
value for all stakeholders. Value in the 
mining industry is achieved through 
a continual drive for productivity and 
efficiency at operating mines, whilst 
undertaking a growth strategy that is 
focused on enhancing returns over the 
long term. 
In this context, Sukari delivered 
production in line with guidance and 
with AISC significantly below initial 
forecasts. At the same time, Centamin 
continues to invest in long‑term 
growth, with continued resource and 
reserve increases at Sukari and positive 
indications of multiple high‑grade 
prospects from within its West African 
exploration projects. This stands 
against an industry forced towards 
short‑term initiatives to preserve 
cash in response to the various 
external challenges.
Safety is a critical area of Centamin’s 
performance and our aim is to ensure 
that every person returns safe at 
the end of each shift. Continued 
development of the onsite health and 
safety culture at Sukari has resulted in a 
low l TIFR for 2015 of 0.12 per 200,000 
man‑hours. Against this positive result, 
however, a very unfortunate incident 
occurred within the open pit operation 
during the fourth quarter, when a 
contractor’s employee was involved in 
a rock collapse while relocating a grade 
control drill rig. The operator, and sole 
occupant of the drill rig, was fatally 
injured in the incident. The loss was 
deeply saddening and overshadowed 
the strong operational performance 
during the quarter. 
Earlier in 2015, and as previously 
reported, an unfortunate incident 
occurred in Burkina Faso on a public 
road near the Konkera village which 
resulted in one of our local employees 
being fatally wounded and another 
sustaining injuries. A thorough 
investigation into this bandit attack 
on two of our vehicles has been 
carried out. Further additional security 
measures have been implemented 
following the incident. There was no 
impact on operational activity as a 
result of the incident.
Centamin remains committed 
to further improving health and 
safety during 2016 towards our 
zero‑harm target.
Sukari’s performance during 2015 
continues to bode well for the 
potential of the operation to generate 
significant free cash flow over 
the coming years. Fourth quarter 
production of 117,644 ounces was 
within the operation’s target annualised 
rate of 450,000 to 500,000 ounces, 
driven by the continued ramp‑up of 
the expanded process plant to its 
throughput rate of 11 million tonnes 
per annum. The plant is now operating 
at 10% above nameplate capacity, 
which represents the achievement of 
our base case forecast rate.
The average metallurgical recovery 
was 88.8%, a 1.7% increase on 2014. 
Work is continuing to optimise the 
operational controls and improve 
circuit stability to ensure recoveries 
are maintained above 88% at the 
increased rate of throughput.
Centamin is entering a 
sustainable period of cash 
generation, which it will use to 
reward shareholders through 
dividends and ongoing growth.

New processing  
plant completed following  
Stage 4 expansion
2015 was another successive record for 
both open pit and underground mining 
rates and productivity in both of these 
areas remains strong. The open pit 
delivered total material movement 
of 57.8Mt, an increase of 28% on the 
prior year. This was related to improved 
fleet utilisation and productivity, 
together with incremental blasting 
rates following the increased daily 
usage of ammonium nitrate (“AN”) 
from October 2014. The open pit 
remains on a secure footing to deliver 
the scheduled material movements as 
required for the expanded operation. 
Open pit mined grades are expected 
to increase towards the reserve 
average from 2016, in line with the 
mine plan and our production forecasts 
as detailed in May 2015.
The underground mine produced a 
record 1.16Mt of ore, a 20% increase 
on 2014. The average mined head 
grade was 6.5g/t, in line with our 
forecast, and represents a successful 
reduction in grade volatility when 
compared with 2014, a period when 
the operation underwent a significant 
ramp‑up in productivity. The focus for 
the operation remains to consistently 
deliver ore at an average grade of at 
least 6g/t. 
There was a material year‑on‑year 
decrease in operating costs per tonne 
in both the mining and processing 
areas, principally driven by the 
decrease in the international fuel price. 
The trend towards lower unit costs is 
expected to continue in the coming 
quarters, as the expanded operation 
continues to be optimised and further 
efficiency gains are realised. 
In September 2015, an updated 
resource and reserve estimate for 
Sukari provided further support for 
our production forecasts and our 
expectation of a long life and low 
cost operation that will continue to 
generate significant cash flow even 
under the current weak gold price 
environment. Open pit reserves of 
8.3 million ounces increased from the 
previous estimate by approximately 
0.5 million ounces, net of mining 
depletion. This increase was due to 
lower mining and processing costs 
associated with the recent reduction in 
international fuel prices and continued 
underground resource expansion from 
drilling. The estimate was based on 
assumptions conservatively above 
current operating costs. 
Reserves were based on a 
US$1,300 per ounce gold price, 
consistent with previous estimates and 
allowing for comparisons exclusive of 
short‑term volatility in the gold market 
over the expected 19‑year‑plus life of 
the operation.
Continued growth of the underground 
resource and reserve demonstrates the 
potential for further material increases 
over the coming years. The ongoing 
drilling programme continues to return 
high grade assay results and we expect 
this to continue as the development 
and drilling extends along the strike 
and at depth.
Our exploration programmes in West 
Africa continue to build momentum. 
In Burkina Faso, at the Wadaradoo, 
Napelapera and Torkera prospects, 
drilling has indicated the presence 
of structurally controlled high‑grade 
mineralised zones in addition to 
extensive lower‑grade mineralisation. 
In Côte d’Ivoire, first‑pass drilling 
over targets defined by geochemical 
and geophysical surveys has outlined 
mineralised zones over a number 
of prospects. We continue to test 
the potential for lateral and depth 
extensions at these more advanced 
prospects, whilst also progressing the 
numerous other prospects within our 
significant land packages. Centamin plc Annual report 2015

CHIEF ExECuTIvE OFFICER’S REPORT continued
The greenhouse gas emissions 
reporting required by Schedule 7 
of the large and Medium‑Sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008 as 
amended by the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013 only applies to UK 
incorporated quoted companies. 
Centamin has, however, provided 
information relating to this legislation 
in the CSR report as part of its 
commitment to environmental issues. 
Maintaining good community relations 
is a core part of our operational 
strategy and corporate governance 
standards. As the first mining company 
in Egypt in modern times, we strive to 
set an example of a socially responsible 
industry through adopting a good 
neighbour policy. We take every action 
to ensure Sukari has the minimum 
impact on the social environment, as 
well as to deliver positive benefits to 
Egypt and the community as a result of 
our investment, and further details of 
our various initiatives can be found in 
the CSR report.
Our work force is remunerated well 
above the average for Egypt and our 
career development programmes 
are highly valued. In general we 
enjoy a very positive and constructive 
relationship with our employees.
outlook
Our longer‑term production and cost 
forecasts remain unchanged and there 
remains scope for significant additional 
production increases as productivity 
in the various areas of the expanded 
Sukari operation is further optimised.
Safety remains a priority and our 
target is a lost time injury rate of zero 
during 2016.
Guidance for 2016 is for 470,000 
ounces at US$680/ounce cash 
operating cost and US$900/ounce 
all‑in sustaining cost. Whilst this 
guidance implies further material 
production growth at Sukari, the 
key focus for the operation during 
the year is on realising the potential 
for additional productivity and cost 
efficiencies. 
The productivity levels achieved during 
2013 in the pre‑expansion process 
plant, together with the various design 
improvements implemented during 
the Stage 4 project, provide us with 
confidence that the expanded plant 
will achieve, in time, production levels 
materially above current levels. At the 
underground mine, we see potential 
for further incremental productivity 
increases whilst the priority remains 
stable grade delivery. The additional 
shareholder value that can be gained 
from this continued drive for efficiency 
has the potential to be significant 
and requires no material capital 
expenditure. 
The objective, as always, is to generate 
substantial free cash flow even under 
challenging gold price assumptions. 
We intend to return 15‑30% of this 
cash flow to our shareholders, in 
line with our dividend policy, and to 
allocate the remainder towards our 
medium‑ and long‑term objective 
of organic growth aimed at realising 
incremental shareholder value 
and returns.
We take every action to ensure Sukari has the minimum 
impact on the social environment, as well as to deliver 
positive benefits to Egypt and the community as a result 
of our investment. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
Centamin plc Annual report 2015 
strategic report
17
No capital expenditure for expansion 
or project development is planned 
for 2016.
Exploration at Sukari continues to 
prioritise extensions of the high‑grade 
underground resource and reserve 
and we expect to continue to deliver 
positive news in line with our strong 
results to date. A resource and reserve 
update is planned during 2016.
In West Africa, we expect a total 
exploration expenditure of circa 
US$25 million in 2016, with the 
largest proportion on the advanced 
exploration programme in Burkina 
Faso. In line with our overall 
exploration strategy, the actual 
expenditure on these projects is results 
driven and the current estimated 
expenditures are therefore subject 
to ongoing revisions.
We will continue to evaluate potential 
opportunities to grow the business 
through the acquisition of projects 
offering the potential for the Company 
to deliver on its strategic objectives. 
Finally, I would like to thank all my 
colleagues for their hard work over 
the years including the employees 
onsite at Sukari, those on the 
exploration sites in Burkina Faso, 
Côte d’Ivoire and Ethiopia as well 
as those in the corporate and 
administration offices in Jersey and 
Australia. I would also like to thank 
your board of directors for their 
continued support and I am very much 
looking forward to another prosperous 
year for Centamin and its stakeholders 
in 2016.

Our flagship Sukari Gold Mine has 
continued to deliver substantial free 
cash flows.
With the completion of the Stage 4 expansion project in 2014, the Sukari 
operation has transitioned out of its investment phase, where cash flows were 
used to fund the staged construction, and into a sustainable period of free cash 
flow generation over the remaining life of mine. As production continues to rise 
towards our base‑case target of 450,000 to 500,000 ounces per annum, cash 
operating costs are expected to be US$680 per ounce and all‑in sustaining costs 
are expected to be US$900 per ounce in 2016, with potential to reduce further in 
the coming years. Centamin has no debt or hedging and is therefore financially 
robust, is well positioned to benefit from a recovery in the gold price, and has the 
financial flexibility to grow both organically and through strategic acquisitions.
kpis reported during the year: 
•	 cash operating cost of US$713 per ounce;
•	 all‑in sustaining cost of US$885 per ounce; and
•	 revenue was driven by increased production offset by the lower average gold 
price of US$1,159 per ounce.
kpis set for 2016:
•	 targeted US$680 cash operating cost per ounce;
•	 targeted US$900 all‑in sustaining cost per ounce; and
•	 revenue increase proportional to production growth.

The 2015 dividend of approximately 
US$33.7m sits at the top end of our 
policy to pay out 15‑30% of our net 
free cashflow.
Having successfully built a substantial gold mining operation through a staged 
expansion programme and with a total of circa US$1.1 billion capital investment 
in Egypt, the Company is placed in a strong competitive position, with low cost 
production, solid growth potential and a stable balance sheet. In recognition 
of this, the board of directors declared a maiden dividend in August 2014 and 
a final dividend for the year, which totalled 2.86 US cents per share for 2014 
(totalling approximately US$33 million). In 2015, an interim dividend of 0.97 US 
cents per share was paid and a final dividend of 1.97 US cents per share will 
be paid to shareholders following the AGM on 11 May 2016. The ex‑dividend 
date is 21 April 2016 for lSE listed shareholders and 20 April 2016 for TSX listed 
shareholders. The record date for both exchanges is 22 April 2016.

RISk MANAGEMENT
The process for identifying and assessing risk is an integral and 
inseparable part of the group’s performance culture and processes 
and is therefore at the core of our business.
Understanding the risks the group faces and managing 
them appropriately allows the group to improve its decision 
making process, deliver on its objectives and therefore 
improve its performance as a mining company.
The exploration for and development of metals and mineral 
resources, together with the construction and development 
of mining operations is an activity that involves a high 
degree of risk.
This group can only manage, rather than eliminate risk and 
the following summarises how the group identifies, assesses 
and manages risks.
The board retains overall responsibility for assessing the 
effectiveness of the Company’s systems for management 
of material business risks. The board discharges the 
responsibility of implementing risk management systems 
to the executive management and the monitoring of risk 
and internal controls is delegated to the audit and risk 
committee.
The teams in Egypt, Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire are 
responsible for managing the operational risks in their 
respective areas and report on these to management.
Centamin conducts a variety of risk assessments throughout 
the year, including assessing risks daily at an operational 
level, risk assessment as part of the monthly reporting 
process, annual business continuity planning, preparations 
for five year forecasts, as well as planning over the longer 
term, such as the preparation of impairment and life of 
mine models.
The audit and risk committee and the board are pleased to 
confirm that the Company remains in compliance with best 
practice guidelines and with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and relevant Canadian requirements. The latest 
edition of the Code (September 2014) contained a number 
of changes including an increased focus on how risk is 
governed and managed, with new provisions on the robust 
assessment of solvency and liquidity, continuous monitoring 
of systems of internal control and a statement on business 
viability. Details of our viability statement can be found on 
page 37 and our going concern statement can be found on 
page 103.
This risk assessment carried out by the group covers the 
following key areas:
•	 operational risks within the business;
•	 corporate risks (identified as either strategic or 
operational in nature); and
•	 principal risks based on the corporate risk register.
The assessment identifies the risks facing the business and 
we consider the annual assessment to be suitably robust, 
covering strategic and operational risks at a corporate level 
and risks identified at our operations in Egypt, Burkina Faso 
and Côte d’Ivoire.
The assessment carried out during the year, which also 
took note of the work carried out by the internal auditor, 
concluded that there were adequate procedures, polices 
and controls in place at an operational level and that the 
risks at a corporate level, taking into account the Company’s 
strategic objectives, had been adequately identified. The 
areas for improvement following the review were as follows:
•	 improvements in documenting the process for identifying 
risks at a corporate level and linking the risks to the 
organisation’s objectives;
•	 at present, risks do not have assigned owners, making 
it difficult to hold management to account for the 
mitigation of these risks;
•	 risk management procedures are needed to more clearly 
define the risks and the responsible persons to help 
define the roles and responsibilities; and
•	 more training needed in identifying and responding 
to risk.
As part of the review process, it was decided to update 
the existing corporate policy on risk and the board adopted 
a revised and updated risk management framework 
agreement. The risk management framework includes 
additional detail about the scope and structure of an 
executive risk management working group. 
It was noted that the areas of improvement identified 
following the review were not seen as significant failings 
or weaknesses, but reflect the breadth and scope of 
the review.
Having considered the risks in detail, the key principal risks 
have been identified and are set out on page 34. The risks 
reflected in the matrix and the mitigating actions reflect the 
key principal risks to the Company and its stakeholders.
The board has overall responsibility for establishing risk 
across Centamin through a robust risk management system 
that allows for the assessment and management of material 
strategic and operational risks. In addition, the board is 
responsible for articulating the group’s risk appetite against 
the principal risks. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information

The audit and risk committee monitors the risk management 
and internal control structure implemented by management. 
It advises on significant changes to that structure so as to 
obtain reasonable assurance that the Company’s assets 
are safeguarded and that reliable financial records are 
maintained. The committee assists in developing the risk 
environment, making suggestions on ways in which the 
business can improve its internal reporting. The committee 
receives comprehensive monthly reporting information from 
the group’s operations and enhanced reporting in the event 
of an incident.
The other committees of the board ensure that their areas 
of responsibility take account of the group’s risk strategy and 
any matters relating to risk identification are raised directly 
to the board on a quarterly basis.
The CEO, aided by the senior management team, is 
responsible for developing short‑, medium‑ and long‑term 
corporate strategies for the group, preparing business plans 
and reports with senior management and reporting to the 
board on current and future initiatives. In developing the 
corporate strategy, the CEO ensures that the group has the 
appropriate risk management practices and policies in place 
and assesses business opportunities which are of potential 
benefit to the group taking into account its strategic 
objectives and risk appetite.
The executive management team is responsible for 
defining, debating and challenging the nature of the 
principal and corporate risks, and for ensuring that risk 
management is consistently applied within the group. The 
executive and key personnel within management meet 
regularly to discuss new and emerging risks for the group. 
At an operational level, the heads of department are 
responsible for implementing the requirements of the risk 
management framework and providing assurance to the 
executive management that the work has been carried out.
The internal auditor reports primarily to the audit and risk 
committee and provides an independent viewpoint and 
assurance over certain strategic risks and the controls that 
are in place to mitigate the risks. The internal auditor also 
assists the business in monitoring the effectiveness of the 
risk management and internal control environment. See 
page 100 for further details on the role and scope of the 
internal auditor.
The external auditor designs procedures to assess the 
risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, 
looking particularly at subjective judgments that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are 
inherently uncertain. The responsibilities of the group and 
those of the external auditor in forming their opinion are set 
out in the independent auditor’s report on page 105.
activity during 2015 relating to risk management 
During the year, the audit and risk committee and the board 
evaluated their risk management processes and reporting. 
In evaluating the current processes and taking advice and 
guidance from both the external and internal auditors, they 
have prepared a revised and updated risk management 
framework. During 2016, the updated framework will 
assist the Company to enhance reporting and information 
flows to the board and assist the board, aided by the audit 
and risk committee, in assessing the effectiveness of the 
Company’s systems for management of material strategic 
and operational risks. In addition, the following reports were 
prepared for the audit and risk committee’s review:
•	 comprehensive control environment memorandum and 
recommendations for further improvement prepared by 
the management team;
•	 monthly and quarterly reporting on the operational 
activity, including enhanced reporting on any significant 
operational and corporate issues;
•	 internal audit work on the risk management structure 
and recommendations on developing the reporting and 
information flows between the operational areas and 
the board;
•	 external audit work culminating in the annual and 
half‑yearly audit report; and
•	 significant incident reports.
targets in 2016
The board and the audit and risk committee will use the 
risk framework agreement to influence the type and form 
of risk information that is currently reported to management 
and the board. The board will also consider the approach 
taken to, and effectiveness in, influencing the Company’s 
risk appetite and risk culture throughout the organisation. 
Activities that will be taking place during 2016 include:
•	 embedding the risk management framework within the 
organisation;
•	 enhancing the reporting to the board at a strategic and 
operational level;
•	 considering further our risk appetite towards strategic 
risks and strategic objectives; and
•	 continuing with its work to improve the control 
environment and updating the control environment

RISk MANAGEMENT continued
principal risks
Centamin takes a number of measures to mitigate risks associated with its underlying operational 
and exploration activity which are monitored and evaluated regularly. Due to the nature of 
these inherent risks, it is not possible to give absolute assurance that mitigating actions will be 
wholly effective. 
riSk category treND NatUre oF riSk MitigatioN coMMeNtary

single project dependency
Neutral The Sukari Project currently constitutes Centamin’ s main mineral resource and sole mineral reserve 
and near‑term production and revenue. The resource at the advanced stage of exploration in 
Burkina Faso is not currently of a sufficient size to convert into a reserve. The regional exploration 
of the licence portfolio in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire continues on the existing 1.92Moz 
indicated and 1.33Moz inferred resource.
The project at Sukari has two distinct ore sources (open pit and underground) and the processing 
plant has two separate flotation circuits and two separate power stations. Whilst one project, the 
nature of the design of the plant provides adequate mitigation and reduces the relative likelihood of 
dependence compared to a single layer plant design. The second circuit of the processing plant has 
been fully operational for over twelve months which shows the resilience of the project. In addition, 
the plant is fed by both the open pit and underground operation, providing high and lower‑grade 
ore to the processing plant. Operational activity and production is expected to continue at above 
nameplate capacity. Other mitigating factors include the continued focus on longer term growth and 
expansion through exploration and acquisition targets both inside and outside of Egypt.
Until further production growth beyond Sukari 
is identified, the potential impact remains high 
and safeguarding the project is paramount to 
the Company.
iNterNaL strategic risK
sukari project joint venture risk 
and relationship with eMra 
Neutral Whilst Centamin retains control over the project, the joint venture holding company, Sukari 
Gold Mines (“SGM”), is jointly owned with EMRA with equal board representation from both 
parties. The board of SGM operates by way of simple majority. As such, should the board of 
SGM be unable to reach consensus on a matter requiring board level approval or in the event 
of any dispute that may arise which can’t otherwise be amicably resolved, arbitration or other 
proceedings may need to be employed to resolve any disputes.
These include ensuring co‑operative and timely correspondence, maintaining good relations with 
EMRA and making sure that the terms and conditions of the Concession Agreement governing the 
mine are fully complied with.
Current discussions with EMRA are focused on the cost recovery process and determining the exact 
timing and quantum of the first payment of profit share for Sukari, as well as the interpretation of 
certain provisions of the Concession Agreement. Centamin has shown its willingness to assist EMRA 
through prepayments in relation to future profit share.
The successful management of the Sukari Gold 
Mine is in part dependent on maintaining a good 
working relationship with EMRA. The group has 
regular meetings with officials from EMRA and invests 
time in liaising with relevant ministry and other 
governmental representatives. 
eXterNaL Strategic riSk
gold price and currency exposure 
Neutral The Company does not currently hedge against the price of gold or exposure to currencies. Centamin manages its exposure to gold price by keeping operating costs as low as possible. 
Revenues from gold sales are in US dollars and Centamin has exposure to costs in other currencies 
including Egyptian pounds, Australian dollars and sterling. Natural hedges against currency 
fluctuations are utilised wherever possible to offset foreign currency liabilities.
The group is 100% exposed to the gold price, 
however, the cash costs of the Sukari Gold Mine 
remain low compared with the industry norm.
iNterNaL strategic risK
Jurisdictional taxation exposure 
Neutral The group’ s corporate structure includes operational activity in Egypt and West Africa held 
through holding companies in Australia and the United Kingdom. 
Exposure to changing cross jurisdictional tax legislation could have an adverse effect of the 
Company’ s ability to repatriate revenues. The group engages tax advisers to provide local advice at 
an operational level as well as corporate and structuring advice at a corporate level.
See note 7 in the financial statements for details of 
the tax liability through the Australian holding group 
of companies.
eXterNaL Strategic riSk
political risk – sukari
Improved The Company’ s operational activities are primarily in Egypt, a country which has been subject to 
civil and military disturbance. Future political and economic conditions in Egypt could change with 
future governments adopting different policies that may impact the development and ownership 
of mineral resources. Policy changes and licensing may also impact the use of explosives, tenure of 
mineral concessions, taxation, royalties, exchange rates, environmental protection, labour relations 
and repatriation of income and capital. Changes may also impact the ability to import key supplies 
and export gold.
The Concession Agreement with EMRA and the Egyptian government, was declared into Egyptian 
law no. 222 of 1994 which further protects the Company’ s licence rights and sets the applicable 
tax regime for a number of years. The law received full parliamentary approval as required by 
Egyptian law.
In respect to the Company’ s operations in Egypt, 
the potential for serious impact should be balanced 
against the Egyptian government’ s support of 
Centamin’ s investment and contribution to both 
revenue and development of the mining industry. 
New laws have been introduced to protect and 
therefore encourage foreign investment which is 
a positive step for the country. This new law was 
recently confirmed by the newly installed Parliament, 
although law no. 32 remains subject to a challenge in 
the Supreme Court.
eXterNaL Strategic riSk 
political risk – West africa
Neutral The Company operates in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. There are no assurances that future 
political and economic conditions in these countries will not result in the governments adopting 
different policies in respect to foreign development and ownership of exploration and  
exploitation licences.
Centamin actively monitors legal and political developments, engaging in dialogue with relevant 
government and legal policy makers to discuss all key legal and regulatory developments. 
Policies have developed over many years to 
encourage foreign investment and the development 
of mining operations, which continues to be the focus 
of governments in these regions.
iNterNaL operatioNaL riSk
reserve and resource estimate
Neutral Mineral resource and reserve figures are prepared by Centamin personnel and reviewed by 
externally appointed independent geologists. By their nature, mineral resources and reserves 
are estimates based on a range of assumptions, including geological, metallurgical, technical 
and economic factors. Other variables include expected costs, inflation rates, gold price and 
production outputs. There can be no guarantee that the anticipated tonnages or grades expected 
by Centamin will be achieved both from the underground operation or open pit.
Management has implemented processes to continuously monitor and evaluate the current life of 
the Sukari Gold Mine, mine plans and production targets.
The most recent technical update was completed in 
Form 43‑101 dated 23 October 2015 and is available 
at www.sedar.com. Details of the reserve and resource 
can be found on pages 50 and 51.
iNterNaL operatioNaL riSk
Failure to achieve production estimates
Improved Centamin prepares annual estimates for future gold production from the Sukari Gold Mine. 
There can be no assurance that Centamin will achieve its production estimates and such failure 
could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’ s future cash flows, profitability, results of 
operations and financial condition. It should be specifically noted that the potential quantity and 
grade from the Sukari underground mine is conceptual in nature, that there has been insufficient 
exploration to define a mineral resource and that it is uncertain if further exploration will result in 
the target being delineated as a mineral resource.
The realisation of production estimates are dependent on, amongst other things: the accuracy of 
mineral reserve and resource estimates; the accuracy of assumptions regarding ore grades and 
recovery rates; the ore tonnes and grade mined from the underground operation which are outside 
the current reserve base; ground conditions, a skilled and motivated labour force: processing 
capacity and maintenance policies and logistics for consumables and parts.
Whilst there can be no certainties, production to date 
has provided confidence in management’ s estimation 
and mine planning methods and with the fully 
operational expanded processing plant, the prospect 
of improvements in reliable forecasting is increased.
eXterNaL operatioNaL riSk
Litigation
Improved Centamin’ s finances, and its ability to operate in Egypt, may be severely adversely affected by 
current and any future litigation proceedings and it is possible that further litigation could be 
initiated against Centamin at any time. Centamin is currently involved in litigation that relates both 
to (a) the validity of its exploitation lease at Sukari and (b) the price at which it can purchase Diesel 
Fuel Oil. Full details of the current litigation can be found on page 133.
In order to mitigate this risk Centamin has (a) engaged appropriate legal advice and continues to 
actively pursue its legal rights with respect to the existing litigation and its legal advisers believe that 
Centamin will ultimately be successful in both of these cases; and (b) actively monitors both activity 
in court and local media for signs of any legislative developments that may threaten its operations, 
finances or prospects.
The potential for serious impact should be balanced 
against Centamin’ s adherence to local laws and 
agreements, as well as the Egyptian government’ s 
support of Centamin’ s investment and law no. 32 of 
2014 that should protect Centamin against litigation 
of this nature as well the fact that Egypt and Australia 
have in place a bilateral investment treaty. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information

nameplate capacity. Other mitigating factors include the continued focus on longer term growth and 
expansion through exploration and acquisition targets both inside and outside of Egypt.
Until further production growth beyond Sukari 
is identified, the potential impact remains high 
and safeguarding the project is paramount to 
the Company.

sukari project joint venture risk 
and relationship with eMra 
Neutral Whilst Centamin retains control over the project, the joint venture holding company, Sukari 
Gold Mines (“SGM”), is jointly owned with EMRA with equal board representation from both 
parties. The board of SGM operates by way of simple majority. As such, should the board of 
SGM be unable to reach consensus on a matter requiring board level approval or in the event 
of any dispute that may arise which can’t otherwise be amicably resolved, arbitration or other 
proceedings may need to be employed to resolve any disputes.
These include ensuring co‑operative and timely correspondence, maintaining good relations with 
EMRA and making sure that the terms and conditions of the Concession Agreement governing the 
mine are fully complied with.
Current discussions with EMRA are focused on the cost recovery process and determining the exact 
timing and quantum of the first payment of profit share for Sukari, as well as the interpretation of 
certain provisions of the Concession Agreement. Centamin has shown its willingness to assist EMRA 
through prepayments in relation to future profit share.
The successful management of the Sukari Gold 
Mine is in part dependent on maintaining a good 
working relationship with EMRA. The group has 
regular meetings with officials from EMRA and invests 
time in liaising with relevant ministry and other 
governmental representatives. 
eXterNaL Strategic riSk
gold price and currency exposure 
Neutral The Company does not currently hedge against the price of gold or exposure to currencies. Centamin manages its exposure to gold price by keeping operating costs as low as possible. 
Revenues from gold sales are in US dollars and Centamin has exposure to costs in other currencies 
including Egyptian pounds, Australian dollars and sterling. Natural hedges against currency 
fluctuations are utilised wherever possible to offset foreign currency liabilities.
The group is 100% exposed to the gold price, 
however, the cash costs of the Sukari Gold Mine 
remain low compared with the industry norm.
iNterNaL strategic risK
Jurisdictional taxation exposure 
Neutral The group’ s corporate structure includes operational activity in Egypt and West Africa held 
through holding companies in Australia and the United Kingdom. 
Exposure to changing cross jurisdictional tax legislation could have an adverse effect of the 
Company’ s ability to repatriate revenues. The group engages tax advisers to provide local advice at 
an operational level as well as corporate and structuring advice at a corporate level.
See note 7 in the financial statements for details of 
the tax liability through the Australian holding group 
of companies.

political risk – sukari
Improved The Company’ s operational activities are primarily in Egypt, a country which has been subject to 
civil and military disturbance. Future political and economic conditions in Egypt could change with 
future governments adopting different policies that may impact the development and ownership 
of mineral resources. Policy changes and licensing may also impact the use of explosives, tenure of 
mineral concessions, taxation, royalties, exchange rates, environmental protection, labour relations 
and repatriation of income and capital. Changes may also impact the ability to import key supplies 
and export gold.
The Concession Agreement with EMRA and the Egyptian government, was declared into Egyptian 
law no. 222 of 1994 which further protects the Company’ s licence rights and sets the applicable 
tax regime for a number of years. The law received full parliamentary approval as required by 
Egyptian law.
In respect to the Company’ s operations in Egypt, 
the potential for serious impact should be balanced 
against the Egyptian government’ s support of 
Centamin’ s investment and contribution to both 
revenue and development of the mining industry. 
New laws have been introduced to protect and 
therefore encourage foreign investment which is 
a positive step for the country. This new law was 
recently confirmed by the newly installed Parliament, 
although law no. 32 remains subject to a challenge in 
the Supreme Court.
eXterNaL Strategic riSk 
political risk – West africa
Neutral The Company operates in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. There are no assurances that future 
political and economic conditions in these countries will not result in the governments adopting 
different policies in respect to foreign development and ownership of exploration and  
exploitation licences.
Centamin actively monitors legal and political developments, engaging in dialogue with relevant 
government and legal policy makers to discuss all key legal and regulatory developments. 
Policies have developed over many years to 
encourage foreign investment and the development 
of mining operations, which continues to be the focus 
of governments in these regions.
iNterNaL operatioNaL riSk
reserve and resource estimate
Neutral Mineral resource and reserve figures are prepared by Centamin personnel and reviewed by 
externally appointed independent geologists. By their nature, mineral resources and reserves 
are estimates based on a range of assumptions, including geological, metallurgical, technical 
and economic factors. Other variables include expected costs, inflation rates, gold price and 
production outputs. There can be no guarantee that the anticipated tonnages or grades expected 
by Centamin will be achieved both from the underground operation or open pit.
Management has implemented processes to continuously monitor and evaluate the current life of 
the Sukari Gold Mine, mine plans and production targets.
The most recent technical update was completed in 
Form 43‑101 dated 23 October 2015 and is available 
at www.sedar.com. Details of the reserve and resource 
can be found on pages 50 and 51.
iNterNaL operatioNaL riSk
Failure to achieve production estimates
Improved Centamin prepares annual estimates for future gold production from the Sukari Gold Mine. 
There can be no assurance that Centamin will achieve its production estimates and such failure 
could have a material and adverse effect on Centamin’ s future cash flows, profitability, results of 
operations and financial condition. It should be specifically noted that the potential quantity and 
grade from the Sukari underground mine is conceptual in nature, that there has been insufficient 
exploration to define a mineral resource and that it is uncertain if further exploration will result in 
the target being delineated as a mineral resource.
The realisation of production estimates are dependent on, amongst other things: the accuracy of 
mineral reserve and resource estimates; the accuracy of assumptions regarding ore grades and 
recovery rates; the ore tonnes and grade mined from the underground operation which are outside 
the current reserve base; ground conditions, a skilled and motivated labour force: processing 
capacity and maintenance policies and logistics for consumables and parts.
Whilst there can be no certainties, production to date 
has provided confidence in management’ s estimation 
and mine planning methods and with the fully 
operational expanded processing plant, the prospect 
of improvements in reliable forecasting is increased.
eXterNaL operatioNaL riSk
Litigation
Improved Centamin’ s finances, and its ability to operate in Egypt, may be severely adversely affected by 
current and any future litigation proceedings and it is possible that further litigation could be 
initiated against Centamin at any time. Centamin is currently involved in litigation that relates both 
to (a) the validity of its exploitation lease at Sukari and (b) the price at which it can purchase Diesel 
Fuel Oil. Full details of the current litigation can be found on page 133.
In order to mitigate this risk Centamin has (a) engaged appropriate legal advice and continues to 
actively pursue its legal rights with respect to the existing litigation and its legal advisers believe that 
Centamin will ultimately be successful in both of these cases; and (b) actively monitors both activity 
in court and local media for signs of any legislative developments that may threaten its operations, 
finances or prospects.
The potential for serious impact should be balanced 
against Centamin’ s adherence to local laws and 
agreements, as well as the Egyptian government’ s 
support of Centamin’ s investment and law no. 32 of 
2014 that should protect Centamin against litigation 
of this nature as well the fact that Egypt and Australia 
have in place a bilateral investment treaty.
The descriptions below describe the current status of the principal risks affecting Centamin and 
its operational and exploration activities together with the measures to mitigate risk. Centamin plc Annual report 2015

One of our main objectives is to achieve a target of zero 
injuries and for every employee to be safe every day. 
The control environment and operating practices in place 
at our mining and exploration operations help reduce 
the likelihood of harm to our employees. We are also 
committed to attracting, energising, developing and 
training our workforce to ensure they are highly skilled 
and motivated. In the fourth quarter, the Sukari Gold Mine 
operation encountered its first fatality, when a contractor’s 
employee was involved in a rock collapse whilst relocating 
a grade control drill rig. The incident was thoroughly 
investigated and more details on the incident can be found 
in the CSR report on page 38 and operational report on 
page 48. Earlier in 2015, an incident occurred in Burkina 
Faso on a public road near the Konkera village which 
resulted in a local employee being fatally wounded and 
another sustaining injuries. A thorough investigation into 
this bandit attack on two of our vehicles has been carried 
out. Further additional security measures were implemented 
following the incident.
We recognise the value of being a socially responsible 
employer and the importance of engaging with the wider 
community in the areas in which we operate. By investing in 
the community and engaging in projects that directly and 
positively impact local people, we can foster a co‑operative 
working environment. Full details of our community 
projects and local initiatives are set out in our CSR report on 
page 46.
The trend column on page 34 indicates the relative 
movement (either adverse, neutral or improving) for 
each principal risk, over the last twelve months. This 
trend represents the views of the Company based on 
their experience operating and working in the relevant 
jurisdictions.
risk appetite
Risk appetite forms an integral part of corporate 
governance and in defining risk appetite the board has 
given consideration to the following:
a) the Company’s strategy, objectives and specific goals;
b) acceptable risk tolerances, the parameters for acceptable 
risk and attitudes towards risk;
c) existing policies, processes and practices within the 
group to ensure risks are managed within the acceptable 
and agreed limits;
d) the competitive environment with consideration of 
shareholders’ views and the need to reassess or more 
fully communicate risk appetite; and
e) short‑term risk which needs to be specifically managed.
The group’s employees are paramount to the success of 
the organisation and therefore the group’s policies and 
procedures demand the lowest levels of risk appetite 
and risk tolerance for employee and contractor health, 
safety and wellbeing. The group has a higher risk appetite 
towards its strategic objectives, such that risks are reduced 
to reasonably practicable levels, in the pursuit of mineral 
exploration, development and gold production. Meeting 
environmental, regulatory and legal obligations takes 
priority over other business objectives.

The group’s risks may change over time, as will the group’s 
risk appetite statement, as the external environment 
changes and as operations are expanded into new 
geographical areas. The risk management and review 
process requires regular monitoring of the Company’s 
existing risks and the identification of any new and 
emerging risks facing the Company, including financial 
and non‑financial matters. It also requires the ongoing 
management of the appropriateness of the risk mitigation 
in place.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, the 
directors have assessed the Company’s prospects over 
the longer term, addressing a period of five years. A key 
part of the directors’ assessment was a review carried out 
in May 2015 for business reasons which also assisted the 
process of formalising a review of the longer term viability 
of the Company. The assessment took into account the 
Company’s position and progress against its four strategic 
focus areas including generating free cash flow, shareholder 
return, growth and social responsibility. The strategic focus 
areas are set out on page 18. In addition, the Company 
considered the potential impact on its principal risks, and 
also considered how its appetite for risk might affect the 
assessment. The May 2015 review allowed management 
to share the Company’s strategic objectives with key 
stakeholders and to explain the Company’s business model 
and its prospects over the coming five years.
The review received board approval and formed the basis of 
an investor presentation. The financial forecasts used in the 
review included key assumptions about gold price, future 
production levels, operating and capital costs, cash flows 
and the group’s balance sheet and shareholder returns. 
The operational forecasts included mining and process 
plant throughput levels, grades and metallurgical recovery 
rates. The operation at Sukari has a low cost‑per‑ounce of 
production compared with other operating mines, which 
contributes to the Company’s longer term viability.
Although the business does prepare plans over a longer 
time horizon, notably in the Sukari life of mine models, the 
Company chose five years for its viability statement due 
to the level of rigour and detail involved in the May 2015 
review process.
As part of the May 2015 review process the potential 
impact on the group’s principal risks was considered, at 
both a strategic and operational level. Of the principal risks 
identified on pages 34 and 35 those with the most potential 
to impact negatively upon the Company’s ongoing viability, 
include the gold price, the relationship with its joint venture 
partner, political risk and the ongoing litigation in Egypt. 
A sensitivity analysis was carried out on the key inputs to 
the financial and operational forecasts, including sensitivity 
analysis on the average gold price.
The May 2015 investor presentation, together with the 
latest presentations can be viewed on the Company’s 
website which contain the latest up‑to‑date operational 
and financial forecasts.
As well as the May 2015 review, the directors’ overall 
assessment took into account the Company’s resource and 
reserve statement, which was completed in September 
2015 and underpins longer‑term strategic and operational 
projections. The relevant 43‑101 Technical Report can be 
viewed at www.sedar.com and on the Company’s website.
The management team also considers strategic, operational 
and compliance risks throughout the year and produces the 
following reports and documents for board and audit and 
risk committee review to support it in making the formal 
viability statement:
•	 operational risk assessment register and corporate 
risk matrix;
•	 annual impairment review;
•	 going concern review;
•	 life of mine model;
•	 business continuity planning; and
•	 monthly and annual budgets.
On the basis of all the procedures outlined above, the 
directors confirmed on the date of this report that they have 
a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the five‑year period of their assessment.

Dear shareholders
I am presenting this report in my capacity as chairman of the 
health, safety, environmental and sustainability committee 
(“HSES”), a committee of the board of Centamin plc.
The committee is responsible for making recommendations 
to the board on all matters in connection with issues of 
the environment, workplace health and safety, and the 
development of sustainable engagement with communities 
and stakeholders.
During the year the HSES committee worked closely with 
management on the following matters:
•	 review monthly and quarterly reporting on corporate 
sustainable development issues and initiatives;
•	 develop and implement HSES policies in Burkina Faso 
and Côte d’Ivoire;
•	 complete existing community initiatives at Sukari and the 
neighbouring town, Marsa Alam;
•	 steer community initiatives in Burkina Faso and 
Côte d’Ivoire;
•	 review of environmental, health, safety and contingency 
planning issues; and
•	 review of incident reports relating to the two fatalities 
occurring in 2015 (one incident in Burkina Faso and one 
incident occurring at Sukari).
Key issues were raised by the committee during the year 
and in particular the committee assisted in progressing the 
segregation of material in the scrap yard at Sukari. 
The committee was also encouraged by the level of training 
undertaken at Sukari, with many employees achieving 
certification following tailored training programmes in the 
following areas:
•	 fire safety training;
•	 emergency response training; and
•	 hygiene standards.
One of our main priorities is for each employee to return 
home safely at the end of each day having worked in a 
zero‑harm environment. Our safety and l TIFR has improved 
further this year; however, it is regrettable that Sukari 
experienced its first fatality during 2015. An unfortunate 
incident occurred within the open pit operation, when a 
contractor’s employee was involved in a rock collapse whilst 
relocating a grade control drill rig. The operator, and sole 
occupant of the drill rig, was fatally injured in the incident.
The committee was consulted and informed by 
management as the incident, the response and the 
follow‑up investigation unfolded. The committee praised 
the work of the response team and also the leadership 
onsite in the aftermath of the incident, ensuring personnel 
received regular and reliable information. The committee 
is working with management regarding implementation of 
additional safety measures for any area of the operation 
where there is scope for improvement.
The committee has also been involved in the security 
assessment and follow up community work following the 
unfortunate incident in early 2015 in Burkina Faso. The 
incident, which occurred on a public road near the Konkera 
village, resulted in one of our local employees being fatally 
wounded and another sustaining injuries. 
The wellbeing of our employees is a priority for Centamin 
and the committee will continue to ensure that health and 
workplace safety remain at the top of the agenda.
The report below covers the key HSES issues for Sukari 
and concludes with information relating to the exploration 
activity in Burkina Faso.

Company. The previous chairman of the committee, Bob 
Bowker, retired in January 2015.
Health and safety
Centamin is committed to minimising health and safety 
risks to a reasonably practical level, while striving for a 
zero‑harm and productive work place. We have designed 
and implemented systems, procedures and measures to 
manage occupational health and safety risks. Such systems 
are implemented in full conformity with local legislation, 
licence and permit conditions, as well as international best 
practice standards.
In 2015, we were able to reduce the l TIFR further and we 
continue to strive for an injury‑free environment.
Safety-conscious culture
We realise that safety is the responsibility of all employees 
and pursue the development of a safety culture at our 
sites. We do this by empowering employees, giving them 
responsibility for their wellbeing as well as the safety of the 
colleagues they work alongside. Through training, coaching 
and leading by example, our employees are fully aware of 
the safety requirements and standards expected.
Safety is a main element of discussion in pre‑shift, daily 
planning and weekly safety meetings. Safety alerts are also 
periodically issued and sent to all employees.
proactive approach and emergency response planning
The HSES team onsite prepare and train to respond quickly 
to emergencies. We have developed a detailed emergency 
plan with full response and rescue procedures for different 
potential risk scenarios. The plan is coupled with emergency 
arrangements for different areas of the operation.
Risk assessment is integral to all operational activities onsite 
and we continuously evaluate potential and actual hazards, 
their probability and likely outcomes, to determine the 
level of risk and appropriate risk mitigation and safeguards. 
A variety of different procedures and systems have been 
developed and implemented including job hazard analysis 
for new and non‑recurrent activities.
We undertake emergency drills to test our performance 
and our equipment. In 2015, we undertook 53 emergency 
drills covering different risk scenarios to test our emergency 
response, rescue and evacuation capabilities.
An inspection and maintenance programme is implemented 
to ensure all emergency response equipment is fit for use at 
all times.
The tool box talks are an effective and easy method of 
safety communication. Full‑time trainers are available in 
almost all operational departments to provide in‑field 
training and coaching for the work force. Tool box talks 
before shifts are used to address safety issues, to share 
tips and lessons learnt.
The talk provides an environment for interactive 
discussion and promotes a safety‑conscious culture. 
This timely safety communication addresses numerous 
safety aspects and supplements formal training. Our 
safety professionals are continuously developing 
material for the talks in a simple form using brief text, 
photos and drawings. The tool has proved to be a very 
successful method of continuous safety learning.
The Company is committed to continuously training 
the employees through a comprehensive safety training 
and coaching programme:
•	 a tailored safety induction for new employees, 
contractors and visitors;
•	 incident investigation;
•	 training modules addressing job hazard analysis, 
risk assessments, incident investigations, work 
permits, first aid, fire extinguishing, and hazard 
identification; and
•	 technical competence tuition, such as isolation 
training, lifting procedures, confined space entry, 
hot work and working at height.
Training is repeated regularly through refresher courses 
and employees are all tested to ensure a high level 
of understanding and application. The training is 
undertaken by the onsite HSE department. Mandatory 
training is rolled out for all departments, encompassing 
area‑specific training, field training and coaching.

contractor management 
All contractors operating onsite are required to adhere to 
the implemented safety management system, whether 
they work for long periods of time or for short assignments. 
Currently there are around 485 permanent contractors 
at Sukari.
We provide and share information with our contracting 
teams, in support of our compliance and safety procedures. 
Contractors are provided with a standard health and safety 
induction upon their arrival at site and given full access to 
health services available onsite.
tracking safety performance and safety 
performance indicators 
A core element of our management system is to assess our 
safety performance and identify areas for improvement. The 
evaluation of our safety performance is essential to indicate 
the effectiveness of our systems and controls and to identify 
opportunities for continuous improvement. In that regard, 
we have monitoring systems in place for:
•	 workplace and occupational health parameters;
•	 occupational health parameters to detect health impacts 
due to work‑related matters;
•	 fitness to work to detect personnel under the influence 
of alcohol or illegal drugs;
•	 implementation of safety procedures and standards to 
ensure they are assimilated and adhered to; and 
•	 stability of structures to detect any potential movement, 
cracks or other instabilities. 
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIbILITy continued
Creating and maintaining a qualified emergency team 
is an essential element of emergency preparedness. 
At Sukari, we have structured a very competent 
response and rescue team to be immediately 
mobilised in case of emergency situations. The team 
has received ample training and was coached for a 
year by a resident emergency response expert. The 
capacity building programme includes theoretical and 
practical training as well as drills to simulate different 
emergency situations. The team is equipped with the 
required response equipment, supplies and rescue 
facilities. A training plan is implemented to ensure full 
competence of the team. As noted earlier, in the HSE 
chairman’s summary, the committee praised the work 
of the response team at Sukari in the aftermath of the 
unfortunate incident that occurred within the open pit 
operation in the fourth quarter.
caSe StUDy – eStaBLiSHiNg a capaBLe

Monitoring methodology includes measurements, medical 
surveillance, auditing and visual inspection, as well as 
systematic observation of the work and behaviour of staff. 
Measurements are performed through in‑house capabilities 
as well as third‑party entities. Reactive or responsive 
evaluation is also undertaken to investigate and analyse 
incidents and to identify root causes to help implement 
corrective measures. The information collated from these 
processes is reported to the committee on a monthly and 
quarterly basis.
All employees and contractors are required to report all 
hazards, near‑misses and incidents for investigation and 
analysis. This embodies the principles adopted by the 
HSES policies and procedures that everyone shares and 
contributes in a responsible manner to creating a safe 
working environment.
Our safety performance in 2015 saw a considerable 
improvement in our lost time injury (“l TI”) frequency rate 
and a slight increase in our medical treated injury (“MTI”) 
frequency rate. We have had one fatal incident at Sukari 
which occurred in 2015. 
This incident was investigated and duly reported to 
authorities and occurred within the open pit operation, 
when a contractor’s employee was involved in a rock 
collapse whilst relocating a grade control drill rig. The 
operator, and sole occupant of the drill rig, was fatally

Health and wellbeing
We pay the utmost attention to the wellbeing of our 
employees and their protection from exposure to 
occupational health risks. We provide protective measures 
and equipment for different operations ensuring the 
equipment is appropriate for the working conditions.
Medical tests, including blood analysis, are conducted 
regularly, particularly for laboratory personnel and those 
working with chemicals and metals. In 2015, the following 
tests and measurements were also carried out and the 
outcomes were as follows:
•	 internal health and hygiene audits confirmed the results 
were within acceptable limits;
•	 water quality sampling and analyses carried out by an 
external laboratory confirmed no major anomalies; and
•	 work environment monitoring and personal exposure 
levels recorded no anomalies and confirmed that Sukari 
was compliant with required standards.
Our health programme has a special focus on food safety 
and hygiene, given we have a large mess that provides 
meals to about 1,500 employees and contractors per 
day. We employ in‑house health and hygiene officers 
who supervise food safety and undertake inspection and 
auditing on all components of the system. Periodic external 
audits are also undertaken for verification. In 2015, the 
programme yielded very satisfactory results and a higher 
level of hygiene was achieved and maintained. 
We provide quality health service for our employees 
onsite and offsite through a comprehensive health 
insurance system.
our employees and contractors
Our people are core to the success of our business. 
We are committed to attracting, energising, developing 
and retaining a highly skilled and experienced workforce. 
The Company’s activities provide direct and indirect 
employment, training and work experience for many 
Egyptian employees. Our workforce has witnessed 
considerable growth since we started production in 2010, 
both in terms of the number of employees and the range 
of skills and expertise of our workforce.
In Egypt, we employ 1,316 people of whom 95% are 
Egyptian. The remaining 5% are experienced expatriate 
mining professionals, which is well below the 10% maximum 
expatriate limit mandated by Egyptian law. Approximately 
50% of our Egyptian nationals are from Upper Egypt, 
the area where Sukari is situated, which typically has less 
economic activity than the more prosperous areas around 
the Nile Delta.
Only 1% of our Egyptian workforce are women and they 
work in the group’s office in Alexandria – this is mainly 
because social conditions in Egypt and in the Middle East 
in general do not encourage the work of female employees 
in remote sites away from their families.

Human resources principles
Our recruitment procedures and standards are innovative 
and target those who will have not only the relevant 
competence, skills and qualifications, but who have 
potential for growth and development and could integrate 
within a large work team working in a remote area. 
Our human resources policy provides the framework within 
which we operate. It delineates the rights, obligations and 
benefits for employees. Our policies ensure:
•	 all employees have the same rights and obligations and 
there is no discrimination based on religious grounds, 
nationality or political views;
•	 employment decisions, such as hiring and promotion are 
based on the ability of a person to perform the job in 
question, without regard to personal characteristics that 
are unrelated to the inherent job requirements;
•	 harassment of employees by anyone and in any way is 
not tolerated;
•	 any practices of forced and compulsory labour are not 
allowed in any work related to our activities;
•	 all employees are entitled to a safe healthy work 
environment, and each employee is accountable 
for HSE performance in the Company;
•	 child or forced labour is prohibited, whether in our 
permanent employment or in contractors’ workforces; 
and
•	 we are committed to the highest ethical standards and 
behaviours as firmly rooted in our Code of Conduct. 
The code secures the adherence to set principles and 
promotes confidence in the integrity of the Company.
Contractors are required by their agreements to abide by 
these requirements, and follow‑up checks are carried out to 
establish that our conditions are met.
We expect all employees to uphold our core values of 
honesty and integrity. All employees are encouraged 
to treat their fellow colleagues with respect, dignity 
and common courtesy. All employees are required to 
understand and act in accordance with the Company’s 
requirements and to fully integrate within the work team. 
Annual performance appraisals are undertaken for all 
employees. The appraisal covers several areas including 
the employee’s job knowledge, skills attained during 
the year, quality of work, initiative and innovation. The 
appraisal is undertaken by the immediate supervisor and 
the performance is agreed with the section head. The 
process also identifies the need for training or coaching, 
modification of responsibilities or opportunities to 
undertake more challenging roles and responsibilities.
capacity building and development 
We actively invest in securing the full spectrum of skills and 
competencies needed for effective operations. We adopt 
a comprehensive development plan for each position 
to enhance skills and qualifications for the Egyptian staff 
to become a workforce of international repute in the 
mining industry.
We work with all our employees closely and encourage 
those who show keenness and desire to develop new 
personal skills and experience. External training is arranged 
either onsite or abroad. Special training programmes for 
databases, software and surveys are designed to include 
distant follow‑up and support. 
We value regular communication and feedback with 
employees which helps enhance the efficiency, effectiveness 
and safety of everyday activities and overall operational 
performance.
recreational facilities onsite
In addition to creating a positive work environment, the 
Company believes it is important that employees enjoy their 
time before and after work. The majority of our staff live 
in the Sukari camp, and thus we have invested in a variety 
of leisure facilities such as playing fields, a gymnasium, 
a library, internet access and satellite television. Special 
barbecue dinners are also held at the beach or around 
Sukari and sports tournaments are regularly organised. 
Sukari has also arranged accommodation complexes 
outside the site in Marsa Alam city centre.

the environment
Our HSE policy outlines our commitment to environmental 
responsibility. One of Centamin’s core values is to minimise 
the environmental impact and risk of an environment 
incident from its operations, to a reasonably practical 
level. We remain committed to maintaining, and whenever 
possible exceeding, the high level of environmental 
performance that we have achieved in 2015.
An environmental and social impact assessment 
(“ESIA”) was prepared as part of the project feasibility 
study at Sukari. We strive to maintain high standards 
of environmental performance. We meet, and where 
possible, exceed relevant legal requirements. The system 
is supported by a robust documentation system that ensures 
the maintenance of required registers, documents and 
renewal of required permits.
The environmental management scheme for the Sukari 
project includes a monitoring programme designed to 
evaluate compliance with environmental laws, regulations, 
Company policies and international best practice. The 
system covers waste management; material, water and 
energy management; management of hazardous substances 
and chemicals and biodiversity management.
Maintaining an environmentally responsible culture
Employees are made aware of their environmental 
responsibilities and relevant procedures through a number 
of means. We maintain an established programme of 
environmental training and awareness. The programme 
addresses different environmental fields including chemical 
management; waste management; emissions and water 
conservation, as well as general environmental management 
practices. Other forms of awareness are undertaken through 
meetings and tool box talks.
resource management
Systems and procedures are in place to ensure efficient 
and safe handling of material used at the mine including 
chemicals and hazardous materials.
Risk assessments are carried out for handling and usage 
of all chemicals and hazardous materials. Controls include 
containment, automatic alarms and shut‑off systems. 
Preventative maintenance programmes for tanks and 
equipment are also in place. Our emergency response 
system include spill prevention and response measures.
We fully acknowledge the importance of managing 
chemicals in a sound manner so as to minimise harm to 
the environment and the health of employees. Hazard 
communication and chemical management handling 
is a core component of our training programme and 
our continuous education system. The systems in place 
ensure safe transportation, storage, labelling and handling 
of chemicals.
water management and groundwater protection
Water is a crucial input for our processes, thus it is essential 
to secure and maintain a sustainable source of water for our 
operations. In an area with limited fresh water resources, 
we rely on a sea water intake and pipeline from the Red 
Sea to provide a sustainable water supply to the mine. 
As a secondary source of water, we have beach wells where 
sea water infiltrates through the soil. We have desalination 
plants for generating fresh water for the process plant and 
for domestic use.
The sea water pumped to site is used, and then recycled 
throughout the process plant ensuring optimum usage 
of this resource. This is undertaken through an internal 
recycling system where different water streams are deployed 
in closed‑loop systems to reduce consumption as much as 
possible. We strictly monitor our water use and strive to 
adopt measures for efficient use of water.
In 2015, we used a total of 9,743,584m
3
 per year with an 
increase of 18% on 2014 (8,298,474m
3
). About 99% of the 
water consumed at Sukari is sea water, which has no impact 
on fresh water resources.
Desalinated water used in camps and offices is tested to 
ensure its quality in terms of chemical and bacteriologic 
parameters. Bottled water (used for drinking) is also 
periodically tested to ensure supplier standards and storage 
procedures are maintained. All samples are compliant with 
Egyptian legal requirements.
Groundwater protection measures have been incorporated 
in the design of the tailing storage facility and other 
components where a layer of gypsum and a HPDE 
liner are used to prevent seepage. Workshops have 
concrete working areas to prevent seepage. We monitor 
groundwater quality through monitoring bores downstream 
from the tailing storage facility to detect any potential 
contamination. In 2015, the monitoring of these bores 
showed no contamination.

energy
Marsa Alam, the region in which the Sukari mine is located, 
is a remote area with no direct connection to any power 
grid. The city has its own power plant whose capacity is 
only sufficient for residential use not industrial needs.
Consequently, the project at Sukari powers the 
entire processing plant through its own onsite diesel 
power station.
In 2015, Sukari consumed a total of 130,687,478 litres of 
diesel, an increase of 20% from 109,422,636 litres in 2014. 
About 68% of this quantity is used in power generation 
and the rest is used in operating mobile equipment and 
vehicles, and in operation. 
Calculation of the direct greenhouse gases (“GHG”) 
emissions is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories. In 2015, the Sukari mine generated 367,588
(1)
 
tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent against production of 439,072 
ounces per annum. The emissions intensity for 2015 was 
0.84 tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent per ounce of gold produced. 
(1)  Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions occurring from sources that are 
controlled directly through the operating company, Sukari Gold Mines. 
There are no material external purchases of power. Exploration beyond 
Sukari and overheads occurring at the corporate offices in other locations 
are not considered material for the purposes of these calculations.

A review of alternative fuel sources to supply the 
processing plant is ongoing, but to date there have 
been no viable alternatives.
emissions, effluents and wastes
Systems and procedures are in place for sound 
management of different environmental aspects including 
emissions, effluents, non‑process waste, waste rock and 
tailings. The system is based on setting annual plans; 
development of documented procedures and standards; 
awareness and training of employees and monitoring of 
performance to achieve further improvement. 
All our industrial wastewater streams are recycled within 
the process. Sewage is treated in a tertiary wastewater 
treatment plant and the treated water is used in 
landscaping. Periodic inspections are conducted on the 
treated wastewater and monitoring is undertaken for 
its effluent. 
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIbILITy continued
Our monitoring activities in 2015 confirmed that we 
remained within legal requirements and international best 
practice standards in respect of the following areas:
•	 ambient air quality in the camp area (in terms of dust 
and emissions);
•	 dust concentration in different work areas;
•	 noise and illumination;
•	 work environment emissions, including carbon 
monoxide, sulphur dioxide and ammonia;
•	 stack emissions due to fuel combustion;
•	 quality of treated wastewater; and
•	 quality of groundwater.
The waste management system in place at Sukari, Egypt 
includes procedures for the handling, storage and disposal 
of waste. The system is focused on:
•	 waste minimisation through different measures to reduce 
generation of waste;
•	 maximising onsite recycling and reuse of different types 
of wastes;
•	 recovery of valuable material from the waste;
•	 reuse of treated wastewater streams; and
•	 disposal of discarded material in an environmentally 
acceptable manner. 
We maintain a salvage area where valuable wastes are 
temporarily stored until transferred offsite or recycled 
in different areas onsite. A key focus for the committee 
has been improving the rate at which waste material is 
transferred offsite or recycled and this is an ongoing task.
At Sukari, we believe that waste has a value that must 
be recovered to the most practically feasible extent. 
In that respect:
•	 waste oil is recovered from oily filters before 
disposal, waste oil is recycled offsite within a 
national system; 
•	 food waste is transported off site to our 
neighbouring Bedouins to use as animal fodder;
•	 spent chemical solutions are recycled in the process 
plant after appropriate treatment; 
•	 empty plastic containers are cleaned and used as 
waste baskets all over the site; and
•	 discarded timber is used to make benches at the site 
and in Marsa Alam streets.

Biodiversity
Centamin is committed to protecting the wildlife unique 
to the eastern desert by minimising the impact of our 
operations on the environment. We are conscious that the 
sea near Sukari is renowned for its crystal clear water, and 
includes a variety of coral reefs and marine biota. The desert 
environment is characterised by its scarce terrestrial 
biodiversity resources, and the area of Marsa Alam also 
includes the Wadi El‑Gemal protectorate, one of Egypt’s 
largest environmental protectorates, with about 100km of 
pure beach and desert landscapes.
Biodiversity conservation principles were integrated into the 
project design for Sukari from the outset and are applied to 
all of our activities.
There were no incidents reported of negative impact on 
wildlife as a result of operations at Sukari during 2015.
Land management and rehabilitation
We are committed to transferring Sukari to a stable and 
self‑sustaining condition after closure. Due consideration 
will be given to environmental and social impacts to avoid 
long‑term challenges for neighbouring parties.
The planning for the closure of the mine aims to ensure 
that a physically and chemically stable landform is 
maintained, with minimal erosion and minimal potential 
for dust generation and that the hazards are reduced to 
levels equal to or below those naturally existing within the 
surrounding environment.
Our restoration and rehabilitation plan is updated each year 
to account for all components and activities within the mine. 
A provision for restoration and rehabilitation is included in 
the annual budget. The provision for future restoration costs 
is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure 
required to settle the restoration obligations at the 
reporting date.
In addition to the long‑term rehabilitation plan, we 
undertake short‑term rehabilitation activities especially 
for construction sites and for clean‑up of spills. 
community and society
Centamin recognises that it has a responsibility to support 
and enhance the community in which it operates, and 
to minimise its impact on the environment and local 
people at every stage of its activities. We consider good 
community relations as a key component of continued 
operational success as well as a corporate requirement. 
We are committed to acting in a socially responsible manner 
at all times.
Stakeholder engagement
We nurture dialogue and build relations with the local 
community in areas in which we operate. We maintain 
open channels of communication with all our stakeholders. 
A public consultation system has been in place at 
Sukari since the project design phase, and during the 
construction phase. With mining in operation we have 
maintained open channels of communication with all our 
stakeholders for the purpose of information disclosure 
and for them to raise grievances or concerns. In providing 
these opportunities we have been pleased to find that, 
throughout 2015, as in previous years, the Sukari mine 
continues to enjoy full support from the local community 
and government authorities.

and standards are being integrated into the Batie 
operations where relevant. These include:
•	 provision of health services at camp;
•	 training and induction requirements;
•	 incident investigation and reporting requirements;
•	 internal communication mechanisms; 
•	 vehicle safety requirements; and
•	 contractor management.

implemented following the incident.
Health services
The Batie camp site has a well‑equipped clinic operated by 
ISOS and the clinic has a full‑time paramedic. The camp is 
also equipped with an ambulance to transfer cases to the 
nearest medical centre in Batie or to hospital in Gauoa.
The clinic is accessible to employees at all times and 
provides quality health services with a particular focus 
on malaria. Through applying protective measures and 
through employee awareness programmes, the malaria 
frequency rate was maintained at 43 per 1,000 people 
in 2015 compared to the 225 country frequency rate in 
Burkina Faso as a whole. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information

environment
An environmental impact assessment study (“EIA”) has been 
carried out in accordance with Burkina Faso legislation. 
Of particular note in connection with the EIA were the 
specific issues relating to the social environment and these 
were identified, as follows:
•	 relocation of communities directly impacted;
•	 relocation of cashew tree plantations;
•	 identification of sacred and religious sites;
•	 social acceptability and job creation;
•	 economic impact assessment; and
•	 community projects. 
The process of developing the EIA included a stakeholder 
consultation for the project and the associated relocation 
requirements. The proposed Batie project extends to 
villages and occupied areas and thus some farms, houses 
and public areas will need to be relocated. A relocation plan 
has been prepared taking account of the views expressed 
in the consultation including those of farmers, land owners, 
local chiefs. local committees have been formed to follow 
up the process. With the further optimisation and design of 
the project, the relocation plan will be refined accordingly. 
An important component of exploration activities is the 
rehabilitation of sites. There are procedures to ensure the 
safe, stable and environmentally sound closure of pits 
and wells immediately after completion of works. Drilling 
contractors are required to implement such procedures at 
all their drilling sites.
community and society
Stakeholder engagement remains a key element throughout 
the exploration and advanced exploration phase. This will 
become increasingly important as the Company proves 
the resource and is able to develop an operating mine in 
the region. Centamin, through its local subsidiaries, will 
continue to engage with the local community in relation to 
its projects in Batie.
Stakeholder engagement is undertaken through individual 
and group meetings to discuss concerns. These include:
•	 access to exploration lands
•	 identification of sacred sites that must not be disturbed
•	 compensation for removing trees or disturbing land
•	 conflict management 
community development initiatives
Community development in 2015 had tackled several 
objectives including enhancing:
•	 education;
•	 health services; 
•	 social involvement; and
•	 livelihood.
enhancing education
•	 internship for two technical students at the mechanical 
department at Batie camp; and 
•	 internship for two geology students in the 
exploration department. 
enhancing health services
•	 supporting Batie medical centre through providing 
antivenins, running water, power access, analysis 
equipment, and financing hygiene services; and
•	 repair of water bore for the Wadaradoo maternity clinic.
Our community development team has undertaken 
visits and discussions with the Batie medical centre 
to identify needs for enhancement of health services 
and responding to emerging needs. As a result the 
following have been carried out:
•	 provision of antivenins for snake attacks;
•	 construction of a water tank and related connections 
to provide running water in the centre;
•	 implementing solar energy installations to provide 
lighting to critical areas in the centre;
•	 provision of advanced haematology equipment 
and kits; and
•	 provision of cleaning kits and contracting 
professional cleaning services to ensure high levels 
of hygiene.
social involvement:
•	 sponsorship of, and participation in, community 
events and celebrations; and
•	 support for vulnerable students in education.
enhancing livelihood:
•	 establishing two water bores in Danhal 
tenement; and 
•	 supplying 50 bicycles for students with excellence 
achievements.

OPERATIONAL REvIEw Health and safety – Sukari
The l TIFR for 2015 was 0.12 per 200,000 man‑hours 
(2014: 0.39 per 200,000 man‑hours), with a total 
of 5,032,828 man‑hours worked during 2015 
(2014: 5,620,444). Continued development of the onsite 
health and safety culture has resulted in improved reporting 
of incidents. 
Against this positive result, an incident occurred within 
the open pit operation during the fourth quarter, when a 
contractor’s employee was involved in a rock collapse whilst 
relocating a grade control drill rig. The operator, and sole 
occupant of the drill rig, was fatally injured in the incident. 
Centamin remains committed to further improving health 
and safety during 2016 towards our zero‑harm target.
open pit
The open pit delivered total material movement of 57.8Mt, 
an increase of 28% on the prior year. This increase was 
related to improved fleet utilisation and productivity, 
together with incremental blasting rates following the 
increased daily usage of ammonium nitrate (“AN”) from 
October 2014. Mining continued to focus on the Stage 3A 
and 3B areas and the northern and eastern walls of the 
open pit, in line with the mine plan.
Ore production from the open pit was 8.75Mt at 0.75g/t, 
with an average head grade to the plant of 0.78g/t. The 
ROM ore stockpile balance decreased by 1.5Mt to 0.7Mt 
by the end of the year. Ore mining was primarily from the 
Stage 3A area, which provided access to higher‑grade 
sulphide portions of the ore body during the second half 
of the year.
Underground mine 
The underground mine produced a record 1.16Mt of ore, 
a 20% increase on 2014. Ore from stoping accounted for 
52% (0.60Mt) of the total and 48% (0.56Mt) was ore from 
development. Ore tonnages from stopes increased by 
18% on the previous year.
The average mined head grade was 6.5g/t, in line with 
our forecast. The average grade from stoping was 6.9g/t 
(an increase of 5% on 2014) and the average grade from 
development was 6.0g/t (an increase of 9% on 2014).
Underground development took place over 8,501 metres, 
including progression of the Amun and Ptah declines. 
Of this total, there was 6,864 metres of development 
in mineralised areas between the 845 and 680 levels (5,389 
metres in Amun, and 1,466 metres in Ptah) associated with 
stoping blocks planned for mining over the coming years. 
The exhaust ventilation circuit for the Ptah decline was 
progressed, ensuring sufficient ventilation as the decline 
extends deeper into the orebody. Ore drive development 
continued on the Ptah P810, P790, P775, P745 and 
P735 levels.
A total of 12,277 metres of grade control diamond drilling 
were completed, aimed at short‑term stope definition, 
drive direction optimisation and underground resource 
development. A further 26,835 metres of HQ and NQ 
drilling continued to test the depth extensions below the 
current Amun and Ptah zones.
processing
The Sukari plant processed 10.6Mt of ore in 2015, a 
26% increase on 2014 and reflecting the ramp‑up of the 
expanded plant circuit. The annual tonnes processed were 
6% above the nameplate capacity of 10Mtpa. Productivity 
continued to increase throughout the year, with 2.76Mt 
processed during the fourth quarter, representing a 13% 
increase on 2014 annual productivity rates and achieving 
the plant’s minimum expected long‑term rate of 11Mtpa.
The average metallurgical recovery was 88.8%, a 1.1% 
increase on 2014. Work is continuing to optimise the 
operational controls and improve circuit stability to ensure 
recoveries are maintained above 88% at the increased rate 
of throughput. 
The dump leach operation produced 15,642oz in 2015.

resources and reserves – Sukari
During the year, Centamin updated its mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates for the Sukari Gold Mine 
as at 30 June 2015. An updated NI 43‑101 resource and reserve report was completed and filed on SEDAR at  
www.sedar.com.
The total measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of 13 million ounces (“Moz”) gold is reported as an open pit 
resource at a 0.3g/t cut‑off grade. This total is inclusive of the 1.0Moz underground mineral resource. The open pit and 
surface stockpile mineral reserve estimate is 8.3Moz and the underground mineral reserve estimate is 2.7 million tonnes 
(“Mt”) containing 0.5Moz gold.
The total combined open pit and underground mineral reserve estimate of 8.8Moz represented an increase of 7% over the 
previous 8.2Moz as at 30 September 2013. The increase is due to lower operating mining and processing costs associated 
with lower international fuel prices, and continued drilling from underground to move ounces up through the resource 
categories and increase the underground reserve.
Resource and reserve definition drilling continues to target higher grade areas of the Sukari Hill deposit, in parallel with 
expanding underground infrastructure. Positive results from the ongoing programme are discussed in the following section.

exploration
sukari
During 2015, drilling from underground remained the 
focus of the Sukari exploration programme as expanded 
development continued to improve access to test the 
potential high‑grade extensions of the deposit. The ore 
body remains open to the north, south and at depth and 
further underground drilling of the Sukari deposit will take 
place during 2016, predominantly from both the Amun and 
Ptah declines.

The strategy for 2015 was to continue to systematically 
explore and drill‑test the numerous targets along the 
160km length of greenstone belt contained within our 
extensive 2,200km
2
 licence holding. Results from this 
programme will lead to further drilling and resource 
development during 2016. The main focus of the 
exploration is to discover and develop new zones of 
near surface high grade mineralisation.
Earlier in 2015, and as previously reported, an incident 
occurred in Burkina Faso on a public road near the Konkera 
village which resulted in one of our local employees being 
fatally wounded and another sustaining injuries. A thorough 
investigation into this bandit attack on two of our vehicles 
has been carried out. Further additional security measures 
have been implemented following the incident. There was 
no impact on operational activity as a result of the incident.
A signed ministerial decree approving the Tiopolo mining 
licence, which hosts the existing indicated resource of 
1.92 million ounces and inferred resource of 1.33 million 
ounces, was issued on 5 March 2015. A deferral was granted 
by the Ministry of Mines and Energy in November 2015 in 
order to continue exploration, as provided for in the Burkina 
Faso Mining Code. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information

Burkina Faso and côte d’ivoire prospects
The exploration programme in Burkina Faso includes 
geological mapping and geochemical surveys in order 
to outline prospects for further work. During the year a 
regional geophysical interpretation was completed, with 
follow‑up Induced Polarisation (“IP”) ground surveys 
defining numerous anomalies for follow‑up drill testing.
The drilling fleet comprises five multipurpose reverse 
circulation/diamond (“RC/DD”) rigs, 2 aircore (“AC”) rigs 
and three auger rigs. During 2015 there were 118,758m of 
RC, 8,510m of diamond, 86,514m of aircore and 52,380m 
of auger drilled.
A number of regional exploration targets with potential 
have been identified utilising the developed structural 
model for high‑grade mineralisation in the region. Based 
on positive results received during 2015, two prospect areas 
– Wadaradoo and Napelapera – were prioritised for further 
work. At present, three RC/DD multipurpose rigs are drilling 
at Wadaradoo, with two further RC/DD rigs conducting 
regional reconnaissance working in conjunction with the 
AC rigs in both the north and south of the licence region.
Exploration at Wadaradoo has to date focused on several 
zones, including Wadaradoo Main and Wadaradoo East. 
At Wadaradoo Main high‑grade south‑plunging shoots have 
been identified on both the main 020° trending structure 
and 320
o
 trending splay structures. Results have confirmed 
at least three shoots that are open at depth. One shoot 
returned intersections of 5m @ 15.7g/t (hole WDRD524), 
4m @ 2.9g/t (WDRD525), 8m @ 8.0g/t and 14m @ 4.4g/t 
(WDRD334W2).
At Wadaradoo East, higher‑grade lenses are observed 
within a broad halo of low‑grade mineralisation. Increasing 
data has helped to improve our understanding of the 
geological controls and higher‑grade mineralisation can 
now be traced for 400m along strike, remaining open in all 
directions. One of the high‑grade zones was intersected on 
two adjacent 50m‑spaced sections, returning 25m @ 3.5g/t 
(hole WDRC586) and 7m @ 6.4g/t (WDRC589). 
Several good targets with favourable structural and 
lithological settings have been identified at Wadaradoo, 
particularly in the north and south of the prospect area. 
Targets continue to be identified through combining the 
structural model with alteration patterns, geochemical 
results and interpretation of the IP and magnetic surveys.
Exploration is continuing at a number of other target 
areas, where major cross cutting structures coincide 
with demagnetised and altered zones. This includes 
the Gongombili anticline (the southern continuity of 
the Wadaradoo Main structure in an area with a broad 
paragonite anomaly), Wadaradoo Far East (large auger 
anomalies where an intrusive is interpreted at depth), 
and Doukou (around a major NE striking mafic dyke).

Now in its seventh year of production, the Sukari Gold 
Mine remains highly cash generative and this is reflected 
in the group’s financial results for the year ended 
31 December 2015:
•	 2015 revenues of US$508 million were up 
8% year‑on‑year as an 8% fall in realised gold prices 
was offset by a 17% increase in gold sales;
•	 cash costs decreased to US$713 per ounce produced 
from US$729 in 2014, driven by the decrease in fuel 
price, although was marginally above guidance of 
US$700 per ounce despite the higher production 
than originally forecast;
•	 AISC of US$885 per ounce sold was below our original 
forecast of US$950 per ounce mainly due to the 
higher gold production base and the rescheduling of 
certain capital cost items, as foreshadowed in the third 
quarter results;
•	 EBITDA decreased by 8% to US$152 million, mainly 
due to lower gross operating margins as a result of the 
reduced gold price and also an increased production 
cost associated with net changes in production 
inventories;
•	 profit before tax decreased by 28% to US$58.4 million, 
due to the factors affecting EBITDA as well as a 
US$6.3 million write‑off due to the group’s decision 
to cease exploration in Ethiopia;
•	 earnings per share of 4.51 US cents were down 37% on 
7.21 cents per share in 2014, due to the factors affecting 
profit before tax in addition to an income tax charge of 
US$6.8 million in relation to foreign exchange gains on 
its cash holdings within Australia; and
•	 operational cash flow of US$186 million was 59% 
higher than 2014, due to the higher gold production 
base achieved through the completion of the Stage 4 
expansion completed in the second half of 2014 and 
a positive movement in working capital balances 
compared to 2014.
Centamin announced an interim dividend in August 2015 
of 0.97 US cents per ordinary share (US$11.1 million total 
distribution). Subject to shareholder approval at the AGM 
on 11 May 2016, a final dividend of 1.97 US cents per share 
(totalling approximately US$22.7 million) is proposed to 
be paid on 27 May 2016 to shareholders on the register 
as of 22 April 2016. The ex‑dividend date is 21 April 2016 
for lSE listed shareholders and 20 April 2016 for TSX listed 
shareholders. The final dividend would thus bring the total 
full year dividend to 2.94 US cents per share (totalling 
approximately US$33.8 million).
Centamin remains committed to its policy of being 100% 
exposed to the gold price through its unhedged position, 
and maintained a healthy cash, bullion on hand, gold sales 
receivables and available‑for‑sale financial assets balance 
of US$230.7 million as at 31 December 2015.
Centamin has continued to return 
strong earnings and cash flow 
generation despite the weaker 
gold price environment.

revenue
Revenue from gold and silver sales has increased by 
8% to US$508 million (US$473 million in 2014), with 
an 8% decrease in the average realised gold price to 
US$1,159 per ounce (US$1,257 per ounce in 2014) 
offset by a 17% increase in gold sold to 437,571 ounces 
(375,300 ounces in 2014).
cost of sales
Cost of sales represents the cost of mining, processing, 
refinery, transport, site administration and depreciation 
and amortisation, and movement in production inventory. 
Cost of sales is inclusive of exceptional items of 
US$46.7 million in relation to fuel charges (refer to note 6 
to the financial statements for further information) and has 
increased by 16% to US$416.2 million, as a result of:
(a) an increase in activity year‑on‑year with overall mined 
tonnes increasing by 29% and processed tonnes 
increasing by 26%, resulting in a 14% increase in total 
mine production costs to from US$275.9 million to 
US$314.8 million;
(b) a 12% increase in depreciation and amortisation from 
US$84.2 million to US$93.9 million, a result of the higher 
rates of depreciation associated with the Stage 4 plant 
expansion; and 
(c) a US$7.5 million adjustment for movement in production 
inventories as a result of an overall decrease in mining 
stockpiles and gold in circuit levels offset by an increase

profit before tax
As a result of the factors outlined above, the group recorded 
a profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 of 
US$58.4 million (2014: US$81.6 million). 
tax
Australian tax rules govern the taxation of financial 
arrangements (“TOFA”) and the realisation of foreign 
exchange gains/losses. The TOFA rules provide that a 
foreign exchange gain or loss will arise in relation to foreign 
currency bank accounts to the extent funds have been 
withdrawn from these accounts during the period. This 
foreign exchange gain or loss is calculated by comparing 
the A$ spot rate at the date of deposit to the A$ spot rate 
at the date of withdrawal on a first‑in‑first‑out (“FIFO”) basis 
(i.e. the first amounts deposited are the first amounts to 
be withdrawn). 
The group made foreign exchange gains for Australian 
income tax purposes during the year which were assessable 
when they were realised (i.e. when US$ cash balances 
were withdrawn from Australian bank accounts). Australian 
income tax rules (contained within subdivision 960‑D of 
the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) require that where 
an amount is not in the taxpayer’s ‘applicable functional 
currency’, the amount is to be converted into the ‘applicable 
functional currency’ i.e. Australian dollars. Accordingly, 
the withdrawal of US$ bank deposits gave rise to foreign 
exchange gains for Australian income tax purposes, which 
were assessable when realised.

comprehensive income
Other comprehensive income has increased by 
US$0.1 million to US$0.2 million as a result of the 
revaluation of available‑for‑sale financial assets. 
Financial position
At 31 December 2015, the group had cash and 
cash equivalents of US$199.6 million compared to 
US$125.7 million at 31 December 2014. The majority of 
funds have been invested in international rolling short‑term 
higher interest money market deposits.
Current assets have increased by US$66.1 million or 23% to 
US$359.5 million, as a result of:
(a) an increase in net cash inflows of US$74.0 million net of 
foreign exchange movements; offset by
(b) a US$1.2 million decrease in gold sale receivables; 
(c) a US$1.6 million increase in stores inventory to 
US$106.4 million;
(d) a US$0.5 million decrease in prepayments;
(e) a US$0.2 million increase in other available‑for‑sale 
financial assets; and
(f) a US$7.5 million decrease in mining stockpiles and gold 
in circuit levels, offset by an increase in finished goods 
inventory, to US$28.3 million at period end.
Non‑current assets have decreased by US$24.9 million or 
2% to US$1,052.4 million, as a result of:
(a) a US$93.9 million charge for depreciation and 
amortisation; offset by
(b) a US$36.5 million cost for net capitalised 
work‑in‑progress (comprising of plant and mining 
equipment and rehabilitation asset);
(c) a US$28.1 million increase in exploration and evaluation 
assets to US$152.1 million, as a result of the drilling 
programmes in Sukari Hill, the Sukari tenement area, 
Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. This increase is inclusive 
of a US$6.3 million write‑off of expenditure in relation to 
the Ethiopian operations; and
(d) a US$5.0 million increase in prepayments to EMRA in 
relation to advance payments against future profit share.
Current liabilities have increased by US$17.0 million to 
US$51.4 million with an increase of US$9.9 million in 
payables, an increase of US$0.3 million in provisions and an 
accrual of US$6.8 million for Australian tax payable on forex 
gains, as outlined above. 
Non‑current liabilities reported during the period have 
increased by US$4.1 million as a result of a revision to 
the assumptions used in the estimating of the inflation 
and discount rates employed in the calculation of the 
rehabilitation provision.
Issued capital has increased by US$4.0 million due to the 
vesting of awards.
Share option reserves reported have decreased by 
US$1.6 million to US$2.5 million as result of the forfeiture 
and vesting of awards and the resultant transfer to 
accumulated profits and issue capital respectively, offset by 
the recognition of the share‑based payments expense.

exceptional items
In January 2012, the Company received a letter from 
Chevron to the effect that Chevron would not be able to 
continue supplying Diesel Fuel Oil (“DFO”) to the mine at 
Sukari at local subsidised prices. It is understood that the 
reason that this letter was issued was that Chevron had 
received a letter instructing it to do so from the Egyptian 
General Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”). It is understood 
that EGPC itself took the decision to issue this instruction 
because it had received legal advice from the legal Advice 
Department of the Council of State (an internal government 
advisory department) that the companies operating in 
the gold mining sector in Egypt were not entitled to 
such subsidies. In addition, during 2012 the Company 
received a demand from Chevron for the repayment of fuel 
subsidies received in the period from late 2009 through 
to January 2012, amounting to some US$51 million 
(EGP403 million).
The group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter 
(and, in particular, on the opinion given by legal Advice 
Department of the Council of State) and in consequence 
in June 2012 lodged an appeal against EGPC’s decision in 
the Administrative Courts. Again, the group believes that 
its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is every 
prospect of success. However, as a practical matter, and 
in order to ensure the continuation of supply, the group 
has since January 2012 advanced funds to its fuel supplier, 
Chevron, based on the international price for diesel.
As at the date of the financial statements, no final decision 
had been taken by the courts regarding this matter. 
Furthermore, the group remains of the view that an instant 
move to international fuel prices is not a reasonable 
outcome and will look to recover funds advanced thus far 
should the court proceeding be concluded in its favour. 
However, management recognises the practical difficulties 
associated with reclaiming funds from the government and 
for this reason has, fully provided against the prepayment of 
US$208.2 million to 31 December 2015, as an exceptional 
item, of which US$42.4 million was provided for during 2015 
as follows:
(a) a US$46.7 million increase in cost of sales 
(2014: US$62.5 million increase);
(b) a US$1.3 million decrease in stores inventories 
(2014: US$0.2 million increase); and
(c) a US$2.9 million decrease in mining 
stockpiles, gold in circuit and finished goods 
(2014: US$1.0 million decrease).
This has resulted in a net charge of US$46.7 million in the 
profit and loss.

cash flows
Net cash flows generated by operating activities comprise receipts from gold and silver sales and interest revenue, offset 
by operating and corporate administration costs. Cash flows have increased by US$69.1 million to US$185.5 million, 
primarily attributable to:
(a) an increase in revenue, due to higher gold sales offset by a lower average realised price; 
(b) an increase in mine production costs as a result of increased gold production; and
(c) a decrease in cash outflows flows in relation to receivables and payables.
Net cash flows used in investing activities comprise exploration expenditure and capital development expenditures 
at Sukari including the acquisition of financial and mineral assets. Compared to 2014, cash outflows have decreased 
by US$8.1 million to US$70.6 million. The primary use of the funds during the year was for investment in underground 
development and exploration expenditures incurred.
Net cash flows generated by financing activities comprise the dividends paid and advance payment against future profit 
share to EMRA. During the year US$33.8 million was paid comprising the final dividend for 2014 of US$22.7 million 
(following an interim dividend of US$9.9 million paid in 2014) and the interim dividend for 2015 of US$11.1 million. 
An advance payment against future profit share of US$5.0 million was made to EMRA in 2015.
Effects of exchange rate changes have increased by US$0.6 million as a result of the performance of the US$ to the euro 
and A$.

Non-gaap financial measures
Three non‑GAAP financial measures are used in this report:
(1) eBitDa
“EBITDA” is a non‑GAAP financial measure, which excludes the following from profit before tax:
•	 finance costs;
•	 finance income; and
•	 depreciation and amortisation.
Management believes that EBITDA is a valuable indicator of the group’s ability to generate liquidity by producing 
operating cash flow to fund working capital needs and fund capital expenditures. EBITDA is also frequently used by 
investors and analysts for valuation purposes whereby EBITDA is multiplied by a factor or “EBITDA multiple” that is based 
on an observed or inferred relationship between EBITDA and market values to determine the approximate total enterprise 
value of a company. EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts and does not have any 
standardised definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance 
prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA excludes the impact of cash costs and income of financing activities and taxes, 
and therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other 
companies may calculate EBITDA differently. The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA to profit for the year 
attributable to the Company.

Non-gaap financial measures continued
(2) cash cost per ounce calculation: 
“Cash costs per ounce” is a non‑GAAP financial measure. Cash cost per ounce is a measure of the average cost of 
producing an ounce of gold, calculated by dividing the operating costs in a period by the total gold production over the 
same period. Operating costs represent total operating costs less administrative expenses, royalties, depreciation and 
amortisation. Management uses this measure internally to better assess performance trends for the Company as a whole. 
The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP , certain investors 
use such non‑GAAP information to evaluate the Company’s performance and ability to generate cash flow. The Company 
believes that these measures provide an alternative reflection of the group’s performance for the current period and 
are an alternative indication of its expected performance in future periods. Cash costs is intended to provide additional 
information, does not have any standardised meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or 
as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP . This measure is not necessarily indicative 
of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP . Other companies may calculate these 
measures differently.

In June 2013 the World Gold Council (“WGC”), an industry body, published a Guidance Note on the AISC metric, which 
gold mining companies can use to supplement their overall non‑GAAP disclosure. AISC is an extension of the existing 
‘cash cost’ metric and incorporates all costs related to sustaining production and in particular recognising the sustaining 
capital expenditure associated with developing and maintaining gold mines. In addition, this metric includes the costs 
associated with developing and maintaining gold mines, corporate office structures that support these operations, the 
community and rehabilitation costs attendant with responsible mining and any exploration and evaluation costs associated 
with sustaining current operations. AISC per ounce is arrived at by dividing the dollar value of the sum of these cost 
metrics, by the ounces of gold produced. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information

INtroductIoN
As chairman of the board I endorse the 
values of good governance, and in my 
view, board effectiveness is enhanced by 
regular information being presented to 
the board.
Josef El‑Raghy Chairman
Dear shareholders
In my view, board effectiveness has been achieved by 
ensuring that communication channels are open between all 
board members and regular information is presented to the 
board allowing all members to contribute knowledgeably 
at board meetings and in discussions between the 
executives and non‑executive directors. This has enabled 
open discussion on the requirement and content of 
public disclosures, to meet regulatory obligations as well 
as ensuring shareholders are properly informed about 
key events.
Having consulted with the non‑executive directors, I believe 
that the format of the board, in conjunction with the 
activities of the various board committees, allows open 
debate. This format has allowed directors to engage on 
matters of executive management policy and performance 
and risk management and allows them to effectively monitor 
the performance of management and develop proposals 
on strategy.
Following the appointment of our new chief executive 
officer (“CEO”), Andrew Pardey, the previously combined 
roles of chairman/CEO are now separate. It should be noted 
that, on appointment, Andrew received a full induction pack 
and over the last year Andrew has met many of our key 
shareholders. Andrew has also presented to investors and 
analysts at key conferences throughout the year.
I am pleased to observe that, during Andrew’s first year as 
CEO, the Company has continued to develop and realise its 
next stages of growth, whilst maintaining its strategic focus 
on cash flows, shareholder returns and social responsibility.
Our board composition and approach to leadership are set 
out in detail on page 66. Within the directors’ report and, 
where applicable, the strategic report, the directors provide 
the required governance and regulatory assurances. These 
are set out in the following areas:
Code compliance statement on page 65.
Directors’ responsibilities (C.1.1/C.1.3) on page 104.
Strategic report and risk management report) (C.1.2/
C.2.1/C.2.2.) on page 32.
Directors’ report (C.2.3.) set out in this section.
As described in my chairman’s statement, Centamin 
made continued progress during 2015 in developing its 
longer‑term growth objectives. In my role as chairman, 
I look forward to continuing to work with the Company 
towards delivering substantial shareholder value through 
further development of our portfolio of assets.

Compliance statement
The Company is incorporated in Jersey, Channel Islands. 
The Company is by virtue of the Listing Rules, subject to the 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) issued by the 
UK Financial Reporting Council and therefore the Company 
must confirm that it has complied with all relevant provisions 
of the Code or to explain areas of non‑compliance. The 
Code can be found on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website www.frc.org.uk.
In addition, the Company is required to follow the principles 
of corporate governance set out in the best practice 
recommendations of the Toronto Stock Exchange, in 
particular those recommendations in National Policy 58201 
– Corporate Governance Guidelines (“NP 58‑201”).
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2015, the 
Company has been in full compliance with the provisions set 
out in the Code with the exception of the following matters:
The roles of chairman and chief executive officer were 
both exercised by Josef El‑Raghy during 2014. This matter 
was addressed on 1 February 2015 when Andrew Pardey 
was appointed as the Company’s CEO. Josef El‑Raghy, 
the Company’s interim CEO, will continue in his role as 
Chairman. 
It should be noted that both the Code and best practice 
recommendations favour that the chairman be an 
independent director on appointment. Josef El‑Raghy is not 
an independent non‑executive chairman within the meaning 
of the Code. As such, Edward Haslam will continue to take 
an active role to ensure the board’s ongoing effectiveness 
in all respects. As advised in the 2015 half‑year results, 
Edward Haslam’s title was changed to deputy chairman 
and senior independent non‑executive director, which is 
reflective of his role and activities.
It is noted that in the case of the directors’ remuneration 
report, the disclosures have exceeded the obligations on 
the Company given its incorporation in Jersey. However, 
the Company considers such enhanced disclosure is 
appropriate to allow shareholders to compare the Company 
with UK incorporated FTSE 350 listed companies. It has also 
incorporated many additional and voluntary disclosures in 
its strategic report.
Leadership and effectiveness
This report sets out the key areas the board has focused on 
during the year, together with details of the roles of the key 
board members and an assessment of the effectiveness of 
the board.

How the board of directors operates continued
Key activities of the board in 2015 continued
Further to the introduction of the revised UK Corporate 
Governance Code in 2014, the board spent time discussing 
the changes to the Code and the guidance from the FRC on 
implementing the new Code requirements. In particular, the 
board and audit and risk committee spent time reviewing 
their internal control environment, risk management 
processes and internal and external reporting.
The board has delegated certain matters to its committees 
and their reports are presented within the strategic or 
directors’ report:
Health, safety, environmental and  
sustainability committee – strategic report page 38
Compliance and  
corporate governance – directors’ report page 74
Nomination committee – directors’ report page 76
Audit and risk committee – directors’ report page 98
Remuneration committee – directors’ report page 80
Leadership
The Chairman, Josef El‑Raghy, is responsible for ensuring 
the business is run in accordance with the board’s strategy. 
Following the appointment of the new CEO, responsibility 
for implementing strategy and overseeing the day‑to‑day 
running of the business is with Andrew Pardey.
The management team and board are relatively few in 
number and are, therefore, actively involved in, and made 
aware of, all the major activities of the group. They can 
therefore ensure the Company’s actions are aligned with 
the strategic aims of the group.
Areas of focus for the board in 2016
Strategic planning – the board regularly reviews and 
approves strategic plans and initiatives put forward by 
management and the executive, including geographical 
diversification. Details of the strategic objectives for 
cash generation, shareholder return, growth and social 
responsibility can be found in the strategic report.
Communications – the board oversees the Company’s 
public communications with shareholders and other 
stakeholders and plans to develop the financial statements, 
presentations and other forms of communication, such as 
the Company’s website, over 2016.
Risk assessment – the board has primary responsibility for 
identifying the principal risks in the Company’s business 
and to ensure the implementation of appropriate systems 
to manage these risks. The board will continue to review its 
processes for risk identification and evaluation, improving 
internal communication and external reports in this area.
Internal control – the board, with assistance from the 
audit and risk committee oversees the group’s internal 
control and management information systems. Following 
the appointment of the internal auditor, the board will be 
reviewing progress on the recommendations put forward 
by the internal auditor.
Reporting and audit – the board, through the audit 
and risk committee, is reviewing proposals to upgrade 
the accounting systems. Internal system upgrades in the 
accounting and financial reporting areas will also be closely 
monitored by the board as well as recommendations from 
the external auditor on areas for improvement.
Relationship with stakeholders – the board will continue 
to maintain, develop and monitor relationships with key 
stakeholders including EMRA in relation to Sukari and other 
governmental bodies in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire.
The responsibilities of the board and key roles within the 
organisation are set out below:
the chairman:
•	 leads the board to ensure it operates effectively;
•	 sets the agenda and ensures all matters are given due 
consideration and that directors have the opportunity 
to contribute to board discussions;
•	 communicates with shareholders in relation to the 
Company’s strategic aims and policies; and
•	 represents the group before key stakeholders including 
government officials (including EMRA).
chief executive officer:
•	 develops and implements, short, medium and long term 
corporate strategies;
•	 is responsible for day‑to‑day management of the 
business and the implementation of the board’s strategic 
aims; and
•	 promotes the highest standards of safety, corporate 
compliance and adherence to codes of conduct.
Non‑executive directors:
•	 challenge and help develop the group’s strategy;
•	 participate as members of the board on their respective 
committees;
•	 monitor the performance of management;
•	 need to be satisfied as to the adequacy and integrity 
of financial and other reporting;
•	 determine appropriate levels of remuneration for 
executive directors; and
•	 raise any concerns with the board or with management.

Detailed knowledge of the group’s activities is essential and, 
each year, the board visit Sukari where they are shown the 
underground operation, open pit site and the operations 
plant, accompanied by the heads of department based at 
Sukari. In addition to regular site visits to Sukari, the senior 
members of the management team and executive visit the 
exploration sites in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire to ensure 
the activities in these regions are aligned with the corporate 
objectives of the group.
Board effectiveness
Each committee carries out a self‑assessment evaluation 
of its effectiveness over the year. This review compares the 
responsibilities and objectives of the committee against 
the activities carried out during the year. This evaluation 
is submitted to the board for review. The internal annual 
performance evaluation of the board was completed 
in March 2015 for the year ended 31 December 2014. 
The internal annual performance evaluation for 2015 was 
completed in March 2016 by the board. The non‑executive 
directors meet at least annually, without the chairman or 
CEO present and evaluate their performance during the 
year. The board is assisted by the nomination committee 
on its evaluation of the non‑executive directors. An external 
facilitator will be appointed in May 2016 to assess the 
effectiveness of the board. The last review by an external 
facilitator was carried out in May 2013.
Following the evaluation process, there were no proposed 
changes to the membership of the committees or the 
composition of the non‑executive directors or executive 
directors. The nomination committee and the board 
discussed the need for any new appointments to the 
board, either through the process of succession planning 
or external appointments. Discussions of this nature will 
continue in 2016.
Board appointments and independence
During the course of 2015, the vacancy for the position 
of CEO, an executive director appointment, was filled. 
The nomination committee, through the process of 
succession planning, had ensured that adequate support 
and development were given to Andrew Pardey to prepare 
him for the role of CEO. After a thorough assessment 
of the experience and expertise of Andrew Pardey and 
his performance as COO, the nomination committee 
recommended, and the board unanimously agreed, to 
appoint Andrew Pardey as the Company’s new CEO 
effective from 1 February 2015.
The nomination committee and the board also considered 
and approved that Josef El‑Raghy, interim CEO, continue in 
his role as chairman of the board.
In January 2015, Trevor Schultz, a non‑executive director 
(but not independent having served with the Company as 
an executive director), was appointed chairman of the HSES 
committee. This appointment followed the retirement of 
Bob Bowker.
The Company remains compliant with the provisions of 
the Code that the board should have a greater number of 
non‑executive directors than executive directors. 
When determining whether a director is independent, the 
board has established a directors’ test of independence 
policy, which is based predominantly on the definition 
of independence in Canadian Securities Administrators’ 
National Instrument 52‑110 – Audit Committees. The criteria 
set out in the instrument are mandatory and are more 
stringent in certain respects than the independence criteria 
suggested by the Code. Based on this policy, the majority of 
the board are considered by the board to be independent 
non‑executive directors.
Managing risks and internal controls
The board is responsible for satisfying itself that 
management has developed and implemented a sound 
system of risk management and internal control. Assisted 
by the audit and risk committee, management reports to 
the board on the group’s key risks and the extent to which 
it believes these risks are being appropriately managed 
and mitigated.
Full details of the risk environment can be found in the risk 
management report on page 32.
The board are pleased to confirm that the Company 
remains in compliance with best practice guidelines, with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and relevant Canadian 
requirements, and the systems in place to manage risk and 
the internal control environment have been in place for the 
year under review, up to the date of approval of the annual 
report and accounts. Centamin plc Annual report 2015 
Directors’ report

INtroductIoN continued
Managing risks and internal controls continued
During the year, the Company conducted an assessment of 
the control environment of the group, summarised by the 
following key headings:
•	 corporate governance framework;
•	 management reporting framework;
•	 material contracts and contract management;
•	 procedures for forecasting and budgeting;
•	 external reporting obligations and procedures;
•	 information technology environment; and
•	 corporate and operational principal risk assessment. 
The board made the following recommendations to 
enhance the internal control environment following the 
review and these are summarised below:
•	 carry out an upgrade of the finance accounting software 
and an overhaul of the accounting handbook;
•	 recommendations on the areas of focus for the internal 
auditor as set out in section 100 of the audit and risk 
committee report; and
•	 updates to the risk reporting framework as set out on 
page 32 of the risk management report.
It was noted that the review of the internal control 
environment and subsequent recommendations were not 
seen as significant failings or weaknesses, but are reflective 
of the detailed review that was undertaken.
Board committees
The board committees are a valuable part of the Company’s 
corporate governance structure. The workload of the board 
committees is far greater than the table of scheduled 
meetings would indicate, as ad‑hoc meetings and 
communications occur frequently between the directors and 
management. Details of each of the board committees is set 
out below.

The Company continued to grow 
and mature this year and at the 
heart of this growth was continued 
focus on executive recruitment and 
succession planning
G Edward Haslam 
Chairman of the nomination committee
Dear shareholders
I am presenting this report as chairman of the nomination 
committee, a committee established by the board of 
the Company.
The committee played an active role in succession planning 
during 2015 and this culminated in the appointment of our 
chief executive officer, Andrew Pardey. Andrew Pardey, at 
the recommendation of the committee, was appointed a 
director and CEO on 1 February 2015. The committee also 
had oversight of the induction process, ensuring that he 
received the support that he needed and understood his 
responsibilities as a director of a listed Company.
The committee was involved in detailing the role and scope 
of the executive chairman, Josef El‑Raghy, who resumed 
the role of chairman of the Company in February 2015. 
Having previously undertaken the dual role of CEO and 
chairman, the orderly handover of responsibilities to the 
new CEO was critical and this process was overseen by the 
nomination committee.
This year, the committee has been actively involved in 
the recruitment process to identify and appoint a new 
chief financial officer (“CFO”). This process followed the 
resignation of our current CFO, Pierre Louw, who will hand 
over responsibilities in April 2016.
Following a short, but thorough recruitment exercise, I am 
pleased to advise that Ross Jerrard will join Centamin as 
CFO with effect from 18 April 2016. Ross was selected 
from a shortlist of candidates, all of whom were highly 
qualified individuals, who were either CFOs within the 
mining industry, or individuals who held senior positions 
within audit and assurance or as commercial accountants. 
The committee are fully supportive of the appointment of 
Ross, who will bring a wealth of experience, enthusiasm 
and leadership to the CFO role. Ross was lead audit partner 
with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Perth, where he was based 
for the last thirteen years. Ross previously served as the 
engagement partner for the audit of Centamin’s Australian 
subsidiaries (these subsidiaries are now audited by PwC) and 
the appropriate clearance procedures have been followed 
in relation to his appointment with Centamin. Ross has led 
many teams providing audit and related financial advisory 
services to public companies, and national and international 
groups. Prior to moving to Australia, Ross worked in 
southern Africa and the Middle East providing services 
for a range of resource companies. Specifically relevant 
to Centamin is that he spent three‑and‑a‑half years in 
Egypt, based in Cairo, acting for multinational companies 
operating in the region.
The committee also recommended the appointment 
of Trevor Schultz, as chairman of the HSES committee, 
following the retirement of Bob Bowker. Following Bob’s 
retirement, the committee evaluated the board composition 
as well as the experience, balance and skill set on each of 
the committees. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
Centamin plc Annual report 2015 
Directors’ report

The committee met three times during the year and also 
carried out the following activities:
•	 made recommendations as to the structure, size and 
composition of the board and board committees;
•	 reviewed the competencies, skills, knowledge and 
experience of directors;
•	 reviewed the board succession plans;
•	 made recommendations for the appointment and 
re‑election of directors to the board;
•	 considered the requirements for board diversity 
(including gender diversity); and
•	 updated the policy on senior and executive recruitment 
and succession planning.
Within the remit of the nomination committee, there is a 
requirement to ensure adequate succession planning is 
routinely discussed. Reviews of management capabilities 
and potential are performed on a routine basis and 
resources allocated to assist with this.
In 2015, the nomination committee and the board discussed 
the need for any new appointments to the board, either 
through the process of succession planning or external 
appointments. Discussions of this nature will continue 
in 2016.
The report provides more detail on the activities, decisions 
and policies of the nomination committee and the board.
Edward Haslam
Chairman of the nomination committee

As part of our succession planning, we will continue to appoint

NomINatIoN report continued
Nomination committee
As at the date of this report, the nomination committee 
comprises Edward Haslam (chairman), Mark Arnesen 
and Kevin Tomlinson, all of whom are independent 
non‑executive directors of the Company. All appointed 
members attended all three committee meetings held 
during the year.
Board diversity
The board set out its updated policy on recruitment, the 
selection process and succession planning in the 2014 
annual report.
The board has further considered the recommendations 
of the nomination committee both in connection 
with recruitment policy, selection process and 
succession planning.
In particular, in connection with board diversity, the board’s 
position is that, whilst all appointments should be continued 
to be made on merit, female candidates will be considered 
routinely as part of the recruitment process. It remains the 
board’s intention to identify a suitable female candidate as 
part of the recruitment process as and when the need arises 
for a new appointment at board level.
In addition, and as part of our succession planning, we will 
continue to appoint and encourage female professionals to 
ensure a progressive pipeline of talent within the Company’s 
management and senior management team.
In this last context the committee noted that a number of 
females already hold senior positions within the Company, 
in the areas of legal, accountancy, HSES and subsidiary 
directorships. However, as set out in the CSR report, mining 
is traditionally a male‑dominated industry and, of our 
Egyptian workforce, only 1% are female. This is mainly due 
to social conditions in Egypt and in the Middle East where 
in general female employees are not encouraged to work at 
remote sites. A greater percentage of females are employed 
throughout the group in the administrative offices and at 
the Company’s headquarters.
In developing the Company’s policy on diversity, the board 
has considered the requirements of the Code and National 
Instrument 58‑101.
The board, through the recommendations of the nomination 
committee, will provide an update on the recruitment 
process in future reporting disclosures.
Details of the current composition of the board and the 
wider management team are set out in the directors’ report.
Performance evaluation
The senior independent non‑executive director held 
meetings with the non‑executive directors without the 
executive directors present, providing feedback to the full 
board. These meetings focused primarily on the evaluation 
of the board’s performance, a performance evaluation of 
the chairman and CEO, discussing the quality of reporting 
and information flows to the board and discussions on the 
strategic aims and objectives for the group. 
The non‑executives also discussed openly with the 
executive directors, the areas they could assist further with 
in relation to business development.
An evaluation of the board and its committees was 
undertaken during the year and was concluded in March 
2016. The board, in conducting its evaluation, reviewed 
the activity, composition and expertise of the committees 
and considered their effectiveness taking account of 
the following:
•	 the responsibilities set out in their respective charters;
•	 activities carried out during the year, taking account of 
their mandated duties and responsibilities; 
•	 progress made in respect of their duties and 
responsibilities;
•	 attendance and contribution to the committees; and
•	 reporting and updates provided to the board.
The board noted in particular that the committees had 
become more streamlined and the timely delivery of 
committee and board papers had allowed the board to 
spend more time discussing key issues.
The board reviewed its own membership and performance 
and this review was concluded in March 2016.
The nomination committee had recommended that Trevor 
Schultz be appointed to replace Bob Bowker as HSES 
committee chair. The board, whose views were supported 
by the nomination committee, agreed that the board 
continued to have the required breadth of expertise and 
there was no immediate need to seek a replacement for 
Bob Bowker.
The board discussed in detail the scope and remit of the 
new CEO, Andrew Pardey, and specifically the KPIs and 
areas of focus for Andrew Pardey. Key to the success of 
the new CEO would be to ensure Andrew Pardey had the 
required resources, induction and support of the board.  Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information

The committee and the board were involved in ensuring 
an orderly handover of certain responsibilities that  
Josef El‑Raghy assumed whilst acting in the joint role 
of chairman and CEO.
The board is assisted by the nomination committee on 
its evaluation of the non‑executive directors. An external 
facilitator will be appointed in May 2016 to assess the 
effectiveness of the board. The last review by an external 
facilitator was carried out in May 2013.
The performance of all directors is constantly reviewed 
by the chairman and, periodically, by the nomination 
committee. The Company deployed a formal process for 
evaluation of the board, the board members, the board 
committees and the chairman during the relevant period led 
by the senior independent non‑executive director.
The board has also had training sessions on various topics 
during the year, carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
– topics included corporate governance updates and 
identification of risks and risk management processes.  Centamin plc Annual report 2015

1. Introduction and annual statement
As chairman of the remuneration committee, I am pleased 
to present the remuneration report and policy for 2015/16.
The committee made good progress on its planned 
objectives during 2015, which saw the introduction of a new 
long term incentive scheme. The scheme was presented to 
shareholders at the AGM and 99% of votes were in favour of 
the new restricted share plan.
changes in the board
Andrew Pardey was appointed chief executive officer 
(“CEO”) on 1 February 2015 with Josef El‑Raghy, interim 
CEO, standing down as CEO and continuing in his role as 
executive chairman. The committee undertook a thorough 
review of the roles and responsibilities of both executives 
and as a result recommended changes to Andrew Pardey’s 
remuneration package and an update to their balance 
scorecards, which are used to determine the annual bonus.
salary reviews
The committee undertook salary reviews for both of the 
executive directors. The review took into consideration 
the directors’ personal performance, their updated roles 
and responsibilities and industry benchmarking data. 
Consideration was also given to the fact that the base salary 
for Josef El‑Raghy (chairman) has remained unchanged for 
over four years. The committee proposed an increase of 3% 
for Josef El‑Raghy from 1 January 2016. On appointment 
as CEO, Andrew Pardey received a 10% salary increase and 
a further 7% increase for Andrew Pardey is proposed, with 
effect from 1 April 2016. As disclosed in last year’s report, 
Andrew Pardey’s salary has been increased in incremental 
steps, as Andrew transitions into the role of CEO. These 
increases realign his remuneration package from the 
position before joining the board to the appropriate market 
rate now that Andrew is CEO and a director of the board.
recommended and approved salary increases
 Base salary Increase  New base salary
Josef El‑Raghy  
(chairman) £500,000 3% £515,000

Andrew Pardey  
(CEO) £430,000 7% £460,000  
   (effective  
   1 April 2016) 
The executive directors’ contracts were reviewed 
and updated this year ensuring they were up to date 
with any legal developments and aligned with best 
practice guidelines.
Fee reviews 
Reviews of the non‑executive directors’ fees were 
undertaken. There were no proposed changes to the 
structure of the non‑executive directors’ fees. A reduction 
in the fee for the role of deputy chairman and senior 
independent non‑executive director took effect in July 2015. 
This fee reduction was due to Josef El‑Raghy resuming his 
sole role as chairman and assuming responsibility for all 
chairmanship duties (further details are set out below).
New rsp
Andrew Pardey (CEO) now participates in the new RSP . 
Josef El‑Raghy (chairman) does not currently participate in 
the scheme and as a shareholder with a 6.2% interest in the 
Company, Josef El‑Raghy remains aligned with the interests 
of shareholders. Josef El‑Raghy’s participation in the new 
scheme will be reviewed in 2016 to consider if participation 
in 2017 would be appropriate. Centamin plc Annual report 2015

remuNeratIoN report continued
1. Introduction and annual statement continued
shareholder consultation
I have taken the views of shareholders and proxy advisory 
services, following which we developed our new restricted 
share plan to include claw back provisions. Further details of 
the share plan can be found on pages 96 and 97. We would 
like to thank shareholders for their constructive feedback on 
the remuneration report and share scheme. I will continue 
to engage with shareholders, proxy advisory firms and other 
stakeholders throughout 2016.
simple approach to remuneration
The committee remains wedded to a simple approach to 
remuneration and the introduction of the new restricted 
share plan will help ensure both executives have a 
meaningful actual shareholding to directly link their interests 
with those of the shareholders. There is no better union 
of interest between shareholder and executives than for 
executives to be substantial shareholders in their own right.
Delivering the strategic aims of the company
As set out in the business model, Centamin creates value 
through the process of gold exploration and production, 
maximising production at the lowest possible cash 
operating and all‑in sustaining cost. The gold/silver doré 
bars produced at Sukari are sold to our appointed refiners 
who in turn refine the doré bars and sell the near‑pure gold 
at the price determined by the London bullion markets. As 
set out in the risk matrix, the Company is exposed to the 
daily fluctuations in the price of gold, receiving the market 
rates on the day of sale. Consequently, revenue cannot be 
directly linked with the performance of the executive and 
therefore the remuneration committee uses other metrics 
to measure the success of the executive directors, which are 
set out below.
Background to remuneration decisions
Cash generation:
•	 439,072 ounces produced (re‑guided upwards during the 
year) representing a 16% increase on 2014;
•	 2015 production at US$713/oz cash operating costs and 
US$885/oz AISC;
•	 further production upside/lower cash costs at Sukari for 
no material capex; and
•	 US$200 million in cash at 31 December 2015.
Shareholder returns:
•	 dividend returns, with free cash flow to fund the next 
stage of growth;
•	 no debt, no hedging and Sukari capex complete; and
•	 share price performance relative to peers.
Growth:
•	 exploration/development to be funded from cash 
reserves after dividend;
•	 significant Sukari reserve expansion potential, especially 
via high grades from the underground operation; and
•	 advanced exploration in Burkina Faso; highly prospective 
tenements in Côte d’Ivoire.
Social responsibility:
•	 LTIFR rates at Sukari for 2015 of 0.12 per 200,000 a 
reduction of 70% on 2014;
•	 training and staff development;
•	 community projects; and
•	 government relations.
Bonus structure
The executive bonus opportunity and structure for 2015 will 
remain the same in 2016. For the executives the maximum 
bonus opportunity is 175%. This bonus opportunity 
for executives will be reduced to a maximum bonus 
opportunity of 125% in any year where an award under the 
new restricted share plan (“RSP”) is made.
summary
The Company performed well in 2015, and 2016 should 
see further increases in gold production and a reduction in 
cash operating costs and all‑in sustaining costs. There are 
still challenges in respect of the litigation, details of which 
are set out in note 20 to the financial statements. However, 
from an operational and financial perspective this has been 
another successful year and it is within this context that the 
key remuneration decisions for 2015 described below have 
been taken by the remuneration committee.
The following report has been made available to the 
auditors; PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , and section 4 (where 
indicated), ‘annual remuneration report’ has been audited

2. Summary of executive remuneration
chairman
Base salary for Josef El‑Raghy, which is paid in sterling, 
remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive year at 
GBP500,000 for 2015 and will rise by 3% effective from 
1 January 2016.
The bonus outcome for Josef El‑Raghy for 2015 was 70% 
of the maximum opportunity which equates to GBP612,500 
and represents 122.5% of base salary. As Josef El‑Raghy 
does not participate in any long term incentive plan, no 
awards were either granted or vested and hence the 
annual bonus plan is the sole incentive arrangement for 
Josef El‑Raghy. The bonus calculation is made by reference 
to a balanced scorecard which comprises of a combination 
of financial, operational and individual performance criteria. 
Full details are on pages 90 and 91.
chief executive officer
Base salary for Andrew Pardey, which is paid in sterling, 
increased from GBP390,000 to GBP430,000 (10% increase) 
following his appointment as CEO. A further increase of 7% 
(the second stage of the realignment of his remuneration 
following appointment as CEO) will be effective from 
1 April 2016.
The bonus outcome for Andrew Pardey for 2015, whilst 
undertaking the role of executive director, was 68% of the 
maximum opportunity, which equates to GBP285,600 and 
represents 68% of base salary. Andrew Pardey participated 
in the new restricted share plan receiving 900,000 awards 
(representing 150% of base pay) in June 2016, and these 
awards remain subject to the performance conditions set 
out in the scheme. A further grant of awards under the 
terms of the RSP are to be made in April 2016 in accordance 
with the rules of the scheme and our remuneration policy. 
Awards made to Andrew under the terms of the DBSP , 
issued prior to his appointed as CEO, will vest over the next 
two years. The bonus calculation is made by reference to 
a balanced scorecard which comprises of a combination of 
financial, operational and individual performance criteria. 
Full details are on pages 91 and 92.
3. The committee
the committee membership
The remuneration committee is a committee of the 
Company represented by three non‑executive directors, 
namely, Edward Haslam (chairman of the committee), Mark 
Arnesen and Kevin Tomlinson, all of whom are regarded 
as independent.
No member of the committee has any financial interest, 
other than as shareholder, in the matters decided by 
the committee. None of the members of the committee 
participate in any bonus scheme, long term incentive, 
pension or other form of remuneration other than the fees 
disclosed below and the statutory superannuation for the 
Australian resident directors. There is no actual or potential 
conflict of interest arising from the other directorships held 
by members of the committee.
All members of the committee attended the four meetings 
held during 2015, with Mark Arnesen chairing the meeting 
where Edward Haslam’s remuneration was discussed 
(Edward Haslam was not present during these discussions). 
Full details of the attendance at the board and committee 
meetings are detailed on page 68.
Josef El‑Raghy may attend meetings of the committee to 
make recommendations relating to the performance and 
remuneration of his direct reports but neither he nor the 
company secretary are in attendance at meetings when 
their own remuneration is under consideration.

The responsibilities of the committee are set out in the 
charter and include:
•	 the remuneration, recruitment, retention, termination, 
superannuation and incentive policies and procedures for 
executives and senior management; and 
•	 the performance conditions, criteria and policies for the

Advisers to the committee
During the year the committee was supported by the 
company secretary. MEIS executive compensation data 
was appointed as adviser to the committee in respect of its 
work on executive remuneration. MEIS does not provide 
any other service to the Company and is regarded as 
independent by the committee. MEIS is engaged on an 
annual retainer for GBP8,000 for a twelve‑month period. 
MEIS was originally appointed on the recommendation 
of the remuneration committee and is regarded by the 
committee as providing independent advice as it has no 
connections with the directors and officers of the Company 
other than this engagement.
4. Our remuneration policy 
introduction
The remuneration report and the remuneration policy were 
put to shareholders on an advisory basis at the AGM on 
18 May 2015 and the resolutions were passed by a majority 
of 98% and 99%, respectively. The remuneration policy 
and application of the policy will be subject to separate 
non‑binding advisory vote at the AGM on 11 May 2016. 
The remuneration policy will be effective following the 
AGM until the next AGM in 2017.
The policy that was put to shareholders on 18 May 2015 
on an advisory basis remains in force until the conclusion of 
the AGM in 2016. A copy of the policy is available on the 
Company’s website. There are no proposed changes to the 
policy in 2016, however, as the policy was on a non‑binding 
vote we will continue to put our policy to shareholders on 
an annual basis. The remuneration policy is set out below 
and the application of the policy in 2016 is detailed below.
In developing its remuneration policy, the committee has 
had regard to the fact that the business of the Company is 
operated outside the UK and in a market which requires the 
engagement, motivation and retention of very particular 
operational and managerial personnel and skills. The 
remuneration policy therefore seeks to:
•	 position remuneration packages to ensure that they 
remain competitive, taking account of all elements of 
remuneration and be reflective of the performance 
of the Company;
•	 use external benchmark data on a transparent and open 
basis using comparator groups that reflect the industry 
and size of the Company;
•	 provide incentive arrangements for relevant employees 
that are based upon pre‑agreed performance criteria 
against which individuals will then be tested. Such 
incentives should be relevant and stretching;
•	 provide long term incentives that encourage the 
involvement, in the long term, of the performance of the 
Company; and
•	 encourage executives, and in particular executive 
directors, to build and then maintain a meaningful 
shareholding in the Company.

Element Details For 2015 For 2016
Base Pay
Objective
Base pay to be 
set competitively 
so as to allow 
the motivation 
and retention of 
key executives of 
the calibre and 
skills necessary to 
support Centamin’s 
short and long term 
objectives.
Pay is reviewed annually and any change 
ordinarily takes effect from 1 January.
Salaries are benchmarked against a number 
of comparator groups as described below 
to provide a balanced approach. Increases 
will take account of those of the general 
workforce.
Increases will take account of the performance 
of the individual and the benchmarked data 
but any increase which exceeds that of the 
general workforce may only normally be 
awarded in cases of a change in responsibility, 
complexity and nature of the role or size of the 
organisation or when the pay level becomes 
out of line with the market data.
The base salary for 2015  
was as follows:
Josef El‑Raghy  
GBP500,000
Andrew Pardey  
GBP390,000  
(from 1 February 2015) and  
GBP430,000 (from 1 April 2015)
There is no intended change 
in the policy for 2016. A 3% 
increase has been awarded 
for Josef El‑Raghy effective 
from 1 January 2016 and a 7% 
increase has been awarded for 
Andrew Pardey effective from 
1 April 2016.

Benefits
Objective
Benefits may be 
provided where 
necessary to 
ensure competitive 
remuneration 
packages are 
consistent with 
the market.
The normal benefits that may be provided 
include such items as car or car allowance, 
life assurance, private medical provision, 
subscriptions and phones. Normal benefits will 
not currently exceed 5% of base pay. 
Where necessary, due to the location 
of operations of the business, it may be 
necessary to provide additional benefits 
such as private security, accommodation and 
reasonable travel costs or enhanced provision 
of other benefits. Additional benefits may not 
exceed 10% of base pay. 
Therefore normal benefits and additional 
benefits will not currently exceed 15% of 
base pay.
A proportion of benefits were 
utilised in 2015.
Benefits to remain within the 
policy.
Pension
Objective
Positioned to 
ensure competitive 
packages and 
provision of 
appropriate income 
for executives in 
retirement.
A payment in lieu of pension will be made 
between 10% and not more than 20% of base 
pay. Where any payment is required to be 
made under a statutory provision then this 
amount will be included within the above limit. 
No director has a prospective entitlement 
to a defined benefit pension by reason of 
qualifying services.
Josef El‑Raghy receives a cash 
payment in lieu of a pension 
equivalent to 20% of his 
base salary.
There is no intended change 
to the pension contribution 
for Josef El‑Raghy. There is no 
current pension contribution 
for Andrew Pardey, however 
a pension contribution for 
Andrew Pardey, in line with the 
policy, will be considered by the 
remuneration committee in 2016.
Annual bonus
Objective
To provide a 
driver and reward 
for the delivery 
of short term 
performance goals, 
normally over 
the course of the 
financial year.
Performance criteria, which are set at the 
beginning of each year, are based upon a 
balanced scorecard approach. The balanced 
scorecard shall be based 70% on financial, 
operational and strategic targets and 30% on 
individual key tasks.
The performance measures are selected to 
provide an appropriate balance between 
incentivising executive directors to meet 
financial/operational targets for the year and 
incentivising them to achieve specific strategic 
objectives. In selecting the performance 
conditions for each year, consideration will 
be given to market expectations and the 
performance measures that are generally 
regarded as reflective of the performance of 
the industry. These will normally be selected 
from financial performance measures 
(profitability, cost against budget and 
operational efficiency), strategic measures 
(M&A opportunities, exploration and project 
delivery), corporate measures (health and 
safety and corporate governance) and 
individual tasks.
For executive directors, the maximum 
annual bonus opportunity is 175% of base 
salary, however a lower amount will be set 
for executive directors who participate in 
the new RSP . On target bonus is just above 
half of the maximum opportunity at 57% of 
the maximum.
The committee may apply claw back to any 
bonus where the committee is of the view 
that facts have come to light, which had they 
been known at the time, would have affected 
the committee’s decision to pay part or all of 
any bonus.
Bonus maximum opportunity of 
175%. Actual outcome for Josef 
El‑Raghy was 70% of maximum.
Bonus maximum opportunity 
of 100%. Actual outcome for 
Andrew Pardey was 68% of 
maximum.
Bonus maximum opportunity of 
175%, reducing to a maximum 
opportunity of 125% of base 
salary in any year an award is 
made to an executive under the 
new RSP . Centamin plc Annual report 2015 
Directors’ report

policy if a new director is appointed
The Company has a track record of succession planning and 
growing and promoting talent internally as demonstrated by 
the appointment of the new CEO.
When hiring a new executive director, or promoting an 
individual to the board, the committee will offer a package 
that is sufficient to attract and motivate while aiming to pay 
no more than is necessary taking account of market data, 
the impact on other existing remuneration arrangements, 
the candidate’s location and experience, external market 
influences and internal pay relativities.
The structure of the remuneration package of a new 
executive director will follow the policy above, however 
in certain circumstances, the committee may use other 
elements of remuneration if it considers it appropriate with 
due regard to the best interests of the shareholders. In 
particular, a service contract that contains a longer initial 
notice period, tapering down to twelve months over a 
set period of time, the buy‑out of short and or long term 
incentive arrangements (taking account of the performance 
measures on such incentives) as close as possible on a 
comparable basis, the provision of long term incentives 
and the provision of benefits such as housing allowance or 
similar particularly where it is an expatriate appointment.
The committee may, where necessary and in the interest of 
shareholders, also offer recruitment incentives to facilitate 
the recruitment of an appropriate individual subject to the 
following limits:
•	 annual bonus plus buy‑out short term incentives as 
described above will not exceed 175% of base pay; and
•	 long term incentives will be limited to an aggregate of 
250% in the first year or where there is a buy‑out of long 
term incentives as described above to 150%.
The limits of 175% and 250% (as set out above) are the 
limits that cover all awards, be they standard or recruitment 
awards. Specifically the remuneration committee cannot 
make standard awards plus these awards, as the limits of 
175% and 250% are the absolute limits.
To facilitate the buy‑out awards outlined above the 
committee may grant awards to a new executive director 
under Listing Rule 9.4.2. The total package offered to a 
new recruit will not exceed the overall limits set out in the 
Company’s remuneration policy.

Long term 
incentives
Objective
To align the 
interests of 
the executive 
with those of 
shareholders 
through a 
meaningful 
ownership of shares.
The new RSP was approved at the AGM 
in 2015. Executive directors and senior 
employees may participate in the new scheme 
at the recommendation of the committee. 
Details of the new RSP are set out on pages 
96 and 97.
For management, but not directors, the 
Company has a deferred bonus share plan 
(“DBSP”) as part of the annual bonus. The 
Company can require up to 100% of a bonus 
to be deferred into shares. Such shares will 
then be released typically as to a third at the 
end of each 12, 24 and 36 month period.
900,000 awards were granted 
to Andrew Pardey in June 2015 
under the terms of the RSP . 
5,145,000 awards in total 
were granted in June 2015 to 
employees. No awards were 
made under the DBSP in 2015.
Awards under the terms of the 
RSP are to be made to Andrew 
Pardey in April 2016. The RSP is 
available to all executives (and 
senior management), however 
there are no current plans to 
make awards to Josef El‑Raghy.
Share ownership 
requirement
Objective
To encourage 
ownership of 
shares and thereby 
create a link of 
interest between 
shareholder and the 
executives.
Executive directors are required to build a 
holding of shares in the Company equivalent 
to 150% of base salary over a five year period 
from appointment. Vested and unvested 
shares are to be included in the calculation.
Josef El‑Raghy (and family) 
hold an interest of 6.2% in the 
Company which represents a 
value of 9,144% of base salary.
Andrew Pardey holds 2,968,800 
shares in the Company (including 
unvested awards under the 
DBSP and RSP) which represents 
a value of 440% of base salary. 
Values are based on the share 
price at 31 December 2015.

policy on payment for loss of office
The Company’s approach to payment on loss of office 
will take account of the circumstances of the termination 
of employment. In the case of a good leaver then the 
individual will be expected to work through the notice 
period and will be entitled to all the benefits under the 
service agreement during that period.
In the case of a termination as a result of poor performance 
or a breach of any of the material terms of the agreement, 
then the Company may terminate with immediate effect 
without notice and with no liability to make any further 
payment to the individual other than in respect of amounts 
accrued due at the date of termination.
Where the Company wishes to terminate the agreement 
and make a payment in lieu of notice, this payment shall be 
phased in monthly or quarterly instalments over a period of 
no longer than twelve months (or the notice period if less) 
and any payment should be reduced in accordance with the 
duty on the executive to mitigate his loss. The Company 
will consider if any bonus amount is to be included in the 
calculation when determining the payment in lieu of notice. 
Any bonus (if included at all) would be restricted to the 
director’s actual period of service only.
In the case of notice given in connection with and shortly 
following a change of control then the executive directors 
are entitled to payment in lieu of an amount equal to twelve 
month’s basic salary plus bonus. Any bonus that may be 
due to him at the completion of the change of control, shall 
be determined by the remuneration committee and such 
bonus (if any) would be based on the period only up to the 
completion of the change of control, taking account of all 
the relevant key performance indicators.
Claw back provisions for executive directors relate to bonus 
and holiday taken in advance.
In relation to the RSP , the Company’s approach to payment 
on loss of office will take account of the circumstances 
of the termination of employment. In the case of a good 
leaver then the individual will be expected to work through 
the notice period and will be entitled to all the benefits 
under the service agreement during that period. In the 
case of a termination as a result of poor performance or a 
breach of any of the material terms of the agreement then 
all unvested awards and all vested but unreleased awards 
will lapse.
A new claw back provision has been included in the RSP , 
since the approval of the RSP at the AGM. This provision 
relates to the dismissal of an eligible employee for gross 
misconduct, fraud or matters materially adversely affecting 
the group’s reputation. If an award holder ceases to be an 
eligible employee under this provision, in the period after 
the award has vested, but before the settlement of the 
deferred shares, any subsisting rights in the award shall 
immediately lapse upon the date of such cessation.
In the case of death, annual bonus will be determined 
by the remuneration committee, which shall determine 
the bonus to be paid taking account of the duration in 
employment and performance of the Company and long 
term incentives shall be treated in the same way as a 
good leaver.
policy on external board appointments
The Company encourages the executive directors to 
have non‑executive external appointments provided that 
such appointments do not adversely impact on the duties 
required to be performed to the Company. Where there are 
external appointments the director will retain any fees for 
such appointments and will not be liable to account to the 
Company for such fees.

Element Details For 2015 For 2016
Non‑executive 
director fees
Objective
To attract and 
retain high calibre 
non‑executive 
directors by 
the provision of 
competitive fees.
Non‑executive directors receive annual 
fees within an aggregate directors’ fee pool 
limited to an amount which is approved by 
shareholders.
Fees are reviewed every two years against 
the same comparator groups as used for the 
executive directors.
Non‑executive directors do not participate in 
any incentive arrangements.
Deputy chairman and senior independent 
non‑executive director (“SNED”). The fees 
for the SNED were reduced in 2015 due 
to Josef El‑Raghy resuming his sole role as 
chairman and assuming responsibility for all 
chairmanship duties.
The fees were reviewed in 2013 
and the following applied from 
1 April 2013:
•	 basic fee GBP65,000;
•	 chair of a committee 
GBP10,000; and
•	 member of a committee 
GBP5,000.
The fees payable to the SNED 
are subject to an annual 
review. The fees for the other 
non‑executives will next be 
reviewed in 2016. Otherwise the 
fees will remain as for 2013.
Incentives
Objective
No incentives.
The non‑executive directors do not participate 
in any short or long term incentive plans.

4. Our remuneration policy continued
remuneration arrangement across the company
Our remuneration policy for executive directors is consistent 
with that across the Company and aims to attract and 
retain high performing individuals and to reward success. 
Base pay and benefits are set competitively taking account 
of the individual’s performance and market data. Annual 
incentives are typically linked to local business performance 
with a focus on performance against key strategic business 
objectives. Key management team members may also 
receive some of their annual bonus in shares which are 
deferred. At this time there are no all employee share 
arrangements but this is kept under review on a regular basis 
taking account of the locations the Company operates in and 
the appropriateness of share base rewards in such locations.
All employees of Sukari Gold Mine Company (the majority 
of whom are based at the Sukari mine site) are subject to a 
performance‑related bonus which is linked to the underlying 
operation performance, and cost control measures at the 
mine. Further details on employee relations can be found in 
the CSR report.
For Josef El‑Raghy the graphs assume a base salary 
as disclosed in this report of GBP500,000, pension 
contributions of 20% of base being GBP100,000 and bonus 
from zero at the minimum, to 50% of 175% at target, and 
175% of base for the maximum. There are no benefits or 
long term incentive elements. 
For Andrew Pardey, the graphs assume a base salary 
of GBP430,000, pension contributions of up to 20% of 
base and bonus from zero, to 50% of 125% at target and 
125% of base for the maximum. The graph assumes that 
Andrew Pardey will be awarded shares under the terms of 
the new RSP of 150% of his base salary with an initial award 
of up to 150% of his base salary. For the LTI the assumed 
values are zero for minimum, to 50% of the face value of 
the award at target and the face value of the award for 
the maximum.

Non‑executive director fees (audited)
Non‑executive directors receive annual fees within an aggregate directors’ fee pool limited to an amount which is approved 
by shareholders. The committee reviews and recommends, for board approval, remuneration levels and policies for 
directors within this overall directors’ fee pool. The fees which are paid are also periodically reviewed. The current annual 
fee rate for non‑executive directors is as follows:
 As at  As at  
 31 December 2014 31 December 2015
Annual base fee GBP65,000 (US$101,674) GBP65,000 (US$96,353)
Chairman of a board committee GBP10,000 (US$15,642) GBP10,000 (US$14,824)

1.  W ith ef fect from 1 April 2013, the fees payable to Edward Haslam in his capacity as senior independent director were increased to take account of the 
additional duties undertaken while the roles of CEO and chairman were combined. Following the changes to the board in 2015, these fees were reduced 
from GBP150,000 to GBP125,000 per annum. This fee remains subject to an annual review and given that the Company has an executive chairman, 
Edward Haslam will continue with an enhanced role with fees commensurate with that role. Edward Haslam’s title was changed to deputy chairman and 
senior independent non‑executive director during the year to reflect this ongoing enhanced role. In keeping with the Company’s policy, Edward Haslam did 
not and will not participate in any meeting discussing his fees. 
2. These amounts include any statutory superannuation payments where applicable.
3. The Company reviewed the NED fees during 2015 and no increases in NED fees were proposed in 2015.

5. Annual remuneration report continued
Base pay
Remuneration of the executive directors and the senior 
management team is considered against three criteria 
– general pay levels and pay increases throughout the 
Company, the performance and skills of the individual 
and market data.
In respect of market data for the executive directors and 
the senior management team, a selection of five different 
comparator groups are used in order to gain a balanced 
view of the market data. These comparator groups consist 
of a bespoke list of UK and international mining companies, 
companies with a similar market capitalisation, companies 
with a similar turnover, the mining sector and the FTSE 250. 
Any increase which exceeds that of the general workforce 
may only normally be awarded as a result of change in 
responsibility or change in the complexity and nature of 
the role or the size of the organisation or the pay level 
becoming out of line with market data. Pay is reviewed 
annually and any changes ordinarily take effect from 
1 January.
Base salary for Josef El‑Raghy, which is paid in sterling, 
remains unchanged for the fourth consecutive year at 
GBP 500,000 for 2015 and will rise by 3% effective from 
1 January 2016.
Base salary for Andrew Pardey, which is paid in sterling, 
increased from GBP390,000 to GBP430,000 (10% increase) 
following his appointment as CEO. A further increase of 7% 
will be effective from 1 April 2016.
Over the last four years (the same period since Josef 
El‑Raghy last received a salary increase), employee salaries 
have increased significantly more than the proposed 
marginal increase for Josef El‑Raghy.
Annual bonus
The bonus plan for the executive directors is based upon 
a balanced scorecard approach designed to encourage 
and reward the delivery of operational performance. 
For Josef El‑Raghy the bonus is split 70% business and 
30% individual targets as follows:
•	 70% – the business targets are based on: 
•	 20% – financial (profitability/financial position, total 
cost against budgeted total cost); 
•	 20% – operational (meeting production guidance, 
CSR development and implementation of plan);
•	 20% – strategic measures (M&A opportunities, 
strategic management, M&A opportunities formalise 
the business strategy); and
•	 10% corporate (maintain sound corporate governance 
and structure, board leadership and effective 
management of the board, executive development 
and succession planning).
•	 30% – the individual tasks are based on building 
management team and motivation, formalisation 
and communications of business strategy, in country 
stakeholder management and shareholder relations.
For Andrew Pardey, the bonus is split 70% business and 
30% individual targets as follows:
•	 70% – the business targets are based on: 
•	 25% – financial (profitability/financial position, cost 
against budget and operational efficiency); 
•	 25% – operational (meeting production guidance, 
health safety and environment, CSR development, 
open pit and underground mining, resource and 
reserve growth);
•	 10% strategic measures (exploitation success in 
Egypt and elsewhere, M&A opportunities including 
geographical diversification); and
•	 10% corporate (corporate governance improvements, 
senior staff development, shareholder relations, 
in‑country stakeholder management).
•	 30% – the individual tasks are based on building the 
management team and taking on the new responsibilities 
as CEO.

On this basis, the committee determined that 70% of the maximum bonus, of 175% of Josef El‑Raghy’s 2015 base salary 
had been achieved. This resulted in a payment of GBP612,500 (US$907,945).
As set out in the risk matrix, the Company is exposed to the daily fluctuations in the price of gold, receiving the market 
rates on the day of sale. Consequently, revenue cannot be directly linked with the performance of the executive and 
therefore the remuneration committee use other metrics to measure the success of the executive directors, which are 
set out below.
Further details on performance targets cannot be disclosed as these are commercially sensitive.

To encourage ownership of shares and thereby create a link of interest between shareholder and the executives, the 
remuneration policy (adopted in 2014 and recommended in 2015) requires executive directors to build a holding of shares 
in the Company equivalent to 150% of base salary over a five year period from appointment. Vested and unvested shares 
are to be included in the calculation.

7. Long term incentive arrangements
introduction
Centamin introduced a new long term incentive scheme, 
which was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 
18 May 2015. The aim of the plan is to introduce a long 
term incentive plan that can provide a suitable recruitment 
and retention tool for any new or promoted executives, 
senior management and individuals at executive director 
level. The plan, which complies with best practice 
guidelines, is to provide a platform, as part of the 
remuneration policy, to be used to provide a long term 
reward tool for participants.
New long term incentive plan 
New restricted share plan (“RSP”)
The RSP was approved by the shareholder at the AGM on 
18 May 2015. Full details of the plan are set out in the 2014 
directors’ remuneration report.
Following the adoption of the new restricted share plan, 
the Company has granted 5,145,000 conditional awards 
to employees of the group (900,000 awards were made 
to Andrew Pardey, executive director). 21 employees 
participate in the RSP , including heads of department and 
senior personnel based onsite, as well as members of the 
senior management team located at the head office.
The remuneration committee also proposed an amendment 
to the scheme rules, following feedback from shareholders 
and the proxy advisory organisation and the Company 
subsequently applied an amendment to the published 
scheme rules to include a malus claw back provision. In 
summary, the additional clause has been included so that 
an award holder who ceases to be an eligible employee for 
cause (see definition below) in the period after the award 
has vested but before the settlement of the deferred shares 
(i.e. during the two year holding period) shall immediately 
forfeit his/her rights in the award from the date of cessation. 
Cause is defined as “ceasing to be an eligible employee by 
reason of dismissal for gross misconduct, fraud or materially 
adversely affecting the group’s reputation”.
The awards granted on 4 June 2015 will vest in three years 
(with 50% of the vested shares deferred for a further two 
years) and will be subject to satisfaction of the performance 
conditions which are set out below and divided into three 
tranches:
•	 20% of the award shall be assessed by reference to a 
target total shareholder return (“TSR”). If the top end of 
the TSR target is met (currently anticipated to be if the 
Company is ranked equal to or better than the upper 
quarter total shareholder return of selected comparator 
companies, see below) all 20% of the award tranche shall 
vest. If the Company is ranked at the median level in a 
table of comparator companies by reference to TSR, 25% 
of the award tranche shall vest (i.e. 5% of the award). 
Proportionate amounts of the award tranche will vest for 
results in between;
The comparator group is as follows: Agnico Eagle Mines 
Ltd, AngloGold Ashanti, Centerra Gold, Eldorado Gold, 
Gold Fields Ltd, Kinross Gold Corporation, IAMGOLD 
Resources Inc, Petropavlovsk, Polyus Gold, Randgold 
Resources, Yamana Gold, Inc, Acacia Mining plc/
African Barrick, Alacer Gold, B2 Gold Corp and 
Endeavour Mining;
•	 50% of the award shall be assessed by reference to 
absolute growth in earnings per share (“EPS”). If a 
compound annual growth rate in EPS of the Company 
of 12% is achieved, all 50% of the award tranche shall 
vest. If a compound annual growth rate in EPS of the 
Company of 8% is achieved 25% of the award tranche 
shall vest (i.e. 12.5% of the award). Proportionate 
amounts of the award tranche will vest for results in 
between. With the onset of profit share (expected 
from 2017) likely to impact the growth of EPS, the 
remuneration committee will have the discretion to make 
a fair and equitable adjustment, if necessary, to reflect 
the impact of profit share when assessing the growth 
over the period of the grant. Any such adjustment will be 
discussed with key shareholders at the time; and
•	 30% of the award shall be assessed by reference to 
compound growth in gold production. If a compound 
annual growth rate of 10% of gold production is 
achieved, all 30% of the award tranche shall vest. If a 
compound annual growth rate of 6% of gold production 
is achieved 25% of the award tranche shall vest (i.e. 7.5% 
of the award). Proportionate amounts of the award 
tranche will vest for results in between.
Further awards are intended to be made in April 2016. The 
awards granted in April 2016 will vest following the passing 
of three years. Vesting will be subject to the satisfaction of 
the following performance conditions (and the two year 
holding period for 50% of the vested award) which are 
divided into four tranches, as follows:
•	 TSR: 20% of the award shall be assessed by reference to 
a target total shareholder return (“TSR”). If the top end 
of the TSR target is met (currently anticipated to be if the 
Company is ranked equal to or better than the upper 
quarter total shareholder return of selected comparator 
companies, see below) all 20% of the award tranche shall 
vest. If the Company is ranked at the median level in a 
table of comparator companies by reference to TSR, 25% 
of the award tranche shall vest (i.e. 5% of the award). 
Proportionate amounts of the award tranche will vest for 
results in between. 
The comparator group is as follows: Agnico Eagle 
Mines Ltd, AngloGold Ashanti, Centerra Gold, Eldorado 
Gold, Gold Fields Ltd, Kinross Gold Corporation, 
IAMGOLD Resources Inc, Petropavlovsk, Randgold 
Resources, Yamana Gold, Inc, Acacia Mining plc, Alacer 
Gold, B2 Gold Corp and Endeavour Mining;
remuNeratIoN report continued Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
Centamin plc Annual report 2015 
Directors’ report

•	 Mineral reserves: 30% of the award shall be assessed 
by reference to mineral reserve replacement and 
growth. Reserve replacement is calculated based on the 
cumulative reserve estimates (from June 2015 to the 
most recent reserve estimate prior to vesting) compared 
with the cumulative reserves mined from 31 December 
2015 to 31 December 2018. All 30% of the award will 
vest if the ratio is 105%. 25% of the award tranche will 
vest if the ratio is at least 75% (i.e. 7.5% of the award);
•	 EBITDA: 20% of the award shall be assessed by 
reference to compound growth in EBIDTA. If a 
compound annual growth rate of 10% of EBITDA is 
achieved, all 20% of the award tranche shall vest. If a 
compound annual growth rate of 9% of EBITDA is 
achieved, 25% of the award tranche shall vest (i.e. 5% of 
the award). Proportionate amounts of the award tranche 
will vest for results in between; and
•	 Gold production: 30% of the award shall be assessed by 
reference to compound growth in gold production. If a 
compound annual growth rate of 8% of gold production 
is achieved, all 30% of the award tranche shall vest. If a 
compound annual growth rate of 4% of gold production 
is achieved 25% of the award tranche shall vest (i.e. 
7.5% of the award). Proportionate amounts of the award 
tranche will vest for results in between.
As Sukari reaches optimum production rates, the relative 
year‑on‑year rate of growth slows. Maintaining production 
rates at this optimum level still represents an award, with an 
appropriate incentive to further improve production rates 
through efficiency and optimisation.
The above measures are assessed by reference to current 
market practice and the remuneration committee will have 
regard to current market practice when establishing the 
precise performance conditions for awards.
Deferred bonus scheme (not for directors)
This plan, introduced in 2012, allowing the annual bonus to 
be matched with shares which are then ordinarily released 
in three annual tranches, conditional upon the continued 
employment with the group. The plan was introduced as a 
review of annual bonus arrangements for management with 
the objectives of:
•	 increasing the variable pay element of remuneration;
•	 introducing a new retention element in the remuneration 
package; and 
•	 linking part of that reward to the medium term share 
performance of the Company.
On 4 June 2013, the Company offered participants of 
existing plans the opportunity to replace awards with an 
initial one‑off award under the deferred bonus share plan. 
In June 2014, the participants who met the vesting criteria 
received their first tranche, representing one‑third of the 
original award. An additional grant was awarded in June 
2014 to new and existing participants which also vests in 
thirds over three years.
The plan is not open to directors of the Company and any 
shares used for the plan are not newly issued shares.
The DBSP , now in its fourth year, provides a simple yet 
effective incentive to senior management and senior 
employees below board level, motivating and retaining 
individuals over the longer term. 31 employees participate 
in the DBSP , including heads of department and senior 
personnel based onsite, as well as members of the senior 
management team located at the head office.
Historic long term incentive plan summary
The historic plans, namely the executive directors loan 
funded share plan (“EDLFSP”) and employee loan funded 
share plan (“ELFSP”) 2011 Employee Option Scheme 
(“2011 EOS”) are no longer in use and all shares awarded 
have either being forfeited, lapsed or transferred to other 
schemes. The residual accrual in relation to these schemes 
has been expensed to the profit and loss.
Statement of shareholder voting

Mark Arnesen 
Chairman of the audit and risk committee
Dear shareholders
This report provides you with a summary of the activities 
undertaken by our independent audit and risk committee 
during 2015. The report looks at the involvement of 
the committee in respect of the work carried out by the 
external auditors, the appointment and scope of the new 
internal audit function and the development of the control 
environment in compliance with the Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”).
Audit committee composition and effectiveness
The audit and risk committee is made up of three 
independent non‑executive directors, myself as chairman, 
Mark Bankes and Edward Haslam. Biographies of the 
members of the committee can be found on pages 70 
and 71.
In accordance with the Ontario Securities Commission 
requirements, all members of the committee are considered 
financially literate (pursuant to section 1.5 of the Multilateral 
Instrument 52‑110) and in compliance with the Code, I am 
the member with the required relevant financial experience 
as a professionally qualified accountant.
The board conducted an evaluation of the committee, 
its composition, experience and activities during the year. 
The findings concluded that the committee had made 
a significant contribution during the year to enhance 
the control environment within the finance team and in 
establishing a detailed scoping and action plan in respect 
to the provision of internal audit services.

The committee meetings are regularly attended, by 
invitation, by the Chairman, CEO and CFO along with 
the company secretary and general counsel. PwC are also 
invited to attend relevant committee meetings. Separate 
discussions outside of formal committee meetings are 
regularly held between the external audit partner, the 
committee chairman and the CFO.
The committee meets in person for four scheduled 
meetings during the year. The committee also meet, by way 
of conference call, at least once a quarter to review the draft 
quarterly and annual financial statements. A summary of the 
committee’s main duties and activities carried out during 
2015 is set out below:
External auditor: The committee reviewed the audit 
planning and completion documents and assessed 
the effectiveness of the external auditor, taking into 
consideration the perceptiveness of the auditor in handling 
key judgments and estimates.
Financial reporting: The committee reviewed the quarterly, 
half‑year and annual results and reviewing the application 
of the accounting policies, making recommendations and 
highlighting any matters to the board. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information

Risk reporting: The committee reviewed the risk 
management process and periodic review of the corporate, 
strategic and operational risks. See risk management and 
reporting on page 32 for full details of the risk management 
structure. The committee developed further the internal and 
external reporting to take account of updates to the Code.
Internal controls: The committee reviewed the internal 
control environment, to include controls over financial 
reporting, budgeting and reporting obligations. The 
committee also finalised the appointment of the internal 
auditor and assisted in the scoping of services for 2015 
and 2016 (see below for details of the process and work 
undertaken by the internal auditor). Details of the risk 
management and internal controls are summarised in the 
corporate governance report together with the assessment 
which was undertaken by the board during the year.
Accounting for transactions: The committee reviewed, 
among other reports, the cost recovery model, the 
accounting treatment for SGM and PGM together with 
the procedures for maintaining the PPE register and 
asset allocation. The committee considered the timing 
and modelling of future profit shares with government. 
The committee also reviewed the accounting policies for 
the write down of exploration expenditure during the year 
in respect to Sheba (Ethiopian exploration) which ceased 
operations late in 2015. Details of the financial forecasting 
can be found in the risk management section and 
viability statement.
General: The committee maintained oversight for the 
preparation of accounts for the major subsidiaries, the 
repatriation of funds through the corporate structure, 
the treasury policy and the reorganisation of the Ampella 
group structure which holds the Burkina Faso and 
Côte d’Ivoire assets.
External audit
At the AGM in May 2015, the shareholders approved the 
appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) 
as the Company’s external auditor. PwC’s appointment 
followed a tender process in 2014, conducted in compliance 
with best practice guidelines, and there were no matters 
raised in connection with the subsequent resignation 
of the previous auditor, Deloitte LLP . PwC has, since its 
appointment on 23 June 2014, carried out the review 
engagement for the half year ended 30 June 2014 and 
30 June 2015 as well as the statutory audit for the years 
ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2015.
The committee have been instrumental in ensuring an 
orderly handover of the audit engagement to PwC and the 
process was compliant with relevant auditing standards.
During 2015, PwC attended meetings with the committee 
and the management team, presenting their detailed audit 
plan, their findings and recommendations in respect to 
the issue of their audit review and statutory opinions. PwC 
has open access to the board of directors at all times and 
the audit partner and certain of the audit management 
team attend and present at relevant committee meetings 
throughout the year.
The committee, having considered the audit plans put 
forward by PwC, assessed the content and scope of the 
audit to ensure the key areas have been identified. The 
approach to the audit and identification of the significant 
focus areas were considered appropriate by the committee, 
based on their detailed understanding of the business and 
the control environment and procedures in place. 
PwC has visited the Sukari mine site and audited stock take, 
as well as spending time at our finance and administrative 
offices in Alexandria, Egypt and Jersey. PwC has also met 
with our legal advisers in Cairo.
PwC has arranged training and Q&A sessions during 
the year, attended by management and members of 
the committee to cover topics including governance, 
accounting and risk management updates.
Non‑audit fees
There was no significant non‑audit work carried out by PwC 
during the year, with the majority of the tax advisory services 
continuing to be provided by the Deloitte LLP tax teams 
in the UK and Australia. The group’s policy for non‑audit 
services sets out the categories which the external auditor 
will and will not be allowed to provide to the group and 
those engagements that need pre‑approval of the group. 
Fees for audit services incurred during the year amounted 
to US$345k, there were non‑audit services carried out by 
PwC during the year. Full details are set out in note 22 to 
the financial statements.
Our policy on non‑audit services and auditor independence 
can be found on our website.
Audit rotation
There has been no rotation of audit partner since PwC’s 
appointment. The Company’s policy is to tender the 
external audit every ten years.
Auditor objectivity and independence
The committee continues to monitor the auditor’s objectivity 
and independence and are satisfied that PwC and the group 
have appropriate policies and procedures in place to ensure 
that these requirements are not compromised.  Centamin plc Annual report 2015

External audit continued
external auditor effectiveness
The group has an established control environment which 
ensures regular reporting by its operating mine and 
exploration projects through to the Company’s headquarters 
in Jersey. Progress was made in 2015 to make better use of 
the existing financial reporting programmes, to streamline 
reporting and therefore remove processes which could 
be subject to human error. These improvements in 
the reporting environment have been recognised and 
encouraged by PwC. 
The committee undertakes a review of the effectiveness 
of the external auditor at the half‑year review and annual 
statutory audit. This review compares the original audit 
plan against the delivery of the audit. The committee 
also reviews the process, taking account of the views of 
the senior members of the finance team and the CFO. 
An evaluation of auditor’s findings and recommendations 
are considered, to ensure that all key areas have been 
identified. Where applicable, an action plan and control 
sheet is set up to ensure recommendations are addressed. 
There has been open communication between the 
committee and the auditor. Management has also worked 
well with PwC during the half‑year and full year audit. 
Having carried out the evaluation, the committee is satisfied 
that the audit engagement for the financial year ended 
2015 was both effective and added value to the group.
Appointment of the internal auditor
In 2015, the committee assisted management to complete a 
tender process for the provision of internal audit services.
Having approached a number of firms, including mid‑tier 
and the big four audit firms, BDO LLP was selected based 
on its experience and industry knowledge. There were 
no matters which might otherwise compromise their 
independence and objectivity. The committee assisted 
management in developing the scope of the audit for 2015 
and 2016. BDO LLP reports its findings primarily to the 
committee and discussions are regularly held between the 
audit partner and the chairman of the committee.
In 2015, representatives of BDO LLP visited the mine in 
Egypt and met with the senior heads of department. Having 
carried out an initial assessment, it concentrated the internal 
audit on the core financial controls and corporate risk 
management, as set out below.

action plan and progress updates, following the initial 
internal audit review, will be monitored by the committee 
throughout 2016. 
The scope of work for 2016, which was developed after 
consultation with the management team, the committee 
and BDO LLP , is set out below:

•	 Compliance testing of a 
sample of CA items.
The committee will also monitor the auditor’s progress this year and ensure they have access to the required resources and 
information to complete their scope in 2016.
The internal auditor will make an assessment each year of any significant changes to the risk profile of the organisation 
and consider any areas of focus for the provision of internal audit services. The committee will ultimately be seeking an 
independent viewpoint and assurance over internal control environment from BDO LLP . Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information

Impairment 
of assets 
(other than 
financial 
assets)
Management have concluded that there is no 
indication that an impairment exists, nor have any 
indicators arisen after the reporting period and are 
therefore not required to perform a full impairment 
review under IAS 36.
In making the assessment as to the possibility of 
whether impairment losses have arisen, management 
considered the following indications:
•	 internal sources of information;
•	 external sources of information;
•	 litigation;
•	 the key assumptions applied in the 31 December 
2015 impairment review;
•	 forecast gold prices;
•	 discount rate;
•	 production volumes;
•	 reserves and resources report; and
•	 costs and recovery rates.
The committee reviewed the papers presented 
by management in respect to IAS 39 and are in 
agreement with the conclusions set out above.
Accounting 
for 
transactions
Litigation The group exercises judgment in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposures to contingent 
liabilities related to pending litigation, as well as other contingent liabilities (see note 20 to the financial 
statements). Judgment is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability 
will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the financial settlement.
The details of this litigation, which relate to the loss of the Egyptian national subsidy for Diesel Fuel Oil and 
the ability of the group to operate outside the area of 3km
2
 determined by the Administrative Court of first 
instance to be the area of the Sukari exploitation lease, are given in note 20 to the financial statements and in 
the most recently filed Annual Information Form (“AIF”) which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. 
The committee has reviewed the external legal opinions, the opinions of the Company’s general counsel and 
the facts associated with the litigation and are in agreement with management on the accounting judgments 
and agree that, in the unlikely event, that the group is unsuccessful in either or both of its legal actions, and 
that the operating activities are restricted to a reduced area, it is management’s belief that the group will be 
able to continue as going concern. 
Accounting 
for 
transactions
Going 
concern
Under guidelines set out by the UK Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) the directors of UK listed companies 
are required to consider whether the going concern basis is the appropriate basis of preparation of financial 
statements.
Based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by management, in which any reasonably possible change in 
the key assumptions on which cash flow forecast is based, the directors considered it appropriate to prepare 
the financial statements on the going concern basis. Key assumptions underpinning this forecast include:
•	 litigation as discussed in note 20 to the financial statements;
•	 forecast gold price;
•	 production volumes; and
•	 costs and recovery rates.
These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 have therefore been prepared on a going 
concern basis, which contemplate the realisation of assets and liquidation of liabilities during the normal course 
of operations, in preparing the financial statements.

Accounting 
treatment 
of Sukari 
Gold Mines 
(“SGM”) and 
profit share.
SGM is consolidated within the Centamin group of companies, reflecting the substance and economic reality 
of the Concession Agreement (see note 21 to the financial statements). The group, in considering the relevant 
activities of SGM, its power over these activities and exposure to the variable returns has concluded that the 
group consolidate this interest. A non‑controlling interest is recorded in relation to the equity in the subsidiaries 
that are not attributable to the group. Note 21 to the financial statements sets out in detail the accounting 
treatment for all the assets, liabilities, income and expense of SGM. The committee reviewed papers from 
management and agree with the accounting treatment as set out above.
Due to the cessation of exploration activity in Ethiopia during the year, an impairment of US$6.3 million was 
recorded. The committee reviewed the papers presented by management in respect to IFRS 6 and are in 
agreement with the accounting treatment.
Risk

Jurisdictional 
taxation 
matters
As detailed in note 7 the group operates in several countries and, accordingly, it is subject to the various tax 
regimes in the countries in which it operates. From time to time, the group is subject to review of its related tax 
filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation 
or application of certain rules to the group’s business conducted within the country involved. If the group is 
unable to resolve any of these matters favourably, there may be an adverse impact on the group’s financial 
performance, cash flows or results of operations. In the event that management’s estimate of the future 
resolution of these matters changes, the group will recognise the effects of the changes in its consolidated 
financial statements in the period that such changes occur. Centamin plc Annual report 2015

Fair, balanced and understandable
The committee was satisfied that the controls over the 
accuracy and consistency of the information in the 2015 
annual report were sufficiently robust. The committee 
reviews the control environment and is in receipt of monthly, 
quarterly and annual financial and budgetary information. 
The committee is also involved in the review of all key 
accounting policies and matters requiring judgment 
and estimation.
The committee has, at the request of the board, also 
considered whether the annual report is fair, balanced 
and understandable. In arriving at that decision, the 
committee has been involved in reviewing, at an early 
stage, the content of (both) the financial statements and 
the strategic report (including the business model), the 
performance review and governance reporting throughout 
the report (including the directors’ report). The assessment 
of each component by the committee can be summarised 
as follows:
•	 Is the annual report fair and balanced?
•	 Have the group’s activities been presented fairly in 
all respects?
•	 Does the narrative reporting fairly represent 
financial results?
•	 Have we disclosed key indicators of performance?
•	 Have we applied the appropriate emphasis on the 
material matters?
•	 Do the chairman and CEO reports reflect the 
full story?
The committee considered these questions (and more) and 
as an example, the committee considered the reporting of 
both the positive and less favourable outcomes this year. 
For example, the increase in ounces of gold produced was 
sufficiently weighted against the backdrop of a low gold 
price environment. In addition, the ongoing litigation was 
given prominence in the chairman’s statement. The narrative 
reporting also explained the write down of exploration 
expenditure following the decision to relinquish the licence 
areas in Ethiopia with sufficient narrative relating to the 
ongoing investment at our advanced and early stage 
exploration in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire.
•	 Is the annual report clear and understandable? 
•	 Do we clearly show our business model and strategy 
to the reasonably informed reader of the report?
•	 Have we identified the key metrics and explained the 
significance of these results?
•	 Have we reflected the link between our strategy, 
performance and financials?
•	 Are our risk and governance presented clearly?
The committee recommended an update on how we 
present our risk management process and business model 
this year, which has been implemented in this report (see 
page 32). The additional sign posting and clear presentation 
of the strategic objectives, and how these link to operational 
and exploration activity has also been modified to help the 
user of the report.
The committee concluded that the annual report was ‘fair’, 
‘balanced’ and ‘understandable’ having considered the 
activity of the Company during the period and that users 
of the report would be able to understand our position, 
strategy, business model and overall performance which 
were presented consistently throughout the annual report. 
Control environment
Full details of the risk management and control environment 
are set out in the strategic report on page 32. The risk 
management report concludes by identifying the principal 
risks for the business and the Company’s statements on risk 
appetite and long term viability.
While the board has overall responsibility for risk 
management and internal controls, the board has delegated 
certain responsibilities to this committee. These include 
responsibility over the adequacy of the internal control 
policies and procedures and the effectiveness of internal 
financial controls and risk management systems.
The key features of the control environment are to ensure 
compliance with laws, regulations and other requirements 
relating to external reporting by the Company of financial 
and non‑financial information. The purpose of the risk 
management framework is to understand the risks the 
group faces and to manage them appropriately to enhance 
the Company’s ability to improve its decision making 
process, deliver on its objectives and subsequently improve 
its performance as a mining company.
During the year, the committee reviewed the overall 
control environment, including specific financial controls 
and procedures. The committee also recommended the 
adoption of a new risk framework agreement to formalise 
the existing information and reporting flows between 
the operation, the executive management team and the 
committees and board. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information
Centamin plc Annual report 2015 
Directors’ report
103
As part of the review process, it was necessary to update 
the existing corporate policy on risk and the board adopted 
a revised and updated risk management framework 
agreement. The risk management framework includes 
additional detail about the scope and structure of an 
executive risk management working group, which will be 
preparing quarterly reports on an ongoing basis to help 
implement the suggested improvements following the last 
review and internal audit recommendations. 
The appointment of the internal auditor, BDO LLP , was an 
important step in the Company’s growth strategy, and will 
help the Company and the committee identify any potential 
weaknesses in the control environment and recommend 
improvements for the future.
controls over financial reports and financial statements
The consolidated financial statements and annual report 
are prepared at the Company’s head office in Jersey, where 
the group financial controller and chief financial officer 
are based. The accounting information from the group’s 
operations is provided to the head office where the ledgers 
are consolidated. Appropriate reconciliations and reviews 
are performed at the level of the operation and at the 
group’s head office by way of the performance of monthly, 
quarterly and annual reconciliations.
Going concern and long term viability
The directors considered it appropriate to continue to 
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements. The going concern statement is 
detailed in full in note 3 to the financial statements. The 
statements in relation to the group’s viability, over the longer 
term, are set out in the risk management report on page 37.
External auditor
So far as each current director of the Company is aware, 
the auditor has had full access to all relevant information 
and the committee has answered any questions raised by 
the auditor allowing the auditor to carry out its duties.
The committee recommends to the board the appointment 
of PwC as auditor at the forthcoming annual general 
meeting. PwC has expressed its willingness to continue 
in office as auditor.
Overview
As a result of its work during the year, the committee 
has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its 
terms of reference and has ensured the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditor. A member of the 
committee will be available at the annual general meeting 
along with the CFO to answer any questions in relation to 
this report.
During the year, the committee carried out an evaluation 
of its own performance, taking into consideration the 
contribution to the quarterly and annual accounts and the 
risk review and risk assessment process. The committee also 
considered its composition, the competency, availability and 
contribution of its members and did not recommend any 
further changes to the board.

The directors are also responsible for the preparation of the 
strategic report (including the business model and risk management 
report), directors’ report, directors’ remuneration report, nomination 
report and corporate governance statement. These reports are 
contained within the annual report and financial statements.
These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplate 
the realisation of assets and liquidation of liabilities during the 
normal course of operations, in preparing the financial statements.
The directors consider that the annual report and financial 
statements, when taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
The board receives written assurances from the CEO and CFO 
that to the best of their knowledge and belief, the group’s financial 
position presents a true and fair view and that the financial 
statements are founded on a sound system of risk management, 
internal compliance and control. Further, they confirm that the 
group’s risk management and internal compliance is operating 
efficiently and effectively. The board recognises that internal control 
assurances from the CEO and CFO can only be reasonable rather 
than absolute, and therefore they are not and cannot be designed 
to detect all weaknesses in control procedures.
The financial statements have been audited by the independent 
audit and accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , who 
were given unrestricted access to all financial records and related 
information, including minutes of all shareholder, board and 
committee meetings.
The financial statements were approved by the board of directors 
on 21 March 2016 and signed on their behalf by:

Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the annual report 
and financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and 
financial statements in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law, 1991 (the “Law”) and applicable laws and regulations. The 
Law requires the Company to prepare financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the 
Company has chosen to prepare the accounts in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted 
by the European Union and applicable law.
Under the Law, the directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the group and of the profit or loss of the 
group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
accounting standards require that directors:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the group and Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
the Law. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Due to the Company’s place of incorporation 
and its dual listing, it is subject to legislation in the United 
Kingdom, Canada and Jersey governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements, which may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). 
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective 
judgments, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, 
including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due 
to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on 
our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table on page 106. We have 
also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific 
areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our 
procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete 
list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Changes in areas of focus
In 2015, one addition was made to our areas of focus whilst two 
others were removed. Taxation was added as an area of focus as 
the Group made taxable foreign exchange gains that gave rise to 
a material tax liability. The Group also continues to invest within 
multiple jurisdictions where tax practices are evolving, and therefore 
has to adopt tax positions that can be uncertain. 
The first area of focus removed was accounting for the Group’s 
interest in the Sukari Gold Mine. Our work last year led us to 
concur with the directors’ determination that the Group satisfied 
both the control and exposure to variable returns requirements for 
consolidation under IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ 
(“IFRS 10”). We considered whether any material facts or 
circumstances underlying this conclusion had changed in 2015, and 
satisfied ourselves that they had not. As a result, this was not an 
area of audit focus this year. 
Impairment of the Sukari Gold Mine was also not an area of 
focus this year. Our work last year identified that the gold price 
would have to fall significantly below current levels to trigger an 
impairment if other variables remained constant. During 2015, 
management performed an impairment indicator analysis and 
concluded that no indicators existed. We concurred with this view, 
and consequently did not focus our audit work on this area. 
Report on the Group financial statements 
Our opinion
In our opinion, Centamin plc’s Group financial statements (the 
“financial statements”): 
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2015 and of its profit and cash flows for the year 
then ended; 
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union; and 
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the Annual 
Report, comprise: 
•	 the consolidated statement of financial position as at 
31 December 2015; 
•	 the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the 
year then ended; 
•	 the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then 
ended; 
•	 the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year 
then ended; and 
•	 the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary 
of significant accounting policies and other explanatory 
information. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union. 
Our audit approach
context
Centamin plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange and its 
principal operation is the Sukari Gold Mine in Egypt. Although 
production of gold has increased in 2015, following the completion 
of the Stage 4 expansion in 2014, weakening of the gold price has 
resulted in lower profitability than in the prior period. In addition 
to the operation of Sukari, the Group continues its exploration 
program in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire, having decided in 
2015 to conclude its exploration activities in Ethiopia. 
Overview
Overall Group materiality: $5.4 million which represents 5% of 
three‑year average profit before tax, after exceptional items 
(2014: $7.7 million). The lower materiality in 2015 reflects the lower 
profitability of the Group, principally due to the fall in gold price. 
•	 We focused our audit procedures on the Sukari Gold Mine, as 
well as performing full scope audits over the Group’s significant 
exploration and corporate operations. This resulted in six 
components (2014: three) being subject to an audit of their 
complete financial information and involved performing the 
related audit work in Egypt and Jersey. 
•	 As a consequence of the lower Group materiality and increased 
exploration activity, we brought additional business units into 
scope this year and performed extended audit procedures 
at in‑scope business units to maintain audit coverage levels 
comparable with the prior year. 
•	 All audit work on the areas of focus was performed by the 
Group audit engagement team.

area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
taxation
Refer to page 127 (note 7 to the financial statements) and 
page 34 (Principal risks). 
The Group operates across a number of jurisdictions and, like 
most Groups, is subject to periodic challenges by local tax 
authorities on a range of tax matters during the normal course 
of business. 
Where the amount of tax payable is uncertain, the Group 
establishes provisions based on management’s best judgment 
of the probable amount of the liability. 
In addition, as at 31 December 2015 the Group has current tax 
payable of $6.8 million as the result of taxable foreign exchange 
gains realised during the year, which we considered merited 
our focus.
We held discussions with management regarding their calculation 
of taxes payable and obtained management’s calculation. Where 
management had obtained independent tax advice, we obtained 
that advice and our own tax specialists in the relevant jurisdictions 
evaluated it, using their relevant experience and knowledge. 
We also used our specialists to assist in the audit of the calculation 
of current tax payable in note 7 to the financial statements and 
determined that it was accurate and complete. We also reviewed 
the disclosure of taxes payable in note 7 and determined that it 
was consistent with the requirements of IFRS and the results of 
our audit work. 
For matters where the amount of tax payable was uncertain, we 
tested management’s assessment of the probable amount of the 
liability, involving our tax specialists to satisfy ourselves that tax 
provisions had been appropriately recorded where required. 
the appeal before the supreme administrative court in egypt 
concerning the validity of the sukari concession agreement
Refer to page 134 (note 20 to the financial statements) and page 
34 (Principal risks).
The Group is in the process of appealing a ruling passed by the 
Egyptian Administrative Court in October 2012.
If the ruling is upheld, the Group’s operations at the Sukari site will 
be significantly reduced and there is, therefore, a risk of material 
impairment in property, plant and equipment at Sukari, which had 
a carrying value of $961.5 million at 31 December 2015. 
The outcome of this case is subject to significant uncertainty due 
to ongoing political, social and economic volatility in Egypt.
We discussed the legal case with the Group’s legal team, and 
considered appropriate documentation to understand the 
legal position and the basis of the directors’ assessment of the 
outcome of the court case. 
We assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of 
internal and external legal counsel by considering professional 
qualifications, fee arrangements and other relevant factors. These 
procedures satisfied us internal and external legal counsel were 
competent, capable and objective. 
We also obtained and read a copy of the Concession Agreement, 
as signed by the relevant parties. 
The directors assessed that the Group’s case has strong legal 
merit and will ultimately be successful. Based on our work, 
we determined that the directors had reflected all available 
information in their assessment. 
We tested the disclosures in note 20 to the financial statements 
and determined that they were consistent with the requirements 
of IFRS and the results of our audit work. 
the claim before the administrative court concerning diesel 
fuel disputes 
Refer to page 133 (note 20 to the financial statements) and page 
34 (Principal risks).
The Group is involved in an ongoing legal case relating to 
historical and current fuel subsidies. The potential amount that 
could be recouped by the Group relating to the current subsidy 
case is $208.0 million and the potential amount that the Group 
could have to pay if they lose the historical case is EGP403 million 
(approximately US$51 million at current exchange rates). 
To date, the Group has not provided for the historical case, based 
on internal and external assessments of the merits of the case, 
but has made disclosure of a contingent liability. 
In 2015, the Group has disclosed the impact of the current 
subsidy case, being the difference between international 
and subsidised diesel price that has impacted the Group’s 
results for the year, as an exceptional item in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. No contingent asset has 
been recognised.
We discussed the legal fuel subsidy cases with the Group’s legal 
team, and considered appropriate documentation to understand 
the legal position and to evaluate the directors’ assessment of the 
outcome of the case. 
We assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of 
internal and external counsel, by considering professional 
qualifications, fee arrangements and other relevant factors. These 
procedures satisfied us internal and external legal counsel were 
competent, capable and objective. 
The results of the procedures we performed, as described above, 
supported the directors’ accounting treatment, under which no 
liability was recognised in respect of the historical case and no 
asset was recognised in respect of the current subsidy case. 
We considered whether any new factors had arisen this year 
that would impact the appropriateness of continuing to disclose 
this item as exceptional. There were no new developments of 
this nature. 
We also considered the sufficiency of the disclosure regarding 
the case and found that it was consistent with the requirements of 
IFRS and gave a balanced description of the case.

How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure 
of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which the Group operates. 
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including Group‑wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at Group level. The 
Group is headquartered in Jersey and has production operations 
in Egypt, with exploration activity in Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and 
Côte d’Ivoire. 
Based on that assessment, our Group audit scope focused primarily 
on the Sukari Gold Mine in Egypt, the Group’s principal operation, 
which was subject to a full‑scope audit, as was Pharaoh Gold Mines, 
which holds the Group’s interest in Sukari. In addition the Group’s 
principal exploration asset Ampella Mining Ltd was subject to a full 
scope audit this year reflecting the increased activity in 2015, whilst 
the reduced profit this year meant that Centamin Group Services, 
which incurs some of the Group’s operating expenses, was also 
subject to a full scope audit this year. We visited the Sukari Gold 
Mine and conducted audit fieldwork in Alexandria and Jersey. 
During these visits, we observed and discussed mining operations 
with local management and met with the Group’s external 
in‑country legal counsel in Cairo. 
Furthermore, we performed work over the consolidation of the 
Group’s components and significant head office and consolidation 
adjustments. This approach enabled us to have greater than 90% 
coverage of profit before tax, revenue and total assets within the 
consolidated financial statements. All audit work was performed by 
the Group audit team. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent 
of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line 
items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality for 
the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
Overall Group materiality $5.4 million (2014: $7.7 million). 
How we determined it 5% of three‑year average profit  
   before tax, after exceptional items. 
Rational for   We used the profit before tax after 
benchmark applied    exceptional items benchmark, a 
generally accepted auditing practice 
and took a three‑year average 
to eliminate the effects of gold 
price volatility. 
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to 
them misstatements identified during our audit above $270,000 
(2014: $385,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, 
in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Going concern
The directors have voluntarily complied with Listing Rule 9.8.6(R)
(3)(a) of the Financial Conduct Authority and provided a statement 
in relation to going concern, set out on page 103, required for UK 
companies with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange. 
The directors have requested that we review the statement on 
going concern as if the company were a premium listed UK 
company. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we 
have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation 
to the directors’ statement about whether they considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded 
that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that 
the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and 
that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the 
date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we 
have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis 
is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  Centamin plc  Annual report 2015

Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review the directors’ 
statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, and the directors have 
requested that we review the directors’ statement in relation to 
the longer‑term viability of the Group required under the Listing 
Rules for UK companies with a premium listing on the London 
Stock Exchange. 
Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only 
consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process 
supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in 
alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering 
whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to 
report having performed our review. 
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to 
report arising from this responsibility. 
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the 
corporate governance statement relating to ten further provisions of 
the Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Opinions on additional disclosures
Directors’ remuneration report
The company voluntarily prepares a directors’ remuneration report 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
The directors have requested that we audit the part of the directors’ 
remuneration report specified by the Companies Act 2006 to be 
audited as if the company were a UK‑quoted company. 
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
corporate governance statement
The company prepares a corporate governance statement that 
includes the information with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems and about share capital structures required 
by the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority. The directors have requested that we report on 
the consistency of that information with the financial statements. 
In our opinion, the information given in the corporate governance 
statement set out on pages 67 and 68 with respect to internal 
control and risk management systems and about share capital 
structures is consistent with the financial statements. 
Opinion on other matters
In our opinion the information given in the strategic report and 
the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit 
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement 
set out on page 104, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom 
this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
•	 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
•	 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the directors; and 
•	 the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
directors’ judgments against available evidence, forming 
our own judgments, and evaluating the disclosures in the 
financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit 
evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non‑financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’. IFRS 9 addresses the financial 
reporting of financial assets and financial liabilities. This 
standard replaces IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement’. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into 
two measurement categories: those measured at fair value and 
those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made 
at initial recognition. The classification depends on the entity’s 
business model for managing its financial instruments and the 
contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial 
liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. 
The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is 
taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due 
to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive 
income rather than in net earnings, unless this creates an 
accounting mismatch. The impairment model and hedging rules 
have also been amended under IFRS 9 but the derecognition 
rules remain the same. The group does not expect a significant 
impact from IFRS 9 at the moment as it does not enter into formal 
hedge accounting arrangements, has no long‑term trade or other 
receivables and does not hold financial liabilities at fair value. 
However, the group will need to consider the accounting for 
assets currently held as available‑for‑sale. The new standard will be 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. The new standard will replace IAS 17 ‘Leases’ 
and eliminates the classification of leases as either operating or 
finance leases by the lessee. Classification of leases by the lessor 
under IFRS 16 continues as either an operating or a finance lease, 
as was the treatment under IAS 17 ‘Leases’. The treatment of 
leases by the lessee will require capitalisation of all leases resulting 
in accounting treatment similar to finance leases under IAS 17 
‘Leases’. Exemptions for leases of very low value or short‑term 
leases will be applicable. The new standard will result in an increase 
in lease assets and liabilities for the lessee. Under the new standard 
the treatment of all lease expense is aligned in the statement of 
earnings with depreciation, and an interest expense component 
recognised for each lease, in line with finance lease accounting 
under IAS 17 ‘Leases’. The group’s office building leases will come 
on balance sheet on adoption of IFRS 16 but this is not expected 
to have a significant impact on either the balance sheet or KPI 
reporting. IFRS 16 will be applied prospectively for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
These financial statements are denominated in US dollars (“US$”), 
which is the presentational currency of Centamin plc. All companies 
in the group use the US$ as their functional currency except for the 
UK subsidiaries which are denominated in Great British pounds 
(“GBP”) and the Australian subsidiaries which are denominated 
in Australian dollars (“A$”). All financial information presented in 
United States dollars has been rounded to the nearest thousand 
dollars, unless otherwise stated.
1. General information
Centamin plc (the “Company”) is a listed public company, 
incorporated in Jersey and operating through subsidiaries 
and jointly controlled entities operating in Egypt, Ethiopia, 
United Kingdom and Australia. It is the parent company of 
the group, comprising the Company and its subsidiaries and 
joint arrangements.
Registered office and principal place of business:
Centamin plc 
2 Mulcaster Street 
St Helier, Jersey JE2 3NJ
The nature of the group’s operations and its principal activities 
are set out in the directors’ report and the strategic report of the 
annual report.
2. Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
standards not affecting the reported results nor the 
financial position
In the current year, the new and revised Standards and 
Interpretations that have been adopted have not had a significant 
impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
new standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
Standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective up to 
the date of issuance of the financial statements are listed below. 
This listing of standards and interpretations issued are those that 
the group reasonably expects to have an impact on disclosures, 
financial position or performance when applied at a future date.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’. The new standard 
replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ 
and provides a five step framework for application to customer 
contracts: identification of customer contract, identification of the 
contract performance obligations, determination of the contract 
price, allocation of the contract price to the contract performance 
obligations, and revenue recognition as performance obligations 
are satisfied. A new requirement where revenue is variable 
stipulates that revenue may only be recognised to the extent that 
it is highly probable that significant reversal of revenue will not 
occur. The group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 but 
as the majority of gold sales are not subject to pricing adjustments, 
a significant impact is not anticipated. The new standard will be 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

Sukari Gold Mines (“SGM”) is jointly owned by PGM and EMRA 
on a 50% equal basis. For accounting purposes, SGM is wholly 
consolidated within the Centamin group of companies reflecting 
the substance and economic reality of the Concession Agreement 
(see note 21) and will therefore recognise a non‑controlling 
interest (“NCI”) for EMRA’s participation. Furthermore based on 
the requirements of the Concession Agreement, payments to NCI 
meet the definition of a liability and will be recorded in the income 
statement and statement of financial position (below profit after 
tax), as the EMRA profit share, on the date that a net production 
surplus becomes available. Payment made to EMRA pursuant to 
the provisions of the Concession Agreement is based on the net 
production surplus available as at 30 June, being SGM’s financial 
year end. Pursuant to the Concession Agreement, PGM solely 
funds SGM’s activities. PGM is also entitled to recover the following 
costs and expenses payable from sales revenue (excluding the 
royalty payable to the Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”): (a) all current 
operating expenses incurred and paid after the initial commercial 
production; (b) exploration costs, including those accumulated to 
the commencement of commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% 
of total accumulated cost per annum); and (c) exploitation capital 
costs, including those accumulated prior to the commencement of 
commercial production (at the rate of 33.3% of total accumulated 
cost per annum).
EMRA is entitled to a share of 50% (except for, in accordance 
with the terms of the Concession Agreement, in the first four 
years where it shall be 40% for the first two years and 45% for the 
following two years) of SGM’s net production surplus (“EMRA Profit 
Share”) (defined as revenue less payment of the fixed royalty to 
ARE and recoverable costs). Based on the Company’s calculation 
there was no net profit share due to EMRA as at 31 December 
2015, nor is any likely to be due as at 30 June 2016. Accordingly, 
no EMRA entitlement has been recognised to date. Any payment 
made to EMRA pursuant to these provisions of the Concession 
Agreement will be recognised as a variable charge in the income 
statement (below profit after tax) of Centamin, which will lead to a 
reduction in the earnings per share.
Going concern 
These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplate 
the realisation of assets and liquidation of liabilities during the 
normal course of operations. 
The group meets its day‑to‑day working capital requirements 
through existing cash resources. As discussed in note 20, during 
2012 the operation of the mine was affected by two legal actions. 
The first of these followed from a decision taken by EGPC to charge 
international, not local (subsidised) prices for the supply of Diesel 
Fuel Oil to Sukari, and the second arose as a result of a judgment 
of the administrative court in relation to, amongst other matters, 
the Company’s 160km
2
 exploitation lease. With regard to the first 
decision, the Company remains confident that in the event that it is 
required to continue to pay international prices, the mine at Sukari 
will remain commercially viable. Similarly, the Company remains 
confident that the appeal it has lodged in relation to the decision of 
the Administrative Court will ultimately be successful, although final 
resolution of the matter may take some time. 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and 
adopted for use by the European Union and interpretations 
issued from time to time by the IFRS Interpretations Committee 
(“IFRS IC”) both as adopted by the European Union (EU) and which 
are mandatory for EU reporting as at 31 December 2015, the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, and IFRS as issued by the IASB and 
interpretations issued from time to time by the IFRS IC which are 
mandatory as at 31 December 2015, therefore the group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. The 
group has not early adopted any other amendments, standards or 
interpretations that have been issued but are not yet mandatory.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, as 
modified by available‑for‑sale financial assets, and financial assets 
and financial liabilities (including derivative) instruments at fair value 
through profit and loss.
The group’s financial statements have been prepared on the 
basis of accounting policies consistent with those applied in 
the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 
except for the implementation of a number of minor amendments 
issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU which applied for 
the first time in 2015. These new pronouncements do not have 
a significant impact on the accounting policies, methods of 
computation or presentation applied by the group and therefore 
prior‑period financial statements have not been restated for these 
pronouncements.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining 
the financial statements of all the entities that comprise the 
consolidated entity, being the Company (the parent entity) and 
its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured 
entities) over which the group has control, as defined in IFRS 10 
‘Consolidated financial statements’. Consistent accounting 
policies are employed in the preparation and presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements include the information and 
results of each subsidiary from the date on which the Company 
obtains control and until such time as the Company ceases to 
control such entity. The group controls an entity when the group is 
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement 
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the entity.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany 
balances and transactions, and unrealised profits arising within the 
consolidated entity are eliminated in full. Centamin plc  Annual report 2015

Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL 
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial 
liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. 
A financial liability is classified as held for trading if:
•	 it has been incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing it 
in the near term; or
•	 on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial 
instruments that the group manages together and has a recent 
actual pattern of short‑term profit taking; or
•	 it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a 
hedging instrument. 
A financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading may 
be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
•	 such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a 
measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise 
arise; or
•	 the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets 
or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its 
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance 
with the group’s documented risk management or investment 
strategy, and information about the grouping is provided 
internally on that basis; or
•	 it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded 
derivatives, and IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement’ permits the entire combined contract (asset or 
liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains 
or losses arising on re‑measurement recognised in profit or loss. 
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any 
interest paid on the financial liability and is included in the ‘other 
gains and losses’ line item in the income statement.
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially 
measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an 
effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating 
interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments 
through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where 
appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, 
the group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Going concern continued
With respect to the legal action, on 20 March 2013 the Supreme 
Administrative Court upheld the Company’s application to 
suspend the decision until the merits of the Company’s appeal are 
considered and ruled on, thus providing assurance that normal 
operations would be able to continue during this process. Sukari 
has operated as usual throughout the period.
In the unlikely event that the group is unsuccessful in either or both 
of its legal actions, and that the operating activities are restricted to 
a reduced area, it is the directors’ belief that the group will be able 
to continue as going concern. 
Having assessed the principal risks and the other matters discussed 
in connection with the long term viability statement (refer to the 
risk management report included within the annual report), the 
directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
accounting policies 
Accounting policies are selected and applied in a manner which 
ensures that the resulting financial statements satisfy the concepts 
of relevance and reliability, thereby ensuring that the substance 
of the underlying transactions or other events is reported. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated.
The following significant policies have been adopted in the 
preparation and presentation of these financial statements:
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash 
equivalents are short‑term, highly‑liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the group’s 
balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities and equity 
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial 
liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the group are recognised at the 
proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Financial assets 
Financial assets are recognised and derecognised on trade date 
where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the 
timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially 
measured at fair value, net of transaction costs except for those 
financial assets classified as at fair value through the profit or loss 
which are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investments in subsidiaries are 
measured at cost in the Company financial statements. Other 
financial assets are loans and receivables. The classification 
depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets 
and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Effective interest method 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the 
amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter 
period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Available‑for‑sale financial assets (“AFS”)
Listed shares and listed redeemable notes held by the group 
that are traded in an active market are classified as being AFS 
and are stated at fair value. The group also has investments in 
unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market but that are 
classified as AFS financial assets and stated at fair value (because 
the directors consider that fair value can be reliably measured). Fair 
value is determined in the manner described in note 26. Gains and 
losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated profits with the exception 
of impairment losses, interest calculated using the effective interest 
method and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, 
which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment 
is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve 
is reclassified to profit or loss.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss 
when the group’s right to receive the dividends is established.
The fair value of AFS monetary assets denominated in a foreign 
currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at 
the spot rate at the balance sheet date. The foreign exchange 
gains and losses that are recognised in profit or loss are determined 
based on the amortised cost of the monetary asset. Other foreign 
exchange gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive 
income.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method 
less impairment. Interest is recognised by applying the effective 
interest rate except for short‑term receivables when the recognition 
of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for 
indicators of impairment at each reporting date. Financial assets 
are impaired where there is objective evidence that as a result of 
one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the 
financial asset the estimated future cash flows of the investment 
have been impacted. For financial assets carried at amortised cost, 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the 
impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception 
of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced 
through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable 
is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are 
credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying 
amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
With the exception of available‑for‑sale equity instruments, if, in a 
subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases 
and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent the 
carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is 
reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have 
been had the impairment not been recognised.
In respect of available‑for‑sale equity instruments, any subsequent 
increase in fair value after an impairment loss is recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Derecognition of financial assets 
The group derecognises a financial asset only when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or 
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the 
group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred 
asset, the group recognises its retained interest in the asset and 
an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the group 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a 
transferred financial asset, the group continues to recognise the 
financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the 
proceeds received. Centamin plc  Annual report 2015
Financial statements

Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when 
facts and circumstances (as defined in IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and 
evaluation of mineral resources’) suggest that the carrying amount 
of exploration and evaluation assets may exceed its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount of the exploration and evaluation 
assets (or the cash generating unit(s) to which it has been allocated, 
being no larger than the relevant area of interest) is estimated to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where an 
impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the 
asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, 
but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had 
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in previous years.
Where a decision is made to proceed with development in 
respect of a particular area of interest, the relevant exploration 
and evaluation asset is tested for impairment, reclassified to mine 
development properties, and then amortised over the life of the 
reserves associated with the area of interest once mining operations 
have commenced.
Mine development expenditure is recognised at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. When 
commercial production in an area of interest has commenced, the 
associated costs are amortised over the estimated economic life of 
the mine on a units of production basis.
Changes in factors such as estimates of proved and probable 
reserves that affect unit of production calculations are dealt with on 
a prospective basis.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each group entity are 
presented in its functional currency being the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates. 
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the 
results and financial position of each entity are expressed in 
United States dollars, which is the functional currency of the 
group and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial 
statements except for the UK subsidiaries which are denominated 
in Great British pounds and the Australian subsidiaries which are 
denominated in Australian dollars. 
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, 
transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the 
transactions. At each reporting date, monetary items denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at 
the reporting date. Non‑monetary items carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. 
Non‑monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost 
in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences are 
recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
accounting policies continued
Employee benefits 
A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in 
respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave and 
sick leave when it is probable that settlement will be required and 
they are capable of being measured reliably.
Liabilities recognised in respect of employee benefits expected 
to be settled within twelve months, are measured at their nominal 
values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of 
settlement. Liabilities recognised in respect of employee benefits 
which are not expected to be settled within twelve months are 
measured as the present value of the estimated future cash flows to 
be made by the consolidated entity in respect of services provided 
by employees up to reporting date.
Superannuation
The Company contributes to, but does not participate in, 
compulsory superannuation funds (defined contribution schemes) 
on behalf of the employees and directors in respect of salaries and 
directors’ fees paid. Contributions are charged against income as 
they are made.
Exploration, evaluation and development expenditure 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures in relation to each 
separate area of interest are recognised as an exploration and 
evaluation asset in the year in which they are incurred where the 
following conditions are satisfied:
a) the rights to tenure of the area of interest are current; and
b) at least one of the following conditions is also met:
i) the exploration and evaluation expenditures are expected 
to be recouped through successful development and 
exploration of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale; 
or
ii) exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest 
have not at the reporting date reached a stage which permits 
a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of 
economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant 
operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are 
continuing.
Exploration and evaluation assets are initially measured at cost 
and include acquisition of rights to explore, studies, exploration 
drilling, trenching and sampling and associated activities. General 
and administrative costs are only included in the measurement of 
exploration and evaluation costs where they are related directly to 
operational activities in a particular area of interest.

Depreciation is provided on PPE. Depreciation is calculated on a 
straight‑line basis so as to write off the net cost or other revalued 
amount of each asset over its expected useful life to its estimated 
residual value.
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method 
are reviewed at the end of each annual financial period, with the 
effect of any changes recognised on a prospective basis.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation 
of depreciation:
Plant and equipment  2 – 20 years 
Office equipment   3 – 7 years 
Mining equipment   2 – 13 years 
Buildings    4 – 20 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is 
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Mine development properties 
Where mining of a mineral resource has commenced, the 
accumulated costs are transferred from exploration and evaluation 
assets to mine development properties.
Amortisation is first charged to new mine development ventures 
from the date of first commercial production. Amortisation of 
mine properties is on a unit of production basis resulting in an 
amortisation charge proportional to the depletion of the proved 
and probable ore reserves. The unit of production can be on a 
tonnes or an ounce depleted basis.
Capitalised underground development costs incurred to enable 
access to specific ore blocks or areas of the underground mine, and 
which only provide an economic benefit over the period of mining 
that ore block or area, are depreciated on a units of production 
basis, whereby the denominator is estimated ounces of gold in 
Proven and probable reserves within that ore block or area where 
it is considered probable that those resources will be extracted 
economically.
Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Costs including an appropriate portion of fixed and variable 
overhead expenses are assigned to inventory on hand by the 
method appropriate to each particular class of inventory, with 
the majority being valued on a weighted average cost basis. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less 
all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make 
the sale.
Ore stockpiles, gold in circuit and finished goods are valued 
applying absorption costing.
Interests in joint arrangements 
The group applies IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’. Under IFRS 11 
investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint 
operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights 
and obligations each investor. Joint ventures are accounted 
for using the equity method. In relation to its interests in joint 
operations, the group recognises its share of assets and liabilities; 
revenue from the sale of its share of the output; and its share of 
expenses.
SGM is wholly consolidated within the Centamin group of 
companies, reflecting the substance and economic reality of the 
Concession Agreement (see note 21).
Leased assets 
Leased assets are classified as finance leases when the terms of 
the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental 
to ownership of the leased asset to the lessee. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on 
a straight‑line basis over the lease term, except where other 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which 
economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Contingent 
rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense 
in the period in which they are incurred.
Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) 
PPE is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment. PPE will include capitalised development expenditure. 
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to 
the acquisition of the item as well as the estimated cost of 
abandonment. In the event that settlement of all or part of 
the purchase consideration is deferred, cost is determined by 
discounting the amounts payable in the future to their present 
value as at the date of acquisition. Subsequent costs are included 
in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the 
item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced 
part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged 
to the income statement during the financial period in which they 
are incurred. The cost of PPE includes the estimated restoration 
costs associated with the asset. Centamin plc  Annual report 2015

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value loss costs to sell and 
value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre‑tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of 
future flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is estimated 
to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. Where 
an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount 
of the cash generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for 
the cash generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit 
or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, 
in which case the reversal of an impairment loss is treated as a 
revaluation increase.
Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable for goods and services in the normal course of 
business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sale of goods 
Revenue from the sale of mineral production is recognised when 
the group has passed the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
of the mineral production to the buyer, it is probable that economic 
benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the group, 
the sales price can be measured reliably, and the group has no 
significant continuing involvement and the costs incurred or to be 
incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. This 
is when insurance risk has passed to the buyer and the goods have 
been collected at the agreed location.
Where the terms of the executed sales agreement allow for an 
adjustment to the sales price based on a survey of the mineral 
production by the buyer (for instance an assay for gold content), 
recognition of the revenue from the sale of mineral production 
is based on the most recently determined estimate of product 
specifications.
Pre‑production revenues 
Income derived by the entity prior to the date of commercial 
production is offset against the expenditure capitalised and carried 
in the consolidated statement of financial position. All revenues 
recognised after commencement of commercial production are 
recognised in accordance with the revenue policy stated above. 
The commencement date of commercial production is determined 
when stable and sustained production capacity has been achieved.
Production royalty 
The Arab Republic of Egypt (“ARE”) is entitled to a royalty of 3% 
of net sales revenue (revenue net of freight and refining costs) as 
defined from the sale of gold and associated minerals from the 
Sukari Gold Mine. This royalty is calculated and recognised on 
receipt of the final certificate of analysis document received from 
the refinery. Due to its nature, this royalty is not recognised in cost 
of sales but rather in other operating costs.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued

Stripping activity assets
The group defers stripping costs incurred (removal of mine waste 
materials which provide improved access to further quantities of 
material that will be mined in future periods). This waste removal 
activity is known as “stripping”. There can be two benefits accruing 
to the entity from the stripping activity:
•	 usable ore that can be used to produce inventory; and
•	 improved access to further quantities of material that will be 
mined in future periods.
The costs of stripping activity to be accounted for in accordance 
with the principles of IAS 2 ‘Inventories’ to the extent that the 
benefit from the stripping activity is realised in the form of inventory 
produced. The costs of stripping activity which provides a benefit in 
the form of improved access to ore is recognised as a non‑current 
“stripping activity asset” where the following criteria are met:
a) it is probable that the future economic benefit (improved access 
to the ore body) associated with the stripping activity will flow to 
the entity;
b) the entity can identify the component of the ore body for which 
access has been improved; and
c) the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with that 
component can be measured reliably.
When the costs of the stripping activity asset and the inventory 
produced are not separately identifiable, production stripping costs 
are allocated between the inventory produced and the stripping 
activity asset by using an allocation basis that is based on a relevant 
production measure. A stripping activity asset is accounted for 
as an addition to, or as an enhancement of, an existing asset and 
classified as tangible or intangible according to the nature of the 
existing asset of which it forms part. A stripping activity asset is 
initially measured at cost and subsequently carried at cost or its 
revalued amount less depreciation or amortisation and impairment 
losses. A stripping activity asset is depreciated or amortised on 
a systematic basis, over the expected useful life of the identified 
component of the ore body that becomes more accessible as 
a result of the stripping activity. The stripping activity asset is 
depreciated using a units of production method based on the 
total ounces to be produced over the life of the component of the 
ore body.
Deferred stripping costs are included in “stripping assets”, within 
tangible assets. These form part of the total investment in the 
relevant cash‑generating unit, which is reviewed for impairment if 
events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may not be recoverable. Amortisation of deferred stripping costs is 
included in operating costs.
Impairment of assets (other than exploration and evaluation and 
financial assets) 
At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts 
of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment 
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). For the purposes of assessing impairment, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely 
independent cash inflows (cash generating units).

Assets held for sale and discontinued operations are measured 
in accordance with that standard. If the initial accounting for a 
business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting 
period in which the combination occurs, the group reports 
provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is 
incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities 
are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, 
would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition 
to the date the group obtains complete information about facts and 
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject 
to a maximum of one year.
Investments in associates 
An associate is an entity over which the group has significant 
influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint 
control over those policies.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in 
these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, 
except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which 
case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non‑current 
assets held for sale and discontinued operations’.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried 
in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for 
post‑acquisition changes in the group’s share of the net assets 
of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual 
investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the group’s interest 
in that associate (which includes any long‑term interests that, in 
substance, form part of the group’s net investment in the associate) 
are recognised only to the extent that the group has incurred 
legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of 
the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s share of the 
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is 
recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying 
amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of 
that investment.
Any excess of the group’s share of the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost 
of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss.
Where a group entity transacts with an associate of the group, 
profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the group’s 
interest in the relevant associate.
The group determines at each reporting date whether there is any 
objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. 
If this is the case, the group calculates the amount of impairment 
as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate 
and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to share 
of profit and loss of associates in the income statement.
Dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are 
recognised in the income statement.
Other income 
Interest income 
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic 
benefits will flow to the group and the amount of income can be 
measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by 
reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest 
rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset 
to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of businesses as defined by IFRS 3 are accounted 
for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each 
acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the 
date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, 
and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control 
of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit 
or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes 
any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. 
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the 
cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period 
adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair 
value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability 
are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 either in profit or 
loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Changes in 
the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are 
not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for 
within equity.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the group’s 
previously‑held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to 
fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the group attains 
control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit 
or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the 
acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such 
treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
•	 deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to 
employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured 
in accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ and IAS 19 ‘Employee 
benefits’ respectively;
•	 liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by 
the group of an acquiree’s share‑based payment awards are 
measured in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share‑based payment’; 
and
•	 assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in 
accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non‑current assets held for sale’. Centamin plc  Annual report 2015

Taxation 
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable 
and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. 
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income because of items of income 
or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for 
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are 
generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which those deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised 
if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit 
nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the group 
is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it 
is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible 
temporary differences associated with such investments and 
interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the 
benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of 
each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all 
or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled 
or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting 
period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets 
reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner 
in which the group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to 
recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
accounting policies continued
Share‑based payments 
Equity settled share‑based payments with employees and others 
providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the 
equity instrument at grant date. Fair value is measured by the use 
of the Black‑Scholes model. Where share‑based payments are 
subject to market conditions, fair value was measured by the use of 
a Monte‑Carlo simulation. The fair value determined at the grant 
date of the equity settled share‑based payments is expensed over 
the vesting period, based on the consolidated entity’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest.
Equity settled share‑based transactions with other parties are 
measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, 
except where the fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which 
case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments 
granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the 
counterparty renders the service. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of the options is 
recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is 
determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
•	 including any market performance conditions (for example, 
an entity’s share price);
•	 excluding the impact of any service and non‑market 
performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability and 
remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time 
period); and
•	 including the impact of any non‑vesting conditions (for example, 
the requirement for employees to save or holding shares for a 
specific period of time).
When the options are exercised, the Company issues new 
shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and 
share premium.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on 
management’s best estimate, for the effects of non‑transferability, 
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. Further details 
on how the fair value of equity settled share‑based transactions has 
been determined can be found in note 27. At each reporting date, 
the group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original 
estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining 
vesting period, with corresponding adjustment to the equity settled 
employee benefits reserve.
Issued capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company or other members of the consolidated group 
purchases the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration 
paid is deducted from the total shareholders’ equity of the group 
and/or of the Company as treasury shares until they are cancelled. 
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any 
consideration received is included in shareholders’ equity of the 
group and/or the Company.

Litigation
The group exercises judgment in measuring and recognising 
provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related to 
pending litigation, as well as other contingent liabilities (see note 20 
to the financial statements). Judgment is necessary in assessing the 
likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, 
and to quantify the possible range of the financial settlement.
The group is currently a party to two legal actions both of which 
could affect its ability to operate the mine at Sukari in the manner 
in which it is currently operated and adversely affect its profitability. 
The details of this litigation, which relate to the loss of the Egyptian 
national subsidy for diesel fuel oil and the ability of the group to 
operate outside the area of 3km
2
 determined by the Administrative 
Court of first instance to be the area of the Sukari exploitation lease, 
are given in note 20 to the financial statements and in the most 
recently filed Annual Information Form (“AIF”) which is available 
on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. Although it is possible to quantify 
the effects of the loss the national fuel subsidy, it is not currently 
possible to quantify with sufficient precision the effect of restricting 
operations to an area of 3km
2
.
Every action is being taken to contest these decisions, including 
the making of formal legal appeals and, although their resolution 
may still take some time, management remain confident that a 
satisfactory outcome will ultimately be achieved. In the meantime, 
however, the group is continuing to pay international prices for 
diesel fuel oil. With respect to the Administrative Court ruling, 
on 20 March 2013 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the 
Company’s application to suspend this decision until the merits of 
the Company’s appeal are considered and ruled on, thus providing 
assurance that normal operations will be able to continue during 
this process.
In the unlikely event that the group is unsuccessful in either or both 
of its legal actions, and that the operating activities are restricted to 
a reduced area, it is management’s belief that the group will be able 
to continue as going concern. 
Recovery of capitalised exploration evaluation and 
development expenditure 
The group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation 
expenditure results in exploration and evaluation expenditure being 
capitalised for those projects where such expenditure is considered 
likely to be recoverable through future extraction activity or sale 
or where the exploration activities have not reached a stage which 
permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves.
This policy requires management to make certain estimates and 
assumptions as to future events and circumstances, in particular 
whether the group will proceed with development based on 
existence of reserves or whether an economically viable extraction 
operation can be established. Such estimates and assumptions 
may change from period to period as new information becomes 
available. If, subsequent to the exploration and evaluation 
expenditure being capitalised, a judgment is made that recovery 
of the expenditure is unlikely or the project is to be abandoned, 
the relevant capitalised amount will be written off to the 
income statement.
Restoration and rehabilitation
A provision for restoration and rehabilitation is recognised when 
there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
exploration, development and production activities undertaken, 
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation, and the amount of the provision can be 
measured reliably. The estimated future obligations include the 
costs of dismantling and removal of facilities, restoration and 
monitoring of the affected areas. The provision for future restoration 
costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure 
required to settle the restoration obligation at the reporting date. 
Future restoration costs are reviewed annually and any changes in 
the estimate are reflected in the present value of the restoration 
provision at each reporting date.
The initial estimate of the restoration and rehabilitation provision 
relating to exploration, development and mining production 
activities is capitalised into the cost of the related asset and 
amortised on the same basis as the related asset, unless the present 
obligation arises from the production of the inventory in the period, 
in which case the amount is included in the cost of production for 
the period. Changes in the estimate of the provision of restoration 
and rehabilitation are treated in the same manner, except that 
the unwinding of the effect of discounting on the provision is 
recognised as a finance cost within other operating costs rather 
than being capitalised into the cost of the related asset.
4. Critical accounting judgments 
critical judgments in applying the entity’s accounting policies 
The following are the critical judgments that management has 
made in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies 
and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in the financial statements:
Management has discussed its critical accounting judgments 
and associated disclosures with the Company’s audit and risk 
committee.
Impairment of assets (other than exploration and evaluation and 
financial assets) 
IFRS requires management to test for impairment if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of 
a finite lived asset may not be recoverable. Management has 
concluded that there is no indication that an impairment exists, 
nor have any indicators arisen after the reporting period and are 
therefore not required to perform a full impairment review under 
IAS 36.
In making its assessment as to the possibility of whether 
impairments losses having arisen, management considered the 
following indications:
•	 internal sources of information;
•	 external sources of information; 
•	 litigation;
•	 the key assumptions applied in the 31 December 2015 
impairment review;
•	 forecast gold prices;
•	 discount rate;
•	 production volumes;
•	 reserves and resources report; and
•	 costs and recovery rates. Centamin plc  Annual report 2015
Financial statements

Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, 
and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting 
date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year:
Provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs 
The group is required to decommission, rehabilitate and restore 
mines and processing sites at the end of their producing lives to 
a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities. The provision 
has been calculated taking into account the estimated future 
obligations including the costs of dismantling and removal of 
facilities, restoration and monitoring of the affected areas. The 
provision for future restoration costs is the best estimate of the 
present value of the expenditure required to settle the restoration 
obligation at the reporting date.
Ore reserve estimates 
Estimates of recoverable quantities of reserves include assumptions 
on commodity prices, exchange rates, discount rates and 
production costs for future cash flows. It also involves assessment 
and judgment of complex geological models. The economic, 
geological and technical factors used to estimate ore reserves may 
change from period to period. Changes in ore reserves affect the 
carrying values of mine properties, property, plant and equipment, 
provision for rehabilitation assets and deferred taxes. Ore reserves 
are integral to the amount of depreciation and amortisation 
charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
and the calculation in the valuation of inventory.
Production forecasts from the underground mine at Sukari are partly 
based on estimates regarding future resource and reserve growth. 
It should be specifically noted that the potential quantity and grade 
from the Sukari underground mine is conceptual in nature, that 
there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource 
and that it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target 
being delineated as a mineral resource.
Depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs 
Depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs 
at the Sukari mine is based on reserve estimates. Management 
and directors believe that these estimates are both realistic and 
conservative, based on current information. 
4. Critical accounting judgments continued
Recovery of capitalised exploration evaluation and 
development expenditure continued
As described in note 13 to the financial statements, in 
February 2015, the Company gave formal notice to Alecto Minerals 
plc (”Alecto”) terminating the joint venture agreement entered into 
between the Company and Alecto in September 2013 with regards 
to the development of Alecto’s licences in Ethiopia. 
Centamin’s rights in the Wayuboda and Aysid Metekel licences 
have reverted back to Alecto, such that Alecto will hold 100% 
of the licences and will assume responsibility for the ongoing 
commitments in respect of the licences on termination of the 
joint venture and have thus written off all expenditure incurred to 
date, including the acquisition costs in relation to those licences, 
amounting to US$2.7 million of which US$2.3 million was written 
off in 2014.
Exploration activities were ceased in Ethiopia in late 2015 with 
closure of all remaining projects and the subsequent wind up of the 
Sheba Exploration entities is in progress. The decision was taken 
after a review of the potential of the Una Deriem prospect after 
completing the testing the eastern soil anomaly, which runs parallel 
to the main soil anomaly and mineralised zone. The cessation 
of activity in Ethiopia resulted in impairment of exploration and 
evaluation assets of US$5.9 million in 2015.
Going concern 
Under guidelines set out by the UK Financial Reporting Council 
(“FRC”) the directors of UK listed companies are required to 
consider whether the going concern basis is the appropriate basis 
of preparation of financial statements.
Based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by management, 
in which it included any reasonably possible change in the key 
assumptions on which cash flow forecast is based, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the group will have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Key assumptions underpinning this forecast include:
•	 litigation as discussed in note 20 to the financial statements;
•	 forecast gold price;
•	 production volumes; and
•	 costs and recovery rates.
These financial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2015 have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis, 
which contemplate the realisation of assets and liquidation of 
liabilities during the normal course of operations, in preparing the 
financial statements.
Accounting treatment of Sukari Gold Mines (“SGM”) 
SGM is consolidated within the Centamin group of companies, 
reflecting the substance and economic reality of the Concession 
Agreement (see note 21 to the financial statements).

exceptional items
The directors consider that items of income or expense which are material by virtue of their unusual, irregular or non‑recurring nature 
should be disclosed separately if the consolidated financial statements are to fairly present the financial position and underlying business 
performance. In order to allow a better understanding of the financial information presented within the consolidated financial statements, 
and specifically the group’s underlying business performance, the effect of exceptional items are shown below.

In January 2012 the Company received a letter from Chevron to the effect that Chevron would not be able to continue supplying Diesel 
Fuel Oil (“DFO”) to the mine at Sukari at local subsidised prices. It is understood that the reason that this letter was issued was that 
Chevron had received a letter instructing it to do so from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”). It is understood that 
EGPC itself took the decision to issue this instruction because it had received legal advice from the Legal Advice Department of the 
Council of State (an internal government advisory department) that the companies operating in the gold mining sector in Egypt were not 
entitled to such subsidies. In addition, during 2012, the Company received a demand from Chevron for the repayment of fuel subsidies 
received in the period from late 2009 through to January 2012, amounting to some US$51 million (EGP403 million).
The group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter (and, in particular, on the opinion given by Legal Advice Department of the 
Council of State) and in consequence in June 2012 lodged an appeal against EGPC’s decision in the Administrative Courts. Again, the 
group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is every prospect of success. However, as a practical matter, and in 
order to ensure the continuation of supply, the group has since January 2012 advanced funds to its fuel supplier, Chevron, based on the 
international price for diesel.
As at the date of the financial statements, no final decision had been taken by the courts regarding this matter.
Furthermore, the group remains of the view that an instant move to international fuel prices is not a reasonable outcome and will look to 
recover funds advanced thus far should the court proceeding be concluded in its favour. However, management recognises the practical 
difficulties associated with reclaiming funds from the government and for this reason has, fully provided against the prepayment of 
US$208.2 million to 31 December 2015, as an exceptional item, of which US$42.5 million was provided for during 2015 as follows:
a) a US$43.8 million increase in mine production costs (2014: US$62.5 million increase);
b) a US$1.3 million decrease in stores inventories (2014: US$0.2 million increase);
c) a US$2.9 million decrease in mining stockpiles, gold in circuit and finished goods (2014: US$1.0 million decrease).
This has resulted in a net charge of US$46.7 million in the profit and loss.

The group operates in several countries and, accordingly, it is subject to, the various tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. From 
time to time the group is subject to a review of its related tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing 
authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the group’s business conducted within the country involved. If the group 
is unable to resolve any of these matters favourably, there may be an adverse impact on the group’s financial performance, cash flows or 
results of operations. In the event that management’s estimate of the future resolution of these matters changes, the group will recognise 
the effects of the changes in its consolidated financial statements in the period that such changes occur. 
In Australia, Centamin Egypt Limited and Pharaoh Gold Mines NL have elected to form a tax‑consolidated group and therefore are treated 
as a single entity for Australian income tax purposes. Pharaoh Gold Mines NL benefits from the “Branch Profits Exemption” whereby 
foreign branch income will generally not be subject to Australian income tax.
Australian tax rules govern the taxation of financial arrangements (“TOFA”) and the realisation of foreign exchange gains/losses. 
The TOFA rules provide that a foreign exchange gain or loss will arise in relation to foreign currency bank accounts to the extent funds 
have been withdrawn from these accounts during the period. This foreign exchange gain or loss is calculated by comparing the A$ spot 
rate at the date of deposit to the A$ spot rate at the date of withdrawal on a first‑in‑first‑out (“FIFO”) basis (i.e. the first amounts deposited 
are the first amounts to be withdrawn). 
The group made foreign exchange gains for Australian income tax purposes during the year which were assessable when they were 
realised (i.e. when US$ cash balances were withdrawn from Australian bank accounts). Australian income tax rules (contained within 
subdivision 960‑D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997) require that where an amount is not in the taxpayer’s ‘applicable functional 
currency’, the amount is to be converted into the ‘applicable functional currency’ i.e. Australian dollars. Accordingly, the withdrawal of 
US$ bank deposits gave rise to foreign exchange gains for Australian income tax purposes, which were assessable when realised.
In Egypt, Centamin has entered into a concession agreement that provides that the income generated by Sukari Gold Mining Company’s 
activities is granted a long‑term tax exemption from all taxes imposed in Egypt.
The tax expense for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as follows:
       31 December 31 December  
       2015 2014  
       US$’000 US$’000

tax consolidation
Relevance of tax consolidation to the consolidated entity 
Companies within the group’s wholly owned Australian resident entities formed a tax‑consolidated group with effect from 1 July 2003. 
The head entity within the tax‑consolidated group is Centamin Egypt Limited. The members of the tax‑consolidated group are 
Pharaoh Gold Mines NL, Viking Resources NL and North African Resources NL. Centamin plc  Annual report 2015

7. Tax continued
tax consolidation continued
Nature of tax funding arrangements and tax sharing agreements 
Entities within the tax‑consolidated group have entered into a tax funding arrangement and a tax‑sharing agreement with the head 
entity. Under the terms of the tax‑funding agreement, Centamin Egypt Limited and each of the entities in the tax‑consolidated group has 
agreed to pay a tax‑equivalent payment to or from the head entity, based on the current tax liability or current tax asset of the entity. Such 
amounts are reflected in amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the tax‑consolidated group. 
The tax‑sharing agreement entered into between members of the tax‑consolidated group provides for the determination of the allocation 
of income tax liabilities between the entities should the head entity default on its tax payment obligations. No amounts have been 
recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any amounts under the tax‑sharing agreement is 
considered remote.
8. Segment reporting 
The group is engaged in the business of exploration and mining of precious metals only, which represents a single operating segment. The 
board is the group’s chief operating decision maker within the meaning of IFRS 8.

Other receivables        3,312 916 
       23,784 24,973 
Trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost.
The average age of the receivables is 14 days (2014: 21 days). No interest is charged on the receivables. There are no trade receivables 
past due and impaired at the reporting date, and thus no allowance for doubtful debts has been recognised. Of the trade receivables 
balance, the gold sales debtor is all receivable from Johnson Matthey of Canada. The amount due has been received in full subsequent 
to year end.
Other receivables represent GST and VAT amounts owing from the various jurisdictions that the group operates in inventory returns to 
vendors where refunds are expected to occur.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately equal to their fair value.

In 2013 as a result of the significant decline in the gold price, the group carried out a review of the recoverable amount of the property, 
plant and equipment. The review did not lead to a recognition of an impairment loss. The discount rate used in measuring value in use was 
12% per annum and the assumed average gold price was US$1,342 per ounce. No impairment review was performed in 2014 or 2015 as 
no indicators of impairment were identified.

The exploration and evaluation asset relates to the drilling, geological exploration and sampling of potential ore reserves. 
In February 2015, the Company gave formal notice to Alecto Minerals plc (”Alecto”) terminating the joint venture agreement entered 
into between the Company and Centamin in September 2013 with regards to the development of Alecto’s licences in Ethiopia.
Centamin’s rights in the Wayuboda and Aysid Metekel licences have reverted back to Alecto, such that Alecto will hold 100% of the 
licences and will assume responsibility for the ongoing commitments in respect of the licences on termination of the joint venture and have 
thus written off all expenditure incurred to date, including the acquisition costs in relation to those licences, amounting to US$2.7 million 
of which US$2.3 million was written off in 2014.
Exploration activities were ceased in Ethiopia in late 2015 with closure of all remaining projects and the subsequent wind up of the Sheba 
Exploration entities is in progress. The decision was taken after a review of the potential of the Una Deriem prospect after completing the 
testing the eastern soil anomaly, which runs parallel to the main soil anomaly and mineralised zone. The cessation of activity in Ethiopia 
resulted in impairment of exploration and evaluation assets of US$5.9 million in 2015. Exploration in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire 
continues to progress.

Trade payables principally comprise the amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The average credit period taken for 
trade purchases is 22 days (2014: 16 days). Trade payables are interest free for periods ranging from 30 to 180 days. Thereafter interest 
is charged at commercial rates. The group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the 
credit timeframe.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximate their fair value. Centamin plc  Annual report 2015

that will be required to remove the facilities and restore the affected areas at the group’s sites discounted by 8.17% (2014: 12.00%). This restoration and 
rehabilitation estimate, which is reviewed on annual basis, has been made on the basis of benchmark assessments of restoration works required following 
mine closure and after taking into account the projected area to be disturbed over the life of the mine, being 20 years. The annual review undertaken as 
at 31 December 2015 has resulted in the US$3.8 million increase in the provision.

Fuel supply
In January 2012, the group received a letter from Chevron to the effect that Chevron would only be able to supply Diesel Fuel Oil (“DFO”) 
to the mine at Sukari at international prices rather than at local subsidised prices. It is understood that the reason that this letter was 
issued was that Chevron had received a letter instructing it to do so from the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (“EGPC”). It is 
further understood that EGPC itself issued this instruction because it had received legal advice from the Legal Advice Department of the 
Council of State (an internal government advisory department) that the companies operating in the gold mining sector in Egypt were not 
entitled to such subsidies. In November 2012, the group received a further demand from Chevron for the repayment of fuel subsidies 
received during the period from late 2009 through to January 2012, amounting to EGP403 million (approximately US$51 million at current 
exchange rates).
The group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter (and, in particular, on the opinion given by the Legal Advice Department of the 
Council of State) and in June 2012 lodged an appeal against EGPC’s decision in the Administrative Courts. Again, the group believes that 
its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is a good prospect of success. However, as a practical matter, and in order to ensure the 
continuation of supply whilst the matter is resolved, the group has since January 2012 advanced funds to its fuel supplier, Chevron, based 
on the international price for fuel.
As at the date of this document, no decision had been taken by the courts regarding this matter. The group remains of the view that an 
instant move to international fuel prices is not a reasonable outcome and will look to recover funds advanced thus far should the court 
proceeding be successfully concluded. However, management recognises the practical difficulties associated with reclaiming funds 
from the government and for this reason has fully provided against the prepayment of US$208.0 million, as an exceptional item. Refer 
to note 6 of the accompanying financial statements for further details on the impact of this exceptional provision on the group’s results 
for 2015. 
No provision has been made in respect of the historic subsidies prior to January 2012 as, based on legal advice, the Company believes 
that the prospects of a court finding in its favour in relation to this matter remain very strong. Centamin plc  Annual report 2015

Concession Agreement court case 
On 30 October 2012, the Administrative Court in Egypt handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by, amongst others, an 
independent member of a previous parliament, in which he argued for the nullification of the agreement that confers on the group rights 
to operate in Egypt. This agreement, the Concession Agreement, was entered into between the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Egyptian 
Mineral Resources Authority (“EMRA”) and Centamin’s wholly owned subsidiary Pharaoh Gold Mines (“PGM”), and was approved by the 
People’s Assembly as Law 222 of 1994.
In summary that judgment states that, although the Concession Agreement itself remains valid and in force, insufficient evidence had 
been submitted to court in order to demonstrate that the 160km
2
 “exploitation lease” between PGM and EMRA had received approval 
from the relevant minister as required by the terms of the Concession Agreement. Accordingly, the court found that the exploitation lease 
in respect of the area of 160km
2
 was not valid although it stated that there was in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km
2
. 
Centamin, however, is in possession of the executed original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 160km
2
 exploitation lease 
was approved by the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources. It appears that an executed original document was not supplied to 
the court.
Upon notification of the judgment the group took various steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the mine at Sukari. These 
included lodging a formal appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 November 2012. In addition, in conjunction with the 
formal appeal the group applied to the Supreme Administrative Court to suspend the initial decision until such time as the court was able 
to consider and rule on the merits of the appeal. On 20 March 2013 the court upheld this application thus suspending the initial decision 
and providing assurance that normal operations would be able to continue whilst the appeal process is underway.
EMRA has lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter which is supportive of the Company’s position in this matter. 
Furthermore, in late December 2012, the Minister of Petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and shortly thereafter publicly indicated that, 
in his view, the terms of the Concession Agreement were fair and that the “exploitation” lease was valid. The Minister of Petroleum also 
expressed support for the investment and expertise that Centamin brings to the country. The Company believes this demonstrates the 
government’s commitment to its investment at Sukari and the desire to stimulate further investment in the Egyptian mining industry.
The Company has taken extensive legal advice on the merits of its appeal from a number of leading Egyptian law firms who have 
confirmed that the proper steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km² lease. In addition, the Company has been advised 
that it should benefit from Law no. 32 of 2014, which came into force in April 2014 and which restricts the capacity for third parties to 
challenge any contractual agreement between the Egyptian government and an investor. This law, whilst in force and ratified by the new 
parliament, is currently under review by the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt. It therefore remains of the view that the appeal is 
based on strong legal grounds and will ultimately be successful. 
In the event that the appellate court fails to be persuaded of the merits of the case put forward by the group, the operations at Sukari 
may be adversely effected to the extent that the group’s operation exceeds the exploitation lease area of 3km
2
 referred to in the original 
court decision. 
The Company remains confident that normal operations at Sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal process is underway. Centamin does 
not currently see the need to take the matter to a court outside of Egypt as Centamin remains of the belief that the Egyptian Court will rule 
in Centamin’s favour.

Through its wholly owned subsidiary, PGM, the Company entered into the Concession Agreement with EMRA and the Arab Republic of 
Egypt granting PGM and EMRA the right to explore, develop, mine and sell gold and associated minerals in specific concession areas 
located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. The Concession Agreement came into effect under Egyptian law on 13 June 1995.
In 2005 PGM, together with EMRA, were granted an exploitation lease over 160km
2
 surrounding the Sukari Project site. The exploitation 
lease was signed by PGM, EMRA and the Egyptian Minister of Petroleum and gives tenure for a period of 30 years, commencing 
24 May 2005 and extendable by PGM for an additional 30 years upon PGM providing reasonable commercial justification.
In 2006 SGM was incorporated under the laws of Egypt. SGM was formed to conduct exploration, development, exploitation and 
marketing operations in accordance with the Concession Agreement. Responsibility for the day‑to‑day management of the project rests 
with the general manager, who is appointed by PGM.
The fiscal terms of the Concession Agreement require that PGM solely funds SGM. PGM is however entitled to recover from sales revenue 
recoverable costs, as defined in the Concession Agreement. EMRA is entitled to a share of SGM’s net production surplus or profit share 
(defined as revenue less payment of the fixed royalty to ARE and recoverable costs). As at 31 December 2015, PGM has not recovered 
its cost and accordingly, no EMRA entitlement has been recognised to date. It is anticipated that the first payment to EMRA will become 
payable during 2017. Any payment made to EMRA pursuant to these provisions of the Concession Agreement will be recognised as a 
variable charge in the income statement. Centamin plc  Annual report 2015

21. Subsidiaries continued
The Concession Agreement grants certain tax exemptions, including the following:
•	 from 1 April 2010, being the date of commercial production, the Sukari Project is entitled to a 15‑year exemption from any taxes 
imposed by the Egyptian government on the revenues generated from the Sukari Project. PGM and EMRA intend that SGM will in due 
course file an application to extend the tax free period for a further 15 years. The extension of the tax free period requires that there has 
been no tax problems or disputes in the initial period and that certain activities in new remote areas have been planned and agreed by 
all parties;
•	 PGM and SGM are exempt from custom taxes and duties with respect to the importation of machinery, equipment and consumable 
items required for the purpose of exploration and mining activities at the Sukari Gold Mine. The exemption shall only apply if there is 
no local substitution with the same or similar quality to the imported machinery, equipment or consumables. Such exemption will also 
be granted if the local substitution is more than 10% more expensive than the imported machinery, equipment or consumables after 
the additional of the insurance and transportation costs;
•	 PGM, EMRA and SGM and their respective buyers will be exempt from any duties or taxes on the export of gold and associated 
minerals produced from the Sukari Gold Mine;
•	 PGM at all times is free to transfer in US$ or other freely convertible foreign currency any cash of PGM representing its share of net 
proceeds and recovery of costs, without any Egyptian government limitation, tax or duty;
•	 PGM’s contractors and sub‑contractors are entitled to import machinery. Equipment and consumable items under the “Temporary 
Release System” which provided exemption from Egyptian customs duty; and
•	 legal title of all operating assets of PGM will pass to EMRA when cost recovery is completed. The right of use of all fixed and movable 
assets remains with PGM and SGM.

independence could be compromised. These safeguards include the implementation of a policy on the use of the external auditor for 
non‑audit related services.
Where it is deemed that the work to be undertaken is of a nature that is generally considered reasonable to be completed by the auditor 
of the Company for sound commercial and practical reasons, the conduct of such work will be permissible provided that it has been 
pre‑approved. All these services are also subject to a predefined fee limit. Any work performed in excess of this limit must be approved by 
the audit and risk committee.

26. Financial instruments 
(a) Group risk management
The group manages its capital to ensure that entities within the group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the cash and equity balance. The group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from the 
previous financial period.
The group has no debt and thus not geared at year end or in the prior year. The capital structure consists of cash and cash equivalents 
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital and reserves as disclosed in notes 17 and 18. The 
group operates in Australia, Jersey, Egypt, Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire. None of the group’s entities are subject to externally imposed 
capital requirements.
The group utilises inflows of funds toward the ongoing exploration and development of the Sukari Gold Mine in Egypt, and the 
exploration projects in Burkina Faso and Côte d’Ivoire.

(b) Financial risk management and objectives
The group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential risk 
adverse effects and ensure that net cash flows are sufficient to support the delivery of the group’s financial targets whilst protecting future 
financial security. The group continually monitors and tests its forecast financial position against these objectives.
The group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market; commodity; credit; liquidity; foreign exchange; and interest rate. These 
risks are managed under board approved directives through the audit committee. The group’s principal financial instruments comprise 
interest bearing cash and cash equivalents. Other financial instruments include trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly 
from operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, group policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments be undertaken.
(c) market risk
The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect 
to the Australian dollar, Great British pound and Egyptian pound. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and 
recognised assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. The risk is measured by 
regularly monitoring, forecasting and performing sensitivity analyses on the group’s financial position.
Financial instruments denominated in Great British pound, Australian dollar and Egyptian pound are as follows:

The following table summarises the sensitivity of financial instruments held at the reporting date to movements in the exchange rate of the 
Great British and Egyptian pounds and Australian dollar to the United States dollar, with all other variables held constant. The sensitivities 
are based on reasonably possible changes over a financial period, using the observed range of actual historical rates.

US$/E£ decrease by 10%     (726) (463) — —
The group’s sensitivity to foreign currency has decreased at the end of the current period mainly due to the decrease in foreign currency 
cash holdings in Australian dollars and a corresponding increase in US dollar cash holdings.
The group has not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts. Natural hedges are utilised wherever possible to offset foreign 
currency liabilities. The Company maintains a policy of not hedging its currency positions and maintains currency holdings in line with 
underlying requirements and commitments.
(d) commodity price risk
The group’s future revenue forecasts are exposed to commodity price fluctuations, in particular gold prices. The group has not entered into 
forward gold hedging contracts. 
(e) interest rate risk
The group’s main interest rate risk arises from cash and short‑term deposits and is not considered to be a material risk due to the 
short‑term nature of these financial instruments. Cash deposits are placed on term period of no more than 30 days at a time.
The financial instruments exposed to interest rate risk and the group’s exposure to interest rate risk as at balance date were as follows:

(f) liquidity risk 
The group’s liquidity position is managed to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet its financial commitments in a timely and cost 
effective manner.
Ultimate responsibility or liquidity risk management rests with the board of directors, who has established an appropriate management 
framework for the management of the group’s funding requirements. The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash 
reserves and management monitors rolling forecasts of the group’s liquidity on the basis of expected cash flow. The tables above reflect a 
balanced view of cash inflows and outflows and shows the implied risk based on those values. Trade payables and other financial liabilities 
originate from the financing of assets used in the group’s ongoing operations. These assets are considered in the group’s overall liquidity 
risk. Management continually reviews the group liquidity position including cash flow forecasts to determine the forecast liquidity position 
and maintain appropriate liquidity levels.

(g) credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the group. 
The group has adopted a policy of only dealing with credit‑worthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral or other security 
where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The group measures credit risk on a fair value basis. 
The group’s credit risk is concentrated on one entity, but the group has good credit checks on customers and none of the trade receivables 
from the customer has been past due. Also, the cash balances held in Australian dollars which are held with a financial institution with a 
high credit rating.
The gross carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the group’s maximum exposure to credit risk 
without taking account of the value of collateral or other security obtained. Centamin plc  Annual report 2015

(h) Fair value
The carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the financial statements represents their respective fair values, 
principally as a consequence of the short term maturity thereof.
(i) Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped 
into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
•	 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•	 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
•	 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

27. Share‑based payments 
Restricted share plan 
The Company’s new restricted share plan, as approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2015, allows the Company the right to grant awards 
(as defined below) to employees of the group. Awards may take the form of either conditional share awards, where shares are transferred 
conditionally upon the satisfaction of performance conditions; or share options, which may take the form of nil cost options or have a 
nominal exercise price, the exercise of which is again subject to satisfaction of applicable performance conditions. 
To date the Company has granted 5,145,000 conditional awards to employees of the group.
A detailed summary of the scheme rules is set out in the 2015 AGM proxy materials which are available at www.centamin.com. 
In summary, awards will vest following the passing of three years from the date of the award and vesting will be subject to satisfaction 
of performance conditions. For the purpose of the performance conditions, the award will be divided into up to three tranches to be 
assessed against separate performance conditions measured over a three year period. Although the precise performance conditions may 
vary between awards, the performance conditions adopted at the date of the plan which apply to the first grant are as follows:
•	 20% of the award shall be assessed by reference to a target total shareholder return (“TSR”).
•	 50% of the award shall be assessed by reference to absolute growth in earnings per share (“EPS”).
•	 30% of the award shall be assessed by reference to compound growth in gold production.
The above measures are assessed by reference to current market practice and the remuneration committee will have regard to market 
practice when establishing the precise performance conditions for future awards.
Where the performance conditions have been met, in the case of conditional awards, 50% of the total shares under the award will be 
issued or transferred to the award holders on or as soon as possible following the specified vesting date, with the remaining 50% being 
issued or transferred on the second anniversary of the vesting date.

Expected volatility (%)        0 – 72.33
Expected dividend yield (%)         1.97
(1) The vesting of 20% the awards granted under this plan are dependent on a TSR performance condition. As relative TSR is defined as a market condition 
under IFRS 2 ‘Share‑based payment’, this requires that the valuation model used takes into account the anticipated performance outcome. We have 
therefore applied a Monte‑Carlo simulation model. The simulation model takes into account the probability of performance based on the expected 
volatility of Centamin and the peer group companies and the expected correlation of returns between the companies in the comparator group.
The remaining 80% of the awards are subject to EPS and gold production performance conditions. As these are classified as non‑market 
conditions under IFRS 2 they do not need to be taken into account when determining the fair value. These grants have been valued using 
a Black‑Scholes model.
The fair value calculated was then converted at the closing £:US$ foreign exchange rate on that day.
The awards due to be granted in April 2016 will vest following the passing of three years. Vesting will be subject to the satisfaction of the 
performance conditions (and the two year holding period for 50% of the award) which will be divided into four tranches, as set out on 
pages 96 and 97 of the directors’ remuneration report.
The above measures are assessed by reference to current market practice and the remuneration committee will have regard to current 
market practice when establishing the precise performance conditions for awards.
Deferred bonus share plan (“DBsP”)
In 2012, the Company implemented the DBSP which is a long term share incentive arrangement for senior management (but not executive 
directors) and other employees (participants).
On 4 June 2013, the group offered to both the beneficiaries of the shares awarded under the ELFSP and to the majority of the 
beneficiaries of the options granted under the EOS the choice to replace their awards and options with awards under the DBSP . The 
group has accounted for this change as modifications to the share‑based payment plans and will be recognising the incremental fair value 
granted, measured in accordance with IFRS 2, by this replacement over the vesting period of the new DBSP awards.
Under this offer, each participant has been granted a number of awards under the DBSP equivalent to the number of shares or options 
held under the ELFSP and EOS respectively. Such DBSP awards shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the DBSP and shall 
ordinarily vest in three equal tranches on the anniversary of the grant date, conditional upon the continued employment with the group. 
All offers made to participants were accepted. The award of the deferred shares will not have any performance criteria attached. They will 
however be subject to a service period.
Historic plans
The historic plans, namely the executive directors loan funded share plan (“EDLFSP”) and employee loan funded share plan 
(“ELFSP”) 2011 Employee Option Scheme (“EOS”) are no longer in use and all shares awarded have either being forfeited, lapsed or 
transferred to other schemes. The residual accrual in relation to these schemes has been expensed to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. Centamin plc  Annual report 2015

indicated resource 
As defined in the JORC Code, is that part of a mineral resource which has been sampled by drill holes, underground openings or other 
sampling procedures at locations that are too widely spaced to ensure continuity but close enough to give a reasonable indication of continuity 
and where geoscientific data is known with a reasonable degree of reliability. An indicated mineral resource will be based on more data and 
therefore will be more reliable than an inferred resource estimate
inferred resource 
As defined in the JORC Code, is that part of a mineral resource for which the tonnage and grade and mineral content can be estimated with 
a low level of confidence. It is inferred from the geological evidence and has assumed but not verified geological and/or grade continuity. It 
is based on information gathered through the appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes 
which may be limited or of uncertain quality and reliability

ore reserve 
The economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which 
may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments, which may include feasibility studies, have been carried out, and include 
consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and 
governmental factors. These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could be reasonably justified. Ore reserves are

forward-lookinG statements
This report contains certain forward‑looking statements. 
These statements are made by the directors in good faith 
based on the information available to them up to the time of 
their approval of this report and such statements should be 
treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties, including 
both economic and business risk factors, underlying any such 
forward looking information.
Cautionary note regarding forward looking statements
This document contains “forward‑looking information” which may 
include, but is not limited to, statements with respect to the future 
financial or operating performance of Centamin plc (‘Centamin’ or ‘the 
Company’), its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’), affiliated companies, 
its projects, the future price of gold, the estimation of mineral reserves 
and mineral resources, the realisation of mineral reserve and resource 
estimates, the timing and amount of estimated future production, 
revenues, margins, costs of production, estimates of initial capital, 
sustaining capital, operating and exploration expenditures, costs and 
timing of the development of new deposits, costs and timing of future 
exploration, requirements for additional capital, foreign exchange 
risks, governmental regulation of mining operations and exploration 
operations, timing and receipt of approvals, consents and permits 
under applicable mineral legislation, environmental risks, title disputes 
or claims, limitations of insurance coverage and regulatory matters. 
Often, but not always, forward‑looking statements can be identified by 
the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”, “budget”, 
“scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “targets”, “aims”, 
“anticipates” or “believes” or variations (including negative variations) 
of such words and phrases, or may be identified by statements to the 
effect that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, 
“should”, “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
Forward‑looking statements involve known and unknown risks, 
uncertainties and a variety of material factors, many of which are beyond 
the Company’s control which may cause the actual results, performance 
or achievements of Centamin, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies 
to be materially different from any future results, performance or 
achievements expressed or implied by the forward‑looking statements. 
Readers are cautioned that forward‑looking statements may not be 
appropriate for other purposes than outlined in this document. Such 
factors include, among others, future price of gold; general business, 
economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties; the actual 
results of current exploration and development activities; conclusions 
of economic evaluations and studies; fluctuations in the value of 
the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies in the jurisdictions of 
the Company’s key projects; changes in project parameters as plans 
continue to be refined; possible variations of ore grade or projected 
recovery rates; accidents, labour disputes or slow‑downs and other 
risks of the mining industry; climatic conditions; political instability, 
insurrection or war, civil unrest or armed assault; labour force availability 
and turnover; delays in obtaining financing or governmental approvals 
or in the completion of exploration and development activities; as 
well as those factors referred to in the section entitled “Principal risks 
affecting the Centamin Group” section of the Management Discussion 
& Analysis. The reader is also cautioned that the foregoing list of factors 
is not exhausted of the factors that may affect the Company’s forward‑ looking statements.
Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors 
that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially 
from those described in forward‑looking statements, there may be 
other factors that cause actions, events or results to differ from those 
anticipated, estimated or intended. Forward‑looking statements 
contained herein are made as of the date of this document and, except 
as required by applicable law, the Company disclaims any obligation 
to update any forward‑looking statements, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or results or otherwise. There can be no 
assurance that forward‑looking statements will prove to be accurate, 
as actual results and future events could differ materially from those 
anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place 
undue reliance on forward‑looking statements.
Please refer to the technical report entitled “Mineral Resource and 
Reserve Estimate for the Sukari Gold Project, Egypt” effective on 
30 June 2015 and issued on 23 October 2015 and filed on SEDAR

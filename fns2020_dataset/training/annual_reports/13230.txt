provider
Regus’ network of over 2,200 locations, currently 
serves more than two million customers, across 
some 100 countries; providing convenient, 
high-quality places to work, for any period of 
time. We are the only workplace provider with 
significant and growing national networks, which, 
when taken as a connected whole, results in a 
geographic scale that is unmatched. Crucially, as 
our national networks and global footprint 
develop, so does the Group’s competitive 
advantage over other providers.
Our network provides the ideal work platform for 
businesses set free by mobile technology. We 
put companies in control of how and where they 
work, helping them to be more focused and 
productive, and making sure that they only pay 
for the space they need, when they need it. In 
today’s world of outsourcing and a willingness 
to share resources, it is not surprising that we 
are experiencing strong and growing demand for 
our products and services.
Driven by a structural 
market shift
As we outline in more detail on pages 4-5, the 
way in which people work continues to change 
rapidly, driven by a wide variety of factors 
including technology, globalisation and 
workforce dynamics. At the same time there is a 
growing recognition from large organisations 
that these changes can drive substantial 
productivity gains, alongside lower capital and 
operating costs. 
As this trend develops, the growth in demand for 
high quality, flexible and conveniently located 
workplaces will continue. Our business is ideally 
placed to serve these needs and we are firmly 
focused on participating in this structural shift 
towards flexible work. Our investment 
programme reflects this continuing growth in 
demand, with customers seeking workplaces 
ranging from our core office based locations; 
railway stations; motorway service stations; 
airports and retail outlets.
Our business
Regus is a fast expanding business in a rapidly growing market with

Innovation is key
Transitioning from a predominantly fixed to a 
more flexible mode of work is difficult and, 
despite the significant benefits outlined above, 
it’s often a major physical and cultural change for 
companies. We pioneered flexible working 25 
years ago and so are in the ideal place to help 
them make the transition from fixed to flexible in 
the most efficient way. Technology is as 
important to this today as it was back in 1989 
when Regus was founded. To remain at the 
cutting edge we make significant investments in 
Research and Development (R&D). This drives 
two things: first it helps us better serve our 
customers and unlock additional revenue 
streams; and, second, it helps protect existing 
revenue streams.
Each Regus location provides a 
wide range of products and 
services that cater to the needs of 
our customers. These include (but 
are not limited to) private offices, 
meeting rooms, co-working, 
training rooms, virtual offices and 
admin support.

Location diversity
Set free by ever more powerful and innovative 
mobile technology, work now happens almost 
everywhere. As a result, we are experiencing 
strong demand from a wide range of 
infrastructure providers, such as airport 
operators and railway companies, to partner with 
them and place our facilities in their locations. 
Several years ago we opened our first drop-in 
facilities at train stations in the Netherlands and 
motorway service stations in the UK. Today, 
working closely with our partners, Regus facilities 
can be found within shopping malls and retail 
outlets, university campuses and community 
centres, public libraries and innovation centres. 
At the same time, the size of our locations now 
varies from the very small to ones that can 
accommodate more than a thousand people. We 
have also begun to develop single occupancy 
facilities called Workpods which will be used in 
high footfall areas. What is common to all is that 
they provide a high quality place to work, with a 
full suite of associated services.

 www.regus.com 3 Property is not just expensive, it is a fixed 
(and often long-term) cost; it can also be 
under-utilised. A more flexible, agile 
approach to work has been proven time 
and again to be more cost effective than 
fixed alternatives such as leasing. The 
accompanying capital and operational 
expenditure is lower and an outsourced 
model is less management intensive. On 
many occasions we have been able to 
reduce our customers’ costs by up to 80%.
Significant and 
growing
Today the serviced office and co-working sector 
is only a very small percentage of the entire 
workplace market
1
 while the long-term market 
opportunity is clearly very significant. It is into 
this growing demand that Regus is developing 
the products and services to help workers be  
as productive as possible whilst they work in  
a more flexible way.
Our market
The world of work continues to evolve, driven by structural changes  
in how, where and when people work. People are increasingly working 
in more diverse locations, at different times and in different ways. 
Organisations are finding it more difficult than ever to respond to 
these challenges and adequately support an increasingly mobile 
workforce. As a result, they are increasingly turning to specialist 
providers such as Regus.

Work-life 
balance
Outsourcing
Businesses’ desire to improve efficiency, 
by narrowing their focus on critical core 
competencies, has been a major catalyst 
in the continuing trend to outsourcing. 
Invariably, for businesses, property is not 
a core competency and so many seek ways 
to outsource this to specialist third party 
providers such as Regus, which improves 
the support they provide to their teams at 
a far lower cost.
Achieving balance between working and 
personal lives often tops professionals’ 
definitions of career success. Flexible 
working is a major contributor to a better 
work-life balance, and is now used by 
many companies to attract and retain 
talent such is its positive impact on 
employee satisfaction.
The shift to a low-carbon economy remains 
a priority for governments. Flexible 
working, with its reduction in commuting 
and fixed office space, plays a valuable 
role in achieving this.
Diverse and 
fragmented
The potential of this nascent sector is significant 
and demand is strong and growing, yet given its 
relative immaturity compared to the traditional 
property industry, options are diverse and 
providers fragmented. However, we believe that, 
as has happened in other industries as they 
mature, consolidation will occur. At the same 
time the pace and direction of customer demand, 
from fixed to flexible and from in-house to 
outsourced, is driven by five fundamental factors 
as described on these pages. There are also 
significant variations by geography. For example, 
leading market research company IDC estimates 
that more than 75% of the US workforce spends 
at least one day a week away from their main 
office, whereas the figure for developing 
economies is not yet approaching this level
2
. So 
the key question is, where do these people work? 
A clear market 
opportunity
Some work from home, but even then, available 
data suggests that only a small minority of a 
developed economy’s workforce is based 
predominantly at home
3
. Many more are working 
wherever they happen to find themselves – be 
that a coffee shop, hotel, roadside service 
station, airport or any one of many alternatives. 
Clearly these are not ideal work locations; poor 
levels of security, high levels of distraction and a 
lack of support services being just a few of the 
issues. It is for this reason that specialist 
workplace providers such as Regus exist.

Dell faced a typical chicken-and-egg 
challenge when it decided to grow its 
business in Durban. On the one hand, it 
was entering a small, expanding market 
that didn’t warrant the risk of a traditional 
office with a long-term contract. On the 
other, it had to show it was willing to 
invest in the area if its sales were to gain 
traction. Since it already had a contract 
with Regus, Dell gave one of its account 
executives a Virtual Office Plus. This 
provided the employee with a great 
address to build up credibility with his 
corporate customers and a place to meet 
when required. 
“ Working with Regus lends me credibility 
and creates added value. My customers 
feel more secure that Dell is here to stay 
and wants to establish a relationship and 
invest in the region. It makes them feel

Hungary, Poland and South Africa.
“ With Regus I have one point of contact

With branches across 30 states, Money 
Management International (MMI) is the 
USA’s largest nonprofit, full-service credit 
counselling agency. 
Its branches have traditionally been leased 
but the inherent inflexibility was impacting 
MMI’s ability to move quickly to new 
locations with demographics requiring their 
counselling services. MMI turned to Regus 
for help in restructuring how it organised its 
branch network. In December 2012, MMI 
opened its first Regus-based location 
branch office in Las Vegas, NV and since 
then has opened Regus offices in New York, 
Arizona, California, South Carolina, Atlanta, 
Pennsylvania, Florida, Oregon, Indiana, 
Tennessee, North Carolina, and Texas and 
is currently looking into other locations. 
Each time one of its existing fixed leases 
becomes due, MMI looks for Regus 
workspace in that location. 
“ With Regus, we only pay for the space we 
need, so that is very helpful in terms of 
cost. And the all-in costs are also an 
important factor. For example, telecoms 
and IT are all in place at Regus, so we 
don’t have to pay for connectivity. And at 
Regus we don’t have to pay extra for 
cleaning and security, so we do see cost 
savings from using Regus. The 
professional receptionist staff is a huge 
advantage to us too, it would not be cost 
effective for MMI to have receptionists 
within our branch locations, having them 
in place as part of our overall cost is very 
advantageous.”

Onsight Films is a boutique film studio 
based in Sydney’s Western Suburbs. 
Company founders Marlon Simmons and 
Redgie Duquilla were working from home, 
but saw an opportunity to build their 
business. Regus was the perfect option for 
them to present a professional business 
image and increase their productivity.  
They use Regus’ location in Blacktown as a 
main base and Regus' other 25 Sydney 
locations as required.
“ We deal with a diverse range of clients so 
we have decided to base ourselves in our 
local Regus centre. Working close to 
home saves us time and increases 
productivity and the added benefit of 
Regus means that when necessary, we 
can meet our clients at a range of 
locations across Greater Sydney."

Our business model
During the year we made excellent progress in all aspects of our 
business model. Our consistent and successful strategy applied across 
markets where demand for our products and services is growing, 
delivered another good operating and financial performance this year 
for the Group.
5. 
Investment  
in growth 
Our business comprises four fundamental 
elements: our people, network, products 
and brand. The geographic scale of Regus’ 
operations is unmatched and critically, as 
our physical network grows, so does the 
Group’s competitive advantage over other 
workplace alternatives.
We invest a significant amount of cash in 
growth, either through organic openings 
or acquisitions. We continue to find many 
high quality opportunities that deliver our 
stringent returns criteria. Growth has been 
enhanced by our continued investment in 
developing new location formats and a 
greater diversity in partner relationships. 
Together these have helped the Group 
grow in a more capital efficient way, with a 
reduction in net growth capital 
expenditure per location.
The Group’s ability to alter growth plans to 
reflect changing market conditions is 
another important part of its capability to 
manage risk through the economic cycle. 
With relatively short lead times between 
contracting with our partner and opening a 
new location, the Group can quickly 
capitalise on a favourable investment 
environment and invest in attractive 
assets, or restrict growth, depending on 
the economic cycle. 
Businesses use Regus because they want  
to be in the best places where they can focus 
on what they are doing, not where they are 
doing it from. They stay because we provide 
them with an excellent service at a 
competitive rate and, most importantly, with 
a product that flexes to meet their every 
requirement. As a result, demand continues 
to increase and over the course of 2014 we 
exceeded 2 million members.

Cash 
The strong conversion of profit into cash is 
an attractive feature of the Regus business 
model. The cash flows we generate from 
our network support a significant 
proportion of our continued investment in 
developing our network where we see the 
potential for attractive returns. As well as 
funding valuable location additions to our 
network, strong cash generation underpins 
the Group’s progressive dividend. 
The Group focuses on optimising revenue 
generation through improving the 
performance of each location, which when 
combined with strong discipline on 
overhead costs, which have reduced as a 
percentage of revenues, provides a solid 
foundation to deliver strong returns. 
How we calculate our returns. 
These returns are based on the post-tax 
return divided by the net growth  
capital investment. 
Post-tax cash return = EBITDA less 
amortisation of partner contribution, less tax 
based on EBIT, less maintenance capital 
expenditure 
Net growth capital investment = growth 
capital less partner contributions
The Group’s approach to investment 
ensures it delivers strong post-tax cash 
returns. We generate long-term 
shareholder value through returns-on-
investment well in excess of the Group’s 
cost of capital. Figure A shows the returns 
achieved in 2014 by individual year group 
investments back to 2007 and the 
combined performance of all locations 
opened in or earlier than 2006.

Chairman’s statement
The Group has had a good 
year. It significantly increased 
the size of its network while 
also growing revenues and 
profits. As a result, we 
continued to deliver attractive 
returns on investment. 
During 2014, Group revenues grew to 
£1,676.1m (2013: £1,533.5m), an increase 
of 15.8% at constant currency (9.3% at 
actual rates). Operating profit improved  
by 27% at constant currency to £104.3m 
(2013: £90.8m), up 15% at actual rates. 
This performance is all the more pleasing 
given the adverse impact of start-up costs 
associated with our higher investment in 
growth in recent years. 
We evaluate the underlying performance of 
the business by looking at the returns we 
are able to generate from the investments 
we have made. During 2014 I am pleased to 
report that locations opened on or before 
31 December 2011 (which for clarity are 
locations opened over the first 23 years of 
operation) achieved an annual post-tax 
cash return on investment of 20.9%
4
, well 
above our cost of capital. The specific 
calculation methodology for these returns 
is covered in detail in the CFO’s review  
on page 16-19.
Given these strong returns, the board was 
encouraged by the ability of the business 
to fund additional attractive investment 
opportunities during the year, well ahead 
of its original estimate of at least 300 new 
locations. Adding 452 locations in 2014 
further strengthens the foundations for 
enhanced long-term shareholder returns. 
Furthermore, we achieved this whilst 
maintaining a robust balance sheet and 
investing less of our own capital – indeed, 
we actually generated net cash of £23m  
in the second half of the year, a period in 
which we added 258 new locations. We 
have also taken the opportunity provided 
by good access to debt capital to increase 
and diversify our available facilities. 
Strategy
Our strategic objectives include growing the 
underlying value of our business through 
disciplined investment in quality workplaces 
that expand our national networks while 
providing attractive returns to shareholders. 
Returns to shareholders are further enhanced 
through our focus on efficient and scalable 
operations at both the centre and Group 
level. Our efforts to improve the 
communication of our performance against 
our strategic objectives are reflected in this 
Annual Report.
We continue to benefit from the trend of 
businesses looking to outsource non-core 
activities, of which real estate is one, and the 
shift from fixed to flexible working. These 
changes occur even through variations in the 
macroeconomic climate and, as such, they 
continue to present the Group with 
significant opportunities for growth.
Staying close to our customers and 
providing them with the very best service is 
paramount to our success. We continuously 
look for ways to improve the customer’s 
experience and this underlines the 
importance of our continued investment in 
innovation. Our ability to invest in R&D at a 
scale unmatched by our competitors helps 
define and reinforce our leadership position.  
We understand the benefits of engaging 
with the local economies in which we 
operate and have expanded the support 
for projects of our team members in their 
communities. In addition, while flexible 
working helps our customers reduce their 
carbon emissions, we are working to 
minimise the inevitable environmental 
impact resulting from our significant 
growth through ongoing energy saving 
and sustainability initiatives.
Board
Key roles of the Board include: assuring a 
sound strategy is in place and adapted to 
changing conditions; ensuring we have the 
management and resources to deliver that 
strategy; overseeing management’s progress 
in its execution; and ensuring the Company 
and attendant risks are well managed.
As the breadth and scope of the Group’s 
operations expand, we have undertaken a

number of initiatives to ensure that the 
strategy can be delivered successfully. Our 
ongoing efforts to focus on our strategic 
objectives and initiatives in both Board 
and management activities is paying off, 
evidenced in the numbers we are able to 
present today. We continue to review and 
monitor our remuneration policy to ensure 
that the execution of our strategy includes 
an alignment of interests and incentives 
between our shareholders and executives. 
In May 2014 we welcomed Nina Henderson 
to the Board. She has already made a 
strong contribution and recently assumed 
chairmanship of the Remuneration 
Committee. We have a strong and well 
balanced team with skills and experience 
that complement each other well.
People 
To achieve these results we rely on the 
commitment and skill of our talented and 
experienced people. It is because of their 
dedication, energy and total focus on the 
customer that the business is the success it 
is. To each and every one of them, thank you.
Dividend 
Over the last five years we have doubled 
our dividend payment per share. We remain 
committed to the payment of a sustainable 
and progressive dividend. It underlines our 
confidence in the long-term performance of 
the business, the strength of our balance 
sheet and the quality of our assets.
I am therefore pleased to announce that 
the Board is recommending an increase in 
the final dividend of 10% to 2.75p. Subject 
to the approval of shareholders at the 
2014 AGM, this will be paid on 29 May 
2015 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 1 May 2015.

Chief Executive Officer’s review
Our business has performed 
well. We exceeded 
expectations on growth, 
controlled costs and generated 
attractive, sustainable returns-
on-investment for our 
shareholders. 
Group revenues increased by 15.8%  
at constant currency to £1,676.1m  
(2013: £1,533.5) (9.3% at actual rates). 
Operating profit increased to £104.3m,  
up 27% at constant currency (15% at  
actual rates). 
We have improved the gross margin on the 
locations which were added during 2012 
and 2013. These locations now represent a 
more significant part of our overall revenue 
generated, which increases their relative 
weighting on the overall Group result. We 
continue to achieve a strong level of gross 
margin on all our locations that were open 
on or before 31 December 2011. The initial 
margin achieved by our new 2014 
locations is good and on track but these 
are very young and a long way from 
financial maturity.
I am also particularly pleased with the 
further substantial progress achieved in 
improving the operational effectiveness  
of the business. Total Group overheads, 
including increased investment in R&D, 
were up only 4% at constant currency, 
whilst the size of our network increased 
24%. As a result, total overheads as a 
percentage of revenue reduced from 18.5% 
to 16.7%. As we continue to grow, I expect 
further improvements in this regard.
Consequently, the annual post-tax cash 
return on investment achieved this year 
from centres opened on or before 31 
December 2011 was 20.9%, which is a 
good return.
Market
The way in which people work is changing 
rapidly, driven by a wide variety of factors 
including technological change, 
globalisation and changing workforce 
dynamics, with growing recognition from 
large organisations that effectively 
harnessing these changes can underpin 
substantial productivity gains, alongside

Performance against our strategic 
objectives
Delivering attractive, sustainable returns
Our investments consistently deliver 
strong returns well above our cost of 
capital. We are confident that those made 
in 2014 will, in due course, achieve similar 
strong returns.
The increased diversity of our network  
and number of partners is a positive 
development of the last few years. We now 
have locations from the very busiest city 
centres to large villages, ranging in size 
from 150sqm to 15,000sqm. The wide 
variety of format and service diversity 
means there is no longer a typical, average 
centre for the Group. 
Following feedback from a number of 
stakeholders regarding the presentation  
of the Group’s performance, the Board  
has decided that additional insight can  
be provided through the disclosure of 
post-tax cash return on net investment 
data by year. Accordingly, I am pleased to 
report that locations opened on or before 
31 December 2011 achieved an annual 
post-tax cash return on investment of 
20.9% (2013: 17.8% on locations opened 
on or before 31 December 2010), well 
above our cost of capital. 
Develop national networks
This has been another strong period of 
growth for the Group. We opened in 166 new 
towns and cities, increasing our coverage 
from 684 to 850 cities. We added 452 new 
locations, increasing the size of our network 
by 24% to 2,269. To achieve this, we 
invested net growth capital of £206.6m 
(2013: £260.2m). The reason for the lower 
level of investment in 2014 is mainly due to 
the geographic mix and diversity in deal 
types. As of 28 February 2015, we have 
visibility on growth that will call for a net 
capital investment of approximately £120m 
on some 400 new locations. We will provide 
updates on this as we progress through 
2015. As in previous years these new 
investments will be a mix of organic 
openings and acquisitions. We believe all 
will meet our stringent returns criteria and 
deliver long-term sustainable returns, well 
ahead of our cost of capital.
Industry leading innovation
We have continued to invest in R&D as we 
look to create new formats, improve 
existing ones and develop new products 
and services. Over the period we therefore 
increased spend on R&D by 21% to £8.7m 
(2013: £7.2m).
There is continued strong interest and 
demand globally, from a wide variety of 
infrastructure owners and operators, for us 
to engage with and help them better serve 
their customers. During the year we 
partnered with the Singapore Government to 
open facilities within their public libraries as 
well as expanding the Regus global airport 
network. We launched a new initiative aimed 
at universities, the first deal of which was 
signed with Helsinki University. We also 
partnered with Philips, taking responsibility 
for the management of their innovation 
centre Evoluon in Eindhoven.  
Controlling costs
Against an increase in the network of 24%, 
total overheads increased by only 4% at 
constant currency (down 1% at actual 
rates), reflecting our continued focus on 
cost control. 
Management, both in the field and at Group 
level, remain focused on further improving 
efficiency and productivity, as well as 
delivering scale benefits as we grow. All 
functions underwent some restructuring in 
2014 as we invested further in management, 
streamlined our processes and maximised 
the value of our shared service centres. We 
also increased our investment in R&D and in 
our network development function to 
support the future growth of the business. 
We expect to deliver further efficiencies and 
scale benefits in coming years.  www.regus.com 13

Outstanding teamwork
It has been a year of good progress for the 
Group – strategically, operationally and 
financially. This was achieved only with the 
dedication, focus and commitment of our 
people. As a service-based business, the 
strength and capabilities of our increasingly 
geographically diverse team are critical to 
achieving our objectives and I thank all of 
our staff for their considerable efforts.
We continually review the structure of our 
organisation to get the most out of our 
assets and to optimise on project delivery. 
With the continued growth and 
development at a country level, a strong 
local management presence is required. 
We continue to believe that our current 
organisational model – strong local 
in-country units assisted by support 
functions focused on strategy and  
process optimisation – will deliver our 
strategic goals. 
Our ability to recruit, train, promote and 
retain top quality talent with diverse 
backgrounds is a core strength of the 
business and important to our long-term 
success. For the Group as a whole our 
workforce is 75% female: 25% male (2013: 
70% female: 30% male); at a Group 
operational level the breakdown is broadly 
equal (no change on last year), and at a 
senior management level 33% of positions 
are held by women (2013: 30%). We remain 
committed to a fair approach and equal 
opportunities in all areas of our business.
Outlook
The business is performing well. Our past 
investments are producing attractive 
returns that are well above our cost of 
capital. This performance gives us the 
confidence to continue to invest, thereby 
enhancing future shareholder value. As of 
28 February 2015 we had clear visibility 
over net investments of approximately 
£120m which will increase the size of our 
network by some 400 locations. We will 
provide regular updates on our pipeline 
visibility as the year progresses.
We expect to reduce costs further as a 
percentage of sales as we leverage  
our increased scale and drive new 
operational efficiencies. This will further  
enhance earnings.
As the world of work continues to develop, 
and more organisations look to outsource 
their workplace needs, so the future 
remains positive for Regus. Current trading 
is in line with management’s expectations 
and we remain confident in our business 
model and prospects for 2015.

Our strategy and key performance indicators
Strategic objectives Our approach
Revenue growth achieved through the 
addition of new locations, the development 
of incremental revenue streams and active 
management of the existing network to 
drive efficiency, all contribute to 
improvements in gross profit. Combined 
with strong overhead cost control, this 
drives operating profit and cash flow, 
generating strong returns on investment 
well ahead of the Group’s cost of capital.
Growth is demand-led as we respond to 
customers looking to outsource more of 
their workplace needs and/or benefit from 
the flexibility and convenience we provide. 
By expanding our networks we expand our 
addressable audience and provide our 
existing customers with additional 
convenience. It is important to remember 
that our locations perform well in their 
own right and that the network then 
provides incremental opportunities.
We continue to be mindful of growing only 
in locations where the potential 
investment opportunity meets our 
stringent returns criteria. 
We are also focused on using more capital 
efficient ways of expanding the network.
Cost control is achieved through 
operational excellence and the significant 
economies of scale and operational 
leverage that network growth brings.
Innovation is core to Regus’ strategy and 
allows us to maintain our market-leading 
position and customer service. We invest 
in R&D to ensure we stay on top of (and 
even help shape) trends, by developing 
location formats, products and services 
that meet our customers’ needs and help 
them work more conveniently, efficiently 
and effectively. New product development 
provides existing customers with 
additional reasons to use Regus and also 
opens up new revenue opportunities.
The strategy is clear and simple: to leverage our scale and 
unique position to deliver attractive and sustainable returns

Key performance indicators How we did Future ambitions and risks
Delivering profitable growth and strong, 
sustainable returns is central to creating 
future shareholder value. Regus is 
committed to delivering these returns by 
optimising revenue development and 
controlling costs. Our post 2011 
investments are progressing as expected.
We will continue to add breadth and 
convenience to the network through 
further measured investment in high 
quality assets with the potential for 
attractive returns for shareholders. As  
of 28 February 2015 we had visibility  
over approximately £120m of net  
growth capital expenditure for 2015, 
representing some 400 locations. 
We will continue to control overheads  
to deliver further economies of scale, 
notwithstanding continued and 
significant investments made in the 
business to develop the network and  
our operating platform and processes.
We anticipate increasing our investment 
in R&D as the Group focuses on customer 
requirements and developing 
appropriate offerings to satisfy their 
needs. We believe this provides a key 
point of differentiation for Regus.

workstation sales made in the relevant 
financial reporting period. The remainder 
of the Group overhead base is then 
allocated on a time apportioned pro-rata 
basis by reference to the average number 
of available workstations, with no 
weighting for growth. 
Developing the network 
During 2014 we invested net growth 
capital of £206.6m, adding a further 452 
locations to the network. In 2013 we 
invested net growth capital expenditure of 
£260.2m, adding 448 locations. This 
represents a reduction in the net capital 
cost per location, which we are pleased to 
have achieved. It reflects various factors 
including; geographic mix; different 
location formats and size; increased levels 
of partnering; balance between 
acquisition and organic growth; and a 
more rigorous approach to the design of 
new locations to reduce capital cost. We 
are confident that the returns from the 
investments made in 2014 will, in due 
course, be attractive and ahead of the 
Group’s cost of capital.
We continue to have a good pipeline of 
new openings. As of 28 February 2015 we 
had visibility on growth that will cost in the 
region of £120m and represent some 400 
new locations. We will provide updates on 
our pipeline visibility as we progress 
through 2015. 
As noted previously, every potential 
investment is rigorously evaluated by our 
internal Investment Committee and has to 
meet the stringent financial hurdles before 
being approved. This is a process to which 
we apply maximum focus, given how 
critical the original investment decision is 
to our ultimate success. 
This has been a good year for 
the Group. The strength of our 
business model is reflected in 
the attractive return on 
investment delivered.
Return on investment
Our growth strategy is returns driven and 
focused on achieving our post-tax cash 
payback criteria, which typically is within 
four years. Therefore, as highlighted in our 
2014 interim results statement, we believe 
it is more appropriate to report on value 
creation by referencing the net 
investments made and the associated 
returns generated. 
For the 12 months to 31 December 2014 the 
Group delivered an annual post-tax cash 
return on investment of 20.9% in respect of 
locations opened on or before 31 December 
2011, and which are therefore more 
established in respect of their financial 
performance (2013: 17.8% based on 
locations opened on or before 31 December 
2010). This demonstrates returns ahead  
of the Group’s cost of capital, thereby 
generating strong shareholder value.  
These returns are based on the post-tax 
cash return divided by the net growth 
capital investment. The post-tax return is 
calculated as the EBITDA achieved, less  
the amortisation of any partner capital 
contribution, less tax based on the EBIT 
and after deducting maintenance  
capital expenditure. Net growth capital 
investment is the growth capital after any 
partner contributions. This provides an 
appropriate and conservative measure  
of cash return.
The graph below shows the post-tax cash 
returns achieved in 2014 by individual 
year, back to 2007, and the performance  
of all those locations added on or before  
31 December 2006. 
Returns vary between year groups for a 
number of reasons, notably variations in 
geographical performance, different 
investment levels from mix of deal types 
and movements in currency exchange rates 
from date of investment to current year. 
Simplified overhead allocation
We have simplified the methodology by 
which Group overheads are allocated to 
specific investment years.
The allocation of Group overheads used in 
the returns calculations below is now 
based on two simple criteria. Sales and 
marketing related overheads continue to

Financial performance
Revenue
The Group has produced another good set 
of results whilst delivering against our key 
strategic objectives, notwithstanding the 
negative impact from the strength of 
sterling on the translation of our 
significant international earnings. Group 
revenues increased 15.8% at constant 
currency to £1,676.1m (2013: £1,533.5m), 
an increase of 9.3% at actual rates. 
Gross profit
Group gross profit improved 9% at 
constant currency rates to £383.1m (2013: 
£373.8m), up 2% at actual rates. As 
highlighted in the CEO review on page 11, 
the decline in the Group gross margin from 
24.4% to 22.9% reflects the impact of 
dilution from a relatively higher number of 
immature locations as we have invested 
significantly in growing the network over 
the last couple of years, even though the 
margin performance of these newer year 
groups improved. The mature gross margin 
(from locations added on or before 31 
December 2012), based on a like-for-like 
estate, improved from 26.8% to 27.7%,  
as highlighted in the table opposite.
Improved overhead efficiency
At a time of continued and significant 
growth the Group has made further good 
progress in relation to the total overheads. 
Management remain focused on improving 
efficiency and productivity, as well as 
delivering scale benefits as we grow. All of 
our functions underwent some restructuring 
this year as we invested in management 
and looked to further streamline our 
processes and maximise the value of our 
shared service centres. As a consequence, 
and in spite of significant growth, 
overheads grew only 4% at constant 
currency to £279.6m (down 1% at actual

rates), against a 24% increase in our 
network of locations. We also continued  
to increase investment in R&D, up 21% to 
£8.7m, and in our network development 
function to support future growth. As a 
percentage of revenues, total overheads 
declined from 18.5% in 2013 to 16.7% in 
2014. We continue to maintain a strong 
focus on overhead discipline and anticipate 
further scale benefits to be delivered.
Operating profit
As a result of this strong cost discipline 
and scale benefits, operating profit 
increased 27% at constant currency to 
£104.3m (2013: £90.8m), up 15% at actual 
rates. Consequently, the Group statutory 
operating profit margin increased from 
5.9% to 6.2%.  
Net finance costs
As anticipated, the Group’s net finance 
costs have increased significantly from 
£9.3m to £17.2m. This increase reflects the 
following factors:
• Net debt has increased significantly, 
albeit by less than originally expected, 
from £57m to £138m as the Group has 
invested in growth.
• Available debt finance increased by 
£164m to £484m to ensure appropriate 
financing headroom. With the increased 
availability came the attendant  
carry costs.
• Taking advantage of the low interest 
rate environment and to provide the 
Group with certainty of financing costs 
and protection against higher interest 
rates, swaps were utilised during the 
period to convert a substantial portion 
of debt from floating to fixed rates.
Within the overall net finance costs, the 
Group also incurred a notional, non-cash, 
interest charge of £2.0m (2013: £2.1m) 
relating to the accounting treatment of fair 
value adjustments on various acquisitions 
in past years. 
Tax 
The tax charge for the year was 19.7% 
(2013: 17.9%). This tax rate is consistent 
with our anticipated long-term effective 
tax rate of 20%.
Earnings per share
Group earnings per share increased 17%  
at constant currency to 7.4p (2013: 7.1p), 
up 4% at actual rates. This reflects the 
increase in net income, after higher 
interest costs associated with growing the 
business, the increase in the effective tax 
rate noted above and the attendant initial 
losses associated with new locations. 
The weighted average number of shares  
in issue for the year was 944,081,638 
(2013: 943,775,413). During the year the 
Group purchased 9,484,516 shares 
designated to be held in treasury. The 
Group has also over the same period 
reissued 1,858,441 shares from treasury.
Cash flow
Group cash generation continues to be 
strong. Cash generated before the 
investment in growth capital expenditure 
and the payment of dividends increased to 
£176m, representing 18.6p per share.
We are pleased that we have been able  
to continue to find attractive investment 
opportunities that meet our returns criteria 
and build further long-term shareholder 
value. Accordingly, the £176m of cash 
generated has been applied to fund a 
substantial proportion of the 24% growth 
in locations in 2014. In total, this involved 
a net capital outflow on growth of £206.6m 
after deducting £47m of cash capital 
contributions received in the period from 
partners. This represents a lower level of 
net growth capital investment than in the 
corresponding year for a similar number of 
locations added. Notwithstanding this, the 
growth in 2014 exceeded that which the 
Group could self-fund. So, together with 
the payment of the dividend, net debt 
increased by £81m. 
As our business grows in scale so does its 
ability to fund future growth from internal 
cash generation. For example, in the 
second half of the year the business 
generated £23m of net cash from a first 
half net debt position of £161m, despite 
adding 258 new locations, albeit the 
Group experienced some positive working 
capital movements over the year-end.
Balance sheet & gearing
We closed the year with a net debt position 
of £138m. This represents a Group EBITDA 
leverage ratio of 0.6 times, an 
improvement since the half year. It remains 
our intention to keep this ratio below c. 1.5 
times in order to maintain our prudent 
approach to the Group’s capital structure.
Balance sheet management is an 
important activity and the Group’s capital 
structure is kept under regular review.  
The Group currently has £484m of debt 
funding facilities, which is made up of a 
£320m Revolving Credit Facility and 
£164m (€210m) “Schuldschein” debt 
securities issued during 2014. The 
proceeds of the latter, which was well 
supported by the market and consisted of 
€165m of three-year notes and €45m of 
five-year notes, was used to reduce the 
borrowing on the Revolving Credit Facility.
Taking advantage of the very low interest 
rate environment and to provide greater 
certainty over financing costs and cash 
flows over the medium term, the Group 
took out swaps to convert the floating 
rates on the £164m (€210m) debt 
securities into fixed rates. A currency swap 
was also used to maintain the currency 
profile of our debt. 
During 2014 the Group was accorded a credit 
rating of A- for long-term debt and A1 for 
short-term debt by Egan-Jones. Egan-Jones is 
a Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings 
Organization and is recognised by the 
National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners as a Credit Rating Provider.

5 Net growth capital expenditure of £206.6m relates to the cash outflow in 2014. Accordingly, it includes 
capital expenditure related to locations added in 2013 and 2015, as well as 2014. The total net 
investment in the 2014 additions amounts to £196.1m so far. Strategic report Governance Financial statements
generates. Accordingly, our capital 
expenditure plans remain flexible and we 
have the ability to adjust future investment 
levels in a timely manner.
Post year-end disposal 
Since the year-end we have completed  
the sale of various portfolios of property 
assets. These disposals raised £84m  
of cash and an exceptional profit of 
approximately £20m after expenses, which 
will be reported in our 2015 interim results. 
Deducting these proceeds from our closing 
net debt provides a pro-forma closing 
position of £55m. This is almost identical 
to the £57m opening net debt level for the 
year, and is testament to the Group’s 
attractive cash generation capability given 
the strong level of investment in growth 
through the year. This disposal would have 
reduced the Group’s pro-forma net debt  
to EBITDA ratio to 0.3x at the end  
of 2014.
Foreign exchange
The Group’s results are exposed to 
translation risk from movement in 
currencies. Our reporting currency is 
sterling; in the final quarter of 2013 
sterling strengthened considerably and 
this trend continued for much of 2014. As 
a result the movement in exchange rates 
during the period had a negative impact 
on the translation of our financial results. 
Overall, the strength of sterling reduced 
our reported revenue, gross profit and 
operating profit by £99.7m, £24.4m and 
£11.4m respectively over the 
corresponding period last year.
In recent months we have witnessed the 
US dollar start to strengthen against 
sterling. Whilst this is encouraging, 
sterling has however continued to 
strengthen against both the yen and euro. 
Overall, however, based on current 
exchange rates and the relative weight of 
our US dollar earnings, there is currently a 
mild tailwind as we look forward to 2015, 
rather than the strong headwind 
experienced through 2014. 
The table above sets out the principal 
exchange rates affecting the reporting  
of the Group’s international profits and  
net assets.
Risk management
The principal risks and uncertainties 
affecting the Group remain unchanged. A 
detailed assessment of the principal risks 
and uncertainties which could impact the 
Group’s long-term performance and the 
risk management structure in place to 
identify, manage and mitigate such risks 
can be found on pages 20-23 and 36 and  
37 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Related parties
There have been no changes to the type of 
related party transactions entered into by 
the Group that had a material effect on the 
financial statements for the period ended 
31 December 2014. Details of related party 
transactions that have taken place in the 
period can be found in note 30 to the 2014 
Annual Report and Accounts (page 87).
Dividends
In considering returns to equity 
shareholders, the Board aims to provide a 
progressive dividend, with consideration 
to both profitability and cash generation, 
at a level that is sustainable across the 
cycle. Consistent with this policy and 
subject to shareholder approval, we will 
increase the final dividend for 2014 by 
10% to 2.75p (2013: 2.5p). This will be paid 
on Friday 29 May 2015, to shareholders  
on the register at the close of business  
on Friday 1 May 2015. This represents  
an increase in the full year dividend of  
11%, taking it from 3.6p for 2013 to 4.0p 
for 2014.

The successful delivery of Regus’ strategy 
depends on our ability to identify and 
manage the risks associated with  
our business. 
Regus’ business may be impacted by 
various risks leading to failure to achieve 
strategic targets for growth, loss of financial 
standing, cash flow, earnings, return on 
investment, and reputation. Not all these 
risks are wholly within the Group’s control 
and it may be affected by risks which are not 
yet manifested or reasonably foreseeable.
Effective risk management is critical to 
achieving our strategic objectives and 
protecting our personnel, assets and our 
reputation. Regus therefore has a 
comprehensive approach to risk 
management, as set out in more detail in 
the Corporate Governance Report.
A critical part of the risk management 
process is to assess the impact and 
likelihood of risks occurring so that 
appropriate mitigation plans can be 
developed and implemented.
For all known risks facing the business, 
Regus attempts to minimise the likelihood 
and mitigate the impact. According to the 
nature of the risk, Regus may elect to take or 
tolerate risk, treat risk with controls and 
mitigating actions, transfer risk to third 
parties or terminate risk by ceasing 
particular activities or operations. Regus 
has zero tolerance of financial and ethics 
non-compliance and ensures that Health, 
Safety, Environmental & Security risks are 
managed to levels that are as low as 
reasonably practicable.
Whilst overall responsibility for the risk 
management process rests with the Board, 
it has delegated responsibility for assurance 
to the Audit Committee. Executive 
management is responsible for designing, 
implementing and maintaining the 
necessary systems of internal control.
A list of key risks is prepared and the Board 
collectively assesses the severity of each 
risk, the likelihood of it occurring and the 
strength of the controls in place. This 
approach allows the effect of any mitigating 
procedures to be reflected in the final 
assessment. It also recognises that risk 
cannot be totally eliminated at an 
acceptable cost and that there are some 
risks which, with its experience and after 
due consideration, the Board will choose  
to accept.
As risk management continues to move up 
the agenda, the activity of the Audit 
Committee has become more important  
and increasingly embedded in the  
Group’s activities.
Effective risk management requires 
awareness and engagement at all levels  
of our organisation. It is for this reason that 
risk management is incorporated into the 
day-to-day management of our business, 
as well as being reflected in the Group’s 
core processes and controls. The Board 
oversees the risk management strategy and 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control framework. Risk management is at 
the heart of everything we do, particularly 
as we look to grow across multiple markets 
around the world. For this reason, we 
conduct risk assessments throughout  
the year as part of our business review 
process and all investment decisions.  
These activities include:
• Monthly business reviews of all countries 
and Group functions. 
• Individual reviews of every new location 
investment and all acquisitions.
• Annual planning process for all markets 
and Group functions.
• Annual risk assessment exercise, with 
six-monthly reviews with participation of 
all senior managers.
Risk management
Given the scale of our business, the Board recognises that, whilst it 
aims to maximise returns, the nature, scope and potential impact of our 
key business and strategic risks must be understood and managed.

Principal risks
Risk Mitigation Progress in 2014
Strategic
Lease obligations – The single 
greatest financial risk to Regus is 
represented by the financial 
commitments deriving from the 
portfolio of leases held across  
the Group.
Whilst Regus has demonstrated 
consistently that it has a 
fundamentally profitable 
business model which works in 
all geographies, the profitability 
of centres is impacted by 
movements in market rents, 
which, in turn, impact the price  
at which Regus can sell to  
its customers.
The fact that the outstanding 
lease terms with our landlords 
are, on average, significantly 
longer than the outstanding 
terms on our contracts with our 
customers creates a potential 
mismatch if rentals fall 
significantly, which can impact 
profitability and cash flows.
This risk is mitigated in a number of ways:
1)  92% of our leases are ‘flexible’, meaning that they are 
either terminable at our option within six months and / 
or located in or assignable to a standalone legal entity, 
which is not fully cross guaranteed. In this way, 
individual centres are sustained by their own 
profitability and cash flow. During the most recent 
downturn we were able to negotiate revised terms with 
our partners to reflect downward movements in market 
rates to help recovery. 
2)  Around a quarter of our leases with landlords are 
variable in nature, which means that payments to 
landlords vary with the performance of the relevant 
centre. In this way the ‘risk’ to profitability and cash flow 
of that centre from fluctuations in market rates is 
softened by the consequent adjustment to rental costs. 
In a number of cases, we take no risk at all since the 
lease is signed by a partner who also undertakes all of 
the capital investment and pays us a fixed percentage of 
revenues as well as a share of centre profit.
3)  The sheer number of leases and geographic diversity of 
our business reduces the overall risk to our business as 
the phasing of the business cycle and the performance 
of the commercial property market often varies from 
country to country and region to region.
4)  Each year a significant number of leases in our portfolio 
reach a natural break point.
During 2014, the number of ‘flexible’ 
leases as a percentage of the total 
increased from 84% to 92%. At the 
end of 2014, we were operating 
2,269 locations in 850 towns and 
cities across 104 countries.
Economic downturn – An 
economic downturn could 
adversely affect the Group’s 
operating revenues thereby 
reducing operating performance 
or, in an extreme downturn, result 
in operating losses.
The Group has taken a number of actions to mitigate this 
risk:
1)  Almost a quarter of our leases are performance related 
to a greater or lesser extent and our rental payments, if 
any, vary with revenues earned by the centre.
2)  Lease contracts include break clauses when leases can 
be terminated at our behest. The Group also looks to 
stagger leases in locations where we have multiple 
centres so that we can manage our overall inventory in 
those locations.
3)  We review our customer base to assess exposure to a 
particular customer or industry group.
4)  The increasing geographic spread of the Group’s 
network increases the depth and breadth of our 
business and provides better protection from an 
economic downturn in a single market or region.
We increased the number of centres 
operating on performance related 
leases by 33%.
We also increased the scale of our 
network by 24% and added 166 new 
towns and cities. Our monthly 
business performance reviews 
provide early warning of any impact 
on our business performance and 
allow management to react with 
speed. More generally, investment in 
our management team has also led 
to improved, more responsive 
decision-making at a country and 
area level.
Shifting demand and technology 
trends – Technology 
developments are driving  
demand for flexible working.  
Failure to recognise these could 
mean Regus’ product offering is 
sub-optimal.
Regus continually invests in R&D to develop new products 
and services to increase its competitive advantage,  
protect current revenues and unlock potential new  
sources of revenue.
The Group increased spend on R&D 
by 21% in 2014. 22 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Risk management continued
Risk Mitigation Progress in 2014
Financial
Exchange rates – The principal 
exposures of the Group are to  
the US dollar and the euro with 
approximately 32.4% of the 
Group’s revenues being 
attributable to the US dollar  
and 14.2% to the euro.
Any depreciation or appreciation 
of sterling would have an adverse 
or beneficial impact to the 
Group’s reported financial 
performance and position 
respectively. The Group does not 
generally hedge the translation 
exchange risk of its business 
results. Rather, it assumes that 
shareholders will take whatever 
steps they deem necessary based 
on their varied appetites for 
exchange risk and differing base 
currency investment positions.
1)  Given that transactions generally take place in the 
functional currency of Group companies, the Group’s 
exposure to transactional foreign exchange risk  
is limited.
2)  Where possible, the Group attempts to create natural 
hedges against currency exposures through matching 
income and expenses, and assets and liabilities, in the 
same currency.
3)  The Group, where deemed appropriate, uses currency 
swaps to maintain the currency profile of its external debt.
Overall in 2014 the movement in 
exchange rates had a negative 
translation impact and decreased 
reported revenue, gross profit and 
operating profit by £99.7m,  
£24.4m and £11.4m respectively.
During 2014 cross currency swaps 
were taken out on €165m of debt 
securities to retain the currency 
profile of the Group’s external debt 
following the issue of a €210m loan 
note (which was used to repay 
sterling debt on the Group’s 
revolving credit facility).
Funding – The Group relies on 
external funding to support a net 
debt position of £138m at the end 
of 2014. The loss of these 
facilities would cause a liquidity 
issue for the Group.
The Group constantly monitors its cash flow and financial 
headroom development and maintains a 12-month rolling 
forecast. The Group also monitors the relevant financial 
ratios against the covenants in its facilities to ensure the  
risk of breach is being managed.
The Group also stresses these forecasts with downside 
scenario planning to assess risk and determine potential 
action plans.
The Board intends to maintain a prudent approach to the 
Group’s capital structure by holding the net debt : Group 
EBITDA leverage ratio below c. 1.5 times.
Part of the annual planning process is a debt strategy and 
action plan to ensure that the Group will have sufficient 
funding in place to achieve its strategic objectives.
The Group also constantly reviews and manages the 
maturity profile of its external funding.
During 2014, the Group raised an 
additional £164m by issuing €210m 
of debt securities. These securities 
consisted of €165m of three-year 
notes and €45m of five-year notes. 
The issue also helped to improve the 
overall maturity profile of the Group’s 
debt facilities.
Together with the Group’s banking 
facility of £320m, committed until 
September 2017 , it has £484m of 
available debt financing.
Net debt : EBITDA ratio at 31 
December 2014 of 0.6 times. There is 
significant headroom on each of the 
covenant ratios.
During 2014 the Group was accorded 
A- for long-term debt and A1 for 
short-term debt by an independent 
credit rating agency, which makes 
additional sources of financing 
potentially available.
Interest rates – Operating in a  
net debt position, an increase in 
interest rates would increase 
finance costs. 
The Group constantly monitors its interest rate exposure  
as part of its monthly Treasury Review.
As part of the Group’s balance sheet management it 
utilises interest rate swaps.  
During 2014, to take advantage of 
the low interest rate environment 
and to provide certainty of financing 
costs and cash flows over the 
medium term, the Group has taken 
out swaps to convert a substantial 
proportion of its debt from floating to 
fixed rates. Strategic report Governance Financial statements

Risk management continued
Risk Mitigation Progress in 2014
Operational
Loss of critical systems – The 
Group’s systems and applications 
are housed in a central data 
centre. Should the data centre  
be impacted as a result of 
circumstances outside the 
Group’s control there could be an 
adverse impact on the Group’s 
operations and therefore its 
financial results.
Regus manages this risk through:
1) Business continuity plans. 
2)  A detailed service agreement with our external data 
centre provider which incorporates appropriate back-up 
procedures and controls.
3)  Ensuring appropriate business interruption insurance  
is in place.
We undertake regular testing of 
business continuity procedures  
to ensure that they are adequate  
and appropriate.
Fraud – Landlord and supplier 
and procurement related fraud
Regus manages this risk through:
1)  A rigorous investment approval process to review the 
proposed deal structure against local market conditions 
and alternatives. 
2)  Centralised procurement contracts with suppliers for key 
services and products. 
3) Standardised processes to manage and monitor spend.
4)  Strong governance framework and policies on gifts and 
hospitality, business conduct and bribery and 
corruption.
5) Regular reviews to monitor effectiveness of controls.
Growth
Ensuring demand is there to 
support our growth – Regus has 
undertaken significant growth to 
develop local and national 
networks. Adding capacity carries 
the risk of creating overcapacity. 
Failure to fill new centres would 
create a negative impact on  
the Group’s profitability and  
cash generation. 
Regus mitigates this risk by:
1)  Each investment or acquisition proposal is reviewed and 
approved by the Investment Committee. 
2)  The monthly business review process monitors new 
centre development against the investment case to 
ensure that the anticipated returns are being generated.
3)  As part of the annual planning process, a growth plan is 
agreed for each country which clearly sets out the 
annual growth objectives.
On aggregate, our new centres 
continue to perform in line with 
management expectations and are 
delivering attractive returns.
Human Resources
Ability to recruit at the right level 
Our ability to increase our 
management capacity and 
capabilities through the hiring of 
experienced professionals not 
only supports our ability to 
execute our growth strategy but 
also enables us to improve 
succession planning throughout 
the Group.
Mitigating actions include:
1)  Succession planning discussions are an integral part of 
our business planning and review process.
2)  Part of the annual planning process is the Human 
Resources Plan, and performance against this Plan is 
reviewed through the year.
3)  Regular external and internal evaluation of the 
performance of the Board.
The strengthening of our senior 
management team and country 
management teams has been an 
ongoing activity over the last year. 
This investment in people is 
delivering a return, reflected in the 
reduction of overheads as a 
percentage of revenue and the 
strong financial performance of the 
Group more generally.
During 2014, we also increased the 
size and diversity of our Board with 
the appointment of Nina Henderson. 
Training and employee 
engagement – As a service  
based business the strength and 
capabilities of our increasingly 
geographically diverse team are 
critical to achieving our  
strategic objectives.
One of the key items in the Human Resources Plan is the 
Global Induction & Training Plan, which sets out the key 
objectives for the forthcoming year. Performance against 
these objectives is reviewed through the year.
Our employee survey also provides insight into employee 
issues which is then used to improve the Plan.
During 2014 we successfully 
recruited and trained approximately 
3,500 employees, many through the 
Regus Online Learning Academy. In 
2014 there were over 283,000 
training modules completed. 24 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Corporate responsibility
As a business that works across more than 2,200 locations, we have a 
clear responsibility to make a strong and positive contribution for the 
local communities of which we are a part. 
We specifically look to work with organisations 
focused on health, education and skills 
development, particularly as they relate to 
entrepreneurship and business creation. 
At the same time there is a clear business case 
for such local engagement given our position 
within the local economy – for example with 
recruitment and purchasing. This helps improve 
the local business environment, encouraging 
others to come to the area, some of which may 
decide to use Regus. The deeper our engagement 
across multiple levels, the greater this effect.
We strive to build relationships with all of our 
stakeholders – team members, customers, 
shareholders, property brokers, landlords, 
suppliers and the local communities we are  
a part of – encouraging each stakeholder to 
consider the needs of others and involve 
themselves in the programmes that are in place.
All of our community and charitable activities 
take into account the international context with 
an understanding that cultural diversity 
represents varying perceptions and needs 
across the globe. Our activities are tailored to 
reflect this diverse environment and ensure that 
they are culturally, socially, politically and 
economically adequate and do not negatively 
impact the Company or community in the area.
Community
Regus team members have enthusiastically 
supported local charities through fundraising, 
volunteering, donations of gifts in-kind, 
networking events, mentoring and work 
experience support, and awareness raising 
initiatives. In total more than £150,000 was raised 
and used to support 132 projects for 100 charities. 
This is a significant increase on our activity in 2013.

Environment
We help our customers control both their costs 
and carbon emissions through more effective use 
of space and reducing the need for travel by 
working closer to home. We are also committed 
to minimise our own impact on the environment. 
We are aware that as our business continues to 
grow with the opening and acquisition of more 
centres, our related environmental impact will 
increase. This growth will inevitably generate 
more carbon emissions and carbon charges 
which we have to manage and report under the 
CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme in the UK. Our 
efforts in reducing our carbon emissions continue 
and we are pleased to report a negligible increase 
(0.67%) from last year in total carbon emissions 
from our increased building portfolio. The 
Government’s CRC charges for the coming year 
are increasing by some 36% as the cost of carbon 
allowances increase from £12 per tonne to £16.40 
per tonne. With our continued expansion, we will 
be undertaking a careful review of our portfolio to 
try and ensure our carbon charges and related 
energy costs are as low as possible.
In 2009, through our energy and carbon policy, 
we set out to achieve a 50% reduction in our CO
2
 
emissions in the UK by 2020 based on our 2007 
base year. Excellent progress was being made. 
Nonetheless, our business is changing and 
expanding and so we will review this target 
carefully in 2015 to ensure its appropriateness 
and, if necessary, revise it accordingly.
For the last four years we have been voluntary 
participants of the Carbon Disclosure Project. 
We are pleased to report that for the current year 
(2014) we achieved our highest score to date 
with an 86% disclosure score and performance 
band B rating. 
As a global organisation we work to spread 
environmental best practices across our 
network. In addition to projects that have 
reduced paper usage and target increased 
recycling, our teams are continuing to work hard 
at implementing our carbon reducing policies 
and improving the energy efficiency of each 
centre. Through our ongoing maintenance 
programme, many small but related carbon 
saving projects are undertaken, for example, 
upgrading of controls; changing to more 
efficient low energy lighting; automating 
lighting systems by adding presence detection 
to the switching; and upgrading to more 
efficient chillers and pumps. This ongoing 
strategy of carefully selecting efficient 
equipment is helping to reduce our 
environmental impact further. Strategic report Governance Financial statements
Christmas boxes –  
United Kingdom
For the second year in a row our UK 
business transformed its 300 locations into 
collection points for Operation Christmas 
Child run by Samaritan’s Purse. The charity 
encourages people to fill a shoebox with 
gifts for needy and vulnerable children 
around the world. Our teams, customers 
and local communities responded 
magnificently and more than 2,500 boxes 
were collected. Thanks to them, many 
thousands of children who otherwise 
wouldn’t have received any presents this 
Christmas knew they weren’t forgotten.
Roten Nasen – Austria
Roten Nasen is a charity which brings joy 
to the lives of those sick in hospital by 
sending in “clown doctors”. Our business 
in Austria sponsored the 2014 event and 
several colleagues and their clients took 
part in a fun run dressed in clown noses 
and held stalls with activities for children.
Susan G Komen – Racing for the Cure 
– US & Canada
For the fifth year running the Regus Life Savers Team 
participated in the ‘Race for the Cure’ to raise awareness and 
funds for Susan G. Komen. The charity strives to end breast 
cancer in the U.S. 75% of funds raised for this charity support 
vital breast health services, with the remaining 25% being put 
towards supporting national research to find a cure. Over the 
last four years the team has raised more than US$175,000.
Sightsavers –  
MEA – Kenya, Pakistan, 
Senegal, Tanzania, 
Uganda, Zambia
Regus centre teams actively fundraised in 
support of the local Sightsavers branch 
which works to combat sight loss in their 
country. Their enthusiastic support 
included holding bake sales, football 
match screenings and in-centre activities. 
In addition, each centre held a charitable 
networking event inviting their clients to 
meet the charity programme directors to 
hear more about the amazing, life saving 
work that they do. As a result of our 
combined efforts 834 families will be 
protected from river blindness for a 
whole year.

Flood Relief – Indonesia
In January heavy rains brought flooding to many areas of 
Jakarta, Indonesia and the surrounding cities. More than 
38,000 people were evacuated from their homes, suffering 
from a lack of shelter, food, clean drinking water and other 
essential needs. The eight centre teams in the local area 
organised a collection of these necessary items in their centres 
for the victims. Together with the collections, Regus volunteers 
joined forces with the International Federation of the Red Cross 
and Red Crescent Societies to distribute the donations 
throughout East Jakarta, one of the worst affected areas.  26 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Chairman’s Introduction Corporate Governance
As a Board we regularly discuss and  
review our:
• Performance and progress
• Major risks and their mitigation
• Behaviours
• People and how we can create a high 
performing team
• Future development and succession
• Customers
• Shareholders
These all reflect the considerations for 
directors as referenced in the Companies 
Act 2006 and which our directors know 
they are trusted to consider on behalf  
of all stakeholders.
Governance framework
We hope you can see that Governance  
at Regus is taken very seriously, a critical 
element of our Board environment. It 
enables us to test whether we do the right 
things in the right way, with the right 
safeguards, checks and balances, and 
whether the right considerations underpin 
every decision we take. As such, our 
Governance Framework is reviewed  
every year and sets out the roles, 
accountabilities and expectations for  
our directors and our structures. 
In this section

34 Committee reports
38 Remuneration report
46 Directors’ report

We also trust that you will find this report 
to be fair, balanced and understandable.  
It is a reflection of how we do business and 
how the Board has served its stakeholders.
Changes to corporate reporting 
The Board continues to keep abreast of 
changes to company reporting regulations.
This year has seen the culmination of 
several years of policy development with 
the finalisation of legislation affecting the 
structure and contents of the Annual 
Report. The new Strategic Report on pages 
1 to 25 includes, amongst other matters, 
the Group’s strategy, progress and 
performance for the year. Changes to 
remuneration reporting in particular are 
significant and these are fully covered in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 38 to 45.
Structure of the governance report
In the Governance Report we have provided 
an overview of how the Board operated 
during the year, focusing specifically on 
the Board’s activities during 2014. A 
separate section of the Governance Report 
on page 33 provides a detailed description 
of how the Company has complied with the 
Principles set out in the Code. We hope 
that this new layout will assist readers to 
navigate this section of the Annual Report 
with greater ease. 
Monitoring risk
In view of our long-term ambitions, the 
significant investments that have been 
made across the business and increasing 
complexity as we grow, the Audit 
Committee has played a substantial role  
in ensuring appropriate governance and 
challenge around our risk and assurance 
processes. This is covered in further  
detail on pages 20 to 23 and 35 to 37.
We have built a committed, challenging 
Board. There is much to do and we can 
always do things better, so it is essential 
we are open to ideas which help us 
improve. Our annual Board evaluation 
plays a key role in highlighting those areas 
where we want to do better, and these 
form part of the action plan for this year. 
There were no reportable matters arising 
from this year’s review and we plan an 
external Board evaluation during 2015.
Corporate responsibility
The corporate responsibility activities  
of the Group, including community 
projects and environmental impact 
initiatives, are overseen at the Board  
level by the Chairman.
Douglas Sutherland
Chairman
“ This has been another 
strong year for the Group 
where we have achieved  
our financial and growth 
aspirations.
  The board plays a full and 
active role in ensuring that 
the management team is 
focussed on delivering our 
strategy and achieving the 
returns expected from our 
shareholders.”
Douglas Sutherland

Although the Company is not obliged to 
adhere to the Revised Code, the Board 
prides itself on its commitment to high 
standards of corporate governance and 
the Company has therefore applied the 
principles of the Revised Code as far as  
it is applicable. The Revised Code is 
available at www.frc.gov.uk. and this 
report describes how the Board has 
applied its principles.
The Board
During the year to 31 December 2014, the 
Board of Directors was made up of eight 
members comprising the Chairman, two 
Executive Directors and five Non-Executive 
Directors. Biographical details of the 
Directors are set out on pages 26 and 27.
The Board is mindful of the benefits of 
strength and diversity on the Board. 
Our aim is to have a Board which is 
reflective of the broad range of skills, 
backgrounds and experience necessary to 
properly serve our shareholders. We have 
pursued this objective by engaging Board 
members who have had broad executive 
responsibilities and bring very different 
and complementary personal experiences 
and approaches to matters including  
the evaluation of opportunities and 
management of risks. Our Board members 
represent five different nationalities and 
seven countries of residence. Along with 
their international operational experience, 
they also bring a depth of working 
knowledge covering multiple industries, 
business models, corporate cultures, 
organisational models, functional areas 
and business issues. During the year we 
were pleased to add Nina Henderson to 
the Board as a Non-Executive Director, 
contributing to the skillset and diversity  
of the Board.
The Nomination Committee’s decisions are 
based on merit while reflecting our intent 
to continue to increase diversity over time.
The Board considers that its current 
balance ensures that no individual or group 
dominates its decision making process.
Role of the Board
The primary role of the Board is to  
provide leadership and to review the 
overall strategic development of the 
Group. The Board approves the corporate 
plan and the annual budget and reviews 
performance through monthly reports and 
at every meeting. Capable management 
and relevant technical expertise in the 
business are critical to the implementation 
of the strategy. 
Individuals with strategic responsibilities 
are invited to present to and discuss with 
the Board on a periodic basis.
Through the Audit Committee, the 
Directors ensure the integrity of financial 
information and the effectiveness of 
financial controls and the internal control 
and risk management system. The  
Board has delegated authority to the 
Remuneration Committee to set the 
remuneration policy for Directors and 
senior management. 
The Nomination Committee recommends 
the appointment of Board Directors and 
has responsibility for succession planning 
at Board level. The various Board 
Committees (the ‘Committees’) have 
authority to make decisions in their  
areas of expertise.
Frequency of meetings
There were eight main Board meetings 
during 2014. All serving Directors attended  
each meeting.
The number of meetings of the Committees 
and individual attendance by the Directors 
are shown on the following page (Nina 
Henderson having joined the Board and its 
Committees on 20 May 2014).
Matters reserved for the Board
The Board has a formal schedule of 
matters reserved for its decision, to ensure 
that no one individual has unfettered 
powers of decision. These include:
• approval of regulatory announcements 
including the interim and annual 
financial statements;
• terms of reference and membership of 
the Board and its Committees;
• changes to the Group’s capital structure;
• changes to the Group’s management 
and control structure;
• capital expenditure in excess of £5m; 
and
• material contracts (annual value in 
excess of £5m).
Minutes are taken of all Board discussions 
and decisions and all Directors are 
encouraged to request inclusion in the 
Board minutes of any unresolved concerns 
that they may have.
Board Committees
The Board has delegated certain of its 
governance responsibilities to the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary 
to all of the Board Committees and 
minutes of meetings are circulated to  
all Board members.
The terms of reference of the Committees 
have been documented and approved  
by the Board and are available on the 
Company’s website: www.regus.com. A 
brief summary of the members, activities 
and terms of reference of the Committees 
is provided on the following page.
Chairman’s Introduction Corporate Governance
The Financial Reporting 
Council updated the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 
(the ‘Revised Code’) and it  
is effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or  
after 1 October 2014. 30 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Corporate Governance continued
Group structure
As a Jersey-incorporated company having 
its place of central administration (head 
office) in Luxembourg and being tax 
resident in Luxembourg, the Company is 
required to comply with both Jersey law 
and Luxembourg law, where applicable. In 
addition, the Company’s ordinary shares 
are listed on the Official List of the UK 
Listing Authority and admitted to trading 
on the main market of the London 
Stock Exchange.
It is possible that conflicts may arise 
between the obligations of the Company 
under the laws of each of these 
jurisdictions or between the applicable 
laws and the Listing Rules. If an 
irreconcilable conflict were to occur then 
the Company may not be able to maintain 
its status as a company tax resident  
in Luxembourg.
The Group manages the risk that a 
significant tax liability could arise by taking 
appropriate advice, both in carrying out 
Group reorganisations and on an ongoing 
basis. In addition, the Group believes that 
under current laws and regulations the risk 
of irreconcilable conflicts between current 
laws and regulations impacting Regus plc 
is also low.
All shareholders are paid dividends 
directly from Regus plc SA (‘plc’). All 
dividend payments are made without 
deduction of Luxembourg withholding tax, 
regardless of the residence of the 
recipient.
In general terms, UK resident shareholders 
receiving dividends from plc should be 
taxed in the same way as if they had 
received a dividend from a UK company.
Tax outcomes do, however, depend on the 
specific circumstances of shareholders 
and any shareholder in doubt about their 
tax position (including, in particular, UK 
resident but non-UK-domiciled individuals

Centrally managed applications  
and systems 
All of the Group’s systems and 
applications are housed in a central  
data centre. Should the data centre be 
impacted as a result of circumstances 
outside the Group’s control there could  
be an adverse impact on the Group’s 
operations and therefore its financial 
results. This risk is managed through a 
detailed service arrangement with our 
external data centre provider which 
incorporates appropriate back-up 
procedures and controls.
Strategy
The Board conducts regular reviews of the 
Group’s strategic direction. Country and 
regional strategic objectives, plans and 
performance targets for 2014 have been 
set by the Executive Directors and are 
regularly reviewed by the Board in the 
context of the Group’s overall objectives.
Control processes
The Company has had procedures in place 
throughout the year and up to 3 March 
2015, the date of approval of this Annual 
Report, which accord with the Revised 
Internal Control Guidance for Directors in 
the Code. These include the following:
• There are comprehensive reviews  
every six months of Group and regional 
financial performance, business 
development opportunities, Group 
infrastructure and general Group 
management issues. The results of these 
reviews are presented to the Board.
• Formal country level business reviews 
are performed monthly by regional and 
Group management covering 
performance and management issues 
with country management. Significant 
matters arising from these reviews are 
presented to the Board.
• The annual budget process is driven 
from senior management meetings. 
Budgets are prepared at a detailed  
level by business centre and roll-up  
at country and regional level. The 
Executive Directors review regional 
budgets to ensure consistency with 
regional strategic objectives and the 
final budget is reviewed and approved 
by the Board. The approved budget 
forms the basis of business 
management throughout the year.
• Operational reports and financial 
reports are prepared and distributed to 
the Board on a monthly basis. Actual 
results are reviewed against budget and 
forecast, and explanations are received 
for all material movements.
• Key policies and control procedures 
(including finance, operations, and 
health and safety) are documented in 
manuals having Group-wide application. 
These are available to all staff via the 
Group’s intranet system.
• The Board has formal procedures in 
place for the review and approval of 
investment and acquisition projects.  
The Group Investment Committee 
(comprising the Executive Directors) 
reviews all investments prior to  
approval by the Board where required. 
Additionally the form and content of 
routine investment proposals are 
standardised to facilitate the review 
process. The Group has clearly 
delegated authority limits with regard  
to the approval of transactions.
• Numerous reports are generated  
from the Group’s sales and operating 
systems on a daily, weekly and monthly 
basis to provide management at all 
levels with performance data for their 
area of responsibility which helps them 
to focus on operational issues that may 
require their input.
Information and communications 
processes
The senior management team is integrally 
involved in the business and to this extent 
regularly discuss and address issues and 
opportunities with regional and functional 
teams. Formal business review meetings 
are held with the regional teams and 
functional heads on a monthly basis.
Regular staff communications include 
general information on the business  
from senior management as well as 
operational guidance on changes in 
policies and procedures.
Sales staff and operational management 
periodically attend regional sales or 
management conferences at which 
information on operational issues is 
shared. Delegates present the key 
messages to employees who did not 
attend the event.
Monitoring effectiveness
The following key mechanisms were 
available to the Board at various times 
during the year in the conduct of its review 
of internal controls:
• review of the Group’s monthly 
management accounts which contain 
detailed analysis of financial performance 
for the Group and each of the Group’s 
geographic reporting segments;
• an ongoing process of review, through 
Board meetings, senior management 
meetings and divisional reviews as well 
as other management meetings, for the 
formal identification of significant 
operational risks and mitigating  
control processes;
• delivery of a centrally-coordinated 
assurance programme by the Business 
Assurance department that includes key 
business risk areas;
• reporting the findings and 
recommendations of each review to 
management and the Audit Committee

professionals, not only supports our 
ability to execute our growth strategy but 
also enables us to address succession in  
a more robust way throughout the Group. 
Succession planning discussions are an 
integral part of our business planning and 
review processes. 
In view of the future development of the 
Group and our objective to continue to 
enhance diversity and succession planning 
for Board roles, the Nomination Committee 
maintains an ongoing programme of 
engagement with highly qualified potential 
Non-Executive Directors of varied 
backgrounds and gender. 
Training and resources
Appropriate training is made available  
for all new Directors to assist them in the 
discharge of their responsibilities. Training 
is provided on an ongoing basis to meet 
particular needs with the emphasis on 
governance and accounting developments.
During the year the Company Secretary, 
Tim Regan, provided updates to the Board 
on relevant governance matters, whilst the 
Audit Committee regularly considers new 
accounting developments through 
presentations from management, internal 
audit and the external auditors. The Board 
programme includes presentations from 
management in addition to the Executive 
Directors which, together with site visits, 
increase the Non-Executive Directors’ 
understanding of the business and sector.
All Directors have access to the advice  
and services of the Company Secretary, 
who is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures, corporate governance and 
regulatory compliance are followed and 
complied with. Should a Director request 
independent professional advice to carry 
out his duties, such advice is available  
to him at the Company’s expense.
Directors’ and officers’ insurance
The Group’s insurance programme is 
reviewed annually and appropriate 
insurance cover is obtained to protect the 
Directors and senior management in the 
event of a claim being brought against any 
of them in their capacity as Directors and 
officers of the Company.
Dialogue with shareholders
The Company reports formally to 
shareholders twice a year, with the  
half year results typically announced in 
August and the preliminary final results 
announced normally in March. There  
are programmes for the Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer to give 
presentations of these results to the 
Company’s institutional investors, 
analysts and media in London and  
other key locations.
The Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer maintain a close dialogue with 
institutional investors on the Company’s 
performance, governance, plans and 
objectives. These meetings also serve to 
develop an ongoing understanding of the 
views and any concerns of the Company’s 
major shareholders.
The Non-Executive Directors are given 
regular updates as to the views of the 
institutional shareholders, and the 
Chairman is available and meets with 
these shareholders on request.
The principal communication with  
private shareholders is through the  
Annual Report, the half year results  
and the AGM.
Control environment
High standards of behaviour are  
demanded from staff at all levels  
in the Group. The following procedures  
are in place to support this:
A clearly defined 
organisation structure 
with established 
responsibilities.
An induction process 
to educate new team 
members on the 
standards required 
from them in their role, 
including business 
ethics and compliance, 
regulations and 
internal policies.
Provision to all team 
members of a copy of 
the ‘Team Member 
Handbook’ which 
contains detailed 
guidance on employee 
policies and the 
standards of behaviour 
required of staff.

risk that a significant tax 
liability could arise by taking 
appropriate advice, both  
in carrying out the Group

• Provision E.1.1 – The Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director 
Lance Browne does not have regular 
meetings with major external 
shareholders.
The Board considers it appropriate for  
the Chairman to be the main conduit  
with investors, rather than the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director.  
The Chairman participates in investor 
meetings and makes himself available for 
questions, in person, at the time of major 
announcements as well as upon request. 
The Chairman regularly updates the Board 
and particularly the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director on the results  
of his meetings and the opinions of 
investors. On this basis, the Board 
considers that the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director is able to gain full 
awareness of the issues and concerns  
of major shareholders. Notwithstanding  
this policy, all Directors have a standing 
invitation to participate in meetings  
with investors.
Agreement with Controlling 
Shareholder
On 23 September 2014, Mark Dixon 
entered into a Relationship Agreement 
with the Company so as to comply with 
Listing Rule LR 9.2.2A(2)(a), which came 
into effect on 16 May 2014. The following 
undertakings were given by Mark Dixon:
• all transactions and relationships  
with any member of the Group will be 
conducted on arm’s length terms and  
on a normal commercial basis; 
• no action will be taken that would have 
the effect of preventing the Company 
from complying with its obligations 
under the Listing Rules; and 
• no resolution will be proposed, or 
procured to be proposed, which is 
intended to, or appears to be intended 
to circumvent the proper application  
of the Listing Rules.
The Company confirms that it has 
complied with its obligations under the 
Relationship Agreement during the 
financial period under review, and that so 
far as it is aware all other parties to that 
agreement have complied with it. 
The Company confirms that there are no 
contracts of significance between Mark 
Dixon and any member of the Group, with 
the exception of Mark Dixon’s service 
agreement as a Director of the Company, 
the terms of which are outlined in the 
Remuneration Report.
Corporate Governance continued
The Company continues to engage the 
services of Brunswick as its investor 
relations adviser.
AGM
The AGM each year is held in May in 
Luxembourg and is attended, other than in 
exceptional circumstances, by all members 
of the Board. In addition to the formal 
business of the meeting, there is normally 
a trading update and shareholders are 
invited to ask questions and are also given 
the opportunity to meet the Directors 
informally afterwards.
Notice of the AGM together with any 
related documents is required to be mailed 
to shareholders at least 30 clear days 
before the meeting and separate 
resolutions are proposed on each issue.
The voting in respect of all resolutions to 
be put to the AGM is conducted by means 
of a poll vote.
The level of proxy votes cast and the 
balance for and against each resolution, 
together with the level of abstentions, if 
any, are announced to the meeting 
following voting on a poll.
Financial and other information is made 
available on the Company’s website:  
www.regus.com.
Re-election of the Board
As required by the Code, all Directors 
submit themselves for re-election by 
shareholders annually and Directors 
appointed during the period since the last 
AGM are required to seek election at the 
next AGM under the Company’s articles  
of association. 
Non-Executive Directors are also subject to 
the re-election requirements and serve the 
Company under letters of appointment, 
which have an initial three-year term.
Compliance statement
The Company has complied with the 
provisions set out in section E of the Code 
throughout the year ended 31 December 
2014, with the exception of the following:
Control environment
High standards of behaviour are  
demanded from staff at all levels  
in the Group. The following procedures  
are in place to support this:
Policies and procedure 
manuals and 
guidelines that are 
readily accessible 
through the Group’s 
intranet site.
Operational audit  
and self-certification 
tools which require 
individual centre 
managers to confirm 
their adherence  
to Group policies  
and procedures.
Board performance 
evaluation
The last external evaluation was 
performed in 2012, and the next external 
evaluation will be performed during 2015.
An annual internal evaluation of Board 
performance was conducted for 2014.  
The results of the 2014 evaluation were 
reviewed and are being addressed in our 
efforts to continuously improve the 
processes and effectiveness of the Board.
There were no reportable matters 
identified from the evaluations and we 
continue to have full confidence in the 
Board’s members and processes.
To underpin the 
effectiveness of controls, 
it is the Group’s policy  
to recruit and develop 
appropriately skilled 
management and staff  
of high calibre and 
integrity and with 
appropriate disciplines. 34 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present to you my report 
on the Nomination Committee.
In line with our aim to have a Board which 
is reflective of the broad range of skills, 
backgrounds and experiences necessary 
to properly serve our shareholders, during 
the year the Nomination Committee 
searched for a new non-executive director. 
Our search resulted in the selection, 
recommendation and appointment of  
Nina Henderson as a Non-Executive to  
the Board.
The existing Non-Executive Directors offer 
themselves for re-election each year, as 
further detailed on page 33. Biographical 
details of all serving Directors can be 
found on pages 26 and 27.
“ During 2014, the Committee 
continued to review Board 
composition, seeking  
Board candidates whose 
backgrounds and proven 
skills would strengthen the 
Board and further support 
and develop the long term 
sustainable success of  
the Company.”

The Audit Committee has, via delegated 
authority from the Board, the 
responsibility for applying an effective 
system of internal control and compliance; 
accurate external financial reporting, 
fulfilling its obligations under law, the 
revised UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the ‘Code’); and the Financial Reporting 
Council’s report on Internal Control: 
Revised Guidance for Directors on the 
Combined Code (the ‘FRC Revised 
Guidance’) as well as managing the 
relationship with the Company’s external 
auditors. The Committee therefore acts  
on behalf of the Board, meaning that the 
matters reviewed and managed by the 
Committee remain the responsibility of  
the Board as a whole.
The Committee is comprised entirely  
of Non-Executive Directors as detailed  
on page 30 of the Corporate  
Governance report.
All of the members are considered by the 
Board to be independent in character and 
judgement and are competent in 
accounting and/or auditing. Furthermore, 
and in compliance with the Code, the 
Board regards Elmar Heggen as the 
Committee member possessing recent  
and relevant financial experience.
The Audit Committee met six times during 
the year to 31 December 2014.
Attendance at those meetings is shown on 
page 30 of the Corporate Governance 
report. At the request of the Committee 
Chairman, the external auditors, the 
Executive Directors, the Company 
Secretary (acting as secretary to the 
Committee) and the Business Assurance 
Director may attend each meeting.
The Audit Committee also routinely meets 
independently, without the presence of 
management, with the Company’s external 
auditors and with the Business Assurance 
Director to informally discuss matters  
of interest.
Summary terms of reference of the 
Committee, the full text of which is freely 
available on the Company’s website, are:
• Financial reporting – to provide  
support to the Board by monitoring  
the integrity of financial reporting and 
ensuring that the published financial 
statements of the Group and any  
formal announcements relating to  
the Company’s financial performance 
comply fully with the relevant statutes 
and accounting standards.
• Internal control and risk systems  
– to review the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal controls and risk 
management systems.
• Internal audit – to monitor and review 
the annual internal audit programme 
ensuring that the internal audit function 
is adequately resourced and free from 
management restrictions, and to review 
and monitor responses to the findings 
and recommendations of the  
internal auditors.
• External audit – to advise the Board  
on the appointment, reappointment, 
remuneration and removal of the 
external auditors.
• Employee concerns – to review the 
Company’s arrangements under which 
employees may in confidence raise  
any concerns regarding possible 
wrongdoing in financial reporting or 
other matters. The Audit Committee 
ensures that these arrangements  
allow proportionate and independent 
investigation and appropriate  
follow-up action.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present to you this year’s 
Audit Committee report. The report sets 
out the significant matters that the 
Committee has considered and addressed 
during the year under review, whilst  
also detailing the Committee’s role in 
monitoring all aspects of financial 
reporting, internal controls and risk 
management. For the year under review, 
there were no reportable issues to bring  
to your attention.
“ I am pleased to introduce  
the 2014 Audit Committee 
Report which explains  
the Committee’s role in 
monitoring all aspects  
of financial reporting, 
internal controls and risk 
management, and provides 
an overview of the work 
undertaken by the Committee 
over the past year.”
Elmar Heggen
Chairman, Audit Committee 36 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Audit Committee report continued
The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
routinely reports to the Main Board on  
how the Committee has discharged its 
responsibilities, as well as highlighting 
any concerns that have been raised as  
and when they arise.
Activities of the Audit Committee 
during the year
The Committee has a number of standing 
agenda items which it considers at each of 
its meetings, as well as any other specific 
matters which arise during the year. 
During the year, amongst other items,  
the Committee reviewed and discussed:
• the control observations from the 
previous year’s Group audit cycle;
• internal controls and risk management 
(as further particularised within  
this report);
• the Group tax report;
• the interim and final dividends;
• the integrity of the half year results and 
annual financial statements, alongside 
the formal announcements relating to 
them; and
• the Group audit strategy for the year.
Risk management
On behalf of the Board, the Audit 
Committee oversees and reviews an 
ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the risks faced 
by the Group. Major business risks and 
their financial implications are appraised 
by the responsible executives as a part of 
the planning process and are endorsed  
by regional management. Key risks are 
reported to the Audit Committee, which in 
turn ensures that the Board is made aware 
of them. The appropriateness of controls 
is considered by the executives, having 
regard to cost, benefit, materiality and the 
likelihood of risks crystallising. Key risks 
and actions to mitigate those risks are 
regularly considered by both the Audit 
Committee and the Board, and are 
formally reviewed and approved by  
the Board annually.
Principal risks
There are a number of risks and 
uncertainties which could have an impact 
on the Group’s long-term performance. 
The Group has a risk management 
structure in place designed to identify, 
manage and mitigate business risks. Risk 
assessment and evaluation is an integral 
part of the annual planning process, as 
well as the Group’s monthly review cycle.
The Group’s principal risks, together with 
an explanation of how the Group manages 
these risks, are presented on pages 20 to 
23 of this Annual Report.
Internal control
The Committee has a delegated 
responsibility from the Board for the 
Company’s system of internal control  
and risk management and for reviewing 
the effectiveness of this system. Such a 
system is designed to identify, evaluate 
and control the significant risks associated 
with the Group’s achievement of its 
business objectives with a view to 
safeguarding shareholders’ investments 
and the Group’s assets. Due to the 
limitations that are inherent in any system 
of internal control, this system is designed 
to meet the Company’s particular needs 
and the risks to which it is exposed, and  
is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risk.
Accordingly, such a system can provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
In accordance with the FRC Revised 
Guidance, the Committee confirms that 
there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing  
the significant risks faced by the Group.
During the year under review, the 
Committee continued to revisit its risk 
identification and assessment processes, 
inviting Board members and senior 
management to convene and discuss the 
Group’s key risks and mitigating controls.
A risk-based approach has been adopted 
in establishing the Group’s system of 
internal control and in reviewing its 
effectiveness. To identify and manage  
key risks:
• a number of Group-wide procedures, 
policies and standards have  
been established;
• a framework for reporting and 
escalating matters of significance  
has been set up;
• reviews of the effectiveness of 
management actions in addressing key 
Group risks identified by the Board have 
been undertaken; and
• a system of regular reports from 
management setting out key 
performance and risk indicators has 
been developed.
The above process is designed to  
provide assurance by way of cumulative 
assessment and is embedded in 
operational management and  
governance processes.
Key elements of the Group’s system of 
internal control which have operated 
throughout the year under review are  
as follows:
• The risk assessments of all significant 
business decisions at the individual 
transaction level, and as part of the 
annual business planning process. A 
Group-wide risk register is developed 
annually whereby all Company inherent 
risks are identified and assessed, and 
appropriate action plans developed to 
manage the risk per the Company’s risk 
appetite. The Board reviews the Group’s 
principal risks register annually and 
management periodically reports on the 
progress against agreed actions to keep 
a close watch on how we are managing 
our key risks.
• The annual strategic planning process, 
which is designed to ensure consistency 
with the Company’s strategic objectives. 
The final budget is reviewed and 
approved by the Board. Performance  
is reviewed against objectives at each 
Board meeting.
• Comprehensive monthly business 
review processes under which business 
performance is reviewed on business 
centre, area, country, regional and 
functional levels. Actual results are 
reviewed against targets, explanations 
are received for all material movements, 
and recovery plans are agreed  
where appropriate.
• The documentation of key policies and 
control procedures (including finance, 
operations, and health and safety) 
having Group-wide application. These 
are available to all staff via the Group’s 
intranet system.
• Formal procedures for the review  
and approval of all investment and 
acquisition projects. The Group 
Investment Committee (comprising the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer) reviews and approves 
all investments. Additionally, the form 
and content of routine investment 
proposals are standardised to facilitate 
the review process.
• The delegation of authority limits with 
regard to the approval of transactions.
• The generation of targeted, action-
oriented reports from the Group’s sales 
and operating systems on a daily, 
weekly and monthly basis which  
provide management at all levels with 
performance data for their area of 
responsibility, and which helps them  
to focus on key issues and manage  
them more effectively.
• The delivery of a centrally co-ordinated 
assurance programme by the Internal 
Audit department that includes key 
business risk areas. The findings and 
recommendations of each review are 
reported to both management and  
the Committee.
• Annual internal control self-assessment 
and management certification exercise 
covering the effectiveness of financial 
and operational controls. This is based 
on a comprehensive internal control 
questionnaire collated and reviewed by  Strategic report Governance Financial statements
 www.regus.com 37
Audit Committee report continued
Internal Audit. Results and any 
necessary mitigating action plans are 
presented to senior management and 
the Board.
• The maintenance of high standards of 
behaviour which is demanded from staff 
at all levels in the Group. The following 
procedures are in place to support this:
• a clearly defined organisation 
structure with established 
responsibilities;
• an induction process to educate  
new team members on the standards 
required from them in their role, 
including business ethics and 
compliance, regulation and  
internal policies;
• the availability of the ‘Team Member 
Handbook’, via the Group’s intranet, 
which contains the Company’s Code 
of Business Conduct, detailed 
guidance on employee policies and 
the standards of behaviour required 
of staff;
• policies, procedure manuals and 
guidelines are readily accessible 
through the Group’s intranet site;
• operational audit and self-
certification tools which require 
individual managers to confirm their 
adherence to Group policies and 
procedures; and
• a Group-wide policy to recruit  
and develop appropriately skilled 
management and staff of high  
calibre and integrity and with 
appropriate disciplines.
The Committee and the Board regard 
responsible corporate behaviour as an 
integral part of the overall governance 
framework and believes that it should  
be fully integrated into management 
structures and systems. Therefore the  
risk management policies, procedures  
and monitoring methods described  
above apply equally to the identification, 
evaluation and control of the Company’s 
safety, ethical and environmental risks  
and opportunities. This approach ensures 
that the Company has the necessary and 
adequate information to identify and 
assess risks and opportunities affecting 
the Company’s long-term value arising 
from its handling of corporate 
responsibility and corporate  
governance matters.
The Committee has completed its  
annual review of the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control for the year to  
31 December 2014 and is satisfied that it  
is in accordance with the FRC Revised 
Guidance and the Code. The assessment 
included consideration of the 
effectiveness of the Board’s ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks facing the Group.
Whistle-blowing policy
The Company has an externally hosted 
whistle-blowing channel (‘EthicsPoint’), 
which is available to all employees via 
email, and on the Company’s Intranet.  
The aim of the policy is to encourage all 
employees, regardless of seniority, to 
bring matters that cause them concern  
to the attention of the Audit Committee.
The Business Assurance Director, where 
appropriate and in consultation with the 
executive management team, decides  
on the appropriate method and level of 
investigation. The Audit Committee is 
notified of all material discourses made 
and receives reports on the results of 
investigations and actions taken on a 
regular basis. The Audit Committee has 
the power to request further information, 
conduct its own inquiries or order 
additional action as it sees fit.
External auditors
KPMG Luxembourg, Société coopérative 
were the Company’s auditors for the year 
ended 31 December 2014. The Audit 
Committee is responsible for oversight  
of the external auditors, including an 
annual assessment of their independence 
and objectivity.
During the year, the external auditors 
provided the following audit and non-audit 
related services:
Audit related: KPMG Luxembourg, Société 
coopérative audited the consolidated 
financial statements of the Company, 
performed control observations throughout 
the Group and provided an overview of the 
half year results of the Company.
Non-audit related: KPMG Luxembourg, 
Société coopérative performed buy-side 
due diligence work on certain acquisitions 
by the Group.
It is the Company’s policy to use the 
external auditors for non-audit related 
services only where the use of the external 
auditors will deliver a demonstrable 
benefit to the Company as compared to  
the use of other potential providers of the 
services and where it will not impair their 
independence or objectivity. All proposals 
for permitted defined non-audit services  
to use the external auditors must be 
submitted to, and authorised by, the  
Chief Financial Officer.
Permitted non-audit services include 
advice on financial accounting and 
regulatory reporting matters, reviews of 
internal accounting and risk management 
controls, non-statutory audits (e.g. 
regarding acquisitions and disposal of 
assets and interests in companies) and  
tax compliance and advisory services.
Prohibited non-audit services include 
book-keeping and other accounting 
services, actuarial valuation services, 
recruitment services in relation to key 
management positions and transaction 
(acquisitions, mergers and dispositions) 
work that includes investment banking 
services, preparation of forecasts or 
investment proposals and deal  
execution services.
The scope and extent of non-audit  
related services undertaken by the 
external auditors is monitored by and, 
above a threshold of £50,000, requires 
prior approval from the Committee to 
ensure that the provision of such services 
does not impair their independence  
or objectivity.
The breakdown of the fees paid to the 
external auditors during the year to  
31 December 2014 can be found in note 5  
of the Notes to the Accounts.
For the year ending 31 December 2015, the 
Audit Committee has recommended to the 
Board that a resolution to reappoint KPMG 
Luxembourg, Société coopérative as the 
Company’s auditors be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting.
The Audit Committee notes the ongoing 
dialogue regarding the advantages and 
disadvantages related to the periodic 
rotation of external auditors. The Audit 
Committee has considered the various 
viewpoints expressed in this debate in the 
context of Regus. Given the significant 
level of other changes which are ongoing 
and includes the mix of countries in which 
much of the audit work is conducted, the 
rapid growth and evolving structure of the 
Group, changes in financial organisation 
and personnel, ongoing efforts to continue 
to improve audit effectiveness with the 
existing external auditors, and other 
factors, the Audit Committee does not 
believe at this time that it is appropriate or 
in the interest of shareholders to rotate 
external auditors primarily for the sake of 
change. The Audit Committee will be 
complying with EU legislation regarding 
auditor independence and rotation. The 
Audit Committee will continue to keep 
under review the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditors, the 
effectiveness of the audit process, 
legislative developments, the rotation of 
the lead audit partner and other matters 
as they monitor the appropriateness of the 
retention of KPMG Luxembourg, Société 
coopérative as the Company’s auditors.

Dear Shareholder, 
As the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, I am pleased to present to you

explains the Committee’s key decisions in 
respect of 2014 and the approach for 2015. 
The remainder of the report is divided  
into the following sections:
• Key features of the framework: this

This describes the implementation  
of our policies in 2014, including the 
“single figure of remuneration” and 
supporting narrative for our bonus  
and long-term outcomes.

The final section includes additional 
supporting disclosures. 
Remuneration objectives and 
principles
As context for considering the report, set 
out below are the remuneration objectives 
and principles which have consistently 
underpinned our remuneration framework 
for a number of years:
• Our remuneration packages must 
attract, retain and motivate people of 
the highest calibre and experience 
needed to shape and execute the 
Company’s strategy and to deliver 
shareholder value. Total compensation 
opportunities should be commensurate 
with comparable packages available 
with similar companies operating in 
similar markets;
• A significant proportion of reward 
should be based on short and long-term 
performance measured by satisfaction 
of targeted objectives which are the 
main drivers of shareholder value. 
Executives should be focused on 
delivering attractive returns to 
shareholders and be given the 
opportunity to receive commensurate 
levels of reward if such performance is 
delivered. Conversely if returns are 
conservative, compensation levels 
should be conservative.
• The interests of executives should be 
closely aligned with those of 
shareholders over the long-term 
through substantial share ownership 
and share-based incentives. Historically, 
this has been achieved via our Co-
Investment Plan (CIP) which has 
performance and holding periods of five 
years from grant and through our share 
ownership guidelines. Reflected 
throughout this Annual Report are our 
ongoing efforts to improve 
communication regarding our strategic 
objectives and the performance of the 
Group. During 2015, we will review our 
short-term and long-term compensation 
schemes, which will include 
consultations with stakeholders, to 
ensure compensation policies and plans 
throughout the Group are aligned with 
our future strategic objectives and 
related performance measures.

2014 outcomes
• As discussed within the strategic report 
on pages 1 to 25, 2014 was a good year 
for the Group with strong growth and, as

shareholder returns.

The chart shows the post tax cash return 
achieved by individual year group 
investments from 2011 back to 2007 and 
the combined performance of all locations 
opened in or earlier than 2006. The total 
return in respect of all the locations 
opened on or before 31 December 2011 
(and which are therefore more established 
in respect of their financial performance) 
was 20.9%. All these returns are above the 
Group’s cost of capital.
• The annual bonus for 2014 was based on 
adjusted operating profit performance. 
The Committee determined that 
performance in the year (as described 
earlier in this report) warranted annual 
bonuses of 100% of salary to the 
executive directors. Half of the awarded 
bonuses will be deferred as Regus 
Investment Shares for three years under 
the CIP (see below).

achieving adjusted EPS of 29.4p 
(adjusted to exclude certain growth 
investments and one-off exceptional 
items over the five year performance 
period in accordance with the terms  
of the original award) and TSR of 119% 
(vs FTSE All Share 55%), the Committee 
determined that 86% of the final 
tranche should vest.

2015 decisions
• Following the annual review, there  
are no changes to the salaries of the 
Executive Directors with effect from  
1 January 2015. Salaries will be 
considered as part of the wider review  
of the remuneration framework to be 
held during the year (see below) and 
therefore may change.
• The structure and quantum of our 
incentive opportunities will remain 
unchanged, as set out in the table  
on page 40. 
• Based on the deferral of half of the  
2014 bonus (i.e. 50% of salary), an 
opportunity to earn up to four Matching 
Shares for each Investment Share will 
be awarded under the CIP . This will be 
equivalent to a maximum award of 
200% of salary. 
• For these CIP Matching Shares, 75%  
will be based on EPS, with targets  
which require compound annual growth 
of 32% p.a. for maximum vesting. The 
remaining 25% will continue to be based 
on our total shareholder return (TSR) 
against the constituents of the FTSE 350 
(excluding financial services and mining). 
• Performance will be measured over a 
three year performance period with a 
subsequent two year holding period  40 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Summary of Executive Director remuneration framework / application for 2015
The table below summarises the framework for executive remuneration at Regus. It reflects the Remuneration Policy which was 
approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting and which can be found in the 2013 Directors’ Remuneration Report  
(or downloaded from www.regus.com)
Purpose and operation Application for 2015
Fixed remuneration
Base salary
Provides a market competitive component of fixed 
remuneration taking into account the scope and 
responsibilities of the role, the skills, experience and 
circumstances of the individual, sustained performance 
in role, and appropriate market data. 
Salary increases will normally be broadly in line with 
increases awarded to other employees in the business, 
although the Committee may award larger increases  
if it considers it appropriate (e.g. change in role, 
development and performance in role, or to align  
to market data).
Salaries effective from 1st January will remain 
unchanged at
• Mark Dixon: £587k 
• Dominique Yates: CHF495k
Salaries will be considered as part of the wider review 
of the remuneration framework to be held during the 
year and therefore may change.
Benefits
Provide a competitive benefits package for the nature 
and location of the role, and which currently includes 
private health insurance and life insurance. Dominique 
Yates also receives representation and expatriate 
allowances reflecting specific individual circumstances.
No changes proposed. 
The Committee believes it is appropriate to continue 
payment of expatriate and housing allowances to the 
CFO as part of a market competitive package for the 
location of the role, although the Committee will keep 
this policy under review for future years.
Pension
Provide retirement benefits in line with the overall 
Group policy through participation in the Company’s 
personal pension scheme. The Committee considers 
the maximum contribution for Executive Directors  
(7% of salary) to be low compared with comparative 
companies but prefers to offer enhanced variable 
compensation (rather than a fixed additional  
pension contribution).
No changes. 7% of base salary.
before any vested shares are released. 
This simplifies the framework whilst 
maintaining an overall time horizon of 
five years for the CIP awards.
• In addition, for these 2015 awards the 
EPS targets have been recalibrated from 
an absolute pence target into a 
compound annual percentage growth 
rate. This brings our practice into line 
with the majority of the market, easing 
comparability for shareholders. The 
percentage growth targets for this year 
are properly stretching targets.
• Beginning in 2015, the annual bonus 
and the CIP will both be subject to 
clawback provisions under which the 
Committee may seek to reduce or 
reclaim variable remuneration in 
circumstances of material misstatement 
or participant misconduct. Further 
details are set out on page 41.
• During 2015, the Committee intends to 
review the remuneration and incentive 
framework for our Executive Directors  
to ensure alignment with the Group’s 
strategic objectives. We intend to consult 
with our major shareholders and investor 
bodies ahead of bringing our proposals 
for shareholder approval at the 2016 AGM.
Chairman / Non-Executive Director fees
During 2014 the fees for the Chairman  
and Non-Executive Directors were 
benchmarked and reviewed, resulting  
in an increase with effect from 2015 as  
set out in this report. The last fee increase 
for the Chairman was 2011 and for the 
Non-Executive Directors in 2012. Since this 
time the scale and market capitalisation of 
the business has increased significantly 
as well as the expectations of what is 
required of the Non-Executive Directors. 
The Chairman’s fee also covers 
participation in the boards of certain 
group companies which has  
also expanded over this time period.
At the 2014 AGM, the Directors’ 
remuneration report received strong 
shareholder support for both remuneration 
related resolutions. The voting summary is 
provided on page 45. We look forward to 
receiving your support for this report at the 
2015 AGM.

Summary of Executive Director remuneration framework / application for 2015 continued
Purpose and operation Application for 2015
Variable remuneration
Annual 
bonus
To incentivise and reward annual performance for 
shareholders. Maximum opportunity: 100% of base 
salary per annum. 
Up to 50% of any bonus earned can be deferred into 
Investment Shares under the CIP (see below). The 
remainder is paid in cash. 
Maximum opportunity unchanged: 100% of salary.
The bonus will be determined by reference to adjusted 
operating profit performance in 2015. 
The Committee considers the targets to be 
commercially sensitive.
From 2015, clawback provisions apply. 
Co-
Investment 
Plan 
(CIP)
To reward deferral under the annual bonus, encourage 
the build-up of significant personal shareholdings over 
time, and provide a variable pay opportunity which 
motivates and rewards long-term performance.
An annual bonus of up to 50% of salary (gross) may be 
awarded in the form of Investment Shares which will be 
released at the end of a holding period of three years 
subject to continued employment. For each Investment 
Share held, up to four additional shares (Matching 
Shares) may be earned based on the Company’s 
long-term performance. The maximum award is 
therefore 200% of base salary per annum. 
From 2015, clawback provisions apply. Any shares 
which vest after the three year performance period will 
be subject to a subsequent two year holding period 
before they are released.
The Executive Directors will defer half of the 2014 bonus 
(i.e. 50% of salary) and therefore the number of 
Matching Shares which will be awarded is 200% of 
salary. The Matching Shares will vest subject to EPS  
and TSR performance conditions over a three year 
performance period in accordance with the targets  
as set out in the table below.
Shareholding 
guidelines
Under the Regus Shareholding guidelines, Executive 
Directors are expected to build up a shareholding of 
200% of salary in Regus shares.
No change to the guideline. 
Executive Directors already exceed the guideline.
Other key elements of the framework
Clawback
For the 2015 annual bonus and CIP awards, the Committee will 
have discretion to reclaim bonus cash for a period of three years 
after payment, cancel or reduce the number of Investment Shares 
for a period of three years after grant, cancel or reduce the 
number of unvested Matching Shares at any point prior to vesting, 
or reclaim vested Matching Shares for a period of two years after 
vesting (i.e. five years from grant) in circumstances of material 
misstatement of the Company’s audited financial results, 
misconduct on the part of the participant, or error in assessing  
a performance condition applicable to the award or in the 
information or assumptions on which the award was granted  
or vests.
Service contracts
Executive Directors have service contracts with the Group  
which can be terminated by the Company or the Director by  
giving 12 months’ notice. The Company may terminate the 
employment of the Chief Executive by making a payment in lieu  
of notice which would not exceed 12 months’ salary. Unless it is 
renewed, the contract of the Chief Financial Officer will terminate 
automatically after five years (from 1st September 2011) without 
requiring notice.

reflect underlying performance of the Group, and to make 
adjustments where investments supporting growth are 
significantly above or below those envisaged when the targets 
were set. The purpose of such adjustments is to ensure a fair 
measurement of performance and to avoid the EPS targets acting 
as a disincentive to the investments which underpin the long-
term growth strategy. The targets for 2017 will be based on 
compound annual growth from an equivalent “base year” EPS 
figure for 2014 of 7.4p.  42 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

The salary, benefits, pension and cash element of the bonus  
for Dominique Yates are paid in Swiss Francs and have been 
converted to Pounds Sterling for the table above using the 
average exchange rate for the relevant year.
Benefits – Includes private health insurance and life insurance 
and, for Dominique Yates, it also includes a representation 
allowance and expatriate allowances.
Annual bonus – Includes the full value of the annual bonus 
awarded in respect of the relevant financial year. In both 2014  
and 2013, 50% of the value shown in the table was deferred  
into Investment Shares for three years subject to continued 
employment under the terms of the CIP , with the remainder 
received in cash. 
CIP awards – Includes the value of Matching Share awards made 
to Mark Dixon under the CIP in previous years which vested in 
respect of a performance period ending in the relevant financial 
year. The vesting of the final tranche of the 2008 / 2009 Matching 
Shares is included in the 2014 column (820,205 shares vested out 
of the maximum of 954,420). The vesting of the second tranche of 
the 2008 / 2009 Matching Shares is included in the 2013 column. 
The figure has been updated to reflect the actual share price on 
the date of vesting. 
 Annual bonus
In 2014, the Executive Directors had a maximum bonus 
opportunity of 100% of salary based on performance against 
stretching adjusted Group operating profit targets for the 
financial year. For the purposes of the annual bonus, the 
Committee makes adjustments to Group operating profit to reflect 
certain investments in growth in order to ensure that the bonus 
does not act as a disincentive to these investments which 
underpin the long-term growth strategy. 
Based on the adjusted operating profit performance in the year, 
the Committee determined that the Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Financial Officer should each receive a bonus of 100% of 
salary in respect of the year.
In considering the bonus for the year, the Committee also took 
into account the following performance context (explained in 
more detail on pages 11-19 of the annual report):
• Group revenue increased by 15.8% at constant currency  
to £1,676.1m; Group operating profit by 27% at constant 
currency to £104.3m 
• Strong cash performance, with £176m (18.6p per share)  
of cash generated before net growth capital expenditure  
and dividends. 
• Reduction in overheads of 1.8 ppt to 16.7% of revenues.
• A post-tax return for 2014 on investment in our estate added  
on or before 31 December 2011 of 20.9% (2013: 16.8%)
• Increase in network of 24% to 2,269 locations.
The Committee believes that the adjusted operating profit  
targets used to assess the annual bonus are commercially 
sensitive and that it is not appropriate to disclose them currently 
or retrospectively. 
Half of the awarded bonus (50% of salary) is paid in cash and half 
(the remaining 50% of salary) will be awarded in the form of 
Investment Shares, the vesting of which will be deferred for three 
years under the CIP . Further details of these awards to be made in 
2015 are set out in the table on page 41.
CIP awards vesting in respect of 2014
The 2008 and 2009 Matching Share awards were divided into 
three separate equal tranches subject to performance periods 
over three, four and five years respectively from 1 January 2010. 
The final tranche of the 2008 and 2009 Matching Share award was 
based on a five year performance period to 31 December 2014.  
The vesting conditions for the final tranche are outlined below.

The Committee has assessed performance against the  
TSR and EPS targets set in 2010 and concluded that 86% of the 
final tranche should vest (and the remainder of that tranche  
shall lapse):
• TSR (25%). From a base point of 100%, Regus achieved a TSR 
value of 218.6% compared to 154.6% for the FTSE All Share 
Index over the performance period, equating to a vesting of 
55.75% of this part of the award. 
• EPS (75%). Based on achieving an adjusted 2014 EPS of 29.4p, 
which reflects underlying performance delivered during the  
five year performance period, adjusted to exclude the positive 
impact of changes in accounting policy and estimates 
implemented during 2012, and to exclude certain investments 
in growth and one-off exceptional items in accordance with  
the terms of the original award, the Committee concluded that 
96% of this part of the award should vest.  Strategic report Governance Financial statements

Remuneration report continued
CIP awards made in 2014
The Executive Directors deferred 50% of their 2013 annual bonus 
into Investment Shares under the CIP . The Investment Shares will 
vest and be released at the end of a three year holding period, 
subject to continued employment with the Regus Group during 
that period. 
For each Investment Share held the Executive Directors may earn 
up to a maximum of four Matching Shares which will vest subject 
to EPS and TSR performance conditions in three equal tranches 
over performance periods of three, four and five years. As the 
Investment Shares had a value of 39.5% of salary the maximum 
number of Matching Shares awarded in 2014 was equivalent to 
158% of salary. 
Details of the Investment Share and Matching Share awards made during 2014 to the executive directors are shown in the table below.

threshold target
In previous years, the TSR targets were based on out-performance 
of the FTSE All Share index. For 2014 awards, the Committee 
re-calibrated the TSR targets to be based on the ranked TSR 
performance of Regus against the constituents of the FTSE 350 
(excluding financial services and mining companies). The 
Committee believed that, given the absence of any listed peer 
companies, the use of a broad equity index remained appropriate, 
and that the FTSE 350 is preferable to the All Share index on the 
basis of the position of Regus in the FTSE 350 index. Companies 
from the financial services and mining sectors are excluded  
in order to ensure the TSR result is not unduly skewed by the 
performance of these sectors which are often subject to their  
own business cycles.
For the purposes of the CIP , EPS is defined as basic EPS of  
the Group. The Committee has discretion to adjust EPS (both 
positively and negatively) to take into account one-off exceptional 
items which do not appropriately reflect underlying performance 
of the Group, and to make adjustments where the investments in 
new locations and / or business initiatives is significantly above 
or below that envisaged when the targets were set. The purpose 
of such adjustments is to ensure a fair measurement of 
performance and to avoid the EPS targets acting as a disincentive 
to the growth investments which underpin the long-term growth 
strategy. The equivalent basic EPS figure for 2013 was 7.1p, and 
therefore the targets represented at the maximum approximately 
26-34% growth per annum, which the Committee believed to  
be stretching in the current environment particularly over 
performance periods which extended over three, four and  
five years. 44 Regus plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014

Nina Henderson was appointed as a Non-Executive Director with effect from  
20 May 2014. 
During 2014, the fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors were reviewed. The Chairman’s fee had not been 
increased since 2011 and the Non-Executive Director fees had  
not been increased since 2012. During that time, the financial 
scale and market capitalisation of the business has increased 
significantly. Therefore it was considered appropriate to  
increase some of the fees with effect from 2015 as set out  
in the following table.
2014 2015 Change
Non-Executive Chairman £165,000 £200,000 21%
Basic fee for Non-Executive 
Director £42,000 £50,000 19%

During the period 31st December 2014 to 3rd March 2015, Lance 
Browne acquired 3,738 shares. These acquired shares constitute

for the relevant period of service.

Percentage change in remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer
The table below shows the percentage change in remuneration  
of the Chief Executive Officer and Group support employees (on a  
per capita basis) between the year ending 31 December 2013  
and the year ending 31 December 2014. Given the significant 
scale and diversity of the overall global employee population,  
the Committee considers the Group support employees a more 
relevant comparison.

The graph right shows the TSR of Regus in the six year period to 
31 December 2014 against the TSR of the FTSE 350 (excluding 
investment trusts) and All Share Indices. TSR refers to share price 
growth and assumes dividends are reinvested over the relevant 
period. The Committee considers the FTSE 350 (excluding 
investment trusts) relevant since it is an index of companies of 
similar size to Regus.

Consideration of Directors’ remuneration – Remuneration 
Committee and advisors
Details of the composition of the Remuneration Committee are set 
out on page 38 of this report. The Committee’s terms of reference 
are freely available on the Company’s website: www.regus.com.
In addition to the designated members of the Remuneration 
Committee, the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Company 
Secretary also attended Committee meetings during the year 
although none were present during discussions concerning their 
own remuneration.
Deloitte LLP continued to provide independent advice to the 
Committee during the year. Deloitte was appointed by the 
Committee in 2010 following a competitive selection process 
undertaken by the Committee. The fees charged by Deloitte for 
the provision of independent advice to the Committee during 
2014 were £25,000. Deloitte also provided unrelated tax advice  
to Regus during 2014. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultant’s Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the 
code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting 
in the UK. With regard to remuneration advice, the Committee is 
comfortable that the Deloitte engagement partner and team are 
objective and independent.
Statement of voting at general meeting
The Committee is directly accountable to shareholders and, in 
this context, is committed to an open and transparent dialogue 
with shareholders on the issue of executive remuneration. The 
members of the Committee attend the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting and are available to answer shareholders’ questions 
about Directors’ remuneration. Votes cast by proxy and at the 
Annual General Meeting held on 20 May 2014 in respect of 
remunerated related resolutions are shown in the table.

Dominique Yates

Douglas Sutherland

Elmar Heggen 
Nina Henderson 
Florence Pierre 
Alex Sulkowski
Biographical details for the Directors are shown on pages  
26 and 27.
Details of the Directors’ interests and shareholdings are given  
in the Remuneration Report on pages 38 to 45.
The Corporate Responsibility Statement, Corporate Governance 
Statement, Audit Committee Report, Remuneration Report and 
Director Statements on pages 24 to 48 all form part of this report.
Principal activity
The Company is the world’s leading provider of global office 
outsourcing services.
Business review
The Directors have presented a Strategic Report as follows:
The Chief Executive Officer’s Review and Chief Financial Officer’s 
Review on pages 11 to 19 respectively address:
• review of the Company’s business (pages 11 to 15);
• trends and factors likely to affect the future development, 
performance and position of the business (pages 11 to 15);
• development and performance during the financial year  
(pages 16 to 19);
• employee development, performance and diversity  
(page 13); and
• position of the business at the end of the year (pages 17 to 19).
The Corporate Responsibility Report, on page 24, includes  
the sections of the Strategic Report in respect of:
• environmental matters; and
• social and community issues.
The Audit Committee report, on pages 35 to 37, includes a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing  
the Company.
The Directors’ Statements on page 48 includes the statutory 
statement in respect of disclosure to auditors.
The Directors do not consider any contractual or other 
relationships with external parties to be essential to the  
business of the Group.
Results and dividends
Profit before taxation for the year was £87.1m (2013: £81.5m).
The Directors are pleased to recommend a final dividend of 
£25.8m (2013: £23.6m), being 2.75 pence per share (2013: 2.5 
pence per share). The total dividend for the year will therefore be 
4 pence per share, made up of the interim dividend of 1.25 pence 
per share paid in October 2014 (2013: 1.1 pence per share) and, 
assuming the final dividend is approved by shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM, an additional 2.75 pence per share (2013: 2.5 
pence per share) which is expected to be paid on 29 May 2015  
to shareholders on the register at the close of business on  
1 May 2015.
Policy and practice on payment of creditors
The Group does not follow a universal code dealing specifically 
with payments to suppliers but, where appropriate, our  
practice is to: 
• agree the terms of payment upfront with the supplier;
• ensure that suppliers are made aware of these terms of 
payment; and
• pay in accordance with contractual and other legal obligations.
At 31 December 2014, the number of creditor days outstanding for 
the Group was 21 days (2013: 31 days) and for the Company was 
19 days (2013: 28 days).
Going concern
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the Accounts on pages 50 to 54.
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the financial 
statements, the Directors have considered the further information 
included in the business activities commentary as set out on pages 
11 to 15, as well as the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties as 
set out on pages 21 to 23. Based on the performance of the Group, 
its financial position and cash flows, the Board is satisfied that the 
Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
Further details on the going concern basis of preparation can be 
found in note 23 of the notes to the accounts on page 73.
Employees
The Group treats applicants for employment with disabilities with 
full and fair consideration according to their skills and capabilities.
Should an employee become disabled during their employment, 
efforts are made to retain them in their current employment or to 
explore opportunities for their retraining or redeployment 
elsewhere within the Group.
Political and charitable donations
It is the Group’s policy not to make political donations either  
in the UK or overseas. The Group made charitable donations  
of £155,329 during the year (2013: £80,500). Strategic report Governance Financial statements

Directors’ statements
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of 
the Annual Report and financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the parent company annual accounts in 
accordance with Luxembourg Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice and applicable law.
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and 
their profit or loss for the period.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company annual accounts, state whether 
applicable Luxembourg accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the parent company annual accounts; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and which disclose with reasonable accuracy at  
any time the financial position of the parent company and to 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
applicable law and regulations. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and  
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, a Remuneration 
Report and a Corporate Governance Statement that complies with 
that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s websites.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
Statutory statement as to disclosure to auditor
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ statements confirm that:
• so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
• each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
These financial statements have been approved by the Directors 
of the Company. The Directors confirm that the financial 
statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable  
law and regulations and that they include a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position  
of the parent company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of  
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
We, the Directors of the Company, confirm that to the best of  
our knowledge:
• the financial statements prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation as a whole; and
• the Directors’ Report, including content contained by reference, 
includes a fair review of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

REPORT OF THE RÉVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGRÉÉ 
Report on the consolidated financial statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements of Regus plc (société anonyme), which comprise  
the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2014 and  
the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, 
changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and  
a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information, as set out on pages 50 to 89. 
Board of Directors’ responsibility for the consolidated 
financial statements  
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and  
fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control 
as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free  
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Responsibility of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated 
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit 
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing as 
adopted for Luxembourg by the Commission de Surveillance du 
Secteur Financier. Those standards require that we comply with 
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial 
statements are free from material misstatement. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements. The procedures selected depend on the judgement 
of the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk 
assessments, the Réviseur d’Entreprises agréé considers internal 
control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation 
of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of 
Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
consolidated financial statements.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
Opinion 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements, as set out  
on pages 50 to 89, give a true and fair view of the consolidated 
financial position of Regus plc (société anonyme) as of  
31 December 2014, and of its consolidated financial performance 
and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union. 
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements 
The consolidated Directors’ report, including the corporate 
governance statement, which is the responsibility of the Board  
of Directors, is consistent with the consolidated financial 
statements and includes the information required by the law  
with respect to the Corporate Governance Statement.

At 31 December 2014 treasury shares represent 12,883,455 (2013: 5,257,380) ordinary shares of the Group that were acquired for the 
purposes of the Group’s employee share option plans and the share buy-back programme. During the period, 9,484,516 shares were

The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements 
of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures.  
The revaluation reserve arose on the restatement of the assets and liabilities of the UK associate from historic to fair value at the time 
of the acquisition of the outstanding 58% interest on 19 April 2006. 
Other reserves include £37.9m arising from the Scheme of Arrangement undertaken on 14 October 2008, £6.5m relating to merger

1. Authorisation of financial statements 
The Group and Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 were authorised for issue by the Board of 
Directors on 3 March 2015 and the balance sheets were signed on the Board’s behalf by Mark Dixon and Dominique Yates. Regus plc 
S.A. is a public limited company incorporated in Jersey and registered and domiciled in Luxembourg. The Company’s ordinary shares 
are traded on the London Stock Exchange. 
Regus plc S.A. owns a network of business centres which are leased to a variety of business customers. Information on the  
Group’s structure is provided in note 31, and information on other related party relationships of the Group is provided in note 30. 
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company prepares its parent Company annual 
accounts in accordance with Luxembourg GAAP; extracts from these are presented on pages 90 and 91. 
2. Accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’)  
and equity account the Group’s interest in the associate and jointly controlled entities. The extract from the parent Company annual 
accounts presents information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group. 
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements. 
Amendments to adopted IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) with an effective date from 1 January 2014 did not have a material effect on the Group 
financial statements, unless otherwise indicated. 
The following standards, interpretations and amendments to standards were adopted by the Group for periods commencing on  
1 January 2014: 
IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions – Amendments to IAS 19
IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (Revised) (and subsequent amendments)
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (Revised)
IAS 32 Amendments to IAS 32 – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
IAS 36 Amendments to IAS 36 – Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets
IAS 39 Amendments to IAS 39 – Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements (and subsequent amendments)
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements (and subsequent amendments)
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities (and subsequent amendments)
IFRIC 21 Levies 
Various Annual Improvements (2010 – 2012 Cycle)
Various Annual Improvements (2011 – 2013 Cycle)
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the consolidated 
financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 32. 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, with the exception of certain financial assets and 
liabilities that are measured at fair value as described in note 23. 
The Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements on pages 50 to 89. 
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Directors have considered the further 
information included in the business activities commentary as set out on pages 11 to 13 as well as the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties as set out on pages 20 to 23. 
Further details on the going concern basis of preparation can be found in note 23 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on page 73. 
These Group consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling (£), which is Regus plc’s functional currency, and all 
values are in million pounds, rounded to one decimal place, except where indicated otherwise. 
The attributable results of those companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership. 
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.  
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on  
an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases or  
the associate qualifies as a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and 
carrying value.  
Joint ventures include jointly controlled entities that are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, whereby  
the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. 
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of jointly controlled entities 
on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases or the jointly 
controlled entity qualifies as a disposal group at which point the investment is carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell  
and carrying value.

2. Accounting policies (continued) 
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in a joint venture, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition 
of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments 
on behalf of a joint venture. 
On 19 April 2006 the Group acquired the remaining 58% of the shares of the UK business that were not already owned by the Group. 
As a result the Group fully consolidated the UK business from that date. The acquisition was accounted for through the purchase 
method and as a consequence the entire assets and liabilities of the UK business were revalued to fair value. The effect of these 
adjustments on the 42% of the UK business already owned was reflected in the revaluation reserve. 
On 14 October 2008, Regus plc acquired the entire share capital of Regus Group plc in exchange for the issue of new shares of Regus 
plc on the basis of one share in Regus plc for one share held previously in Regus Group plc. At the date of the transaction, Regus plc 
had nominal assets and liabilities and therefore the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of Regus plc by Regus 
Group plc. Consequently, no fair value acquisition adjustments were required and the aggregate of the Group reserves have been 
attributed to Regus plc. 
IFRSs not yet effective 
The following IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements as they are 
effective for years beginning on or after 1 January 2015 or have not yet been endorsed by the European Union. Their adoption is not 
expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements: 
IAS 16 Revaluation method – proportionate restatement of accumulated depreciation – Amendments to IAS 16 1 January 2016
IAS 38 Revaluation method – proportionate restatement of accumulated amortisation – Amendments to IAS 38 1 January 2016
IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations – Amendments to IFRS 11 1 January 2016
IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts 1 January 2016
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2017
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
The Group did not adopt any standards, interpretations and amendments to standards which were available for optional early 
adoption and relevant to the Group. The Group will adopt the above standards or amendments in the year in which they become 
effective and/or endorsed by the European Union, whichever is later.  
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has the 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control 
commences. The results are consolidated until the date control ceases or the subsidiary qualifies as a disposal group, at which point 
the assets and liabilities are carried at the lower of fair value less costs to sell and carrying value. 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets other than deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
For goodwill, intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the 
recoverable amount was estimated at 31 October 2014. At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of its non-
financial assets to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment. If any indicator is identified, then the assets’ recoverable 
amount is re-evaluated. 
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the cash-generating unit and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.  
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the 
cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. 
Calculation of recoverable amount 
The recoverable amount of relevant assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in  
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent 
cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Goodwill 
All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess  
of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest 
held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the 
aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of  
the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the  
re-assessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then  
the gain is recognised in profit or loss.  
Positive goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for impairment in value. An impairment test is carried out annually and, in 
addition, whenever indicators exist that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Positive goodwill is allocated to cash-generating 
units for the purpose of impairment testing. 
Business combinations that took place prior to the Group’s transition date to IFRS on 1 January 2004 have not been restated under  
the requirements of IFRS.    www.regus.com 57

Governance Financial statements Strategic report
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately from the business are capitalised at cost. Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition  
of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill if their fair value can be identified and measured reliably on initial recognition. 
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows: 
Brand – Regus brand Indefinite life
Brand – Other acquired brands 20 years
Computer software  5 years
Customer lists 2 years
Management agreements Minimum duration of the contract
Amortisation of intangible assets is expensed through administration expenses in the income statement. 
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests 
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no 
goodwill is recognised as a result. Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of 
control are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. 
Assets held for sale 
Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying value of the identified assets and its fair value less cost to sell. 
Leases 
Plant and equipment leases for which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as 
finance leases. All other leases, including all of the Group’s property leases, are categorised as operating leases. 
Finance leases 
Plant and equipment acquired by way of a finance lease is capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of its fair value 
and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception. Future payments under finance leases are included in creditors, 
net of any future finance charges. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the 
outstanding liability. Finance charges are recognised in the income statement over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Operating leases 
Minimum lease payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Lease incentives and rent free periods are included in the calculation of minimum lease payments. The commencement of the lease 
term is the date from which the Group is entitled to use the leased asset. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease, 
together with any further periods for which the Group has the option to continue to lease the asset and when at the inception of the 
lease it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise that option. 
Contingent rentals include rent increases based on future inflation indices or non-guaranteed rental payments based on centre 
turnover or profitability and are excluded from the calculation of minimum lease payments. Contingent rentals are recognised in the 
income statement as they are incurred. 
Onerous lease provisions are an estimate of the net amounts payable under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted 
at an appropriate pre-tax rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows:  
Buildings 50 years
Fixtures and fittings 10 years
Furniture  10 years
Office equipment and telephones 5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Computer hardware 3 – 5 years
Revenue 
Revenue from the provision of services to customers is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable (excluding 
sales taxes). Where rent free periods are granted to customers, rental income is spread on a straight-line basis over the length of the 
customer contract. 
Workstations 
Workstation revenue is recognised when the provision of the service is rendered. Amounts invoiced in advance are deferred and 
recognised as revenue upon provision of the service. 
Customer service income 
Service income (including the rental of meeting rooms) is recognised as services are rendered. In circumstances where Regus acts  
as an agent for the sale and purchase of goods to customers, only the commission fee earned is recognised as revenue. 
Management and franchise fees 
Fees received for the provision of initial and subsequent services are recognised as revenue as the services are rendered. Fees 
charged for the use of continuing rights granted by the agreement, or for other services provided during the period of the agreement, 
are recognised as revenue as the services are provided or the rights used.

2. Accounting policies (continued) 
Membership card income 
Revenue from the sale of membership cards is deferred and recognised over the period that the benefits of the membership card  
are expected to be provided. 
These categories represent all material sources of revenue earned from the provision of global workplace solutions. 
Employee benefits 
The Group’s major pension plans are of the defined contribution type. For these plans the Group’s contribution and other paid and 
unpaid benefits earned by the employees are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method. 
Re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding net interest and the return on plan 
assets, excluding net interest, are recognised immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit 
to retained earnings through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not 
reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. 
Service costs are recognised in profit or loss, and include current and past service costs as well as gains and losses on curtailments. 
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognises the following 
changes in the net defined benefit obligation under ‘cost of sales’, ‘selling, general and administration expenses’ and ‘research and 
development expenses’ in the consolidated income statement: service costs comprising current service costs; past-service costs; and 
gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements. 
Settlements of defined benefit schemes are recognised in the period in which the settlement occurs. 
Share-based payments 
The share option programme entitles certain employees and Directors to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company; these 
awards are granted by the ultimate parent. 
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is 
measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.  
The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model or the Monte Carlo method, taking into 
accounts the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture  
is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. 
Share appreciation rights (CIP) are also granted by the Company to certain employees. The fair value of the amount payable to the 
employee is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is initially recognised at grant date  
and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The fair value of the share 
appreciation rights is measured based on the Monte Carlo valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the instruments were granted.  
Taxation 
Tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that  
it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial 
recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a 
business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised for all unused tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which the asset can be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past  
event that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Restructuring provisions are made for direct expenditures of a business reorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and 
well advanced and where the appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date. 
Provision is made for onerous contracts to the extent that the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed 
the economic benefits expected to be delivered, discounted using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital.

Net finance expenses 
Interest charges and income are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis. Financing transaction costs that relate  
to financial liabilities are charged to interest expense using the effective interest rate method and are recognised within the carrying 
value of the related financial liability on the balance sheet. Fees paid for the arrangement of credit facilities are recognised as a 
prepayment and recognised through the finance expense over the term of the facility. In the event of a facility being drawn the 
relevant unamortised portion of the fee is recognised within the carrying value of the financial liability and charged to the interest 
expense using the effective interest rate method. 
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are carried at net present value, the increase in the amount due to unwinding 
the discount is recognised as a finance expense or finance income as appropriate. 
Costs arising on bank guarantees and letters of credit and foreign exchange gains or losses are included in other finance costs  
(note 7). 
Interest bearing borrowings and other financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities, including interest bearing borrowings, are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption 
value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate method. 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired. 
Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss where the liability is either held for trading 
or is designated as held at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
are stated at fair value with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement. 
Financial assets 
Financial assets are classified either at fair value through profit or loss, held to maturity investments, available for sale financial 
assets or loans and receivables. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined  
on initial recognition. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value and changes therein, including any interest or dividend 
income, are recognised in profit or loss. 
Held-to-maturity financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent 
to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised costs using the effective interest rate method.  
Available for sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent  
to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein, other than impairment losses and foreign currency 
differences on debt instruments, are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the fair value reserve. When these assets are 
derecognised, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss. 
Trade and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified  
as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when recognition 
would be immaterial. 
Foreign currency transactions and foreign operations 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets  
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the closing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the 
gains or losses on translation are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. The results and cash flows  
of foreign operations are translated using the average rate for the period. Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value 
adjustments, of foreign operations are translated using the closing rate with all exchange differences arising on consolidation being 
recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. Exchange differences 
are released to the income statement on disposal. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group’s policy on the use of derivative financial instruments can be found in note 23. Derivative financial instruments are 
measured initially at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognised through profit or loss unless the derivative financial 
instrument has been designated as a cash flow hedge whereby the effective portion of changes in the fair value are deferred in equity.

3. Segmental analysis – statutory basis 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses, including those that relate to transactions with other operating segments. An operating segment’s results are reviewed 
regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Board of Directors of the Group) to make decisions about resources to be 
allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. 
The business is run on a worldwide basis but managed through four principal geographical segments: Americas; Europe, Middle  
East and Africa (EMEA); Asia Pacific; and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom segment does not include the Group’s non-trading 
holding and corporate management companies that are based in the UK and the EMEA segment does not include the Group’s non-
trading head office and holding companies that are based in Luxembourg and Switzerland. The results of business centres in each  
of these regions form the basis for reporting geographical results to the chief operating decision maker. All reportable segments are 
involved in the provision of global workplace solutions. 
The Group’s reportable segments operate in different markets and are managed separately because of the different economic 
characteristics that exist in each of those markets. Each reportable segment has its own discrete senior management team 
responsible for the performance of the segment. 
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the Annual Report and Accounts for Regus plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2013. The performance of each segment is assessed on the basis of the segment operating profit 
which excludes internal revenue, corporate overheads and foreign exchange gains and losses arising on transactions with other 
operating segments.

Revenue in the other segmental category is generated from services related to the provision of workplace solutions including fees 
earned from franchise agreements and commissions earned from the sale of outsourced workplace solution products. Revenue from 
internal customers is determined by reference to current market prices. 
4. Segmental analysis – entity-wide disclosures 
The Group’s primary activity and only business segment is the provision of global workplace solutions and therefore all revenue is 
attributed to a single group of similar products and services. It is not meaningful to separate this group into further categories of 
products. Revenue is recognised where the service is provided. 
The Group has a diversified customer base and no single customer contributes a material percentage of the Group’s revenue. 
The Group’s revenue from external customers and non-current assets analysed by foreign country is as follows:

is a legally enforceable right to set off and they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority. 
Deferred tax assets recognised on short-term temporary differences consist predominantly of provisions deductible when paid and 
share-based payments. Deferred tax assets have been recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities on the basis that there are 
forecast taxable profits in the entities concerned. 
At the balance sheet date, the temporary difference arising from unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries was £249.8m  
(2013: £150.8m). The only tax that would arise on these reserves would be non-creditable withholding tax.

The indefinite lived intangible asset relates to the brand value arising from the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business  
in the year ended 31 December 2006 (see note 12). 
The value in use for each CGU has been determined using a model which derives the individual value in use for each unit from the  
value in use of the Group as a whole. Although the model includes budgets and forecasts prepared by management it also reflects 
external factors, such as capital market risk pricing as reflected in the market capitalisation of the Group and prevailing tax rates,  
which have been used to determine the risk adjusted discount rate for the Group. Management believes that the projected cash  
flows are a reasonable reflection of the likely outcomes over the medium to long term. In the event that trading conditions deteriorate 
beyond the assumptions used in the projected cash flows, it is also possible that impairment charges could arise in future periods. 
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each group of CGUs: 
• Future cash flows are based on the budget for 2014 approved by the Board. The model excludes cost savings and restructurings  
that are anticipated but had not been committed to at the date of the determination of the value in use. Thereafter forecasts have 
been prepared by management for a further four years from 2014 that reflect an average annual growth rate of 3% (2013: 3%).  
• These forecasts exclude the impact of both organic and acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods. Management 
consider these projections to be a reasonable projection of margins expected at the mid-cycle position. Cash flows beyond 2018 
have been extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which management believes is a reasonable long-term growth rate for any of the 
markets in which the relevant CGUs operate. A terminal value is included in the assessment reflecting the Group’s expectation  
that it will continue to operate in these markets and the long-term nature of the businesses. 
• The Group applies a country specific pre-tax discount rate to the pre-tax cash flows for each CGU. The country specific discount rate 
is based on the underlying weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the Group. The Group WACC is then adjusted for each CGU  
to reflect the assessed market risk specific to that country. The Group pre-tax WACC decreased marginally from 13.6% in 2013 to 
12.4% in 2014 (post-tax WACC: 10.0%). The CGU specific pre-tax WACC reflecting the respective market risk adjustment has been 
set between 11.3% and 17.2% (2013: 12.3% to 18.6%). 
The amount by which the value in use exceeds the carrying amount of the CGUs are sufficiently large to enable the Directors to 
conclude that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge in any of the CGUs. 
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a significant nature as to result in the cash-generating 
units carrying amount exceeding their recoverable amount. The forecast models used in assessing the impairment of goodwill are 
based on the related business centre structure at the end of the year. These models therefore do not reflect the expected 
improvement in margin as new centres mature. 
The key assumptions used in the US model forecasts a centre contribution of 22%, with an average centre contribution of 22% over 
the next five years. Revenue and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2014 maintaining a terminal 2019 centre gross margin of 22%. 
Thereafter a 2% long-term growth rate is assumed on revenue and cost into perpetuity. The cash flows have been discounted using  
a pre-tax discount rate of 15% (2013: 17%). 
The UK model forecasts a 2015 centre contribution of 24%, with an average centre contribution of 24% over the next five years. 
Revenue and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2014 maintaining a terminal 2019 centre gross margin of 24%. Thereafter a 2%  
long-term growth rate is assumed on revenue and cost into perpetuity. The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount 
rate of 13% (2013: 14%). 
Management has considered the following sensitivities: 
Market growth and WIPOW – Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and WIPOW. The value in use 
calculation shows that if the long-term growth rate was reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of the US and UK CGUs would still be 
greater than their carrying value. 
Discount rate – Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the calculation. The value-in-use 
calculation shows that for the recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than its carrying value, the pre-tax discount rate would have 
to be increased to 23% (2013: 22%) for the US CGU and 35% (2013: 22%) for the UK CGU.

• These forecasts exclude the impact of both organic and acquisitive growth expected to take place in future periods. Management 
consider these projections to be a reasonable projection of margins expected at the mid-cycle position. Cash flows beyond 2018 
have been extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which management believes is a reasonable long-term growth rate for any of the 
markets in which the relevant CGUs operate. A terminal value is included in the assessment reflecting the Group’s expectation  
that it will continue to operate in these markets and the long-term nature of the businesses. 
• The Group applies a country specific pre-tax discount rate to the pre-tax cash flows for each CGU. The country specific discount rate 
is based on the underlying weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the Group. The Group WACC is then adjusted for each CGU  
to reflect the assessed market risk specific to that country. The Group pre-tax WACC decreased marginally from 13.6% in 2013 to 
12.4% in 2014 (post-tax WACC: 10.0%). The CGU specific pre-tax WACC reflecting the respective market risk adjustment has been 
set between 11.3% and 17.2% (2013: 12.3% to 18.6%). 
The amount by which the value in use exceeds the carrying amount of the CGUs are sufficiently large to enable the Directors to 
conclude that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not result in an impairment charge in any of the CGUs. 
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of such a significant nature as to result in the cash-generating 
units carrying amount exceeding their recoverable amount. The forecast models used in assessing the impairment of goodwill are 
based on the related business centre structure at the end of the year. These models therefore do not reflect the expected 
improvement in margin as new centres mature. 
The key assumptions used in the US model forecasts a centre contribution of 22%, with an average centre contribution of 22% over 
the next five years. Revenue and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2014 maintaining a terminal 2019 centre gross margin of 22%. 
Thereafter a 2% long-term growth rate is assumed on revenue and cost into perpetuity. The cash flows have been discounted using  
a pre-tax discount rate of 15% (2013: 17%). 
The UK model forecasts a 2015 centre contribution of 24%, with an average centre contribution of 24% over the next five years. 
Revenue and costs grow at 3% per annum from 2014 maintaining a terminal 2019 centre gross margin of 24%. Thereafter a 2%  
long-term growth rate is assumed on revenue and cost into perpetuity. The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount 
rate of 13% (2013: 14%). 
Management has considered the following sensitivities: 
Market growth and WIPOW – Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and WIPOW. The value in use 
calculation shows that if the long-term growth rate was reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of the US and UK CGUs would still be 
greater than their carrying value. 
Discount rate – Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the calculation. The value-in-use 
calculation shows that for the recoverable amount of the CGU to be less than its carrying value, the pre-tax discount rate would have 
to be increased to 23% (2013: 22%) for the US CGU and 35% (2013: 22%) for the UK CGU.

Included with the brand value is £11.2m relating to the acquisition of the remaining 58% of the UK business in the year ended  
31 December 2006. The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indefinite useful life due to the fact that the 
value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group. 
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indefinite useful life no amortisation is charged but the 
carrying value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis. The brand was tested at the balance sheet date against the recoverable 
amount of the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business (see note 11). 
The remaining amortisation life for non-indefinite life brands is 10 years.

Governance Financial statements Strategic report
Going concern 
The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 25 of the Annual Report and Accounts sets out the Group’s strategy and the factors that are  
likely to affect the future performance and position of the business. The financial review on pages 16 to 19 within the Strategic Report 
reviews the trading performance, financial position and cash flows of the Group. During the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group 
made a significant investment in growth and the Group’s net debt position increased by £80.8m to a net debt position of £138.0m as 
at 31 December 2014. The investment in growth is funded by a combination of cash flow generated from the Group’s mature business 
centres and debt. The Group has a £320m revolving credit facility provided by a group of relationship banks with a final maturity in 
2017. As at 31 December 2014 £256.6m was available and undrawn. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in  
operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the  
Annual Report and Accounts. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a financial instrument and arises 
principally in relation to customer contracts and the Group’s cash deposits. 
A diversified customer base, requirement for customer deposits, and payments in advance on workstation contracts minimise the 
Group’s exposure to customer credit risk. No single customer contributes a material percentage of the Group’s revenue. The Group’s 
policy is to provide against trade receivables when specific debts are judged to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures 
have commenced. A provision is created where debts are more than three months overdue which reflects the Group’s historical 
experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables. These provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess 
changes in the likelihood of recoverability. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, analysed by geographic region, is summarised below.

At the year end 31 December 2014, the Group maintained a provision of £8.3m against potential bad debts (2013: £7.0m) arising  
from trade receivables. The Group had provided £4.5m (2013: £1.1m) in the year and utilised £2.5m (2013: £0.5m). Customer deposits 
of £290.4m (2013: £239.5m) are held by the Group, mitigating the risk of default. 
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority  
of its revenue in advance of the provision of office services and requires deposits from its customers.  
Cash investments and derivative financial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and 
management does not expect any of these counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.  
Liquidity risk 
The Group manages liquidity risk by closely monitoring the global cash position, the available and undrawn credit facilities, and 
forecast capital expenditure and expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group has 
free cash and liquid investments (excluding blocked cash) of £55.2m (2013: £63.3m). In addition to cash and liquid investments, the 
Group had £256.6m available and undrawn under its committed borrowings. The Directors consider the Group has adequate liquidity 
to meet day-to-day requirements. 
In May 2014 the Group issued debt securities for a total amount of EUR 210.0m (£163.6m) using the German “Schuldschein” 
framework for debt issuance. These securities consisted of EUR 165.0m of three year notes and EUR 45.0m of five year notes,  
and were sold to a number of banks and institutional investors. 
The Group maintains a £320m revolving credit facility with a final maturity date in September 2017. As at 31 December £256.6m  
was available and undrawn under this facility.

23. Financial instruments and financial risk management (continued) 
Although the Group has net current liabilities of £303.9m (2013: £289.1m), the Group does not consider that this gives rise to a 
liquidity risk. A large proportion of the net current liabilities comprise non-cash liabilities such as deferred income which will be 
recognised in future periods through the income statement. Although the Group holds customer deposits of £290.4m (2013: £239.5m) 
these are spread across a large number of customers and no deposit held for an individual customer is material. Therefore the Group 
does not believe the balance represents a liquidity risk. The net current liabilities, excluding deferred income, were £98.6m at 31 
December 2014 (2013: £109.3m).  
Market risk 
The Group is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and the market value of  
our investments in financial assets. These exposures are actively managed by the Group treasury department in accordance with  
a written policy approved by the Board of Directors. The Group does not use financial derivatives for trading or speculative reasons. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the relative proportions of fixed rate debt and floating rate debt. The 
surplus cash balances are invested short term, and at the end of 2014 no cash was invested for a period exceeding three months.  
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate movements. The majority of day-to-day transactions of overseas subsidiaries 
are carried out in local currency and the underlying foreign exchange exposure is small. Transactional exposures do arise in some 
countries where it is local market practice for a proportion of the payables or receivables to be in other than the functional currency  
of the affiliate. Intercompany charging, funding and cash management activity may also lead to foreign exchange exposures.  
It is the policy of the Group to seek to minimise such transactional exposures through careful management of non-local currency  
assets and liabilities, thereby minimising the potential volatility in the income statement. Net investments in Regus affiliates with a 
functional currency other than pound sterling are of a long-term nature and the Group does not normally hedge such foreign currency 
translation exposures. 
From time to time the Group uses short-term derivative financial instruments to manage its transactional foreign exchange  
exposures where these exposures cannot be eliminated through balancing the underlying risks. No transactions of a speculative 
nature are undertaken. 
The foreign currency exposure arising from open third party transactions held in a currency other than the functional currency of the 
related entity is summarised as follows: 
2014 
£m GBP JPY EUR USD
Trade and other receivables 0.1 – 5.7 11.4
Loans – – (7.0) –
Trade and other payables (0.9) (2.2) (26.9) (12.9)
Net statement of financial position exposure (0.8) (2.2) (28.2) (1.5)
 
2013 
£m GBP JPY EUR USD
Trade and other receivables – – 4.9 13.0
Loans – – – –
Trade and other payables (0.3) (3.5) (6.7) (12.0)
Net statement of financial position exposure (0.3) (3.5) (1.8) 1.0
Other market risks 
The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices  
in the income statement. 
Sensitivity analysis 
For the year ending 31 December 2014 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have 
theoretically decreased the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £0.9m (2013: decrease of £0.2m) with a corresponding 
increase in total equity. 
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against pound sterling would have theoretically 
decreased the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £3.1m for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: £3.3m). It is estimated 
that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against pound sterling would have decreased the Group’s profit before 
tax by approximately £0.1m for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: decrease of £0.1m). 
It is estimated that a five percentage point weakening in the value of the US dollar against pound sterling would have theoretically 
decreased the Group’s total equity by approximately £11.7m for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: £12.6m). It is estimated that 
a five percentage point weakening in the value of the euro against pound sterling would have decreased the Group’s total equity by 
approximately £6.4m for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: £0.4m).

During the years ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, there were no transfers between levels for fair value measured 
instruments, and no financial instruments requiring level 3 fair value measurements were held. 
Valuation techniques 
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible. Fair values are 
categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: 
• Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; 
and 
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. 
The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring level 2 and level 3 fair values, as well as the significant 
unobservable inputs used: 
Type Valuation technique
Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other 
receivables/payables and customer deposits 
For cash and cash equivalents, receivables/payables with a remaining life of 
less than one year and customer deposits, the book value approximates the 
fair value because of their short-term nature. 
Finance lease liabilities The fair value of finance leases has been calculated by discounting future 
cash flows at an appropriate discount rate which reflects current market 
assessments and the risks specific to such liabilities. 
Loans and overdrafts The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates the 
carrying value because interest rates are at floating rates where payments  
are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year. 
Foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps The fair values are based on a combination of broker quotes, forward pricing 
and swap models. 
There was no significant unobservable input used in our valuation techniques.

In May 2014 the Group issued debt securities for a total amount of EUR 210.0m (£163.6m) using the German “Schuldschein” 
framework for debt issuance. These securities consisted of EUR 165.0m of three year notes and EUR 45.0m of five year notes, and  
were sold to a number of banks and institutional investors. These securities are subject to covenants which are similar to our banking 
facilities. The Group is in compliance with these covenant requirements. 
The underlying interest obligation on these debt securities is floating rate and in Euro, however, as part of the Group’s balance sheet 
management and to protect against a future increase in interest rates, EUR 165.0 million was swapped into a fixed rate GBP liability 
and EUR 45.0 million was swapped into a fixed rate Euro liability. While providing the Group with protection against higher interest 
rates, given the current positive yield curve, the immediate impact of this hedging is a modest increase in financing expense.   
The Group maintains a £320m revolving credit facility and a £95m bank guarantee and letter of credit facility both with a final  
maturity in September 2017. Both facilities are subject to financial covenants relating to operating cash flow, net debt to EBITDA,  
and EBITDA plus rent to interest plus rent. The Group is in compliance with all covenant requirements. 
24. Share-based payment 
There are two share-based payment plans, details of which are outlined below: 
Plan 1: Regus Group Share Option Plan 
During 2004 the Group established the Regus Group Share Option Plan that entitles Executive Directors and certain employees to 
purchase shares in Regus plc (previously Regus Group plc). In accordance with this programme, holders of vested options are entitled 
to purchase shares at the market price of the shares at the day before the date of grant. 
The Regus Group also operates the Regus Group Share Option Plan (France) which is included within the numbers for the Regus Share 
Option Plan disclosed above. The terms of the Regus Share Option Plan (France) are materially the same as the Regus Group Share 
Option Plan with the exception that they are only exercisable from the fourth anniversary of the date of grant assuming the 
performance conditions have been met.

Valuation techniques 
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible. Fair values are 
categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: 
• Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; 
and 
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. 
The following tables show the valuation techniques used in measuring level 2 and level 3 fair values, as well as the significant 
unobservable inputs used:

Plan 2: Regus plc Co-Investment Plan (CIP) and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The CIP operates in conjunction with the annual bonus whereby a gross bonus of up to 50% of basic annual salary will be taken as a 
deferred amount of shares (“Investment Shares”) to be released at the end of a defined period of not less than three years, with the 
balance paid in cash. Awards of Matching Shares are linked to the number of Investment Shares awarded and will vest depending on 
the Company’s future performance. The maximum number of Matching Shares which can be awarded to a participant in any calendar 
year under the CIP is 200% of salary. As such the maximum number of Matching Shares which can be awarded, based on Investment 
Shares awarded, is in the ratio of 4:1. 
The LTIP provides for the Remuneration Committee to make stand-alone long-term incentive awards without reference to the annual 
bonus up to a maximum of 100% of salary per calendar year.

(a) The LTIP awards have a release date of 23 March 2013. There is no expiry date and therefore remaining contractual life is on the basis that the awards release 
immediately. The LTIP options have a vesting date of 23 March 2013 and an expiry of 23 March 2020. The performance conditions are set out below. 
(b) The CIP Matching Shares and Share Option Plan awards made in 2008 and 2009 did not have performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee  
at the date of the award. A valuation was performed for those awards based on the terms that applied to similar awards made in previous years. The 
Remuneration Committee set the performance conditions for the awards made in 2008 and 2009 effective from 22 March 2010 and the valuation of these 
awards was updated in the year ended 31 December 2010. 
It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently 
in determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion. The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets 
must have been met on a run rate or underlying basis. As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated designed to assess the 
underlying performance of the business. 
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees fit at the time, by way of example, the following 
adjustments may be considered for the 2008 and 2009 grants: 
• In a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive profits in future years. Thus it is important  
to ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year. Accordingly, those 
costs, incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth, will be excluded from the EPS calculation. 
These would include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current 
year losses from investing in new locations. 
• Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded. 
• It is expected that in the relevant periods the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised, thereby increasing 
progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target. This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise deferred 
tax assets as the business strengthens reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next. To provide 
greater clarity and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%. 
• The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and performance targets are a transparent and accurate measure of  
the Company’s performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long-term shareholder value. In addition,  
the TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Company’s return to shareholders is 
competitive compared to comparable companies. 
The performance conditions are as follows: 
2008 and 2009 CIP Investment and matching grants 
The Remuneration Committee agreed to the following modifications to the awards made in 2008 and 2009 and that the following 
performance conditions would apply to these awards effective from 22 March 2010. 
The total number of matching awards made in 2008 and 2009 to each participant was divided into three separate equal amounts and 
was subject to future performance periods of three, four and five years respectively. Thus, conditional on meeting the performance 
targets, the first amount vested in March 2013, the second vested in March 2014 and the third vests in March 2015. These vesting 
dates relate to the financial years ending 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014 respectively. The vesting of 
these awards is subject to the achievement of challenging corporate performance targets. 75% of each of the three amounts is subject 
to defined earnings per share (EPS) targets over the respective performance periods. The remaining 25% of each will be subject to 
relative total shareholder return (TSR) targets over the respective periods. The targets are as follows:

The goodwill arising on the above acquisitions reflects the anticipated future benefits Regus can obtain from operating the 
businesses more efficiently, primarily through increasing occupancy and the addition of value adding products and services.  
£13.3m of the above goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
If the above acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2014, the revenue and net retained profit arising from these acquisitions  
would have been £18.7m and £2.4m respectively. In the year the equity acquisitions contributed revenue of £16.0m and net  
retained loss of £1.2m. 
There was £1.7 contingent consideration arising on the above acquisitions. 
The acquisition costs associated with these transactions were £1.3m, recorded within administration expenses within the 
consolidated income statement. 
The Group continued to complete acquisition transactions subsequent to 31 December 2014, which will be accounted for in 
accordance with IFRS 3. Due to the timing of these transactions, it is not practical to disclose the information associated with the 
initial accounting for these acquisitions.  
During the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group made the following acquisitions:

32. Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements and 
assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. 
Fair value accounting for business combinations 
For each business combination, we assess the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired. Where there is not an active market in the 
category of the non-current assets typically acquired with a business centre or where the books and records of the acquired company 
do not provide sufficient information to derive an accurate valuation, management calculates an estimated fair value based on 
available information and experience.  
The main categories of acquired non-current assets where management’s judgement has an impact on the amounts recorded include 
tangible fixed assets, customer list intangibles and the fair market value of leasehold assets and liabilities. For significant business 
combinations management also obtains third-party valuations to provide additional guidance as to the appropriate valuation to be 
included in the financial statements.  
Valuation of intangibles and goodwill 
We evaluate the fair value of goodwill and intangibles to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an 
event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the carrying 
value of goodwill at the appropriate cash-generating unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections, 
which assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying 
value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated recoverable amount. Further details of the methodology and assumptions 
applied to the impairment review in the year ended 31 December 2013, including the sensitivity to changes in those assumptions,  
can be found in note 11. 
Tax assets and liabilities 
We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and  
other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing laws and rates, and their related interpretations, and future business 
results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred 
tax consequences represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting 
estimates. It is current Group policy to recognise a deferred tax asset when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the assets can be used. The Group considers it probable if the entity has made a taxable profit in the previous year and 
is forecast to continue to make a profit in the foreseeable future. Where appropriate, the Group assesses the potential risk of future 
tax liabilities arising from the operation of its business in multiple tax jurisdictions and includes provisions within tax liabilities for 
those risks that can be estimated reliably. Changes in existing tax laws can affect large international groups similar to Regus and 
could result in significant additional tax liabilities over and above those already provided for. 
Onerous lease provisions 
We have identified certain poor performing centres where the lease is considered onerous, i.e. the Group does not expect to recover 
the unavoidable lease costs up to the first break point. The accounts include a provision for our estimate of the net amounts payable 
under the terms of the lease to the first break point, discounted at the Group weighted average cost of capital, where appropriate. 
Dilapidations 
Certain of our leases with landlords include a clause obliging the Group to hand the property back in the condition as at the date  
of signing the lease. The costs to bring the property back to that condition are not known until the Group exits the property so the 
Group estimates the costs at each balance sheet date. However, given that landlords often regard the nature of changes made  
to properties as improvements, the Group estimates that it is unlikely that any material dilapidation payments will be necessary. 
Consequently, provision has been made only for those potential dilapidation payments when it is probable that an outflow will  
occur and can be reliably estimated.   www.regus.com 89

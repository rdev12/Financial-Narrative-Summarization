Gujarat-Saurashtra Basin
Located in the relatively shallow  
waters off the west coast of India  
the Gujarat-Saurashtra Basin has  
many significant producing oil and  
gas fields. The Company’s licence is 
held via the Dhirubhai 31 gas 
discovery. A Declaration of 
Commerciality proposal has been 
submitted to the GOI for their review 
and adoption.
Krishna Godavari Basin
Located on the east coast of India,  
the KG basin is regarded as the 
most prolific gas basin in India. It is a 
proven oil and gas province with the 
world class D6 gas development 
and a number of significant 
producing oil fields (Ravva, MA).  
The Company has an interest in two 
blocks (D3 and D9) within the KG 
Basin. To date the Company has 
drilled six wells in the basin resulting 
in four consecutive natural gas 
discoveries on the D3 block.
Cauvery Basin
The Cauvery Basin is located in the 
south east of India. The basin is a 
proven oil and gas province. Hardy 
has interests in two licences (PY-3 
and CY-OS/2) within this basin. 
PY-3 field commenced production  
in 1997 and has produced over  
24 mmbbl. The Company believes 
that it can recover a further 
21 mmbbls with the drilling 
of additional wells.

Chairman
Overview
During 2011, the Company accomplished a number 
of objectives. The exploration programme on the 
Company’s two blocks in the Krishna Godavari 
Basin progressed by concluding the drilling of two 
further exploration wells. As a result of this activity, 
we announced the first gas discovery in the D9 
block. The D3 joint venture submitted a Declaration 
of Commerciality proposal for the Dhirubhai 39, 
41 and 52 discoveries on the D3 block to the 
Government of India (GOI) for review. The 
GS-01 joint venture adopted the Declaration 
of Commerciality proposal for the Dhirubhai 
33 discovery. Discussions are continuing with 
partners and contractors in relation to the PY-3 
field development options. We are pleased with the 
progress made on our D3 exploration block which 
will be the catalyst for value creation during 2013.
We are initiating a comprehensive review of our long-term 
strategic goals and objectives. However, the Company 
remains in a strong working capital position with which 
to fund its planned work activity.
Key financial results
Revenue was down from $13.2 million in 2010 to $11.3 
million in 2011 due to lower production levels (the PY-3 
field was shut-in for five months in 2011) but partly offset 
by the higher average realised oil price. Administrative 
expenses increased to $6.9 million compared to $3.3 
million in 2010. The Company made an operating loss 
from continuing operations of $4.7 million in 2011. 
The Company has made a change to its accounting 
policy by adopting the successful efforts based 
accounting policy for its oil and gas assets in 2011. As a 
result Hardy has restated the Company’s consolidated 
financial statements for 2010. We believe that this change 
aligns our accounting policy with international peers and 
provides a better reflection of the results of our activities 
and financial position.

Company Information 
On 31 August 2011 Dinesh Dattani ceased to be the 
Finance Director of Hardy. We would like to thank Dinesh 
for his considerable contributions to Hardy over the past 
four years.
At the time of my appointment the Company announced 
Yogeshwar Sharma’s intention to step aside as Chief 
Executive Officer and assume a non-executive role with 
the Company. On 1 March 2012 we were pleased to 
announce the appointment of Ian MacKenzie. Ian has a 
proven track record of delivering results in a competitive 
industry. We are confident that his experience and 
leadership qualities will ensure we are successful in 
implementing the recommendations of the review.
We are grateful to Yogeshwar, one of the founders 
of the Company, for his invaluable contribution over 
many years and we are particularly grateful that he 
will provide continuity in this period of transition as 
a Non-Executive Director.
Prior to my appointment, Ian Bruce and Carol Bell 
had indicated that they did not intend to put themselves 
forward for re-election at the Company’s next Annual 
General Meeting and would retire from the Board of Hardy. 
Ian and Carol have served as Directors for over four and six 
years respectively. On behalf of the Board I would like to 
thank them for their contribution over their tenure.
The Company announced the appointment of Peter Milne 
as a Non-Executive Director on 1 March 2012. Peter has 
a proven track record in the oil sector having been the 
head of finance for the largest UK headquartered drilling 
contractor for over 15 years. His financial expertise and 
experience will fill a core competency gap. It is intended 
that Peter will be designated the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director and assume the Chairmanship of 
the Audit Committee following his re-election at this year’s 
Annual General Meeting.
The Group started 2011 with cash reserves of $36.5 
million. Net cash used in continuing operating activities 
(before changes in non cash working capital, tax paid, 
interest and investment income and finance costs) was 
$0.9 million. Proceeds from option exercise were $2.0 
million. As a result, the Group’s cash reserves at the end 
of 2011 remained unchanged at $36.5 million. The Group 
remains in a strong financial position with no debt.
Our business model and strategy
Hardy creates value through the exploration and 
production of hydrocarbons. In order to explore we 
must first be granted a licence by the Government 
of the countries in which we choose to invest. After 
extensive analysis, exploration campaigns are planned 
to try to discover oil and gas fields within underexplored 
sedimentary basins. When we have a significant discovery 
we undertake appraisal programmes which may include 
the drilling of wells and further geotechnical analysis to 
determine the size and quality of the discovery. 
If the appraisal programme confirms that development 
of a discovery will be commercially and financially viable, 
we begin work on a development plan. This maps out how 
we will get the hydrocarbons into production to generate 
revenue and cash flow. We also create value through the 
implementation of enhanced production strategies to 
optimise the value of recoverable hydrocarbons from 
existing producing fields. 
Whilst we believe that the Company has a sustainable 
platform to continue to participate in the India growth 
story, we plan to undertake a comprehensive review of our 
medium- and long-term objectives to optimise shareholder 
value. This process will be ongoing through the first half  
of 2012.
Board changes
The Board recently underwent a significant 
reorganisation which has resulted in the appointment 
of three new Directors and the planned retirement of 
three other Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman, Paul 
Mortimer had expressed his intention to step down from 
his role in 2011. The Nomination Committee initiated a 
process which resulted in my appointment in January 
2012. Paul has been Chairman for over nine years, from 
before the Company floated on the London Exchange, 
and we very much appreciate all his wise support 
and guidance. Hardy Oil and Gas plc

Key Performance Indicators
The Board undertook a review of its key performance 
indicators and has subsequently identified six key 
measures to assess the performance of the Company 
which are categorised into four non-financial measures 
(Total Recordable Injuries, Contingent Resources 
growth, wells drilled, net production), and two financial 
measures (cash flow from operations, cash and short-term 
investments). The Board believes that these six measures 
provide a reasonable benchmark for the Company’s overall 
performance. We met several of our targets for 201 1 but 
fell short of one financial and two operating targets.
Risk management
The Board has adopted a formal risk and uncertainties 
review process, involving the generation, identification of 
key risks and the formulation of mitigation strategies by  
the Company’s senior management team. Through the 
review process the following principal risks for 2012  
were identified:
 – Strategic risk – Overdependence on a single partner 
and lack of control to drive value creating activities; 
asset portfolio over-weighted to long-cycle 
exploration licences.
 – Financial risk – A prolonged shut-in of the PY-3 
field will have an impact on the Company’s ability 
to generate cash flow; relinquishment of assets may 
result in an impairment provision; liquidated damages 
for incomplete minimum work programmes; absence of 
GOI budget approval may hinder recovery of auxiliary 
costs associated with PY-3 shut-in period; CY-OS/2 
arbitration ruling not in our favour may result in an 
impairment provision.
 – Operational risk – Dependence on a single producing 
asset; limited life of PY-3 field in absence of further 
development; sustained sub-commercial exploration 
results; staff retention.
 – Compliance – Deteriorating stakeholder sentiment; 
changing regulatory and political environment in India.
Year-end audit
As in last year’s accounts, the auditors have provided an 
emphasis of matter comment in their Audit Report with 
reference to the uncertainty concerning the Group’s 
request to the GOI for an extension of its exploration 
licence in block CY-OS/2 as disclosed in note 2 and 15  
to the consolidated financial statements. In the event that 
Hardy’s application for an extension of the CY-OS/2 
licence was to be unsuccessful, the capitalised expenditure 
of $51 million will be subject to impairment testing.
Going concern
Having regard to the Company’s existing working capital 
position and its ability to raise potential financing, the 
Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate 
resources to enable it to undertake its planned work 
programme of exploration, appraisal and development 
activities over the next 12 months.

comprehensive review of our 
long-term strategic goals and 
objectives in order to realise 
value for shareholders

Outlook
The Declaration of Commerciality proposal for the D3 
block is being reviewed by the Government of India and 
this process will continue through 2012. Reprocessing of 
seismic covering the eastern area of the D3 block is also 
expected to continue through 2012. As a result drilling on 
the D3 block is expected to recommence in the first 
quarter of 2013. 
The D3 exploration licence in the Krishna Godavari 
Basin remains at the core of our organic growth potential. 
The Krishna Godavari Basin is an emerging world-class 
petroleum province and, together with rapidly improving 
Indian gas pipeline infrastructure and high demand for 
gas, the prospects for the economic development of gas 
resources in this area are excellent. Through 2012 we will 
continue to collaborate actively with our partners Reliance 
and BP to optimise the exploration programme for this 
highly prospective block.
With the recent adoption of the Declaration of 
Commerciality for the GS-01 block we have until the  
end of the year to submit a field development plan for the 
Dhirubhai 33 natural gas discovery. The D9 joint venture 
has until July 2012 to submit an appraisal programme for 
the KG-D9-A2 gas discovery.
An early priority for PY-3 will be to determine, with 
partners and contractors, a suitable way forward to 
optimise value for all stakeholders. 
Following the appointment of Ian MacKenzie, as Chief 
Executive Officer, we have initiated a comprehensive 
review of our long-term strategic goals and objectives in 
order to realise value for shareholders. We look forward to 
reporting the results of the review in due course but in any 
event, no later than at the time of our half-year results in 
September 2012. The Company remains in a strong 
working capital position from which to fund its planned 
work activity.

Business Review
Chief Executive’s Statement
Yogeshwar Sharma
Chief Executive Officer
In 2011 we continued our primary objective 
of evaluating the hydrocarbon potential of our 
exploration assets in India and bringing them closer 
to commerciality. A proposal for commerciality for 
the D3 discovery was submitted to the Government 
of India for review, while the GS-01 block’s 
commerciality proposal was adopted by the joint 
ventures Management Committee. We announced 
the results of two further exploration wells drilled in 
our deepwater D9 block, one of which resulted in  
a discovery. The commerciality of the discovery is 
under review. The farming-in by BP in our KG blocks 
further underscored the exploration potential of 
these assets. We were disappointed in not securing 
the necessary approvals to extend the facility 
contract for our producing field PY-3 which 
ultimately resulted in a field shut down.
In 2012, we will continue to build on the positive 
momentum in D3 with further evaluation of the deeper 
prospects in the block while at the same time review longer 
term field development options with our PY-3 partners.
The farming-in by BP in our 
KG blocks further underscored 
the exploration potential of  
these assets
Corporate strategy
The Company has adopted an India-focused upstream 
exploration and development strategy. We believe that the 
India sedimentary basins are underexplored and, as our 
results in the Krishna Godavari Basin have shown that 
significant accumulations of hydrocarbons remain to  
be found. India’s economy is expected to continue its 
impressive growth and as a result, the country’s energy 
consumption, along with its infrastructure, will materially 
increase, far exceeding current domestic supply of energy. 
As a net importer of oil and LNG, we expect India’s 
regulatory and investment environment for independent oil 
and gas explorers and producers to substantially improve 
during the near term given the sustained upward pressure 
on oil and gas prices in India.
Over the past five years, the Company has announced 
seven gas discoveries from 13 exploration wells. The 
approval of the Declaration of Commerciality submissions 
are the next step in the monetisation of our exploration 
efforts. Today we view the D3 exploration block with 
considerable optimism and continue to believe that our 
existing exploration portfolio offers significant organic 
growth potential for the Company.
Execution of strategy
The highlight of 2011 was the continued de-risking of our 
exploration portfolio as we move closer to establishing 
commerciality of our discoveries. While D9 still remains  
a frontier deepwater block, the D3 block with its four 
discoveries to date continues to show more potential in 
many of its deeper prospects which are currently under 
evaluation with our partners BP and Reliance. A proposal 
of commerciality for the D3 discoveries was submitted to 
the Government of India in late 2011 for their approval. 
The proposal called for a stand alone development with 
sub-sea completions and a pipeline to shore.
A previously submitted proposal for commerciality on the 
GS-01 block was approved by the Government of India in 
late 2011 for which the joint venture now have 12 months 
to submit a full field development plan. 
The submission of Declaration of Commerciality on our  
D3 discovery and the approval of commerciality on our 
previously submitted Declaration of Commerciality on 
GS-01 is further endorsement of our India-focused 
strategy of de-risking our exploration assets. Maintaining 
and enhancing the Company’s technical and commercial 
competencies is an integral component for the successful 
execution of our strategy. We will continue to look to 
enhance our organisation’s core technical, financial and 
commercial competencies to maintain the Company’s 
platform to capture the growth and value creating 
opportunities unique to India’s upstream sector.
India outlook
India’s natural gas carrying capacity is expected to 
increase fourfold by 2015 to 490 mmscmd (length  
24,000 km). Natural gas prices in India have progressively 
increased over the past 10 years by over 250 per cent 
through the dismantling of the administered pricing 
mechanism. The combination of prospective 
underexplored basins located within close proximity  
to a growing consumer market, presents an attractive 
upstream investment opportunity. Continuing increase  
in India’s gas supply and demand and rising gas price 
environment puts Hardy in an attractive position. Overview

Company Information 
Health, Safety and Environment
As an offshore operator the Company is committed to 
good health and safety practices which are at the forefront 
in all of our activities. In 2011 we realised a reduction in 
total recordable accidents for the PY-3 field. We were 
delighted to be the recipient of the India Coast Guard’s 
inaugural Environmental Awards 2010 in the oil handling 
agency category. The award is in recognition of efforts 
made by the Company for the implementation of oil 
pollution prevention measures and endeavours for the 
protection of the marine environment.
Exploration highlights
In 201 1 we announced the results of two further exploration 
wells in the D9 block, one of which resulted in a discovery. 
The Company also submitted a proposal for the Declaration 
of Commerciality of the Dhirubhai 39, 41 and 52 natural gas 
discoveries on the D3 exploration block. The exploration 
Phase I for the D3 licence is extended into 2013.
Development and production
During 201 1, the Company operated PY-3 field’s gross 
production was 0.71 mmbbl of oil compared with 1.15 
mmbbl for 2010. The decrease in production is principally 
attributable to the temporary shut-in of the field on 30 July 
201 1. Prior to shut-in the field was producing at a rate of 
3,100 bbld. At the recommencement of production the PY-3 
field will produce at an initial rate of over 3,000 bbld and is 
planned to go to 8,000 bbld with two additional wells.
Resource potential
Due to limited drilling activity in 2011 and the uncertainty 
surrounding the recommencement of production in the 
PY-3 asset, the Company took the decision to postpone 
the updating of a Competent Person’s Report until later in 
the year. A summary of the 2011 report, providing a block 
by block breakdown, is provided at the end of this report 
and the complete report can be downloaded from Hardy’s 
website: www.hardyoil.com.
Key partnerships
Hardy is proactive in its involvement with respect to our 
non-operated assets, working closely with our strategic 
partners in India, contributing independent assessments 
in conjunction with collaborative dialogue. The Company 
interacts on a regular basis with its partners at multiple 
levels, to ensure that our goals and objectives are 
addressed and to facilitate planning of upcoming work 
programme schedules. Maintaining open and substantive 
relationships with existing partners and other key 
stakeholders in the upstream oil and gas sector in India 
are critical to the execution of the Company’s strategy.
In early 2011, it was announced that BP will become a 
joint venture partner with Hardy and Reliance in both of 
our Krishna Godavari Basin blocks. At the time of the 
announcement, Reliance described BP as one of the 
finest deep water exploration companies in the world. 
They bring considerable additional skills and resources, 
backed by a quality research and development group, to 
our partnership. The combined skills of our companies will 
be focused on finding and developing more hydrocarbons 
in the deep water blocks of India and significantly 
contributing to India’s energy security. We welcome BP 
and look forward to working with them and Reliance on 
our joint venture projects in the future.
2012 programme
D3 – Further seismic processing on the D3 block is 
required over the toe-thrust area (north east) prior to 
drilling in this area. The processing is expected to be 
ongoing through the first half of 2012 and drilling to 
recommence in the first quarter of 2013.
As a result of the four consecutive discoveries that have 
been made on D3, this block now singularly stands out 
as the premier asset of Hardy. We have identified 26 
prospects or leads with an average size of 233 bcf. We 
remain in the early stages of exploration on this block and 
with six different play types present, we view this asset 
with great optimism. 
We have submitted Declaration of Commerciality 
proposals on two blocks – D3 and GS-01. We expect the 
Government of India’s review of the D3 declaration to have 
concluded by the end of the year. 
GS-01 – Following approval of the Declaration of 
Commerciality the GS-01 joint venture has 12 months 
to submit a detailed field development plan.
D9 – The joint venture is reviewing the potential of the 
KG-D9-A2 natural gas discovery for further activity and 
has until July 2012 to submit an appraisal programme. 
In the absence of the submission of an appraisal 
programme the block will stand relinquished.
PY-3 – We will continue to review longer term field 
development options with our PY-3 partners to optimise 
value for all stakeholders.
CY-OS/2 – The arbitration process is ongoing and 
further activity on this block is deferred until the arbitration 
tribunal has made its ruling. We expect the process to be 
concluded in 2012.
Staff
In early 2012 the Company announced the restructuring 
of its Board which we believe has strengthened 
management as we begin a process of review and 
reflection of our long-term goals and objectives to 
creating shareholder value.
I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the 
contribution of our staff both based in India and the United 
Kingdom. The Group has demonstrated a tremendous 
level of dedication and commitment, having continued to 
work professionally and efficiently to meet our objectives 
in a challenging environment.

Review of Operations
Exploration
At the beginning of 2011 the Company had planned for 
the drilling of at least two exploration wells in the Krishna 
Godavari Basin. The Company subsequently concluded 
the drilling of two exploration wells on the D9 exploration 
block (Hardy interest 10 per cent) in the Krishna Godavari 
Basin. The KG-D9-B3 exploration well recorded gas 
shows with good quality reservoir sands while drilling, 
however the MDT testing indicated high concentration of 
mobile water in the sands and the well was plugged and 
abandoned. The KG-D9-A2 discovery well was drilled to a 
total depth of 4,881 m MDRT, and three gas bearing sand 
reservoirs with a gross thickness of approximately 22 m 
were encountered and evaluated by wireline MDT. 
After carefully considering the block’s low prospectivity 
in conjunction with the logistical challenges of the area, 
the joint venture elected to relinquish the Assam 
exploration block.
Development
In February 2011, the D3 joint venture (Hardy interest 
10 per cent) submitted a proposal for the Declaration of 
Commerciality for the Dhirubhai 39, 41 and 52 natural gas 
discoveries to the Government of India. The proposed 
development plan provides for a dry gas, subsea cluster 
development with the flexibility to add in additional zones 
and future area discoveries.
Near the end of 2011, the GS-01 (Hardy interest 10 per 
cent) Declaration of Commerciality proposal was adopted 
by the Management Committee and the joint venture has 
until the end of 2012 to submit a detailed field 
development plan.
Through 2011 the Company continued to participate in 
a formal dispute resolution process to extend the expiry 
date of the CY-OS/2 licence (Hardy interest 75 per cent). 
A ruling is expected to be issued in the second half 
of 2012.
The table on page 11 provides a brief comparison of our 
stated operational objectives for 2011 and our subsequent 
accomplishments through the year.
Outlook for 2012
D3 – The joint venture will continue to undertake a number 
of geotechnical studies in 2012. Exploration activity is now 
focused on assessing the potential of the eastern area 
and high grading prospects to test deeper play types 
within the central portion of the block. The D3 operator

The Company was the recipient of one of the India Coast 
Guard’s inaugural Environmental Awards 2010 in the oil 
handling agency category. The award is in recognition of 
efforts made by the Company for the implementation of oil 
pollution prevention measures and endeavours for the 
protection of the marine environment.
Production
The PY-3 field (Hardy interest 18 per cent) performed as 
projected until the field was shut-in at the end of July 2011 
pending approvals to award a contract for the lease of the 
floating production system currently utilised by the field.
Prior to the shut-in the field had produced at an average 
gross daily rate of over 3,300 bbld. For the year, the 
average gross daily production was 1,953 barrels per 
day (bbld) (net: 352 bbld) compared to the Company’s 
forecast of 3,000 bbld. The Company had targeted 
securing the necessary budgetary approvals in mid-2011 
in order to commence the drilling of two further producing 
wells (Phase III) in the PY-3 field in 2012. Throughout 
2011 the Company worked closely with all stakeholders 
to advance the approval process. 
Discussions are continuing with partners and contractors 
in relation to field development options.
The highlights of operations in 2011 were the drilling of the 
second and third exploration wells on the D9 exploration block, 
the submission of a Declaration of Commerciality proposal for 
the D3 block, and the shut-in of the PY-3 field from 30 July 2011 
due to lack of approval from the field’s Management 
Committee to award a contract for its current facilities. 
The Company’s operations in India are conducted through 
its wholly-owned subsidiary Hardy Exploration & Production 
(India) Inc. (HEPI). Overview

Company Information 
indicated that the fifth exploration well is expected to 
commence drilling in the first quarter of 2013 and the 
sixth and final commitment well no later than the second 
quarter of 2013. Prospects in the eastern area and 
the Phase I areas will be evaluated after the PSDM 
processing to prioritise and plan the future 
drilling program.
D3 – Earlier this year the D3 joint venture Operating 
Committee reviewed and recommended a Commerciality 
Report for the Dhirubhai 39, 41 and 52 natural gas 
discoveries subject to a Government of India review. 
The proposed development is a dry gas, subsea cluster 
development with the flexibility to add in additional 
discoveries. The Government of India’s review is 
ongoing and a decision is expected by the end of 2012.
PY-3 – An early priority for PY-3 will be to determine, 
with partners and contractors a suitable way forward to 
optimise value for all stakeholders. 
D9 – Following the KG-D9-A2 natural gas discovery in 
July 2011, the joint venture was unable to drill the fourth 
and final exploration well within the remaining exploration 
time period. The joint venture is reviewing the potential of 
the discovery for further activity and has until July 2012 to 
submit an appraisal programme. In the absence of the 
submission of an appraisal programme the block will 
stand relinquished.
GS-01 – Following approval of the Declaration of 
Commerciality the GS-01 joint venture has 12 months to 
submit a detailed field development plan. The Company 
will work closely with the operator to formulate the optimal 
development plan in a timely manner.

regional data has identified a number of additional 
prospects and leads. The new prospectivity is primarily 
focused on thermogenic sourced plays. We expect further 
clarification of the plays and associated prospectivity to 
coincide with the ongoing interpretation in the central area 
of the block and the PSDM seismic processing in the east 
portion of block.

Exploration (Hardy 10 per cent interest)
Operations
In 201 1 the Company announced the results of two 
exploration wells on this block: KG-D9-A2 and KG-D9-B3.
KG-D9-A2 (Dhirubhai 54)
On 22 June 201 1, the Company announced the first 
natural gas discovery on the D9 block from its third well, 
KG-D9-A2. The well was drilled to a total depth of 4,881 m 
MDRT with the objective of exploring the play fairway in the 
Early and Late Miocene channel levee complex in a water 
depth of approximately 2,703 m. Three gas bearing sand 
reservoirs with a gross thickness of approximately 22 m 
were encountered and evaluated by wireline MDT.
KG-D9-B3
On 5 January 201 1, the Company announced the plugging 
and abandonment of the second exploration well on the 
D9 block. The well, KG-D9-B3, was drilled in a water 
depth of 2,948 m to a total measured depth of 3,829 m. 
The nearest well control is 47 km distant. The well 
encountered two Tertiary aged reservoir quality sand 
packages with a gross thickness of 70 m and 40 m, with 
gas shows ranging from 6 per cent to 9 per cent recorded 
while drilling. Testing was carried out with the MDT tool 
which indicated a high concentration of mobile water in the 
sand packages and the well was plugged and abandoned.
2012 outlook
Following the KG-D9-A2 natural gas discovery in July 
2011, the joint venture was unable to drill the fourth and 
final exploration well within the remaining exploration 
period. The joint venture is reviewing the potential of the 
discovery for further activity and has until July 2012 to 
submit an appraisal programme. In the absence of the 
submission of an appraisal programme the block will 
stand relinquished.
Background
Situated in the Krishna Godavari Basin in India, the 
licence encompasses 11,605 km
2
 in the Bay of Bengal 
where water depths vary from 2,300 m to 3,100 m. 
The block is immediately adjacent to the Reliance 
operated D6 block, where over 1 bcf per day is being 
produced from Tertiary aged sediments. The D9 block 
is operated by Reliance which holds a 60 per cent 
participating interest with BP holding 30 per cent and 
Hardy the remaining 10 per cent.
The joint venture has acquired 4,188 km
2
 of 3D seismic 
in the north west quarter of the block and 2,087 km of 
2D seismic over the remainder of the block. Subsequent 
interpretation of the seismic data has identified prospects 
and leads at the Pliocene, Miocene, Oligocene and 
Cretaceous levels. Overview

PY-3
Block CY-OS 90/1:
Producing Oil Field (Hardy 18 per cent  
interest – Operator)
Production
Gross average daily field production for the year ended 
31 December 2011 was 1,953 bbld (2010: 3,156 bbld; 
2009: 1,535 bbld). Up until the time of shut-in the field 
had produced at a gross average rate of approximately 
3,350 bbld. The production facilities’ uptime performance 
was 58 per cent (2010: 93 per cent). The decrease in 
production was the result of an extended unplanned 
shut-in on 30 July 2011 due to the Floating Production 
System (FPS) falling out of contract and class validity.
The field has remained shut-in for the beginning of 2012. 
Should production recommence we anticipate that the 
PY-3 field will be capable of an initial average gross daily 
rate of approximately 3,000 bbld and approximately 
8,000 bbld with the drilling of two additional wells.
Development
In 2011, the PY-3 joint venture had been seeking approval 
from the Government of India to award a five year contract 
to the incumbent facilities providers which was not 
approved at Management Committee level. The terms  
and conditions of the recommended contract had been 
derived from industry benchmarking and negotiation with 
the incumbent facility ownership. 
2012 outlook
An early priority for PY-3 will be to determine, with 
partners and contractors a suitable way forward to 
optimise value for stakeholders. To date the joint venture 
has been providing the current offshore facilities with 
various support vessels and auxiliary services. In the 
absence of securing the necessary approvals to 
recommence production in a timely manner an 
extended shut-in of the field may result.
The field is currently capable of producing at a gross  
daily rate of over 3,000 bbld and at 8,000 bbld with two 
additional wells. We project that the current producing 
well is capable of producing for a further 18 months. 
Production beyond this period will require the drilling 
of additional wells and the installation of gas lift facilities.
Background
The PY-3 field is located off the east coast of India 80 km 
south of Pondicherry in water depths between 40 m and 
450 m. The Cauvery Basin was developed in the late 
Jurassic/early Cretaceous period and straddles the 
present-day east coast of India. The licence, which covers 
81 km
2
, produces high quality light crude oil (49° API).
The field was developed using floating production 
facilities and subsea wellheads, a first for an offshore 
field in India. The facility at PY-3 consists of the floating 
production unit, ‘Tahara’, and a 65,000 DWT tanker, 
‘Endeavor’, which acts as a floating storage and offloading 
unit. There are four sub-sea wells tied back to Tahara. 
Tahara has a three-stage crude oil separation system,  
with the first two stages being three-phase separators  
and the third stage a two-phase separator.
Liquid processing capacity on Tahara is 20,000 bbld with 
17 mmscfd of gas handling capacity. The field currently 
produces associated gas in the range of 3.5 mmscfd. 
This produced gas is used as fuel gas with excess gas 
being flared. The stabilised crude oil is pumped from Tahara 
to Endeavor for storage and offloading to shuttle tankers. 
Crude oil from the PY-3 field is sold to CPCL at its refinery in 
Nagapattinam, approximately 70 km south of the PY-3 field.

activities necessary to fully appraise the Ganesha discovery. 
It is unlikely that an appraisal well will be drilled in 2012.
Background
Licence block CY-OS/2 is located in the northern part of 
the Cauvery Basin immediately offshore from Pondicherry 
and covers approximately 859 km
2
. The CY-OS/2 licence 
comprises two retained areas. The northern area includes 
the Fan A-1 discovery and the southern area lies immediately 
adjacent to the HEPI operated PY-3 field. The PY-1 gas 
field, a separate ring-fenced licence, lies within the 
southern part of the acreage and commenced 
production in the third quarter of 2010.
Ganesha: On 8 January 2007, the Company 
announced that the Fan A-1 exploration well had 
discovered hydrocarbons. In August 2007, the Company 
announced that it would proceed to the appraisal phase 
of the Ganesha non-associated gas discovery to establish 
potential commerciality.

Operations
The Assam block was awarded under India’s NELP II 
bid round in 2000. The block is located on the western, 
undrilled margin of the Assam Basin. The nearest 
production is approximately 50 km distant. Hardy held a 
10 per cent participating interest with the block operated 
by Reliance.
Following seismic acquisition, processing and 
interpretation, the geologic analysis of the area identified 
two structural prospects. The Company’s published CPR 
listed gross best estimate prospective resources of 20 
mmbbl and 5 mmbbl with a geological chance of success 
(GCOS) of 10 per cent, due to petroleum system 
uncertainty in this undrilled part of the basin.
After carefully considering the block’s low prospectivity 
in conjunction with the logistical challenges of the area, 
the joint venture has elected to relinquish the block. Hardy Oil and Gas plc

Business Review
Financial Review
During 2011, the Company recorded a decrease in 
revenue due to the PY-3 field being shut-in from 31 July 
2011. This has resulted in a decrease in gross profit and 
an operating loss (compared with a profit in 2010). Hardy 
completed the year with cash and short-term investments 
of $36.5 million and has no debt.
Accounting policy change
The Company has changed to the successful efforts 
method of accounting for its oil and gas assets which 
allows for the capitalisation of successful exploration 
costs, whereas the dry hole and its associated geological 
and geophysical costs are written-off. Accordingly, Hardy 
has recorded a charge for unsuccessful exploration costs 
of $55.9 million which had previously been included in 
intangible assets. The Company has also restated the 
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for 2010. 
Key Performance Indicators
The Company undertook a review of its disclosed key 
performance indicators. As a result, the Company identified 
two financial and four non-financial measures as key 
performance indicators for Hardy. The measures reflect the 
Company’s exploration focused strategy, the importance of 
a positive cash position and our underlying commitment to 
ensuring safe operations. The key performance indicators 
adopted in 201 1 are summarised below:

$11.1 million in 2011 compared to $12.9 million in 2010. 
The average price realised per barrel increased by 35 
per cent from $81.71 during 2010 to $110.54 in 2011. 
Average daily sales amounted to 392 bbld in 2011 
compared with 525 bbld in 2010. 
Cost of sales
Production costs decreased from $5.3 million in 2010 to 
$3.7 million in 2011 as a result of reduction of charter hire 
charges to FPS to seven months instead of 12 months in 
2010. Average cost per barrel including depletion is 
$40.87 per barrel in 2011 compared with $41.63 per 
barrel in 2010. Production cost per barrel remained 
relatively unchanged at $28.49 in 2011 compared with 
$25.66 in 2010.
Unsuccessful exploration costs
As a result of the Company’s change in accounting 
policy to the successful efforts method, the unsuccessful 
exploration well costs and the associated geological and 
geophysical costs of $3.4 million for the year 2011, 
$1.8 million for 2010 and $50.7 million up to 2009 were 
charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
The adjustments primarily relate to nine exploration wells 
drilled in prior years including two exploration wells on the 
block CY-OS/2 block (TRL and Fan E), three exploration 
wells on the GS-OSN-2000/1 block (A1, S1 and M1) and 
two exploration wells on the D9 block (A1 and B3), and 
associated geological and geophysical expenses of the 
block AS-ONN-2000/1.
Gross profit
The Company realised a gross profit of $2.2 million in 
2011 compared with a profit of $3.1 million in 2010. 
The decrease is principally the result of lower production 
which was partly mitigated by higher average crude oil 
price realised in 2011.
Administrative expenses 
Administrative expenses increased from $3.3 million in 
2010 to $6.9 million in 2011. This increase is mainly due 
to a provision for possibly irrecoverable costs of $2.3 
million from the operated blocks and a loss on exchange 
of $0.9 million.
Operating loss 
The Company is reporting an operating loss from 
continuing operations of $4.7 million in 2011 compared 
with an operating loss of $0.2 million in 2010.
Interest and investment income 
Investment and other income in 2011 remained 
unchanged from 2010 at $0.4 million.
Finance costs 
Finance costs principally include the cost of providing 
bank guarantees to the Government of India required by 
the provisions of production sharing contracts and the 
unwinding of the decommissioning cost.
Loss before taxation 
The Company has recorded a loss before taxation 
from continuing operations of $4.6 million compared 
to a nominal profit before taxation in 2010. This results 
principally from lower revenues and higher general and 
administrative expenses in 2011 and the change in the 
accounting policy from full cost to successful 
effort method.
Taxation
The Company has recorded a tax credit of $2.7 million 
during 2011 compared to a tax charge of $0.3 million 
in 2010.
Loss from continuing operations
As a result, the Company recorded a loss for the year from 
continuing operations of $1.9 million compared to a loss 
of $0.2 million for 2010.
Cash flow from operating activities 
During 2011, the Company had a negative cash flow 
from continuing operations activities, before changes 
in non-cash working capital, amounting to $0.9 million 
against a positive cash flow of $4.0 million in 2010.  Hardy Oil and Gas plc

Financing activities 
During 201 1 the Company realised $2.0 million in 
proceeds from the execution of various stock options. 
During December 2010, the Company completed a placing 
of 3,370,000 Ordinary Shares at a price of £2.01 per share 
for net cash consideration of $9.5 million. In addition, the 
Company received investment income on its surplus cash 
resources amounting to $0.4 million.
Cash and short-term investments 
The Company’s cash and short-term investments 
remained unchanged at $36.5 million at the end of 2011. 
The Company does not have any debt.
Summary statement of financial position 
Hardy’s non-current assets decreased from $101.6 million 
in 2010 to $97.3 million in 2011. Current assets represent 
the Group’s cash and short-term investments, trade and 
other receivables and inventory and have decreased from 
$43.6 million to $39.7 million. At the end of 2011, of 
the $39.7 million of current assets, $36.5 million are 
represented by cash and short-term investments. Current 
liabilities are principally trade and other accounts payable 
which are $6.1 million at the end of 2011 compared to 
$13.4 million at the end of 2010.
Liquidity and capital resources 
The Company has successfully raised financing in the 
past to provide funding for its ongoing exploration and 
development programmes and to augment its working 
capital. Having regard to Hardy’s existing working capital 
position and its ability to raise potential financing, the 
Directors are of the opinion that the Company has 
adequate resources to enable it to undertake its planned 
work programme of exploration, appraisal and development 
activities over the next 12 months. At the end of 201 1, the 
Group had cash resources of $36.5 million and no debt.
Dividends 
The Directors do not recommend the payment 
of a dividend in the foreseeable future.
Risk factors
Hardy is in the international upstream oil and gas business 
which faces a variety of strategic, operational, financial 
and external risks. Under these distinct classes, the 
Company has identified certain risks pertinent to its 
business including: exploration and reserves risks; loss of 
key human resources; drilling and operating risks; security 
risk in area of operations, costs and availability of materials 
and services; economic and sovereign risks, market risk, 
foreign currency risk, loss of or changes to production 
sharing or concession agreements, joint venture or related 
agreements; and volatility of future oil and gas prices.
Effective risk management is critical to achieving 
our strategic objectives and protecting our assets, 
personnel and reputation. Hardy manages its risks 
through compliance with the terms of its agreements and 
application of appropriate policies and procedures, and 
through the recruitment and retention of skilled individuals 
throughout the organisation. Further, the Company has 
focused its activities mainly in known hydrocarbon basins 
in jurisdictions that have previously established long-term 
oil and gas ventures with foreign oil and gas companies, 
existing infrastructure of services and oil and gas 
transportation facilities, and reasonable proximity 
to markets.
A summary of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Company and the way in which these risks are 
mitigated is provided under the ‘Risks and Uncertainties’ 
section of this report.
Key financial risks
In addition to the global financial risks described above, the 
Company is subject to the following specific financial risks. 
Foreign exchange risk 
The proceeds of the Group’s domestic oil and gas sales 
in India are received in US dollars. The majority of the 
Group’s expenditure requirements are in US dollars. The 
Group has general and administrative expenditure in India 
and United Kingdom and is therefore exposed to foreign 
exchange risk against Indian rupees and UK sterling. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s cash requirements and cash reserves are 
projected for the Group as a whole and for each country 
in which operations are conducted. Whereas the Group 
currently has no debt, in the future the Group expects to 
meet these requirements through an appropriate mix of 
available cash, equity funds and debt financing. The Group 
further mitigates liquidity risk by seeking funds well in 
advance of requirements and by maintaining an insurance 
programme to minimise exposure to insurable losses. 
Commodity price risk 
Historically, oil prices have fluctuated widely and are 
affected by numerous factors over which the Group has 
no control, including world production levels, international 
economic trends, exchange rate fluctuations, expectations 
for inflation, speculative activity, consumption patterns and 
global or regional political events. The aggregate effect of 
these factors is impossible to predict. The production 
estimates for PY-3 and the oil prices will vary depending 
upon market conditions, which are not within the control of 
the Group. The Group’s production in India sold to CPCL is 
based on the 30 day average (commencing 15 days before 
and ending 15 days after the delivery) of Brent crude less 
$0.35. The Board has no immediate intention to enter into 
fixed price contracts. Although oil prices may fluctuate 
widely, it is the Group’s present policy not to hedge crude 
oil sales. 
Status of CY-OS/2 discovery block
The auditors have provided an emphasis of matter 
comment in their audit report with reference to the 
uncertainty concerning the Group’s request for an extension 
of its exploration licence in block CY-OS/2 as disclosed in  
notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company’s Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive 
Officer’s Statement, Review of Operations, Financial 
Review, and Risks and Uncertainties have been prepared 
to substantially comply with the Accounting Standards 
Board Operating and Financial Review Reporting 
Statement issued in January 2006.

Risks and Uncertainties
Clear responsibility
The Board is responsible for the overall group strategy, 
acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major 
capital expenditure projects, corporate costs, significant 
financing matters and the management of risk. The Board 
recognises that risk is inherent across Hardy’s operations, 
and all activities are subject to an appropriate review to 
ensure that risks are identified monitored and managed to 
the extent possible.
Identification and monitoring
The Board has adopted a framework for risk assessment 
and monitoring providing for four distinct categories: 
strategic; financial; operational; and compliance. The 
Board’s review of the Company’s risks and uncertainties 
involves a detailed description of each risk and an 
assessment of its perceived relevance and likelihood 
of materially impacting Hardy’s business. Risks that are 
identified as high and or trending upwards are noted 
and assigned to the Executive Directors to monitor and 
if possible proactively mitigated. The Board is provided 
regular updates of the identified principal risks at 
scheduled Board meetings.
The underlying risks and uncertainties inherent with 
Hardy’s current business model are summarised below.
Strategy risk
The Group’s strategy is predominantly driven by the 
exploration, appraisal, development and production of 
its existing assets in India. There are risks inherent in the 
exploration, appraisal, development and production of oil 
and gas reserves and resources. The Group’s strategy 
may include the acquiring of additional oil and gas properties. 
The Group cannot guarantee that it will be able to identify 
appropriate properties, or negotiate acquisitions on 
favourable terms, or that it will be able to secure the 
financing necessary to complete such future acquisitions.
As an oil and gas exploration and production company with 
operations focused in India, Hardy is subject to a variety of risks 
and uncertainties. Managing risk effectively is a critical element 
of our corporate responsibility and underpins the safe delivery 
of our business plans and strategic objectives. It protects our 
reputation, supports our ability to do business and helps to 
create long-term competitive advantage. The Group has a 
systematic approach to risk identification and management 
which combines the Board’s assessment of risk with risk 
factors originating from and identified by the Group’s senior 
management team.
Financial risk
Any volatility and future significant decreases in crude oil 
prices could materially and adversely affect the Group’s 
business, prospects, financial condition and results 
of operations. Other major financial risks facing the 
Company are: failure to receive extensions for expiring 
exploration and production contracts; inability to access 
debt and/or equity financing for further exploration and 
development; cost inflation or overruns activities; and 
overall deterioration of shareholder sentiment. Additional 
discussion of financial risks is provided for in the Financial 
Review section.
Operations risk
Exploration and production activities by their nature 
involve significant risks. Risks such as delays in executing 
work programmes as a result of access to drilling rigs, in 
the construction and commissioning of drilling platforms 
or other technical difficulties, lack of access to key 
infrastructure, adverse weather conditions, environmental 
hazards, industrial accidents, occupational and health 
hazards, technical failures, labour disputes, unusual or 
unexpected geological formations, explosions and other 
acts of God are inherent to the business.
Compliance risk
The Group’s current business is dependent on the 
continuing enforceability of the PSCs, farm-in agreements 
and exploration and development licences. The Group’s 
core operational activities are dependent on securing 
various governmental approvals. Developments in politics, 
laws, regulations and/or general adverse public sentiment 
could compromise securing such approvals in the future.
Emphasis of matter
As in previous years, the Board notes that the auditors 
have provided an emphasis of matter comment in their 
audit report, which is not qualified, with reference to the 
uncertainty concerning the Group’s request for an 
extension of its exploration licence in block CY-OS/2. 
In 2010, the Group formally commenced arbitration 
proceedings pursuant to dispute resolution provisions 
of the governing PSC and they continued through 2011.
The Group holds a 75 per cent participating interest in the 
block CY-OS/2 which is offshore on the south east coast 
of India. Intangible assets – exploration include an amount 
capitalised of $51,023,493 in respect of exploration 
expenditures on the block wherein a gas discovery was 
announced on 8 January 2007. The exploration period for 
the block ended on 23 March 2007 and the GOI has been 
requested to extend the block for appraisal and Declaration 
of Commerciality for its gas discovery until 7 January 2012.
Provisions of the PSC provide for an appraisal period of 
60 months from the date of discovery. For an oil discovery, 
this period is limited to 24 months. DGH has informed 
HEPI that in their opinion the discovery is classified as 
an oil discovery and not a NANG discovery.
The Company has obtained third party legal and 
technical opinions that support the Company’s view that 
the discovery is NANG and have referred the dispute to 
arbitration for adjudication. The Group believes that it will 
be successful in obtaining the extension of its licence in 
the arbitration.
In the event that the Group is not successful in the 
arbitration, the exploration expenditure capitalised in 
respect of this block will be subject to impairment testing. 
No adjustment has been made to the carrying value of this 
capitalised expenditure. Hardy Oil and Gas plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Risk Mitigation
Strategic Ineffective or poorly executed strategy fails to create stakeholder 
value or fails to meet stakeholder expectations.
Asset portfolio over-weighted to long-
cycle exploration licences
Preferential allocation of resources to advance current discoveries to 
the development stage. Continually assessing acquisition opportunities, 
consistent with stated objectives, offering near term production increases.
Overdependence on a single partner 
and lack of control to drive value 
creating activities
Proactive communication with partner to drive corporate interests and 
mandates. Each licence is governed by joint operating agreements, which 
provide for processes and procedures designed to ensure that the input and 
interests of non-operating partners are considered. The addition of BP as 
a partner to our key exploration licences should further facilitate progress.
Financial Asset performance and excessive leverage results in the Group being 
unable to meet its financial obligations as and when they are due.
A prolonged shut-in of the PY-3 field 
will have an impact on the Company’s 
ability to generate cash flow
Continue to advance Phase III development programme with a view to 
increasing production from one to up to four wells. Maintain sufficient working 
capital to account for an extended shut-in of the field. Maintain tight controls 
on overhead inflation.
Relinquishment of assets may result in 
impairment provision
Continue to work closely with partners to ensure minimum work programmes 
are complete within permitted time.
Liquidated damages for incomplete 
minimum work programmes
The Company has minimum work commitments on its exploration assets in 
India. The D9 and GS-01 blocks have reached the end of their exploration 
phase without completion of the MWP. Potential liabilities may be pending 
however there is uncertainty on the final demand. The Company makes 
provisions when the amount is ascertained by the operator of the licence.
Absence of GOI budget approval 
may hinder recovery of auxiliary costs 
associated with PY-3 shut-in period
Commencement of production and securing approvals to extend the life of 
the field via drilling will mitigate the likelihood of the noted expenditures not 
securing GOI approval.
CY-OS/2 arbitration ruling may result  
in an impairment provision
Arbitration process is ongoing. The Company has obtained strong legal and 
technical opinions in support of its position, retained legal counsel in India and 
assigned the CFO of HEPI to manage the process.
Throughout the year, Hardy’s senior management and Board have critically reviewed and evaluated the risks facing the 
Group. As a result of this process, the Board has synthesised these risks in this year’s report by defining the principle 
risks and uncertainties for 2012 and establishing clear policies and responsibilities to mitigate their possible negative 
impact to the business, a summary of which is provided below.

Principal Risks for 2012 Overview 
Business Review 
Governance 
Financial Statement 
Company Information 
Risk Mitigation
Operational Operational event impacting staff, contractors, communities or 
the environment leading to loss of reputation and/or revenue.
Sustained sub-commercial 
exploration results
Effective portfolio management (low interest, many assets) combined with 
rigorous review and implementation of best practice exploration processes 
and techniques. Internal expertise review process and, when necessary third 
party consultation prior to Board approval.
Dependence on a single producing 
asset – limited life of field in absence 
of further development 
The approval of the GS-01 commerciality proposal will enable Hardy to 
advance plans for development. The Company is also indicating that it plans 
to evaluate acquisitions that have the potential to contribute short- to medium-
term production.
An accident or blowout could occur 
during offshore drilling operations
The Company’s work programme for 2013 involves the drilling of at least two 
deepwater wells. These wells are on non-operated blocks and as such the 
Company relies on the HSE procedures mandated by the operator and the 
contractors. Liabilities associated with an accident are insured to the extent 
reasonably possible.
Loss of acreage The Company’s exploration licences are at or approaching the end of their 
initial exploration phases. The Company will be subject to relinquishment 
requirements, ranging from a portion of a block to an entire licence, at the end 
of the initial phase.
Staff retention The Company’s ability to compete in the upstream oil and gas exploration 
and production industry is dependent on being able to retain and attract 
experienced technical personnel.
Compliance The overall external political, industry or market environment may 
negatively impact on the Group’s ability to independently grow and 
manage its business.
Deteriorating stakeholder sentiment Communicate with investors on a regular basis providing transparent and 
timely information. Effectively convey strategic goals and objectives and 
improve delivery. The Company has initiated a comprehensive review of its 
long-term strategic goals and objectives.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Based on mutual respect and understanding, the Group 
strives to build and maintain enduring relationships with 
the Government of India, local authorities, partners and 
business associates. Respecting the rich cultural diversity 
of the regions in which we engage in business, the Group 
strives to minimise our impact on the environment, taking 
into consideration the specific requirements of the region 
and local working practices to achieve optimum 
performance and timely delivery of projects.
Corporate social responsibility is a fundamental part of 
implementing the Group’s corporate strategy and has both 
practical and ethical dimensions. It includes managing 
business concerns, such as risk, enhancing reputation in 
conjunction with investing in the community, and creating 
a place where people feel good about working.
The Group contributes to community and social 
development by carrying out its business activities 
in a manner that provides energy and infrastructure, 
employment, skills development and trade to the areas 
in which the Group operates. The Group will consider 
monetary and human resource contributions to local 
social programmes which the Company deems 
appropriate to contribute or improve the overall 
wellbeing of the communities in which we operate.
Hardy is committed to applying high ethical standards to 
maintain its reputation as an employer and operator of choice.
To deliver this goal, our investment and operational decisions 
take appropriate account of the social, health, safety and 
environmental impacts that may arise during our activities.
Health, Safety and Environment Activities
The Board has tailored the Group’s Health Safety and 
Environment (HSE) policy and management system taking 
reference from world class operations to suit Indian 
conditions. Safety, security and emergency procedures 
have been incorporated into the weave of the Group’s 
operations. The central HSE Committee and Environment 
Management Committees meet on a monthly basis to 
assess and monitor compliance. The Group regularly 
undertakes internal and external HSE audits, including 
pre-mobilisation HSE audit of rigs and vessels. The Group 
undertakes periodic environmental marine monitoring 
around production facilities and around the drilling 
locations. Prompt compliance with applicable regulations 
by the Group has been recognised by concerned agencies.
The PY-3 field’s floating production unit, the Tahara, fell 
out of ABS classification on 30 July 2011 and as a result 
the field was shut-in. 
Compliance to ministerial and regulatory bodies such as 
OISD, DGH, MOEF, DGMS, ODAG, Coast Guard, Navy, 
TMB and others are maintained by forwarding necessary 
reports as required. Hardy participates in different 
meetings convened by these agencies. Senior officials 
from these agencies also visit our offshore facilities and 
appreciate our HSE management system. 
The CHSE Committee, the Company’s apex body on HSE 
activities, meets every month and reviews the HSE plans, 
activities, accidents and incidents pertaining to the month. 
Representatives from contractors are also invited for these 
meetings. Regular HSE audits, drills and emergency 
exercises are carried out in all facilities offshore.

Environmental impact policy and performance
Offshore petroleum operations interact with the marine 
environment which can lead to short-term and long-term 
physical, chemical and biological changes to the area.
Marine
As a part of the commitment for environmental protection 
and towards compliance to the conditions imposed by 
Ministry of Environment and Forests, Hardy has been 
regularly carrying out an environmental marine monitoring 
programme to assess the quality of the marine environment 
since 1998. A marine environmental survey was carried 
out in 2008 by Onshore & Offshore Environmental 
Consultants in collaboration with the Advanced Centre 
for Marine Biology, Annamalai University. This has been 
accomplished through implementation of adequate 
preventive and control measures.
Based on the detailed study and factors highlighted above, 
it clearly reveals that the marine environment in and around 
the PY-3 oil field has not been altered or affected by the 
ongoing production activities. Numeration of phyto and 
zooplanktons shows that the populations and diversity of 
the region are maintained and the environment is healthy 
with good productivity. Infaunal analysis reveals that the 
sediments are rich in invertebrate fauna with diverse groups 
of marine organisms. Toxicological studies on fish and 
crustaceans indicate that the bio-accumulation is within 
permissible limits. The values obtained during the present 
study are in accordance with the other marine environments 
in this region.

Environmental management system
Hardy’s environmental management system is intended to mitigate the risks of marine pollution due to routine and 
accidental discharges of wastes and consequent adverse impacts on the marine environment.
Offshore oil platforms generally generate the following wastes:
 – major produced water, drilling fluids and drill cuttings; and
 – minor deck drainage, sanitary waste and domestic waste.
The various conventions held and agreements reached for setting limits for discharge from offshore oil/gas exploration 
and production activities provide necessary guidelines for monitoring required standards before discharging different 
wastes. Set out below is a table outlining the major policies and measures that the Company undertakes as operator 
of the PY-3 field:
Routine discharges Control measures
Produced water Produced water recovered during crude oil or condensate gas treatment is generally warm 
and charged with salts and solids. The quantity of water produced given by the Water Oil Ratio 
(WOR) can increase considerably with the age of the oil field. Currently, the PY-3 field produces 
less than 10 stbd and is treated by gravity separation. Treated water is discharged overboard 
after confirming no oil content within allowable limits.
Drilling fluids Drilling fluids are used in exploration and production drilling to maintain hydrostatic pressure 
control in the well and to lubricate the drill bits. Water-based drilling fluids are currently 
discharged directly to the ocean after ensuring that there is no oil contamination.
Drill cuttings The drill cuttings removed from the well are rock debris and mineral particles generated by 
drilling into underground formations. The discharge of rock cuttings and mud may have adverse 
environmental effects especially by changing the sediment particle size distribution and also 
by the possible suffocation of benthic fauna. Except at sensitive areas such as corals and 
mangroves, water-based cuttings are allowed to be discharged directly into sea after clear 
separation from the drilling fluids and through washings.
Deck drainage Deck drainage is either collected and treated separately for oil removal by gravity separation or is 
handled by the Oil Water Sewage (OWS) system before discharge. Typically, OWS systems are 
provided with online analysers and if the oil content is above the preset value, it will not allow the 
water to be discharged.
Domestic wastes Domestic waste originates from kitchens, laundries and galleys located on drilling and 
production facilities. It typically comprises metal cans, glass or plastic bottles, papers, boxes 
and biodegradable wastes. This waste is segregated, stored and dispersed as per the waste 
management plans of the individual facilities concerned.
Sanitary wastes Sanitary waste generated from toilets and lavatories need to be treated before discharge. 
Our facilities are required to maintain a residual chlorine concentration in sanitary waste 
discharge as close to 1 mg/l as possible for disinfection purposes.
Oil spill  
contingency  
plan
An oil spill contingency plan has been prepared in line with IMO guidelines and the National Oil 
Spill Disaster Contingency Plan. It has been approved by Indian Coast Guard and Oil Industry 
Safety Directorate (under Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, GOI). As per the plan, resources 
required for an oil spill will be mobilised based on a tiered approach as follows: Tier 1 within local 
capability; Tier 2 over and above local capability, resources available with neighbour operations 
and national agencies (viz. Indian Coast Guard) will also be mobilised; Tier 3 in addition to Tier 
2 resources, resources from specialised agencies such as Oil Spill Response Ltd (OSRL), and 
EARL will also be mobilised.

Company Information 
Air quality
Evaluation of environmental impact via regular ambient air 
quality studies have confirmed that the air quality is not 
affected by offshore operations and the main focus of 
monitoring is of the impact on the immediate marine 
ecological system.
Flaring: Gas produced from the PY-3 field is associated gas 
which is separated from the crude oil through conventional 
processing at the Tahara. Prior to shut-in the field was 
producing approximately 3.1 mmscfd. The current method 
of disposal is via power generation (for use on the Tahara) 
and flaring offshore. The flaring practice will continue until 
some viable alternative emerges.
Employment practices
Our policy is to ensure equal opportunities in career 
development, promotion, training and reward for all of 
our employees. We continually monitor the skills required 
to manage our activities and ensure there is a balance of 
skilled, experienced expatriate and local employees in our 
offices. We seek to avoid discrimination in the workplace

excellence from our staff to effectively execute our 2012 
work plan and beyond. The Board would like to take this 
opportunity to recognise the importance of our team and 
acknowledge their efforts in the past year.
Outlook
The Board believes that prevention of accidents, ill 
health and protection of the environment are essential 
to the efficient operation of its business. The Board is 
committed to high standards of HSE protection. These 
aspects command equal prominence with other business 
considerations in the decision making process. HSE 
protection are responsibilities shared by everyone working 
for the Company and the full support of all the Company’s 
staff, corporate partners, and contractors is vital to the 
successful implementation of this policy. The Board 
ensures that personnel are aware of their delegated HSE 
responsibilities and are properly trained to undertake them 
diligently. The Board aims to ensure that the necessary 
resources are provided to support this policy fully and 
to seek continuous improvement in performance.
High corporate social responsibility standards and 
constant grass roots level interaction give the Group 
awareness of local communities’ sensibilities and needs.
The Board aims to ensure 
that the necessary resources 
are provided to support high 
HSE standards and to seek 
continuous improvement

Introduction
The Board is committed to ensuring that high levels of corporate 
governance are achieved. Hardy Oil and Gas plc is incorporated in 
the Isle of Man and is not subject to any corporate governance regime 
in its place of incorporation.
The UK Corporate Governance Code
The Company does maintain a listing on the London Stock Exchange 
and as a result is required to make certain statements relating to the 
way it is governed, covering issues provided for in The UK Corporate 
Governance Code published in June 2010 (the Code). The Code is 
publically available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk. In compliance with the Code, this report describes 
the manner in which the Company has applied the main principles of 
governance set out in the Code and provides an explanation where 
the Board has chosen to not comply.
The Company continues to be an explorer with limited cash flows and 
a modest employee base of approximately 37 people. The Company 
has a clear mandate to optimise the allocation of limited resources to 
support its exploration programme. As such, the Company strives to 
maintain a balance between conservation of limited resources and 
maintaining robust corporate governance practices. As the Company 
evolves the Board is committed to addressing specific Combined 
Code deficiencies and enhancing the Company’s corporate 
governance policies and practices deemed appropriate for the 
size and maturity of the organisation.
Set out below are Hardy’s corporate governance practices for the 
year ended 31 December 2011. Disclosures below include matters 
where Hardy has not fully complied during 2011 and its plans for 
compliance during 2012.
Leadership
The role of the Board
The Board sets the Group’s strategy, ensuring that the necessary 
resources are in place to achieve the agreed strategic priorities, and 
reviews management and financial performance. It is accountable to 
shareholders for the creation and delivery of strong, sustainable 
financial performance and long-term shareholder value. To achieve 
this, the Board directs and monitors the Company’s affairs within a 
framework of controls which enable risk to be assessed and managed 
effectively. The Board also has responsibility for setting the Group’s 
core values and standards of business conduct and for ensuring that 
these, together with the Group’s obligations to its stakeholders, are 
widely understood throughout the Company. The Board has a formal 
schedule of matters reserved which is provided later in this report.
Composition
At the beginning of 2011 the Company’s Board comprised a 
Non-Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Finance Director 
and three independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Effective 31 August 2011, Dinesh Dattani, the Finance Director 
of Hardy, ceased to be a Director of the Company. 
Subsequent to the year end, the Board approved the appointment of 
Alasdair Locke as Non-Executive Chairman, Ian MacKenzie as Chief 
Executive and Peter Milne as a Non-Executive Director. 
At the AGM to be held on 16 May 2012, shareholders will be asked 
to elect Alasdair Locke, Ian MacKenzie, and Peter Milne who were 
appointed to the Board in early 2012. In addition Pradip Shah is 
seeking re-election as Non-Executive and as previously announced 
Yogeshwar Sharma is seeking election as a Non-Executive Director 
Governance 
Corporate Governance Statement
following Mr MacKenzie’s appointment as Chief Executive. Dr Carol 
Bell, Ian Bruce and Paul Mortimer will not be seeking re-election and 
will step down from the Board at the Company’s next AGM. Further 
information is contained in the accompanying AGM circular.
Biographical details of the Board members are set out on page 28 
and 29 of this report. 
Following the Company’s AGM election the Board will comprise one 
Executive, a Non-Executive Chairman and three Non-Executives. The 
Non-Executive Directors have either held senior appointments in oil 
and gas companies, companies with interests in the energy sector or 
have significant corporate and financial experience and bring a broad 
range of business, technical and commercial experience to the Board. 
The Board believes that its composition is suitable for operating an 
effective publicly traded international junior oil and gas company. 
How the Board operates
The Board holds scheduled meetings regularly during the year and 
also meets on an ad hoc basis as required. The Board endeavours 
to arrange for one meeting to be held at its India based office. This 
provides senior managers from across several disciplines with the 
opportunity to present to the Board and to meet the Board members 
informally. It also provides the Board with an opportunity to meet 
a broad cross section of staff and to assess senior managers at  
first hand. 
During 2011 the Board met on 13 occasions. In addition to the formal 
meetings of the Board, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
maintained frequent contact with the other Directors to discuss any 
issues of concern they may have had relating to the Company and 
kept them fully briefed on the Group’s operations.
Set out below is a table showing attendance at Board meetings by the 
Directors during 2011.

The Board is pleased with the high level of attendance and 
participation by both Executive and Non-Executive Directors at Board 
and committee meetings. 
In addition to the formal meetings of the Board, the Executive 
Directors maintain frequent verbal and written contact with the 
Non-Executive Directors to discuss various issues affecting the 
Company and its business. In addition, the Board executes a 
number of resolutions in writing to conduct Company business.
The Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, meet without 
the Executive Directors present, generally at the end of every Board 
meeting. Matters arising out of such discussions are communicated 
to the Executive Directors as appropriate.
Information flow
The Chairman establishes the agenda for each Board meeting after 
consultation with other Directors. Business set out on Board agendas 
is discussed at each meeting with sufficient information provided to all 
the Directors. Board meeting agendas and supporting information and  Overview 
Business Review 
Governance 
Financial Statement 
Company Information 
working papers are circulated to each Director prior to each meeting. 
Directors are provided sufficient information on the basis of which to 
discuss relevant matters in order to allow Directors to be appropriately 
informed and able to make informed decisions.
At most Board meetings, the Board reviews future cash flows and 
historical financial information with respect to the business and affairs 
of the Company. In addition, the Directors are provided a status report 
on each of its exploration, development and production assets and a 
meaningful dialogue takes place. The Board receives reports of its 
various committees – Audit, Remuneration and Nomination – and 
takes appropriate action. Matters requiring resolutions are voted upon 
and approved if appropriate. Matters reserved specifically for Board 
approval are discussed and evaluated prior to approval. Decisions 
requiring Board approval in between scheduled Board meetings are 
made by circulating supporting information and approved unanimously 
in writing by the Directors.
Matters specifically reserved by the Board
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved that can only be 
decided by the Board. The key matters reserved are the consideration 
and approval of:
 – The Group’s overall strategy.
 – Financial statements and dividend policy.
 – Management structure including succession planning, appointments 
and remuneration (supported by the Nomination Committee).
 – Material acquisitions and disposal, material contracts, major capital 
expenditure projects and budgets.
 – Capital structure, debt and equity financing and other matters.
 – Risk management and internal controls (supported by the 
Audit Committee).
 – The Company’s corporate governance and compliance 
arrangements.
 – Corporate policies.
Subject to those reserved matters, the Board delegates authority for 
the management of the business primarily to the Executive Director 
and members of the Company’s Senior Executive team. Certain other 
matters are delegated to the Board committees, namely the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees.
Directors
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
There is a defined separation of the responsibilities between 
Non-Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer of the 
Company. The Chairman is primarily responsible for the effective 
working of the Board while the Chief Executive Officer is responsible 
for the operational management of the business, for developing 
strategy in consultation with the Board and for the implementation 
of the strategy. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
are exercised by different individuals.
For the year ended 31 December 2011, Mr Paul Mortimer was 
the Non-Executive Chairman of the Company. In January 2012 
Mr Alasdair Locke was appointed to the Board and subsequently 
assumed the role of Non-Executive Chairman. 
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors bring a broad range of business and 
commercial experience to the Company. The Board considers each  
of the Non-Executive Directors to be independent in character  
and judgement.
Mr Shah has served as a Non-Executive Director for a period of more 
than nine years and has previously been granted 260,333 options to 
purchase Ordinary Shares in the Company. Such options were granted 
upon the Company’s listing on AIM in June 2005. The Board has 
dispensed with the grant of stock options to the Non-Executive 
Directors since 2005. Notwithstanding this the Board is fully satisfied 
that he demonstrates complete independence, robustness of character 
and judgement both in his designated role and as a Board member.
Mr Sharma has previously been granted 1,280,700 options to 
purchase Ordinary Shares in the Company. Such options were issued 
as part of his remuneration package as an Executive Director of the 
Company. Notwithstanding that Mr Sharma has been an employee of 
the Company in the past five years the Board is fully satisfied that he 
demonstrates complete independence, robustness of character and 
judgement in his role as a Board member.
The Board acknowledges that most of the Non-Executive Directors 
have shareholdings in the Company thus expressing their confidence 
in the Company and its future.
Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director is available to meet shareholders 
if they have concerns that cannot be resolved through discussion 
with the Chairman, the Chief Executive, or for which such contact is 
inappropriate. For the year ended 31 December 2011 Dr Carol Bell 
was the Company’s Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. She 
will remain the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director until the 
Company’s next AGM when Mr Peter Milne will assume the role of 
Senior Independent Director.
Delegations of authority
Board Committees
The Board has established Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees, each of which has terms of reference (approved by 
the Board) setting out its authority and duties. The terms of reference 
for Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees can be found 
on the Company’s website. The Board considered various issues 
that would normally fall within the terms of reference of the various 
committees. All members of the Audit Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Nomination Committee are Non-Executive 
Directors. The membership and roles of these committees are 
detailed in a separate section of this report; the Audit Committee 
on pages 34 to 35, the Nomination Committee on page 41, and the 
Remuneration Committee on pages 36 to 40.
Executive Committee
The Board delegates authority for the management of the day-to-day 
business and operational matters to the Chief Executive Officer and other 
Executives. The Committee meets on a bi-weekly basis. The Committee 
currently comprises the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer of 
HEPI and the Treasurer & Corporate Affairs Executive.
Other governance matters
Independent professional advice
All of the Directors are aware that independent professional advice 
is available to each Director in order to properly discharge his or her 
duties as a Director. In addition, each Director and committee has 
access to the advice of the Company Secretary.
The Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is Richard Vanderplank who is retained on a 
consultancy basis. He is available to Directors and responsible for the 
Board complying with Isle of Man procedures. He is supported by the 
Treasurer & Corporate Affairs Executive in the provision of company 
secretarial services to the Company. Hardy Oil and Gas plc

Induction
All new Directors received an induction as soon as practical on joining 
the Board. This included meetings with the Executive Committee 
members and other senior management and, where appropriate, 
visits to the Company’s principal offices of operation. The new Directors 
were also provided an overview of their duties as a Director, corporate 
governance policies and established Board procedures as part of the 
induction process. An induction was given to Messrs Locke, MacKenzie 
and Milne at the beginning of 2012 and the process is ongoing.
In 2011, the Chairman reviewed training and development needs with 
each Director. It was agreed that each Director had the necessary 
current and relevant experience and expertise to effectively discharge 
their respective responsibilities.
Conflict of interest
A Director has a duty to avoid a situation in which he or she has, or 
can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may 
conflict with the interests of the Company. The Board had satisfied 
itself that there is no compromise to the independence of those 
Directors who have appointments on the Boards of, or relationships 
with, companies outside the Company. The Board requires Directors 
to declare all appointments and other situations which could result in 
a possible conflict of interest.
Board performance and evaluation
Hardy has a policy of appraising Board performance annually. Having 
reviewed various approaches to Board appraisal, Hardy has concluded 
that for a company of its current scale, an internal process in which all 
Board members submit answers to a questionnaire that considers the 
functionality of the Board and its committees, is most appropriate at this 
stage. This questionnaire also contains a series of questions to evaluate 
the performance of individual Board members and that of the Chairman. 
The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is responsible for 
reporting on this matter to the Remuneration Committee and to the 
Board, including reviewing the performance of the Chairman, with the 
exception of reviewing their own performance (which is carried out by 
the Chairman). The process of completing the performance evaluation 
of the Board as a whole, its Chairman, and individual Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors, was completed in early 201 1.
Each Director’s position is subject to satisfactory performance of their 
responsibilities and is subject to reappointment by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting. The Board of Directors is pleased with the 
attendance of all Directors at Board and committee meetings, despite 
significant travel and time requirements. The Board of Directors is also 
satisfied with the participation by all the Directors in formulating 
corporate strategies and for their engagement in meaningful dialogue 
and discussions at Board and committee meetings.
Business model
Hardy creates value through the exploration of undiscovered 
hydrocarbons. In order to explore we must first be granted a licence 
by the Government of the countries in which we choose to invest. 
After extensive analysis, exploration campaigns are planned to try to 
discover oil and gas fields within underexplored sedimentary basins. 
When we have a significant discovery we undertake appraisal 
programmes which may include the drilling of wells and further 
geotechnical analysis to determine the size and quality of the 
discovery. If the appraisal programme confirms that development of a 
discovery will be commercially and financially viable, we begin work on 
a development plan. This maps out how we will get the hydrocarbons 
into production to generate revenue and cash flow. We also create 
value through the implementation of enhanced production strategies 
to optimise the value of recoverable hydrocarbons from existing 
producing fields. 
Shareholder relations
Communication with shareholders is given high priority and there 
is regular dialogue with institutional investors, as well as general 
presentations made at the time of the release of the annual and interim 
results. All Directors are kept aware of changes in major shareholders 
in the Company and are available to meet with shareholders who have 
specific interests or concerns. The Company issues its results promptly 
to individual shareholders and also publishes them on the Company’s 
website: www.hardyoil.com. Regular updates to record news in relation 
to the Company and the status of its exploration and development 
programmes are included on the Company’s website. Shareholders 
and other interested parties can subscribe to receive these news 
updates by email by registering online on the website free of charge.
The Chairman and all Executive Directors are available to meet 
with institutional shareholders to discuss any issues and gain 
an understanding of the Company’s business, its strategies and 
governance. At the 2011 Annual General Meeting of shareholders, 
several directors were present including the Chairman. Dr Carol Bell 
currently serves in the capacity as the Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director of the Company and is available to shareholders 
if they have concerns that have not been resolved through the normal 
channels of Chairman or Executive Directors. Meetings are also held 
with the corporate governance representatives of institutional 
investors when requested.
Annual General Meeting
At every AGM individual shareholders are given the opportunity to 
put questions to the Chairman, and Executive Directors and to other 
members of the Board that may be present. Notice of the AGM is sent 
to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. Details 
of proxy votes for and against each resolution, together with the votes 
withheld are announced to the London Stock Exchange and are 
published on the Company’s website as soon as practical after  
the meeting.
Internal controls
The Board of Directors reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s 
system of internal controls in line with the requirement of the Code. 
The internal control system is designed to manage the risk of failure 
to achieve its business objectives. This covers internal financial and 
operational controls, compliances and risk management. The 
Company has necessary procedures in place for the year under 
review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and 
Accounts. The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the 
Company’s system of internal controls and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The Board confirms the need for an ongoing process 
for identification, evaluation and management of significant risks faced 
by the Company. A risk assessment for each project is carried out by 
a team consisting of the Executive Directors and senior management 
before making any commitments. This team meets as and when 
required. Internal and external risks, including exploration and 
development risks, regulatory and compliance obligations under 
various production-sharing contracts, economics including oil price, 
interest rate and currency exposure, as well as natural catastrophes 
are continuously assessed.
During 201 1, the Audit Committee reviewed and reported to the Board 
the effectiveness of the system of internal control through detailed 
consideration of the financial control procedures in place. Given the size 
of the Company, the relative simplicity of the systems and the close 
involvement of senior management, the Board considers that there is 
no current requirement for an internal audit function. The procedures 
that have been established to provide internal financial control are 
considered appropriate for a company of its size and include controls

The Directors are responsible for taking such steps as are reasonably available to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent

The Company’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future operations, financial position, and liquidity position are set out in

The Directors, having made due and careful enquiry, are of the opinion that the Company has adequate working capital to execute its operations 
and has the ability to access additional financing, if required, over the next 12 months. The Directors, therefore, have made an informed judgement, 
at the time of approving financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. As a result, the Directors have continued to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the annual financial statements in accordance with Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009.
Non-compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
The Company did not comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code in the following matters during 2011.
Code provision Subject matter Discussion
B.1.1 Non-Executive Directors meeting 
independence requirements
Paul Mortimer and Pradip Shah have served for more than nine years. 
As a result, under the Company’s policy, both Directors are subject to 
annual re-election.
Paul Mortimer, Pradip Shah and Carol Bell were granted share options  
in 2005 when the Company’s Ordinary Shares were listed on AIM.
The Board has confirmed, notwithstanding the above, that all of the 
Non-Executive Directors are independent.
C.3.4 Audit Committee whistleblower 
arrangements
The Audit Committee has made arrangements for the adoption of a formal 
whistleblower policy in conjunction with an overarching Employee Code 
of Conduct. 
The Employee Code of Conduct is expected to be adopted by the 
Board later in the year at which time a copy will be published on 
the Company website.
D.1.3 Remuneration for Non-Executive 
Directors should not include  
share options
Share options were granted in 2005 to Non-Executive Directors when 
the Company was listed on AIM and not subject to the Code. 
The Company has changed its policies whereby no share options have 
been granted to Non-Executive Directors since 2005.
The Board believes that its composition is suitable having regard to its international stature with a focus on India. Notwithstanding the long tenure 
of some of the Directors, the Board believes all of the Non-Executive Directors provide valuable advice and counsel in furthering the business 
objectives of the Company. 
Although Hardy is a publicly-listed company and has been listed on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities since 
February 2008, the Company continues to be an early stage exploration company with limited cash flows and a modest employee base of 
approximately 37 people. The Company has a clear mandate to optimise the allocation of limited resources to support its exciting exploration 
programme. As such, the Company strives to maintain a balance between conservation of limited resources and maintaining robust corporate 
governance practices. As the Company evolves, the Board is committed to addressing specific Code deficiencies and enhancing the 
Company’s corporate governance policies and practices deemed appropriate for the size and maturity of the organisation.

The Committee comprises four Non-Executive Directors and oversees 
the Company’s financial reporting and internal controls, and provides 
a formal reporting link with the external auditors. The full terms of 
reference for the Audit Committee are available on the Company’s 
website: www.hardyoil.com.
The Committee met four times during the year. The attendance of 
members at the Audit Committee meetings held in 201 1 was as follows:

Peter Milne** –
* Chairman of the Audit Committee until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting  
in May 2012
** Will be appointed Chairman following the Company’s next Annual General Meeting  
in May 2012 
The Audit Committee acts as a preparatory body for discharging 
the Board’s responsibilities in a wide range of financial matters by:
 – Monitoring the controls that are in place to ensure the integrity 
of the financial information reported to shareholders.
 – Reviewing significant financial reporting issues and accounting 
policies and disclosures in financial reports.
 – Overseeing that an effective system of internal control and risk 
management systems are maintained.
 – Overseeing the relationship with the external auditors, reviewing 
the scope and results of audits.
 – Providing a forum for reporting by the Group’s external auditors, 
including regular in-camera discussions.
 – Approving non-audit services provided by the external auditors, 
or any other accounting firm.
 – Ensuring the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditors is safeguarded when appointing them to conduct 
non-audit services.
 – Ensuring compliance with legal requirements, accounting 
standards and the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules.
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the Annual 
Report and Accounts and the half-yearly reports remains with the 
Board. Some or all Executive Directors attend meetings of the Audit 
Committee by invitation.
The Code requires that at least one member of the Audit Committee 
has recent and relevant financial experience. Dr Carol Bell, who was 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee for 2011, has over 30 years of 
oil and gas sector experience, most recently as managing director 
of Chase Manhattan’s Global Oil & Gas Group. Mr Ian Bruce is a CA, 
CBV and CF and until his retirement in 2011 was the co-chairman of 
Peters & Co. Limited, an independent, fully integrated investment 
dealer in the Canadian energy sector. Mr Pradip Shah is also a 
chartered accountant. As a result the Board is satisfied that the 
Audit Committee has recent and relevant financial experience.
The Company’s external auditors are Crowe Clark Whitehill LLP and 
the Audit Committee closely monitors the level of audit and non-audit 
services they provide to the Group. In 2011 Crowe Clark Whitehill did 
not provide non-audit services to the Company.
In 2011 the Finance Director and the Chief Financial Officer of Hardy 
Exploration & Production (India) Inc. were invited to attend each 
meeting of the Audit Committee during 2011. The external auditors 
have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee Chairman. During 
the 2011 audit process, the Audit Committee Chairman met with the 
audit engagement partner from Crowe Clark Whitehill, without the 
presence of management.
In 2011, the Audit Committee met on four occasions. The key work 
undertaken by the Committee was as follows:
Consideration and review of full-year and half-yearly results
 – The Audit Committee met with the external auditors as part of the 
full-year and half-yearly accounts approval process.
Audit planning and update on relevant accounting developments
 – The Audit Committee approved the scope of the work to be 
undertaken by the external auditors for interim and year-end 
statutory audits.
Consideration and approval of the risk management framework, 
appropriateness of key performance indicators
 – The Audit Committee considered the recommendations put 
forward by the Executive to adopt a risk management framework 
which provides for a systematic approach to risk identification 
and management which combines the Board’s assessment of risk 
with risk factors originating from and identified by the Group’s 
senior management.
 – The Executive provided clear updates of risk and uncertainties 
facing the Company and accompanying actions to mitigate such 
risk for the Company’s Interim and Annual reports.
 – The Audit Committee undertook a review of the key performance 
indicators that had been adopted by the Company in previous 
years. As a result of the review the Company has modified its 
reported key performance indicators for 2011.
Absence of Financial Director
 – With the retirement of Dinesh Dattani as Finance Director 
and subsequent to the Board’s decision not to appoint another 
Financial Executive to the Board, the Audit Committee considered 
the appropriateness of previous year-end audit practices. 
Mr Jeevanandam (CFO of HEPI) has previously been significantly 
involved in the preparation and delivery of the Company’s year-end 
report and accounts and would continue to do so. The Chairman 
of the Committee agreed to be available to provide a higher level 
of oversight during this year’s Audit process.
Review of accounting policy for exploration and evaluation assets 
and the adoption of successful efforts method of accounting
 – The Audit Committee regularly reviews the overall reasonableness 
of the Company’s accounting policies. For the 2011 accounts the 
Audit Committee requested that management and the external 
auditor (Crowe Clark Whitehill) provided the Audit Committee with 
information to enable it to assess whether the full cost method of 
accounting for its oil and gas assets is consistent with those used 
by peer companies in the upstream oil and gas industry.
 – Following the review the Audit Committee deemed that the 
successful efforts method of accounting provided a reasonable 
and appropriate presentation in line with the Company’s 
international oil and gas peers. As a result the Committee 
recommended the restatement of the Company’s 2010 and 
2011 accounts.

Review of the Company’s internal control system
 – During 2011, the Audit Committee reviewed and reported to the 
Board on the effectiveness of the system of internal control through 
detailed consideration of the financial control procedures in place. 
Given the size of the Company, the relative simplicity of the 
systems and the close involvement of senior management, the 
Committee considers that there is no current requirement for an 
internal audit function.
 – The procedures that have been established to provide internal 
financial control are considered appropriate for a company of its 
size and include controls over expenditure, regular reconciliations 
and management accounts. Most of the assets are owned jointly 
with others, budgets and expenditures are rigorously reviewed and 
approvals as well as project audits take place with respect to 
capital and operating expenditures on a regular basis.
The Code states that the Audit Committee should have primary 
responsibility for making a recommendation on the appointment, 
reappointment or removal of the external auditors. On the basis of the 
review of external audit effectiveness, the Committee recommended 
to the Board that it recommends to shareholders the re-appointment 
of the auditors at the Company’s 2012 Annual General Meeting.

This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the financial 
Services Authority. The relevant legislation requires the Auditors to 
report to the Company’s members on the ‘auditable part’ of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and to state whether, in their opinion, 
the part of the report that has been subject to audit has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the relevant legislation. This report is 
therefore divided into separate sections to disclose the audited and 
unaudited information.
Unaudited information
The Company’s Remuneration Committee comprises three Non-
Executive Directors: Mr Pradip Shah (Chairman), Mr Paul Mortimer, 
and Dr Carol Bell. Hardy’s Remuneration Committee operates within 
the terms of reference approved by the Board.
The attendance of members at the Remuneration Committee 
meetings held in 2011 was as follows:
Director Meetings attended
Pradip Shah* 4
Paul Mortimer 4
Dr Carol Bell 4
* Chairman of the Committee
Main responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee considers remuneration policy, 
employment terms and remuneration of the Executive Directors 
and also reviews the remuneration of senior management. The 
Remuneration Committee’s role is advisory in nature and it makes 
recommendations to the Board on the overall remuneration packages 
for Executive Directors in order to attract, retain and motivate high 
quality executives capable of achieving the Group’s objectives. The 
Remuneration Committee also reviews proposals for the share option 
plans and other incentive plans, makes recommendations for the grant 
of awards under such plans as well as approving the terms of any 
performance-related pay schemes. 
None of the Directors participate in any discussion or votes on any 
proposal relating to his or her own remuneration. The Board’s policy 
is to remunerate the Group’s senior executives fairly and in such a 
manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of 
suitably qualified personnel. The Remuneration Committee, while 
considering the remuneration packages of Hardy executives, has 
reviewed the policies of comparable groups in the industry. The 
remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the 
Chairman and the Executive Directors outside the framework of 
the Remuneration Committee.
Committee advisors
In the past the Remuneration Committee had engaged Simon 
Patterson of Patterson Associates as a Remuneration Consultant 
to assist the committee in setting the remuneration of Executive 
Directors and Non-Executive Directors. No remuneration advisors 
were retained by the committee during 2011.
Statement of Hardy’s policy on Directors’ remuneration
The Company has established levels of remuneration that are 
appropriate to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of 
the quality required to run its business successfully. A significant 
proportion of Executive Directors’ remuneration is structured so as to 
link rewards to corporate and individual performance, align their 
interests with those of shareholders and to incentivise them to perform 
at the highest levels. The Remuneration Committee considers 
remuneration policy and the employment terms and remuneration of 
the Executive and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors 
on the overall remuneration packages for the Executives. 
The main goals of Hardy’s remuneration policy are to reward past 
performance, incentivise future performance, encourage teamwork, 
retain Company talent and assure alignment with shareholders. These 
goals are achieved by maintaining appropriate base salaries, annual 
cash bonuses and providing a systematic annual grant of options. 
All incentive compensation levels are subject to recommendations 
of the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board.
Executive remuneration
Base salaries
Base salaries of Executive Directors are reviewed on an annual basis. 
No changes to base salaries have been made since 1 July 2007 
except for the Chief Executive Officer whose base salary was 
increased effective 1 April 2010. 
Annual bonus
Although the Company has the policy of awarding cash bonuses, no 
such awards have been made to Executive Directors to date. In the 
future, the Remuneration Committee will consider recommending the 
total amount available for annual bonuses having regard to the cash 
requirement and overall performance of the Group. The size of the 
bonus will correspond to the salary of the Executive Director and each 
participant based upon performance targets, including corporate, 
team and individual performance measures. Any cash bonus shall be 
targeted at 20 per cent of base salary and shall not exceed 40 per 
cent of base salary. Each year, transparent objectives will be set for 
each participant.
Share options
The Company has adopted a policy of granting stock option awards 
on an annual basis although stock option awards cannot be made 
during close periods. The Board believes that equity incentives are 
and will continue to be an important means of retaining, attracting 
and motivating Directors, senior management and key employees. 
Accordingly, in June 2005, the Board adopted the share option 
scheme entitling the Company to award options to Directors 
and employees. The Company’s share option scheme has been 
considered and approved by the shareholders in 2006. Options 
are not granted at a discount to the market value. Under the scheme, 
options are exercisable between the 1st and 10th anniversaries of 
the date of grant. Options granted in June 2005 were subject to 
performance conditions whereby the share price of Hardy would 
need to rise by 20 per cent, 45 per cent and 70 per cent of the price 
at which the Hardy IPO was undertaken. In the first year of the 
performance period, one third of the options will become exercisable 
at or after 12 months following the date of grant. One third of the 
options will become exercisable at or after 24 months following the 
date of grant. The remaining one third of the options will become 
exercisable at or after 36 months following the date of grant. All of 
such performance conditions have been met.
All options granted in 2010 and subsequent years, will generally 
vest between the third and fifth anniversary of the date of grant 
(the “Vesting Period”) subject to the satisfaction of a Performance 
Condition. The Performance Condition shall be satisfied where at any 
time during the Vesting Period, the volume weighted average market 
price of an Ordinary Share for any ten consecutive London Stock 
Exchange trading days is equal to or greater than the Ordinary Share 
price of the Company on the date of grant as increased by 
compounded growth of 5 per cent per annum in the share price as at 
the end of such 10 day period. In the event that the Performance

Condition is not satisfied by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options shall lapse. Options will vest immediately upon the occurrence of a 
Rule 8 Event under the unapproved share option scheme (relating to change of control etc).
Following shareholder consultation in 2011 regarding the awarding of share options, the Remuneration Committee will consider the setting 
of performance conditions such as multiple tests for vesting share options, relative performance as a benchmark, and internal targets.
Pension and other benefits
The Company provides for pension contributions to Executive Directors, personal pension plans as well as life and medical insurance. 
Non-Executive remuneration
Policy
The main goals of the Company’s remuneration policy for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are to assure alignment with shareholders 
through independence, recognise time commitments devoted to corporate affairs and attract and retain outstanding candidates.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors outside the framework of the 
Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. The fees paid are set at a level to attract individuals with the necessary 
experience and ability to make a significant contribution to the Company’s activities, while also reflecting the time commitment and responsibility 
of the role. None of the Directors participate in any discussion or votes on any proposal relating to his or her own remuneration. 
Director fees
Each Non-Executive Director currently receives an annual fee of £36,000. Mr Mortimer received an additional annual fee of £12,000 to reflect 
his additional responsibilities as Chairman. Each Non-Executive Director is also entitled to the reimbursement of necessary travel and other 
expenses. Mr Locke was appointed as Non-Executive Chairman of Hardy on 13 January 2012 and is entitled to receive an annual fee of 
£100,000. Mr Milne was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 1 March 2012 and is entitled to receive an annual fee of £50,000.
Restricted share awards
Effective 1 January 2009, restricted shares are to be issued to the Chairman and each Non-Executive Director on an annual basis. The 
number of restricted shares to be issued will be equivalent to 25 per cent of their annual fee based on the market value of Hardy shares on 
the last trading day prior to the date of issue. These shares will remain restricted for three years from the date of issue. The shares will become 
unrestricted and are delivered to the individual three years after the date of issue. The share award will be in addition to the annual cash fee. In 
the event of a close period, such shares will not be issued until after the close period is over. In the event of change of control of Hardy and the 
participant is no longer a Director going forward, all of the restricted shares will vest. In the event of death of a Director, all shares will become 
fully vested. Upon the Director not being re-elected at a general meeting of shareholders after offering himself for re-election as a Director at a 
general meeting, the shares will vest. In all other circumstances, shares that will remain restricted are forfeited if the participant is no longer a 
Director of Hardy. In addition, the Board has discretion to accelerate vesting on a date determined by it.
A one-time restricted share award may be made to a new Non-Executive Director on joining the Board. Such an award was made to Messrs 
Alasdair Locke and Peter Milne upon their appointments as Directors in January and February 2012. The Company was in a closed period at 
the time of their respective appointments; as such the issuance of restricted shares will be executed following the publication of the Company’s 
preliminary results. Such shares will be held in trust and will be released after three years from the date of issue (subject to earlier release in 
certain circumstances) provided they remain Directors of the Company for that period.
Legacy share option awards to Non-Executive Directors
Mr Paul Mortimer, Mr Pradip Shah, and Dr Carol Bell have previously been granted options to purchase Ordinary Shares of Hardy in the past. 
Executive Directors were granted stock options during October 2010. No options have been granted to Non-Executive Directors since 2005. 
Options will be forfeited if a Director resigns before the options vest. In other circumstances, the vesting of options will be at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee and Board approval. In the event of a change of control, all of the unvested options will vest. Options granted following 
the initial public offering in June 2005 were subject to performance conditions based upon appreciation in the price of Ordinary Shares of the 
Company. All of the performance conditions have been met. Subsequent options granted have been subject to vesting provisions over a three 
year period, commencing from the anniversary of the date of grant.  Hardy Oil and Gas plc

No price was paid for any grant of options by the Directors to the 
Company. There were no variations made during the year in the terms 
and conditions with respect to any outstanding share options granted 
by the Company.
Options granted on 7 June 2005 are subject to performance criteria 
based upon appreciation in the market value of Ordinary Shares of the 
Company. All of such performance conditions have been met. All 
subsequent options granted to the end of 2009 are subject to vesting 
provisions whereby one third of the options granted vest on each of 
the three anniversaries from the date of grant. All options granted in 
2010 and subsequent years, will generally vest between the third and 
fifth anniversary of the date of grant (the “Vesting Period”) subject 
to the satisfaction of a Performance Condition. The Performance 
Condition shall be satisfied where at any time during the Vesting 
Period, the volume weighted average market price of an Ordinary 
Share for any 10 consecutive London Stock Exchange trading days is 
equal to or greater than the Ordinary Share price of the Company on 
the date of grant as increased by compounded growth of 5 per cent 
per annum in the share price as at the end of such 10 day period. In 
the event that the Performance Condition is not satisfied by the fifth 
anniversary of the date of grant, the options shall lapse. Options will 
vest immediately upon the occurrence of a Rule 8 Event under the 
unapproved share option scheme (relating to change of control etc).
No share options were exercised by any of the Directors of the 
Company during 2011.
On 30 December 201 1, the market price of an Ordinary Share of Hardy 
was £1.46 per share. The highest and lowest market price of an Ordinary 
Share of Hardy during 201 1 was £2.41 and £1.39 respectively.
Restricted shares
As mentioned above, the Board of Directors has adopted a policy 
whereby restricted shares will be issued to the Chairman and each 
Non-Executive Director on an annual basis. The number of restricted 
shares to be issued will be equivalent to 25 per cent of their annual 
cash fee based on the market value of Hardy shares on the last 
trading day prior to the date of issue. These shares will remain 
restricted for three years. The share award will be in addition to the 
annual cash fee. In the event of change of control of Hardy and the 
participant is no longer a Director going forward, all of the restricted 
shares will vest. In the event of death of a Director, all shares will 
become fully vested. Upon the Director not being re-elected at a 
general meeting of shareholders after offering himself for re-election 
as a Director at a general meeting, the shares will vest. In all other 
circumstances, shares that are still restricted are forfeited if the 
participant is no longer a Director of Hardy. In the event of a close 
period, the restricted shares will, subject to Board approval, 
be issued after the close period is over.

three times during the year. The attendance of members at the 
Nomination Committee meetings held in 201 1 was as follows:
Director Meetings attended
Ian Bruce (Chairman) 3
Pradip Shah 3
Dr Carol Bell 3
Responsibilities
The Nomination Committee considers the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and senior executive team, retirements, 
replacements and appointments of additional Directors, reviews 
succession plans for the Directors and makes recommendations to 
the Board on membership of the Board, the Board’s other committees 
and other matters within its remit.
Key matters considered by the Committee during the year and 
subsequent to the year-end:
Chairmanship – In 2011 Mr Paul Mortimer expressed to the 
Committee his interest to step down as Chairman of the Board but 
indicated that he was prepared to continue as a Director if required. 
Mr Mortimer had been the Chairman of the Board for over nine years. 
The Committee reviewed the current composition of the Board, 
discussed and agreed to the key criteria for the identification of 
candidates. The Committee noted the additional time commitment 
expected and recognised the need for availability in the event of 
crises for a Chairman of a small exploration and production company. 
The Nomination Committee engaged a specialist search consultancy 
to assist in the identification of candidates. Following extensive 
shareholder consultation the Nomination Committee recommended 
the appointment of Mr Locke. Mr Locke was appointed to the Board 
on 16 January 2012.
Executive Director – In 2011, it was agreed that Mr Dinesh Dattani, 
Finance Director, would cease to be a Director of the Company 
effective 31 August 2011. Following a review of the Board’s 
composition it was agreed that Mr Dattani’s position as Finance 
Director based in London would not be filled. The Nomination 
Committee recommended that Executives Messrs Jeevanandam 
and Galvin would assume additional responsibilities, effective 
1 September 2011. 
Subsequent to the year end the Nomination Committee has also 
facilitated the appointment of a new Chief Executive and an 
additional Non-Executive Director
Chief Executive succession – In late 2011 Mr Sharma had indicated 
his intention to cease being an Executive Director and his desire to 
continue as a Non-Executive Director following the recruitment of an 
appropriate candidate. The Company disclosed Mr Sharma’s intention 
in January 2012 in conjunction with Mr Locke’s appointment as 
Chairman. Mr Locke subsequently put forward a candidate for the 
Nomination Committee to consider. Members of the Nomination 
Committee undertook a number of interviews with the candidate.  
As a result, the Nomination Committee recommended to the Board 
the appointment of Ian MacKenzie as Chief Executive Officer.
Non-Executive appointment – A number of Non-Executive Directors 
have indicated to the Board that they will not be putting themselves 
forward for re-election at the Company’s Annual General Meeting in 
2012. The departing Non-Executive Directors include Dr Carol Bell, 
Mr Paul Mortimer and myself. As Dr Carol Bell and I have extensive 
relevant financial experience and expertise it was agreed to identify a 
candidate with current and relevant financial experience and expertise. 
Mr Locke subsequently put forward a candidate who members of the 
Nomination Committee interviewed. As a result the Nomination 
Committee recommended the appointment of Peter Milne as 
Non-Executive Director.

the Directors are required to:

 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position

Internal control and risk management systems
The Board has the ultimate responsibility for the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems. The Audit Committee monitors

involving an appropriate degree of oversight by senior management in 
each of the business units in which it operates.

terms of payment when contracting for goods or services and 
generally abide by those payment terms. Normal credit terms are 
generally 30 days.

Company Information 
We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Hardy Oil and Gas plc for the year ended 
31 December 2011 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated and Parent Company Statements  
of Financial Position, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Cash Flows, the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of 
Changes in Equity, and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004.
This report is made solely to the parent company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 15 of the Isle of Man Companies Act 1982. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and 
of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
 – the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Emphasis of matter – request for extension of an exploration licence
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not qualified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in notes 2 
and 15 to the financial statements concerning the process of arbitration with the Government of India for an extension of the exploration licence 
in block CY-OS/2. Intangible assets – exploration include an amount capitalised of US$51,023,493 in respect of block CY-OS/2. In the event 
that the Group is not successful in the arbitration, the exploration expenditure capitalised in respect of this block will be subject to impairment 
testing. No adjustment has been made to the carrying value of this capitalised expenditure.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Isle of Man Companies Acts 1931 to 2004 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – the parent company and the Group have not kept proper accounting records; 
 – the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns;
 – if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or 
 – if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the Directors’ Report and consider the implication for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or inconsistencies 
within it. The information in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Review of Operations and Financial Review 
that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 – the Directors’ Statement in relation to going concern;

Governance Code specified for our review; and
 – certain elements of the Board of Directors’ Remuneration Report to shareholders.

1. Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied in preparation of consolidated financial statements of Hardy Oil and Gas plc (Hardy or the 
Group). The domicile, country of incorporation, address of the registered office and a description of the Group’s principal activities can be found 
in the Director’s Report.
a) Basis of measurement
Hardy prepares its financial statements on a historical cost basis except as otherwise stated. 
b) Going concern
The Group has a history of profitable operations and has successfully raised financing in the past to provide funding for its ongoing exploration 
and development programmes and to augment its working capital. Having considered the guidance given in the document Going concern and 
liquidity risk: Guidance for Directors issued in October 2009 by the Financial Reporting Council and having regard to the Group’s existing 
working capital position and its ability to raise potential financing, if required, the Directors are of the opinion that the Group has adequate 
resources to enable it to undertake its planned work programme of exploration, appraisal and development activities over the next 12 months 
from the date of this financial statement.
c) Basis of preparation
Hardy prepares its financial statements in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the European Union.
As at the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations were in issue but not yet effective:
Issued but not yet EU adopted
IFRS 1 Amendments – Severe hyper inflation and removal of fixed dates for first time adoption 
IFRS 9 – Financial instruments
IFRS 10 – Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 11 – Joint Arrangements
IFRS 12 – Disclosure of Interests in other entities
IFRS 13 – Fair value measurement
IAS 1 – (amended) – Presentation of items of other comprehensive income
IAS 12 – (amended) – Deferred tax: Recovery of underlying Assets
IAS 19 – (amended) – Employee Benefits
IAS 27 – Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
IFRIC 20 – Stripping costs in the production Phase of a surface mine
Issued and EU adopted
IFRS 7 (amended) – Financial instruments disclosures
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future reporting periods will have a material impact on 
the Group’s results.
d) Change in accounting policies
Hardy was following the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas assets wherein all expenditures incurred in connection with and directly 
attributable to the acquisition, exploration and appraisal of oil and gas assets were accumulated and capitalised in its India cost pool.
Hardy has elected to change to a successful efforts based accounting policy for its oil and gas assets with retrospective effect. Hardy believes 
this will align its accounting policy with its international peers and provide a better reflection of the results of its activities as well as its 
financial position.
The effect of change in this policy is writing off the cost of the unsuccessful wells capitalised in the books since inception and the associated 
cost of geological and geophysical activities. In addition, the depletion of property, plant and equipment – development/producing assets were 
charged by considering the future cost of development with the associated proved and probable reserves under the unit of production method. 
The cumulative costs of exploration of dry wells and the related costs charged up to the year 2009 are US$50,663,569, the costs charged for 
2010 are US$1,827,418 and the costs charged for 2011 are US$3,432,734. 
The change in computing the depletion and decommissioning charges without considering the future costs and the associated recoverable 
reserves for the period up to December 2009 is US$24,785,043 and cost for the year 2010 is US$3,31 1,744. The depletion and decommissioning 
charge for the year 2011 is US$1,587,531.
The effect of change in this policy for the subsequent years are not possible to predict and therefore no quantification is made. 
The effect of change in the accounting policy reduces the total carrying value of Intangible Assets – Exploration by US$55,923,721.

Financial Statement 
Company Information 
1. Accounting policies continued
The change in the method for computing the depletion impacted a reduction in the profit for 2011 by US$125,669 (2010:US$289,409) and 
increased the profit by US$975,410 for the period up to 2009. 
Accordingly, the corresponding amount charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year 2011 is US$3,558,403 and for the 
year 2010 is US$2,116,827 and the amount adjusted in the retaining earning for the period up to 2009 after adjusting deferred tax impact is 
US$35,775,474.
e) Functional and presentation currency
These financial statements are presented in US dollars which is the Group’s functional currency. All financial information presented is rounded to 
the nearest US dollar.
f) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results of Hardy Oil and Gas plc and its subsidiary undertakings. The Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows include the results and cash flows of subsidiary undertakings up to 
the date of disposal. 
The Group conducts the majority of its exploration, development and production through unincorporated joint arrangements with other companies.
The consolidated financial statements reflect the Group’s share of production revenues and costs attributable to its participating interests under 
the proportional consolidation method.
g) Revenue and other income
Revenue represents the sale value of the Group’s share of oil which excludes the profit oil sold and paid to the Government of India as part of 
profit sharing, tariff, and income from technical services to third parties if any. Revenues are recognised when crude oil has been lifted and title 
has been passed to the buyer or when services are rendered.
h) Joint ventures
The Group participates in several unincorporated joint ventures which involve the joint control of assets used in the Group’s oil and gas 
exploration and producing activities. The Group accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of joint ventures in the 
Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Comprehensive Income as appropriate. 
i) Oil and gas assets
i) Exploration and evaluation assets
Hardy has adopted the successful efforts based accounting policy for its oil and gas assets. 
Costs incurred prior to acquiring the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately in the income statement.
Expenditures incurred in connection with and directly attributable to the acquisition, exploration and appraisal of oil and gas assets are 
capitalised for each licence granted under the production sharing contracts and are undepleted within intangible exploration assets until the 
validity to explore the contract area is ended or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred for geological and geophysical activities before the commencement of exploratory drilling is initially capitalised 
within intangible exploration assets. Exploration drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise of the 
well has been established. The success or failure is assessed on a well-by-well basis. Exploration well costs are written off on completion of the 
well unless the results indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which have reasonable commercial potential. 
Following appraisal of successful exploration, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction is demonstrated, 
the related capitalised intangible exploration and appraisal costs are transferred into a cost centre within the Property Plant and Equipment – 
development assets after testing for impairment, if any. Where exploration well results indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately 
not considered commercially viable, all related costs will be written-off to the income statement. 
ii) Oil and gas development and producing assets
Development and production assets are accumulated on a field-by-field basis. These comprise the cost of developing commercial reserves discovered 
to put them on production and the exploration and evaluation costs transferred from intangible exploration and evaluation assets, as stated in the policy 
above. In addition, interest payable and exchange differences incurred on borrowings directly attributable to development projects, if any, and assets in 
the production phase, as well as cost of recognising provision for future restoration and decommissioning, are capitalised.
iii) Decommissioning
At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning facilities, plugging and abandoning wells. The full 
discounted cost of decommissioning costs are estimated and considered as an asset and liability when the liability arises. The decommissioning 
cost is included within the cost of property, plant and equipment development assets. If any revision in the estimated cost of decommissioning 
which alters the provisions required also adjusted in the cost of asset. The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit of production basis 
based on proved reserves, is shown as ‘Decommissioning charge’ in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and unwinding of the discount 
on the provision is included in the finance costs. Hardy Oil and Gas plc

1. Accounting policies continued
iv) Disposal of assets
Proceeds from any disposal of assets are credited against the specific capitalised costs included in the relevant cost pool and any loss or gain 
on disposal is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Gain or loss arising on disposal of a subsidiary is also recorded in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
 
j) Depletion and impairment 
i) Depletion
The net book values of the producing assets are depreciated on a field-by-field basis using the unit of production method, based on proved and 
probable reserves. Hardy periodically obtains an independent third party assessment of reserves which is used as a basis for computing depletion. 
ii) Impairment
Exploration assets are reviewed regularly for indications of impairment following the guidance in IFRS 6 Exploration and Evaluation of 
Mineral Resources, where circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable. In such circumstances, if the exploration 
asset has a corresponding development/producing cost pool, then the exploration costs are transferred to the cost pool and depleted on unit 
of production. In cases where no such development/producing cost pool exists, the impairment of exploration costs is recognised in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income. Impairment reviews on development/producing oil and gas assets for each field are carried out each 
year by comparing the net book value of the cost pool with the associated discounted future cash flows. If there is any impairment in a field 
representing a material component of the cost pool, an impairment test is carried out for the cost pool as a whole. If the net book value of the 
cost pool is higher than the associated discounted future cash flows, the excess amount is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income as impairment and deducted from the pool value. 
k) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets are measured at cost and depreciated over their expected useful economic lives 
as follows:
Annual  
rate (%)
Depreciation  
method
Leasehold improvements over lease period Straight-line
Furniture and fixtures 20% Straight-line
Information technology and computers 33% Straight-line
Other equipment 20% Straight-line
l) Intangible assets
Intangible assets other than oil and gas assets are measured at cost and depreciated over their expected useful economic lives as follows:
Annual  
rate (%)
Depreciation  
method
Computer software 33% Straight-line
m) Investments 
Investments by the parent company in its subsidiaries are stated at cost. 
n) Short-term investments
Short-term investments are regarded as ‘financial assets at fair value through profit or loss’ and are carried at fair value. In practice, the nature of 
these investments is such that the fair value equates to the value of initial outlay and therefore in normal circumstances no fair value gain or loss is 
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
o) Inventory
Inventory of crude oil is valued at the lower of average cost and net realisable value. Average cost is determined based on actual production cost 
for the year. Inventories of drilling stores are recorded at cost including taxes, duties and freight. Provision is made for obsolete or defective items 
where appropriate, based on technical evaluation.
p) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised at fair value in the Group’s Statement of Financial Position based on the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables are not interest bearing and their fair value is deemed to be their nominal value as reduced by necessary provisions for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables are not interest bearing and their fair value is deemed to be their nominal value.
q) Equity
Equity instruments issued by Hardy and the Group are recorded at net proceeds after direct issue costs. Overview 
Business Review 
Governance 
Financial Statement 
Company Information 
1. Accounting policies continued
r) Taxation
Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on the taxable profit of the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
as it excludes certain items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in years other than the current year, and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The current tax liability is calculated using the tax rates that have been enacted or subsequently enacted by 
the year-end date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investment in subsidiaries, associates and interest in joint ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be 
controlled and it is possible that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the year-end date, where transactions 
or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less or to receive more tax.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which 
temporary differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the year-end date.
s) Foreign currencies
Foreign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the year-end date, all foreign 
currency monetary assets and monetary liabilities are restated at the closing rate. Exchange difference arising out of actual payments/realisations 
and from the year-end restatement are reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Rates of exchanges are as follows:
31 December 
2011
31 December 
2010
£ to US$ 1.5447 1.5544
US$ to Indian Rupees 53.24 44.92
t) Leasing commitments
Rental charges or charter hire charges payable under operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income as part  
of production cost over the lease term. 
u) Share-based payments
Hardy issues share options to Directors and employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of the equity-settled 
options determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. In performing the valuation of these options, 
only conditions other than the market conditions are taken into account. Fair value is derived by use of the binomial model. The expected life 
used in the model is based on management estimates and considers non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the 
related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.
(i) Intangible assets – exploration 
The Group holds a 75 per cent participating interest in the block CY-OS/2 off the east coast of India. Intangible assets include an amount of 
US$51,023,493 with respect to exploration expenditures on the block wherein a gas discovery was announced on 8 January 2007. The exploration 
period for the block ended on 23 March 2007. The Government of India (GOI) has been requested to extend the block for appraisal and declaration 
of commerciality for its gas discovery for a period of 5 years from the date of discovery. This request was declined. The Production Sharing Contract 
(PSC) provides for a period of 60 months from the date of discovery for declaration of commerciality in case of a discovery being Non-Associated 
Natural Gas (NANG). This period will be limited to 24 months for an oil discovery. Hardy Oil and Gas plc

54/55
Financial Statement
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2011
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
The Group has obtained third party legal and technical opinions that support the Group’s view that the discovery is NANG and has referred the 
dispute to arbitration for adjudication. The Group believes that it will be successful in obtaining the extension of its licence in block CY-OS/2 in 
the arbitration. Therefore, the intangible assets arising from expenditure on this block continue to be recognised in full and the Directors do not 
believe that any impairment of these costs has arisen.
The arbitration process is continuing as at the date of approval of these financial statements.
(ii) Decommissioning
The liability for decommissioning is updated to the current cost estimates of decommissioning. Accordingly, the provision made in the books 
will reflect the risk free discounted future cost for decommissioning and this is an annual adjustment based on the changes in costs as a result 
of technical advancements and other factors. A 5 per cent change in the liability for decommissioning will impact the decommissioning charge 
by US$48,729. A 5 per cent change in proven developed reserves will impact the decommissioning charge by US$55,568.
(iii) Depletion
Depletion is based on best estimates of commercial reserves existing as at the year-end date. The determination of commercial reserves is 
based on assumptions which include those relating to the future prices of crude oil and natural gas, capital expenditure plans, cost of production 
and other factors. A 5 per cent change in proven developed reserves will impact the depletion charge by US$65,827. 
3. Segment analysis
The Group is organised into two business units as at end of the year: India and United Kingdom. The India business unit is operated by the 
wholly-owned subsidiary, Hardy Exploration & Production (India) Inc. and Hardy Oil and Gas plc operates in the United Kingdom. 
The India business unit focuses on exploration and production of oil and gas assets in India. The United Kingdom business unit is the holding 
company. Management monitors these business units separately for resource allocation, decision-making and performance assessment.

The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted outstanding as at 31 December 2011 is US$5,812,019. The inputs into the 
binomial model for computation of value of options are as follows:
Share price at grant date varies from £1.44 to £7.69
Option exercise price at grant date varies from £1.44 to £7.69
Expected volatility 8% – 40%
Expected life 6 years from grant date
Risk free rate 4.35% – 4.70%
Expected dividend Nil
Expected volatility was determined by calculating Hardy’s historical volatility. The expected life used has been adjusted based on management’s 
best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. Details of outstanding options at the end 
of the year with the weighted average exercise (WAEP) price are as follows:

Indian operations of the Group are subject to a tax rate of 42.23 per cent which is higher than UK and US corporation tax rates. To the extent that 
the Indian profits are taxable in the US and/or the UK, those territories should provide relief for Indian taxes paid, principally under the provisions 
of double taxation agreements. Based on the current expenditure plans, the Group anticipates that the tax allowances will continue to exceed the 
depletion charge of each year, though the timing of related tax relief is uncertain. Overview

The provision has been made by estimating the decommissioning cost at current prices using existing technology. The inflation and discount 
rates applied have been based on suitable current market information. Decommissioning costs are expected to be incurred between 2018 
and 2020. 
The calculation of the provision has been changed to apply a discounted method. This change in the method of calculation is deemed to be a 
change of accounting estimate and is applied prospectively from the year ended 31 December 2011. 
It is anticipated that the effect of the change in accounting estimate will be neutral over future periods to the anticipated date of decommissioning.
An amount of Rs.198,984,770 (US$3,737,505) has been deposited with State Bank of India for site restoration obligations. This amount has

25. Financial risk management
Hardy finances its operations through a mixture of equity and retained earnings. Finance requirements are reviewed by the Board when funds are 
required for acquisition, exploration and development of projects.
Hardy’s policy is to maintain a strong financial position to sustain future development of the business. There were no changes to the Group’s 
capital management approach during the year.
Hardy treasury functions are responsible for managing fund requirements and investments which includes banking and cash flow management. 
Interest and foreign exchange exposure are key functions of treasury management to ensure adequate liquidity at all times to meet 
cash requirements. 
Hardy’s principal financial instruments are cash, deposits and short-term investments and these instruments are for the purpose of meeting its 
requirements for operations. 
Hardy’s main risks arising from financial instruments are foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, commodity price risk and credit risks. Set out below 
are policies that are used to manage such risks:
Foreign currency risk
The Group reports in US dollars and the majority of its business is conducted in US dollars. All revenues from oil sales are received in US dollars 
and all costs except a portion towards expenses for overheads are incurred in US dollars. For currency exposure other than US dollars, a portion 
of the cash is kept on deposit in other currencies to meet its payments as required. No forward exchange contracts were entered into during 
the year.
Liquidity risk 
The Group currently has surplus cash, which has been placed in deposits and short-term investments which can be converted into cash at short 
notice, ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet the Group’s expenditure requirements. Hardy has no outstanding loan obligations at year-end dates.
Interest rate risk
Surplus funds are placed in deposits and short-term investments at fixed or floating rates. Hardy’s policy is to place deposits only with well 
established banks or financial institutions that offer competitive interest rates and ensure security of capital at the time of issue. 
Commodity price risks
The Group’s share of production of crude oil from PY-3 field is sold to the Government of India’s nominee Chennai Petroleum Corporation 
Limited. The sale price is arrived at based on an average price for the 30-day period commencing 15 days before and ending 15 days after the 
delivery of crude oil. No commodity price hedging contracts have been entered into by the Group.
Credit risk 
All Hardy’s sales are to Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited, a state oil company in India. As it is the Government of India nominee for the 
purchase of crude oil, the credit risk is negligible.
Deposits and other money market instruments, as a general rule, are placed with banks and financial institutions that have ratings of not less 
than AA or equivalent, which are verified before placing the deposits. Cash surpluses are also invested in short-term investments in certain liquid 
funds. These funds are primarily invested in term deposits and graded commercial papers of not less than AA or equivalent.
The Board will continue to assess the strategies for managing credit risk and is satisfied with the existing policies for sale of crude oil to Chennai 
Petroleum Corporation Limited. At year-end, the Group did not have any bad debt risk. The maximum financial risk exposure relating to the 
financial assets is the carrying value of such financed assets as on the year-end date. 
Capital management
The objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity within the Group to carry out the committed work 
programme requirements of all its production sharing contracts. The Group monitors the long-term cash flow requirements of the business in 
order to assess the requirement for changes to the capital structure to meet that objective and to maintain flexibility. The Group considers its 
capital to consist of share capital only.
The Board manages the structure of the capital and makes necessary adjustments to accommodate the changes in the economic conditions.  
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Board may issue new shares for cash, repay debt if any, put in place new debt facilities or such 
other restructuring as appropriate. No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 
31 December 2011. Overview

The Company had previously committed to commission the updating of a Competent Person’s Report (CPR) on an annual basis in conjunction 
with the year-end financial reporting process. Due to limited drilling activity in 2011 and the uncertainty surrounding the recommencement of

2. The GCA has used the Petroleum Resources Management System published by the Society of Petroleum Engineers, World Petroleum Council, American Association of Petroleum 
Geologists and Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers in March 2007 (SPE PRMS) as the basis for its classification and categorisation of hydrocarbon volumes.
3. With respect to Ganesha-1 (CY-OS/2) non-associated natural gas discovery, in 2010 the Group formally commenced arbitration proceedings pursuant to dispute resolution 
provisions of the governing PSC regarding a licence extension request.
4. In the event of a commercial development of a discovery, ONGC has the option to back-into the CY-OS/2 licence at an interest of 30 per cent. Hardy Oil and Gas plc

Connecticut residents.
Our position in California
We currently have seven locations in California where 
we offer betting on horseracing and greyhounds. These are 
typically small areas within larger facilities such as bowling 
alleys and card rooms. The locations are across the state 
of California and we plan to open further venues of a similar 
size in the near future. In addition, our plan is to open sports 
bars with betting facilities across the state over time, the 
first of which is due to open in mid-2014. We have secured 
approval to open ten such facilities in total, subject to 
local town approvals being obtained.

Chairman’s statement
Performance and dividend
It has been a year of strategic progress for the Group. Our 
highly regulated gaming businesses in the US, which now 
represent 60% of the Group’s revenues, continue to grow 
and take advantage of our unique regulatory and licensing 
position. The Football Pools had a solid year, taking 
important steps to arrest the decline in customers and 
generating strong cash flows.
During the year, the Group acquired Data Tote in order 
to strengthen our European operations, established joint 
ventures with NYX Gaming and Picklive US to focus on the 
emerging iGaming and fantasy sports markets in the US, 
and disposed of our loss-making UK focused e-Gaming 
business. These strategic transactions leave the Group 
increasingly focused on our key growth markets and 
the opportunities they present. 
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations 
amounted to 1.7p (2012: 0.3p). Adjusted profit before tax 
from continuing operations was £14.5m (2012: £14.9m), 
with adjusted basic earnings per share of 5.3p (2012: 5.4p), 
primarily as a result of an increased depreciation charge.
Your Board is focused on growing the business and using its 
cash flows to develop the opportunities presented primarily 
in the US. To facilitate this, and as in previous years, no 
dividend is proposed for the year ended 31 December 2013. 
The Board continues to assess the appropriate time to 
commence dividend payments.
SUMMARY
→  A year of strategic progress 
for the Group
→  Earnings per share from continuing 
operations amounted to 1.7p 
(2012: 0.3p)
→  We have the right strategy 
in place to capitalise on 
unique opportunities

 BUSINESS OVERVIEW CORPOR A TE GOVERNANCE STR A TEG IC R E P ORT FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS

To support delivery of these opportunities we have 
combined the Tote Services and Interactive Products 
divisions into one larger organisation, Sportech Racing 
and Digital. Together with Sportech Venues and The 
Football Pools, this focused divisional structure will 
drive the Group's future performance.
Board effectiveness
As Chairman, I am responsible for ensuring your 
Board remains effective. I work closely with Ian Penrose, 
Sportech’s Chief Executive, to ensure your Board provides 
the appropriate support and guidance to the Executive 
team. The Board carries out an annual performance review 
in December of each year, analysing the effectiveness 
and efficiency of the Board, the Board members and the 
individual Committees. As a by-product of this, the Board 
has decided to extend the duration of each Board meeting 
and hold three Board meetings a year at its US operating 
businesses. This will ensure that the quality and depth of 
discussion is increased and, as a consequence, we have 
reduced the number of scheduled Board meetings a year 
from nine to seven.
→ CORPORATE GOVERNANCE p28-35
Last year we endeavoured to implement changes to 
our Directors' Remuneration Report. This year we have 
implemented the Department of Business, Innovation 
and Skills requirements in full, and you can read the 
report on pages 37 to 53. Our objective is to ensure 
that remuneration arrangements clearly reflect our 
strategic objectives and that the interests of management 
and shareholders are properly aligned.
Board and employees
There have been a number of changes to the Board during 
the financial year. Cliff Baty was appointed Chief Financial 
Officer on 14 May 2013. Cliff brings with him considerable 
industry experience, having previously worked in senior 
financial roles at Ladbrokes plc. Rich Roberts was appointed 
to the Board as a Non-executive Director on 3 December 2013. 
Rich lives in New Jersey, US, and has many years' experience 
developing businesses in the digital, mobile, social and 
iGaming markets in the US. I am pleased to welcome them 
both to the Sportech Board.
→ BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMPANY SECRETARY p24-25
John Barnes resigned from the Board on 3 December 2013 
following seven years as a Non-executive Director, and 
Mor Weizer resigned from the Board on 20 June 2013. I would 
like to thank both John and Mor for their contributions, and in 
particular, John for his longstanding commitment to the Group.
Sportech’s international reach and large customer base 
places large demands on our Executives and employees 
and the Board would like to thank them for their dedication 
and commitment to the Group.
Outlook
Looking ahead, I believe we have the right strategy in place 
to capitalise on the significant opportunities that exist for 
Sportech across its divisions and I look forward to working 
with the Board and Executive team to build on the 
successes to date.

Chief Executive’s review
Overview 
Sportech is one of the world's leading operators and suppliers 
of pools betting services, occupying a unique position in the 
highly regulated and emerging gaming markets worldwide.
In 2010, Sportech established itself as one of the largest 
European based gaming businesses with significant operations 
in the United States. Since that time, the Group has continued 
to invest in its businesses, such that over 60% of Group 
revenues are now generated from our US-based operations, 
where we are licensed by gaming regulators in 24 states, 
employing 700 people across field operations and four 
corporate offices. 
The Group’s focus continues to be to build a multi-platform 
(retail, telephone and online) dynamic gaming business in the 
US. Initially focusing on the legal and highly regulated gaming 
operations of horseracing and greyhounds, we will seek to take 
advantage of organic business development opportunities. 
Subsequently we plan to use this strong and expanding 
platform to position the Group for broader-based gaming 
opportunities as regulation evolves over the coming years.
SUMMARY
→  The Group has delivered a good set 
of results in a transformational year
→  We have strengthened the 
management team and Board
→  We remain well positioned for future 
growth in the US market and have 
entered 2014 with confidence
“ The Group has continued to 
invest in its businesses, so that 
over 60% of the Group revenues 
are now generated from our 
US‑based operations.”

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 SPORTECH PLC 11
During 2013, the Group made good progress in line with its 
strategy. We continued to invest in our operations, to leverage 
our unique exclusive licensing position in Connecticut, US, and 
last month launched both the only legal website in Connecticut 
for betting on horseracing, and opened a flagship sports bar, 
restaurant and betting facility in Bradley. The investment is 
aimed at increasing the distribution of racing, and widening the 
exposure and thrill of betting on horseracing to a sport-based 
audience. In another major step forward, we were able to 
develop our extensive operations in California (where we 
process all betting on horseracing, around $1.8bn per annum) 
by obtaining a licence to develop a chain of branded betting 
venues, restaurants and sports bars. The first venue will open in 
Norco, near Los Angeles, in the summer of 2014. Furthermore, 
we have invested in our core tote betting technology, and in 
December launched a suite of market-leading online and 
mobile betting products for our customers.
Corporately, and in line with our strategy of enhancing our 
product range in the US, we established joint ventures with 
NYX Gaming and Picklive US to focus on the emerging iGaming 
and significant fantasy sports markets. Furthermore, we 
acquired Data T ote for an initial consideration of £3.1m in order 
to strengthen our European tote betting operations, whilst our 
loss-making UK-focused e-Gaming business was sold towards 
the end of the year for £3.0m. These strategic transactions 
leave the Group increasingly focused on the attractive 
opportunities in our key growth markets.
The Group has also made a number of organisational changes, 
establishing three key divisions. We have created Sportech 
Racing and Digital, which combined the former Sportech 
Racing, Sportech Interactive Products and Services and also 
eBet, in order to create one cohesive, larger division to provide 
all terrestrial, online and mobile betting technology products to 
our customers. This division is managed by Andrew Gaughan. 
Our Sportech Venues business, operating Connecticut's 
exclusive betting operations in retail venues, on the telephone 
and now online at MyWinners.com, is led by T ed T aylor, and our 
UK Football Pools business is led by Conleth Byrne. As a 
consequence of the increase in the Group's activities overseas 
and the reduction of activity in the UK following the sale of the 
loss-making e-Gaming activity, Ian Hogg has decided to leave 
the Group at, or before, the end of the year for personal reasons 
as he does not wish to increase his duties overseas.
The Group is pleased to have increased its EBITDA from 
continuing operations in 2013 by £0.8m to £26.0m with EBITDA 
from US-based activities increasing by over 20%. The Football 
Pools business delivered a strong performance with EBITDA 
of £17.4m, representing 58% of Group EBITDA before central 
costs. The Football Pools division is making good progress 
towards stabilisation of its direct revenues and generates strong 
cash flows.
Outlook
We have launched a number of growth initiatives in February 
this year, notably the exclusive online betting website and the 
innovative sports bar, restaurant and betting facility, both in 
Connecticut. We continue to make progress in California, and 
our new technology developments are being well received by 
customers. However, the severe snow storms and extreme cold 
weather across the east coast of the US have resulted in the 
closure of our retail venues on several days this year, and there 
have been 170 race cancellations to date in 2014 compared to 
54 in 2013. Whilst this has impacted on the performance of our 
US operations, the Board remains confident in the Group's 
prospects for the full year ahead.

Principal risks
The Group operates under a number of 
licences across worldwide jurisdictions, 
including the UK and US. The loss or 
inadvertent breach of any such licence 
could have a significant impact on the 
Group’s ability to continue to trade 
within that and other jurisdictions 
and therefore on the Group’s trading 
and results. In addition, such loss or 
inadvertent breach would potentially 
lead to the imposition of fines and 
penalties on the Group and could lead 
to substantial legal costs. In certain 
jurisdictions, personal liability rules 
could lead to imprisonment of Group 
personnel. There would also be the 
threat of reputation damage, hindering 
the expansion of the business into 
other jurisdictions.
A significant proportion of the 
Group’s annual income is derived from 
consumer facing activities and is thus 
subject to the impact of economic 
downturns. Any significant downturn in 
the economy could lead to a negative 
impact on the results of the Group and 
its cash flows.
The importance of measuring risk
Our risk management approach is to look at risks arising from all areas of the business both 
through a top-down and bottom-up approach. The executive Boards of the three main business 
units assess on an ongoing basis and formally update their business-specific risk registers 
quarterly. The Board regularly reviews the risks associated with the Group’s activities and strategy 
and formally reviews a Group risk register annually. In reviewing such risks, the Board ensures that 
appropriate systems and controls are in place to mitigate the occurrence and impact of such risks.
Risk registers identify the most significant risks to the business and rate each risk on an unmitigated 
basis first and then a mitigated basis following assessment of controls and processes in place 
to reduce the impact of the risk.
The table shows the most significant risks to Sportech PLC as a Group, the potential impact of 
such risks and the mitigating activities the Group carries out to reduce the likelihood and impact 
of such risks. The movement in the level of the risk in the Board’s opinion is also indicated.
The Group considers that its licences to operate around the world are 
a key asset to the business and as such looks to mitigate the inherent 
risk within this area as follows:
→ 	 the Group employs a Director of Corporate Affairs, one of whose 
primary roles is to ensure compliance with the requirements of our 
licences worldwide;
→ 	 a key aspect of this is monitoring the territories from which 
business is accepted, to ensure that the threat of legal action 
against the Group is minimised, and that territories presenting 
criminal/terrorist money laundering risk are avoided;
→ 	 the Group employs a Group General Counsel in the UK to aid 
compliance issues and also employs a General Counsel within 
its key US subsidiary, Sportech Inc.;
→ 	 the Group employs third-party specialist legal counsel as 
appropriate to ensure relationships with regulatory bodies 
are maintained at the highest level;
→ 	 regular updates and training are provided to those employees 
involved in areas of the business that have inherent regulatory risk. 
Policies and procedures are in place to which staff adhere; and
→ 	 where commercially realistic insurance policies are available, they 
are purchased.
Management has taken and continues to take mitigating actions 
to protect the Group from current and potential operational and 
commercial risks in respect of economic and currency downturn:
→ 	 operating cost bases within the key operational divisions are 
structured to offset potential declines in revenue;
→ 	 revenue channels have been and continue to be expanded in terms 
of both product and territory by the acquisition of a broader base 
of revenue streams for the Group;
→ 	 where possible, fixed income contracts (in respect of Sportech 
Racing) have been entered into with our customers limiting 
downside risk; and
→ 	 management reviews performance against budget on a regular 
basis which would highlight the need to implement change.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 SPORTECH PLC 15
The Group has historically been 
relatively highly leveraged and 
dependent on the provision of debt 
financing to enable it to continue its 
operations. The change in the credit 
markets that occurred over the last 
few years increased the cost of bank 
debt and reduced the availability 
of alternate sources of finance. The 
Group refinanced its debt in July 2012, 
extending its term to August 2015.
Credit markets are tightening providing 
the opportunity for the Group to reduce 
its cost of debt going forward.
The Group runs a number of venues 
offering pari-mutuel wagering, 
principally in the state of Connecticut, 
USA, and the Netherlands. These 
operations involve the handling of 
significant sums of cash. In addition, 
the venues are used by a high number 
of customers on a daily basis. The 
Group therefore has a significant health 
and safety risk in respect of both its 
employees and its customers.
The Group: 
→ 	 refinanced in the summer of 2012 and now has three principal 
lenders, Bank of Scotland Plc, Barclays Bank Plc and Royal Bank 
of Scotland Plc. We maintain very close relationships with each 
finance lender;
→ 	 continues to be focused on cash generation to improve its 
financial position;
→ 	 maintains relationships with potential future finance partners and 
keeps abreast of changing credit market conditions; and
→ 	 monitors its performance against covenants on a regular basis.
The Group takes the following actions to ensure the health and safety 
of its employees and customers:
→ 	 suitably qualified health and safety managers are employed by the 
Group to ensure compliance with Group policies;
→ 	 security processes and procedures are in place to ensure excess 
cash is stored in time-delay safes and then removed from venues 
as soon as possible;
→ 	 appropriate insurance cover is maintained; and
→ 	 there is a continual investment programme to refresh and update 
venues. Health and safety requirements are addressed accordingly.
Level
The Group’s facilities 
are in place for 
another 18 months 
with a one year 
extension option.
Level
There has been no 
change in the Group’s 
operations and thus 
no change in the 
level of the risk.
Risk description Mitigating activities Change
A significant proportion of the Group’s 
annual income is dependent on 
technology-led products.
Management ensures that the risk posed by technology is mitigated 
where possible as follows:
→ 	 the Group has two world-class data centres established in its key 
trading jurisdictions which host the Group’s key technology solutions;
→ 	 the Group continues to invest heavily in upgrading its technology 
solutions to ensure compliance with best practice;
→ 	 Group systems, principally in the USA and in the Netherlands, are 
subject to annual third-party audit to provide assurances to our 
customers that our systems are robust and complete; 
→ 	 where third-party software is utilised, leading technology 
providers are chosen as suppliers of choice; and
→ 	 comprehensive disaster recovery procedures and infrastructure 
are in place and are regularly reviewed and tested. Insurance cover 
is obtained to mitigate the cost of business interruption.

The Group has 
invested significantly 
during the period in 
upgrading technology 
thus continuing to 
reduce this risk.

Financial review
Overview
Group revenue from continuing operations was slightly 
ahead of prior year at £110.3m (2012: £107.7m). EBITDA 
from continuing operations increased by 3% to £26.0m 
(2012: £25.2m) driven by growth in Sportech Racing and 
Digital which offset the decline in Football Pools. Adjusted 
profit before tax was £14.5m (2012: £14.9m) impacted by an 
increased depreciation charge following capital investment. 
Profit after tax was £3.4m (2012: £1.3m) with basic earnings 
per share from continuing operations of 1.7p (2012: 0.3p) 
and adjusted earnings per share of 5.3p (2012: 5.4p). Net 
debt at 31 December 2013 was £63.4m (2012: £57.1m).
An analysis of Group revenue, EBITDA and operating profit 
by division is shown on page 18.
Corporate costs
Corporate costs of £3.9m (2012: £3.8m) have been managed 
carefully and remain in line with the prior year. In addition, 
we also have a non-cash share option expense under IFRS 2 
of £1.5m (2012: £1.4m).
Depreciation and amortisation
The Group’s normal depreciation and amortisation charge 
increased in the period to £5.7m (2012: £4.8m), principally 
due to the ongoing capital expenditure in our businesses in 
North America. In addition, the Group incurred a non-cash

amortisation charge of £7.2m (2012: £5.9m) on the intangible 
assets acquired with Vernons in 2007, eBet in 2012 and Data 
Tote in 2013. The Vernons charge continues at an annualised 
£5.9m until June 2014.
Exceptional costs
The Group has incurred exceptional costs of £2.7m 
(2012: £2.8m) in the twelve month period. These costs 
include restructuring and other costs of £1.3m (2012: £1.3m), 
compensation for loss of office of £0.3m (2012: £0.3m), 
costs in relation to the New Jersey licence of £0.3m 
(2012: £0.4m), transaction costs in relation to acquisitions 
of £0.3m (2012: £0.6m) and legal costs of £0.5m in 
connection with the “Spot the Ball” VAT claim (2012: £0.2m).
Net finance costs
The Group has incurred net interest costs in the period 
of £4.3m (2012: £4.1m). In addition, other finance income 
amounted to £0.8m (2012: charges of £4.7m), primarily 
being the fair value movement on interest rate swaps. 
Net bank debt 
The Group has a £75m revolving credit facility until 
August 2015, which is enabling the Board to invest in strategic 
opportunities, particularly in the USA. Net bank debt has 
increased by £6.3m in the twelve month period to £63.4m 
(31 December 2012: £57.1m), reflecting capital spend of £12.6m, 
as well as £9.4m investment in acquisitions. The Group’s bank 
leverage ratio for covenant testing purposes (net bank debt/
adjusted EBITDA) was 2.41x as at 31 December 2013 
(31 December 2012: 2.12x). At 31 December 2013, this leverage 
covenant was 3.0x (net bank debt/adjusted EBITDA).
Total shareholders’ equity and the Group’s net assets have 
increased to £139.7m (31 December 2012: £135.4m).
Acquisitions and disposals
During the year the Group acquired Data Tote for £3.1m 
in cash consideration with a potential further deferred 
consideration payment of £1.0m in the event that the 
business meets certain growth performance targets for 
the period to 30 June 2016. Of this deferred consideration, 
£0.1m was accrued at the acquisition date with £0.9m 
accrued over the performance period subject to ongoing 
assessment of expectations. Cash on balance sheet at the 
acquisition date was £0.7m.
Total fair value of assets recognised was £3.2m with resultant 
goodwill of £nil. Acquisition costs totalled £0.2m.
On 30 September 2013, £6.5m was paid to Scientific Games 
Corporation Inc., representing deferred consideration 
in relation to the 2010 acquisition of Sportech Racing. 
Performance targets for the contingent element of 
consideration were not met by 31 December 2013 and no 
further payments under the acquisition agreement are due. 
In addition £0.3m was paid in December 2013 in deferred 
consideration for the 2012 acquisition of eBet Online Inc. 
A further £0.7m is due to be paid in December 2014 with 
additional maximum potential consideration due of £0.9m 
based on future performance.
The Group disposed of its e-Gaming business to NetPlay TV 
Group Limited on 31 October 2013 for total cash consideration 
of £3.0m. This generated a net profit after tax from 
discontinued operations of £0.1m including trading losses 
and costs of disposal. This disposal followed a strategic 
review that concluded the business was not of sufficient 
scale ahead of the implementation of UK point of consumption 
tax, which would impact the business significantly.

VAT claim
The VAT repayment claim, in respect of the “Spot the Ball” 
game, was successfully determined in the Group’s favour 
by the First-tier Tax Tribunal (“FTT”) in March 2013. HMRC 
has been given leave to appeal this decision to the Upper 
Tribunal and the appeal hearing will be held on 29 and 
30 April 2014. The claim is for approximately £95m 
including simple interest.
We are pleased with our success to date and remain confident 
in our arguments and a successful outcome of the appeal. 
The claim has not been recognised in the Group’s 
financial statements.
Dividend
No dividend is proposed. The Board will continue to assess 
when to commence the payment of a maiden dividend in 
consideration of the Group’s financial position, business 
performance and future growth opportunities. 
Taxation 
A tax charge for the period of £1.9m (2012: £0.8m) has been 
provided at the weighted average applicable tax rate for the 
Group of 26.8% (2012: 36.5%). The Group has a net deferred 
tax asset of £0.7m (31 December 2012: £1.3m), representing 
primarily foreign taxes withheld which can be utilised against 
future profits and deferred tax provided on unvested share 
options and on interest rate swap liabilities. Tax payments 
of £1.7m were made during the period (2012: £2.0m), 
principally representing final payments for prior year tax 
liabilities and overseas tax deducted at source.
Share capital
During the year 6.0m shares were issued to settle employee 
share options under the 2010 Performance Share Plan 
award, increasing issued share capital to 204,851,114.

Operational review
Overview
Sportech Racing and Digital has a leading position worldwide 
in the provision of Tote software both through land based 
terminals and online solutions including mobile and tablet 
devices. The business processes $13bn of bets annually and 
is licensed in 24 states in the US with offices and operational 
centres in Atlanta, New Jersey, Ireland, Germany and the UK. 
The business has invested heavily in technology including 
its suite of mobile applications (known as Digital Link) which 
delivers an array of wagering and account management 
services through the racing consumer’s own smart phone in 
conjunction with the on-track wagering devices. In addition, 
the division has developed a new online betting platform, 
G4, to improve consumers’ online betting experience. 
These investments will support the business’s future success, 
ensuring its competitiveness and generating opportunities 
for increased efficiency through technological developments.
During the year the business secured several major new 
contracts including a six year agreement with Penn National 
Gaming (“PNG”), a five year agreement with Danske Spil, the 
state-owned Danish gaming operator and terminal sales to 
the UK Tote.
In September, the business purchased Data Tote, a leading 
provider of on-track and online greyhound and horserace 
betting services in Europe. This acquisition further strengthens 
our European operations through an increased customer base 
and complementary product suite. 
Tote Services
Within Tote Services, we have seen continued strong 
operational performance from our customer within the 
Dominican Republic following the investment made in new 
terminals last year. 
During H2 2013, we wound down our US west coast data centre 
and transferred our operations to a single site in New Jersey. 
This will deliver improved customer service and cost efficiencies 
in 2014 and beyond. Revenues of £32.0m (2012: £30.1m) 
included equipment sales of £4.1m (2012: £4.3m), and EBITDA 
of £7.0m (2012: £5.7m) was generated.
Digital
Within Digital, the integration of the eBet business acquired in 
December 2012 has been successfully achieved and expected 
synergies of £0.2m were delivered in 2013 following call-centre 
rationalisation and transfer of bet processing to our own T ote 
system. Revenues for 2013 were £3.9m (2012: £1.6m) with 
EBITDA of £0.7m (2012: loss of £0.2m), in line with 
management expectations. 
The Digital business has entered into a joint venture with NYX 
Gaming Group, an award-winning supplier of online gaming 
platforms and content, to provide online gaming products. 
In addition the business has entered into a separate joint 
venture with Picklive Limited to develop new fantasy sports 
games targeting the rapidly growing US market. Both these 
initiatives, together with the technological investments in the 
G4 online betting platform and Digital Link mobile applications, 
will help drive future performance.

Connecticut Venues
In the state of Connecticut, Sportech Venues operates all 
betting on horseracing under an exclusive and in perpetuity 
licence for retail, telephone and internet. 
During the year we have invested in our venues and online 
opportunities to support future growth. February 2014 saw 
the official opening of the “Bobby V’s” sports bar in Bradley, a 
partnership with baseball legend and experienced restaurateur 
Bobby Valentine. This new $4m facility allows customers to bet 
on horse and greyhound racing while enjoying the amenities of 
a high-end sports bar and restaurant. Also during the year we 
have upgraded the facilities at Sports Haven, our 50,000 sq ft 
venue, to create sports and games zones together with a 
redesigned bar area. We are also progressing the development 
of a potential new site in Stamford, a city close to the New Y ork 
state border with a population of 125,000 which currently has 
no gambling venue.
February 2014 also saw the full launch of Connecticut’s 
only legal online horserace betting platform, MyWinners.com. 
This launch will be supported by marketing campaigns and 
the issuance of formal cease and desist letters by the 
Connecticut authorities.
2013 operating performance saw overall revenues £0.5m 
ahead of prior year with EBITDA at £4.4m (2012: £4.4m), 
with increased content costs being offset by other 
overhead reductions. 
Other Venues
Revenue for Other Venues was £5.9m (2012: £6.0m) with 
EBITDA of £0.4m (2012: £0.3m).
During 2013, the Group provided betting technology and 
services to customers of five third-party venues in southern 
and central California. A further two outlets have opened in 
early 2014. These outlets are performing well with a strong 
return on invested capital; however, overall returns are restricted 
due to the limited number of potential venues and the relative 
Sportech share of the venues’ profits. 
In December we signed an agreement with Southern 
California Off Track Wagering, Inc. (“SCOTWinc”) for a licence 
to allow Sportech to operate up to ten innovative retail venues 
offering customers the ability to bet on horseracing in a 
high-end sports bar and restaurant facility. The Group will 
open the first venue, a 10,000 sq ft purpose-built facility in the 
city of Norco, in the summer of 2014. This location is a joint 
venture between Sportech and the Silky Sullivan Group LLC, 
a food and beverage operator based in southern California. 
This agreement will allow the business to benefit from an 
enhanced share of horserace wagering margin together with 
the food and beverage profits from the restaurant facility. 
In the Netherlands, we operate a number of OTBs, point 
of sale terminals and online betting on horseracing, all on 
an exclusive basis under a licence from the Ministry of Justice. 
This licence has been extended until December 2014 when 
the government’s new laws regarding gambling are due to 
come into effect. We continue to communicate closely with 
the government regarding these plans.

Overview
The strategy of the Pools business is to stabilise then grow 
revenues through improved customer retention, increase 
spend per head from core customers and recruitment of new 
players to direct debit and online channels. Modernisation of 
the business continues with investment in technology driving 
efficiencies including consolidation of customers into a single 
database, enabling greater cross-sell opportunities and a 
lower and more agile operating cost base.
Revenues for the period were £41.3m (2012: £42.9m), 
the reduction driven primarily by a £1.6m decrease in 
the collector and overseas channels. EBITDA fell by £1.4m 
to £17.4m (2012: £18.8m) with cost efficiencies offset by 
increased marketing spend to drive recruitment that will add 
value into 2014 and beyond. Classic Pools average weekly 
customer spend has increased to £2.67 (2012: £2.58) driven 
by an increase in games to two games per week, every week. 
As at December 2013, total customer numbers were 360,000 
compared to 397,000 in prior year. In the direct channel, 
customer numbers fell by 6% to 248,000. Importantly, we 
also recruited 15,000 new customers to this channel through 
our telemarketing investment and will increase this activity, 
together with online marketing, to drive new player 
acquisition throughout 2014.
We continue to broaden our product offering outside our 
core Classic Pools product and in November, our Jackpot 12 
pool grew to greater than £600,000 with one customer 
winning £440,000.
To progress our digital offering, we have entered into an 
agreement with NYX to develop a new footballpools.com site 
with greater content, flexibility and functionality. The full site 
is planned to launch in mid 2014 with mobile and tablet 
applications of Classic Pools, Premier 10, Jackpot 12 and 
Lucky Clover being launched during the first half of 2014.

 Corporate social responsibility
Responsibility to our
Customers
Licences to permit the provision of business-to-business 
services for pari-mutuel betting on horse and greyhound 
racing are held by Group companies in over 30 jurisdictions 
in the Americas and Europe. Licences for business-to-
consumer activity for the same products are held in 
Connecticut and Holland, and for a wider range of gambling 
products in the UK and Alderney. To ensure that the 
obligations placed on the Group under these licences are 
adhered to, the Group employs a Director of Corporate 
Affairs who is responsible for ensuring that the terms of all 
applicable regulations are met. He works closely with the 
Group General Counsel and local Legal counsel to ensure 
the Group meets its policy of maintaining the highest 
standards of compliance and integrity. The Group also 
employs security and compliance staff whose primary role 
is to ensure that our customers are treated fairly, that our 
advertising is compliant with advertising standards and 
codes, that the young and vulnerable are prevented from 
accessing our products and that abuse and illegal behaviour 
are identified and stopped. All gaming products are subject 
to age restrictions and age verification software is used by 
the Group where appropriate. 
The Group actively promotes GamCare, the charity 
providing support to those suffering through a gambling 
problem, to its customers and nearly £0.5m has been 
contributed to the Responsible Gambling Trust, GamCare’s 
major funder, and its predecessor bodies over recent years. 
The Venues business in Connecticut contributes over £0.1m 
annually to promote responsible gambling in the state.
Responsibility to
Society
The Group’s support for communities across the UK is 
virtually unparalleled; since the mid-1970s The Football 
Pools has contributed £1.3bn at today’s value to football, 
sport, the arts and charitable causes. Today the Group helps 
to generate £0.5m annually for charitable use through its 
management and operation of society lotteries within its 
Football Pools business activities.
The Group was, for many years, the sole funder of the 
Foundation for Sport and the Arts (www.thefsa.net), which 
awarded grants amounting to several million pounds each 
year. Many communities, organisations and individuals have 
benefited from modest but critical training bursaries through 
to significant funding for major capital projects. The Foundation 
finally ceased its activities in 2013, after 22 years of supporting 
communities across the UK with donations worth £630m.
Further support in recent years has focused on football and 
included donations of over £6.0m to schemes developed 
with the English and Scottish Football Leagues. Notably, the 
SPL’s Football Fans in Training programme, promoting fitness 
and weight loss, continues to attract international acclaim.
In 2013, to celebrate the 90th anniversary of The Football 
Pools, the Group has been eager to continue its support 
of grass roots football, where we believe the impact is

partner with charity StreetGames in a two-year funding 
arrangement worth £1.7m, to create a new football programme, 
"StreetGames Football Pools Fives". As part of its commitment

Responsibility towards the
Environment
The Group recognises its responsibility to achieve good 
environmental practice and continues to strive for improvement 
in its environmental impact. 
The nature of its business results in the principal impact 
arising from energy and paper consumption. 
Wherever possible, waste consumable materials are recycled 
or disposed of in a manner most suitable to reduce any 
impact on the natural environment. The Group’s business 
practices also encourage environmental good practice, and 
the increasing use of technology to facilitate information 
and data collection and dissemination has led to reduced 
demand for paper resources. 
All employees are encouraged to participate in the 
implementation of this policy and suppliers of consumable 
products are encouraged to be environmentally friendly, 
wherever practical.
In compliance with the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013 
requirements, the Group is reporting on greenhouse gas 
emissions for the first time. The Group believes that the 
approach it has taken, incorporating the use of relevant 
audited costs and data sourced from highly regarded public 
bodies, is robust, but it will undoubtedly be refined in future 
years. It is currently using 2012 as its base year for emissions 
reporting. As well as providing a summary of the Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 CO
2
 emissions produced, an intensity ratio using 
Group revenue is also included, showing a reduction in 
intensity of 4.4% in 2013 over the base year performance.

Responsibility towards
Employees
The Board is acutely aware of the vital contribution 
of employees to the future success of the business. 
It recognises the importance of providing employees 
with information on matters of concern to them, enabling 
employees to improve their performance and make an 
active contribution to the achievement of the Group’s 
business objectives. This is accomplished through formal 
and informal briefings, meetings and will shortly be 
extended to online communication via a Group intranet. 
Employee representatives are consulted regularly on a wide 
range of matters affecting their current and future interests. 
The Group’s Investor in People accreditation reflects the 
progressive training and development programmes that 
are in place within the business.
The Group is committed to equality of opportunity and 
dignity at work for all, irrespective of race, colour, creed, 
ethnic or national origins, gender, marital status, sexuality, 
disability, class or age. It ensures that recruitment and 
promotion decisions are made solely on the basis of 
suitability for the job.
In the UK, it is the policy of the Group to comply with 
the requirements of the Disability and Equality Act 2010 
in offering equality of opportunity to disabled persons 
applying for employment, selection being made on the 
basis of the most suitable person for the job in respect of 
experience and qualifications. Training, career development 
and promotion are offered to all employees on the basis of 
their merit and ability.
Every effort is made to continue to employ, in the same 
or alternative employment, and where necessary to retrain, 
employees who become disabled during their employment 
with the Group. 
The Group proactively addresses health and safety 
management and we have a programme of risk 
identification, management and improvement in place. 
The Board receives a report in respect of health and safety 
across all of its businesses at each Board meeting.

Corporate governance
Chairman’s overview
Dear shareholder
Sportech is committed to sound 
corporate governance and 
believes it to be essential for 
business integrity and for 
shareholders’ trust in their Board. 
The responsibility for good 
governance lies with the Board, 
chaired by me, and I take a 
strong interest in ensuring the 
principles are disseminated 
throughout the organisation.
Our report to you on corporate governance explains 
how we approach and implement the principles of good 
governance across Sportech and the level of importance 
we give to each area.
The effectiveness of our Board is a key priority, as we 
believe this to be fundamental in order to deliver on business 
objectives and ultimately to deliver shareholder value, whilst 
operating in an ethical way. During the year, John Barnes 
has retired from the Board after contributing immensely 
to the Group over the seven years of his Non-executive 
Directorship. We were delighted to announce the 
appointment of Rich Roberts who, following an in-depth 
search process, has been selected for his experience in 
multi-platform entertainment industries and networks 
across the USA.
Our Committees are structured to ensure the responsibilities 
of the Board are carried out effectively and in line with best 
practice procedure. Detail on each Committee and its 
responsibilities and duties carried out during the year under 
review can be found within this report.
We will continue to strive for best practice governance and 
use our time together as a Board, and within communication 
between Directors outside of formal meetings, to address 
the core responsibilities of strategy, review of financial and 
operational performance, review of risk management and 
internal controls and ensuring the composition of the Board 
delivers an effective governing body for Sportech.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 SPORTECH PLC 29
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code
Sportech is committed to a high standard of corporate 
governance. The Financial Reporting Council published 
in 2012 a revised version of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”), which took effect for financial years 
beginning on or after 1 October 2012. As such, Sportech 
has complied throughout the financial year ended 
31 December 2013 with the provisions of the revised Code. 
A copy of the Code is publicly available from www.frc.org. 
It is the policy of the Board to manage the affairs of the 
Company in accordance with the principles of the Code so 
far as the Board believes it is practical. This report, together 
with the Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 53, describes 
how the Company has applied the main principles of 
corporate governance as set out in the Code. 
Board of Directors 
The Board currently comprises the Non-executive 
Chairman, three Executive Directors, three Independent 
Non-executive Directors and one Non-executive Director 
as follows: 
Roger Withers  Non-executive Chairman 
Ian Penrose  Chief Executive 
Cliff Baty  Chief Financial Officer
Ian Hogg   Chief Operating Officer, 
Consumer Facing Business
Peter Williams  Senior Independent Non-executive Director 
David McKeith  Independent Non-executive Director 
Rich Roberts  Independent Non-executive Director 
Lorne Weil  Non-executive Director 
On 6 March 2013, 20 June 2013 and 3 December 2013, 
Steve Cunliffe, Mor Weizer and John Barnes respectively, 
resigned from the Board. Cliff Baty was appointed 
to the Board on 14 May 2013 as Chief Financial Officer. 
Rich Roberts was appointed to the Board on 3 December 2013 
as an Independent Non-executive Director.
Biographies of the Board members appear on pages 24 
and 25. These illustrate the wide-ranging business experience 
of Board members, which is essential to manage effectively 
a business of the size and complexity of Sportech. 
The Board considers Peter Williams, David McKeith and 
Rich Roberts to be Independent Directors. In light of his 
previous roles as Chairman of Playtech Limited, from which 
he resigned on 10 October 2013 (although he is retained 
as an industry adviser through to September 2014) and 
retained adviser to Scientific Games Corporation Inc. (“SGC”), 
a position that came to an end on 30 September 2013, which 
were held upon his appointment as Chairman of the Board, 
Roger Withers cannot be deemed to be independent. 
Similarly, whilst Lorne Weil sits on the Board in his own 
personal capacity and not as a representative of SGC, due 
to the fact that Lorne Weil was Chairman and Chief 
Executive of SGC until November 2013, coupled with SGC’s 
19.99% shareholding in Sportech PLC up to 7 January 2014, 
the Board deems Lorne Weil not to be independent. 
Conflicts of interest 
The Board has a procedure in place to deal with a situation 
where a Director has a conflict of interest, as required by 
the Companies Act 2006. As part of this process, the 
members of the Board prepare a list of other positions held 
and all other conflict situations that may need authorising 
either in relation to the Director concerned or his/her 
connected persons. The Board considers each Director’s 
situation and decides whether to approve any conflict 
situations, taking into consideration what is in the best 
interests of the Company and whether the Director’s ability 
to act in accordance with his or her wider duties is affected. 
Each Director is required to notify the Company Secretary 
of any potential or actual conflict situations that will need to 
be authorised by the Board. Authorisations given by the 
Board are reviewed annually. 
The Independent Directors Committee of the Board has 
powers to deal with matters concerning the Company and 
its major shareholders, including in relation to areas where 
conflicts of interest might otherwise arise.

Board effectiveness
Division of responsibilities, information 
and professional development 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management 
of the business of the Company and its long term success. 
It may exercise all the powers of the Company subject to 
the provisions of relevant statutes and the Company’s 
Articles. The Articles, for instance, contain specific provisions 
and restrictions regarding the Company’s power to borrow 
money. A copy of the Articles is available to view by request 
from the Company Secretary or from the Company’s website, 
www.sportechplc.com/investor_centre/shareholder_
information/memorandum_and_articles_of_association. 
The Board is also responsible for setting the Company’s 
strategic objectives and managing the Company’s resources 
to enable those objectives to be met. 
The division of responsibility between the Chairman and 
the Chief Executive is clearly defined and has been agreed 
by the Board. The Chairman is primarily responsible for 
the workings of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness. 
The Chief Executive is responsible for running the Group’s 
business, for implementing Board strategy and policy 
and for shareholder communication. The Chairman also 
ensures that Directors maintain the appropriate skills 
and knowledge to fulfil their responsibilities and that the 
Company provides the necessary resources to Directors 
to enable this to be achieved, both by way of induction 
upon joining the Board and thereafter by way of updates. 
Luisa Wright, the Company’s Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary, provides in-house legal advice to the 
Board and management. During Luisa’s maternity leave 
period in 2013, the Board engaged and retained various 
advisers in order to continue to receive counsel where and 
when necessary. In addition, the Company takes external 
legal advice where appropriate to ensure compliance with 
best practice. As Company Secretary, Luisa Wright also 
advises the Chairman and the Board on all governance 
matters. Bob Mercer was appointed Company Secretary 
(Alternate) until Luisa returned from maternity leave. 
The Board has in place a number of key processes designed 
to ensure that management responsibilities are clear. 
Executive Directors distribute relevant information and 
key financial reports to Board members in advance of each 
meeting, together with other materials required to facilitate 
proper consideration of business issues. A schedule of 
reserved matters for the Board has been established and 
communicated to the Senior Management teams. 
An Executive Board, chaired by the Chief Executive, 
oversees the detailed operations of the business. The 
Executive Board meets formally on a regular basis to 
update the Group on ongoing corporate matters and to 
review the performance of each business segment and 
progress against key operational targets. 
The Company maintains insurance cover in respect of legal 
action against its Directors and independent professional 
advice may be taken by the Directors as required, at the 
Company’s cost. 
Board performance evaluation 
The Board is satisfied that each Director continues to show 
the necessary commitment, allocates sufficient time to 
discharge their duties and continues to be an effective 
member of the Board due to their skills, expertise and 
business acumen. 
In 2012 a full-scale Board and Committee review process 
was implemented, which is and will be performed annually 
towards the end of each financial year. All Board members 
are invited to complete an online self-assessment and 
evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board. Amongst other 
things, Directors are asked for their views on Company 
strategy; key challenges for the business; the mix of skills, 
experience, independence, knowledge and diversity on the 
Board (including gender); effectiveness of the Board’s 
engagement with shareholders; and how well the Board 
operates. The output of the confidential questionnaires 
completed in December 2013 was discussed with the Board 
at the February 2014 Board meeting. The Board found the 
performance of each Director to be effective and concluded 
that the Board provides the effective leadership and control 
required for a listed company. The evaluation found the 
Board Committees were working well. The Board will 
continue to review its procedures, its effectiveness and 
development in the financial year ahead.

There are seven scheduled Board meetings for 2014. 
In relation to Lorne Weil, the Board considers that, notwithstanding the number of main Board meetings attended, 
Lorne Weil’s vast experience and relationships within the gaming sector are valuable to the Group going forwards, 
particularly in the strategically important North American market. Furthermore, he receives all materials to be presented 
at such meetings and undertakes regular meetings with the Chairman and Chief Executive to ensure that he is able to 
contribute to the Group. 
Committees 
The Committees of the Board are the Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee, the Nomination Committee and the 
Independent Directors Committee. The terms of reference of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees are 
available on request from the Company Secretary and are available on the corporate website, www.sportechplc.com/
investor_centre/corporate_governance. Management ensures that the Committees are provided with all the necessary 
resources to enable them to undertake their duties in an effective and efficient manner. The Company Secretary or her 
delegate acts as secretary to the Committees.

reviewing the Annual Report and Accounts and Interim 
Report, including considering significant financial 
reporting issues and judgements that they contain. 
The Committee reviews, and challenges where necessary, 
the consistency and changes to accounting policies, 
methods used to account for significant and unusual 
transactions, whether the Company has followed 
appropriate accounting standards and the clarity of 
disclosure in the Company’s financial statements. 
Further to this, the Committee is delegated from the 
Board the responsibility for review of the effectiveness 
of internal controls, the Company’s whistleblowing 
procedures and the need for an internal audit function 
as well as the scope, extent and effectiveness of such 
a function. The Chief Financial Officer and other Senior 
Management are invited to attend the Committee 
as appropriate. 
Financial reporting
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial 
reporting is the review with both management and the 
external auditor of the appropriateness of the half-year 
and annual financial statements concentrating on, 
amongst other matters:
  consistency of the Annual Report as a whole and 
ensuring it presents a fair, balanced and understandable 
picture of the Company as well as providing shareholders 
with the information necessary to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy;
  the quality and acceptability of accounting policies 
and practices;
  the clarity of the disclosures and compliance with 
financial reporting standards and relevant financial 
and governance reporting requirements;
  material areas in which significant judgements have 
been applied or there has been discussion with the 
external auditors; and
  any correspondence from regulators in relation to our 
financial reporting.
To aid its review, the Committee considered internal 
reports from the Chief Financial Officer, the Finance 
Director – The Football Pools, the Group Financial 
Controller and the external auditors on the outcomes 
of their half-year review and annual audit. 
The primary areas of judgement considered by 
the Committee in relation to the 2013 financial 
statements were:
  the assumptions underlying impairment testing of the 
Group’s goodwill and intangible assets, particularly in 
relation to the Football Pools;
  the assessment and disclosure of the going concern 
concept; and
  in relation to taxation, both the provisioning for 
potential current tax liabilities and the appropriateness 
of deferred tax asset recognition.
In order to be comfortable with the consistency, fairness 
and accuracy of these financial statements the following 
was undertaken in relation to these key areas of judgement:
  detailed review and discussion of models used 
for impairment testing and forecasts for going 
concern reviews;
  stressing of assumptions to understand impacts; and 
  scenario analysis.
The judgements in relation to asset impairment largely 
relate to the assumptions (principally discount and 
growth rates) underlying the calculation of the value in 
use of the business being tested for impairment, primarily   BUSINESS OVERVIEW CORPOR A TE GOVERNANCE STR A TEG IC R E P ORT FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS

Committees continued
The Audit Committee continued
the achievement of the long term business plan 
underlying the valuation process. The Committee 
addresses this matter through receiving regular updates 
on the business plans and measurement against targets. 
In addition the Committee considers findings of the work 
of the auditors in this area.
External audit
The Committee is responsible for the relationship with 
the external auditors. The Committee considers the nature 
and extent of non-audit services provided by the auditors 
in order to seek to balance the maintenance of objectivity, 
access to applicable technical expertise and value for money. 
To help avoid the objectivity and independence of the 
external auditors becoming compromised, the Committee 
has a formal policy governing the engagement of the 
external auditor to provide non-audit services. This policy 
precludes PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP from providing 
certain services such as internal audit work or accounting 
services. For all other services the Chief Financial Officer 
must approve spend on discrete projects in excess of 
£10,000 and secondary approval is required from the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee for spend on projects 
that are estimated will exceed £50,000 in fees. The 
Committee is regularly updated on the spend to date with 
the external auditors and also with other financial advisers.
The auditors are also subject to professional standards 
that safeguard the integrity of their auditing role. The 
Committee remains confident that the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors are not in any way 
impaired by reason of the audit and non-audit services 
which they provide to the Group. Moreover, the Committee 
is satisfied that such work is best handled by them, either 
because of their knowledge of the Group or because they 
have been awarded it through a competitive tendering 
process. In addition, the independence of the auditors 
is safeguarded by the use of separate teams for individual 
assignments such as acquisition due diligence and the 
audit being subject to internal PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
quality control procedures. A breakdown of non-audit 
fees charged by the auditors is disclosed in note 5 in the 
notes to the financial statements. A significant proportion 
of the non-audit fees charged by the auditors in 2013 relates 
to work undertaken in respect of ongoing issues in relation 
to indirect taxes and in relation to advice on accounting and 
tax treatment of the Spot the Ball VAT claim. It was 
concluded by the Committee that it was in the interest 
of the Company to purchase these services on a single 
tender basis from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP due to 
the cumulative historical knowledge already gained, the 
timing of the work, the tie-in to the financial statements 
and confidentiality.
Effectiveness
The effectiveness of the external audit process is dependent 
on appropriate audit risk identification and at the start of 
the audit cycle we receive from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
a detailed audit plan (“Audit Strategy Memorandum”), 
identifying their assessment of these key risks. For 2013 
the significant risks identified were in relation to asset 
impairment, management override of controls and revenue 
recognition due to the inherent management judgement 
required in these areas. 
The Committee holds private meetings with the external 
auditors at each meeting to provide additional opportunity 
for open dialogue and feedback from the Committee and 
the auditors without management being present. Matters 
typically discussed include the auditors’ assessment 
of business risks and management activity thereon, 
the transparency and openness of interactions with 
management, confirmation that there has been no restriction 
in scope placed on them by management, independence 
of their audit and how they have exercised professional 
scepticism. The Chairman of the Audit Committee also 
has regular discussions with the external audit partner 
outside the formal committee process.
Appointment and re-appointment
The Committee considers the re-appointment of the 
external auditors, including the rotation of the audit partner 
each year, and also assesses their independence on an 
ongoing basis. The external auditors are required to rotate 
the audit partner responsible for the Group audit every five 
years. The current lead audit partner has been in place now 
for three financial year ends. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
have been the Company’s external auditors since 2000, 
although a competitive tender process was conducted 
in 2006. As part of the Committee’s review of the objectivity 
and effectiveness of the audit process, an assessment was 
made not to put the audit engagement out to tender in 2013. 
The Committee will continue to assess the appropriate time 
at which an audit tender process should be conducted 
and continues to assess the effectiveness, independence 
and value for money of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
The Audit Committee provided the Board with its 
recommendation to the shareholders on the re-appointment 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as external auditors 
for the year ending 31 December 2014 and as a result, 
in accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 
2006, a resolution proposing the re-appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our auditors will be 
put to the shareholders at the 2014 AGM. There are no 
contractual obligations restricting the Committee’s choice 
of external auditors and we do not indemnify our external 
auditors. The Committee will keep the appointment of 
the external auditors under annual review.  CORPOR A TE GOVERNANCE

Internal control and internal audit
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness; this 
responsibility has been delegated to the Audit Committee. 
On this basis, there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the 
Group. Such a system is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. Controls are 
monitored by management review. Data consolidated 
into the Group’s financial statements is reconciled to the 
underlying financial systems. A review of the consolidated 
data is undertaken by management to ensure that the true 
position and results of the Group are reflected through 
compliance with approved accounting policies and the 
appropriate accounting for non-routine transactions. 
The Group performs an annual strategy and budgeting 
process and the Board approves the annual Group 
budget as part of its normal responsibilities. The Group 
results are reported monthly to the Board. A quarterly 
forecasting regime is adhered to and revised forecasts 
are produced for the Board whenever significant financial 
trends are identified in the periods between the 
quarterly assessments. 
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the 
internal control environment of the Group, excluding that 
of the Group’s joint ventures. It receives reports from the 
external auditors, which include recommendations for 
improvement. The Audit Committee’s role in this area 
is confined to a high-level review of the arrangements 
for internal control. Significant risk issues are referred to 
the Board for consideration. Risk registers are produced 
and maintained at a divisional level and the significant 
key risks relevant at a Group level selected from these 
registers are presented to the Board. The principal risks 
facing the Group and the mitigating actions taken by the 
Board and management are included on pages 14 and 15 
of the Strategic Report. The Group separately employs 
an India-based accountant as a consultant who is 
responsible for ensuring the integrity of results and 
robustness of internal controls and procedures in the 
Group’s joint venture. Similarly, as and when the 
operations of the Group’s newly formed joint ventures 
become material, resources will be deployed to ensure 
integrity of results and that the Group’s high standard of 
internal control is replicated.
T o manage lower-level risks, a risk management programme 
is in place, supported by a business control and risk 
self-assessment process and a business continuity plan. 
The risk management programme places responsibility 
on managers to identify risks facing each business unit 
and for implementing procedures to mitigate these risks. 
The risk appraisal process has been reviewed by the 
Board and accords with the Turnbull Guidance. The Audit 
Committee and Board have reviewed the effectiveness 
of the internal controls of the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2013 and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report and Accounts. This review covered financial, 
operational, risk management and compliance controls. 
The Group does not have an internal audit function. The 
Audit Committee has considered the use of an internal 
audit function during the year but considers that due to 
the size and nature of the Group there is not a requirement 
for such an internal function. The central Group Finance 
function continues to undertake certain work of an 
internal audit nature and reports findings to the Audit 
Committee. During the year, the Audit Committee 
determined that external internal auditors should 
be engaged to perform a review over key business 
cycles and controls. The firm engaged was Deloitte LLP, 
who undertook the scope of work agreed and reported 
their findings to the Committee. The Committee will 
review the effectiveness and value of the work undertaken 
and agree an ongoing internal audit strategy during the 
coming months. 
Whistleblowing policy 
The Company is committed to providing a safe and 
confidential avenue for all employees within the Group to 
raise concerns about serious wrongdoings. The Company 
also acknowledges the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code in this regard, which states that the 
Audit Committee should review arrangements by which 
staff of the Group may, in confidence, raise concerns 
about possible improprieties in matters of financial 
reporting or other matters. Further to this, an appropriate 
policy so as to encourage and enable staff to raise any such 
concerns is in place and has been throughout the year.

The Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee of the Board comprised 
the three Independent Non-executive Directors, until 
the resignation of John Barnes on 3 December 2013, 
and is chaired by Peter Williams. Rich Roberts joined 
the Committee from 27 January 2014. Biographies of 
the members of the Remuneration Committee appear on 
page 25. The purpose of the Committee is to ensure that the 
remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives, 
together with their terms and conditions of employment, 
is sufficient to recruit and retain individuals of the calibre 
required to ensure profitable growth of the business. The 
Remuneration Report is set out on pages 37 to 53. 
The Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee comprised the three Independent 
Non-executive Directors, until the resignation of John Barnes 
on 3 December 2013. It now comprises the three current 
Independent Non-executive Directors and the Chairman of 
the Board, who also now chairs this Committee. Biographies 
of the members of the Nomination Committee appear on 
pages 24 and 25.
The Committee’s main objectives are to lead the process 
for any new appointments to the Board, whether Executive 
or Non-executive, and make recommendations to the Board 
in relation to the same, evaluate the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Board, consider any 
matters relating to the continuation in office of any Director 
at any time, review Committee memberships and formulate 
plans for succession. The Nomination Committee’s activities 
are underpinned by the principle that all appointments 
should be made on merit, against objective criteria and 
with due regard to the benefits of diversity on the Board. 
Accordingly, the Committee prepares a description of the 
role and capabilities required for a particular appointment. 
The Committee, in its recommendations to the 
Board, acknowledges that diversity extends beyond the 
boardroom and supports management in their efforts to 
build a diverse organisation throughout the Group. Out of a 
workforce of approximately 1,000 employees, 41% are female 
and out of 15 members of Senior Management 14% are female. 
The Committee endorses the Company’s policy to attract 
and develop a highly qualified and diverse workforce; to 
ensure that all selection decisions are based on merit and 
that all recruitment activities are fair and non-discriminatory. 
Although at present there are no female Board members, 
the Committee acknowledges the importance of diversity, 
including gender, to the effective functioning of the Board. 
Furthermore, the Board acknowledges the recommendations 
of the Davies Report, and supports the principle of improving, 
in particular, gender imbalance, both at a board level and 
throughout its businesses. Subject to securing suitable 
candidates, when recruiting additional Directors and/or filling 
vacancies that arise when Directors do not seek re-election, 
we will seek to appoint new Directors who fit the skills criteria 
and gender balance that is in line with the Company’s policy. 
We continue to focus on encouraging diversity of business 
skills and experience, recognising that Directors with diverse 
skill sets, capabilities and experience gained from different 
geographic and cultural backgrounds enhance the Board.
On 14 May 2013, Cliff Baty was appointed as Chief Financial 
Officer and joined the Board. On 3 December 2013, 
Rich Roberts joined the Board as Independent Non-executive 
Director. During the recruitment process for both Cliff and 
Rich, the Board utilised an executive search consultancy 
(Odgers Berndtson) to ensure the Board appointed Directors 
that have the skills criteria and industry experience that the 
Board requires to meet the future growth of the Group. 
Odgers Berndtson is a UK executive search firm, helping 
private and public sector organisations find the highest calibre 
people for permanent and interim management appointments 
in the UK and internationally. Odgers Berndtson is considered 
independent of the Group.
The Independent Directors Committee 
The Independent Directors Committee comprised the three 
Independent Non-executive Directors until John Barnes’ 
resignation and is chaired by Peter Williams. The Committee 
now comprises Peter Williams and David McKeith only and is 
responsible for dealing with matters where conflicts of interest 
might arise due to the Board’s previous composition and 
shareholder representation. The Committee met on two 
occasions during the year. 
Investor relations 
There is regular dialogue with shareholders through a planned 
programme of investor relations which includes formal 
presentations of the Group’s results by the Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer. Meetings also take place with 
institutional investors and analysts on a regular basis and there 
is regular communication with shareholders through the Annual 
and Interim Reports and Sportech’s corporate website (www.
sportechplc.com). They are also available at other times, outside 
close periods, to enter into dialogue with these shareholders. All 
shareholders have the opportunity to question the Board at the 
AGM both formally and informally. The Non-executive Directors 
have taken steps to develop an understanding of the views 
of the major shareholders about the Company through 
face-to-face contact and analyst and broker briefings. 
All resolutions at the 2013 AGM were voted by way of a 
manual poll. This follows best practice and allows the 
Company to count all votes rather than just those of 
shareholders attending the meeting. As recommended by 
the Code, all resolutions were voted separately and the 
voting results, which included all votes cast for, against and 
those withheld, together with all proxies lodged prior to the 
meeting, were indicated at the meeting and the final results 
were released to the London Stock Exchange as soon as 
practicable after the meeting. The announcement was also 
made available on the Company’s corporate website. As in 
previous years, the proxy form and the announcement of 
the voting results made it clear that a ‘vote withheld’ is not 
a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of 
the proportion of the votes for or against the resolution.

Report of the Remuneration Committee
Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman
Dear shareholder 
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report 
(the “Report”) for the year ended 31 December 2013.
This Report sets out the remuneration paid to Directors 
over the year under review and details the remuneration 
policy for the forthcoming year. The Committee has now 
adopted the finalised reporting regulation guidance and 
has sought to achieve transparency and clarity for 
shareholders in this report.
The Directors on the Remuneration Committee (the 
“Committee”) are mindful of balancing the increased 
focus and guidance from stakeholders on remuneration 
issues with the need of the Company to attract and 
retain the best available talent. The Committee is 
comfortable that in 2013 it achieved an appropriate 
balance in this regard. More generally, the Committee 
believes that the policy outlined in this Report achieves 
its overriding objectives of establishing a stable 
remuneration policy going forward, enabling the 
recruitment, retention and motivation of a talented 
Executive Management team that is fully incentivised 
to maximise shareholder value and capable of taking 
the business forward through its next phase of 
strategic development. 
In addition, given that the package has a substantial 
weighting towards long term performance, the Committee 
is comfortable that the current arrangements do not 
inadvertently encourage undue risk taking and that its 
policy motivates behaviours that are in the long term 
interests of the Company and its shareholders.
In determining remuneration levels, the Committee has 
taken account of market conditions, the performance of 
the Company, responsibility to shareholders and good 
corporate governance. Accordingly, basic salaries of 
Executive Directors for 2014 have increased by 2%, with 
no increases taking place in the other elements of 
remuneration vis-à-vis 2013.
Performance and reward in relation to 2013
The bonus payments for 2013, based on the Group and 
operating divisions achieving an EBITDA result in line 
with the target level of performance set (which took into 
account market forecasts as reported at the start of 
2013) and individually tailored strategically important 
objectives, were 40% of the entitlement for the Chief 
Executive, 35% of the entitlement for the Chief Financial 
Officer and 21% of the entitlement for the Chief 
Operating Officer, Consumer Facing Business.
Two-thirds of the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) 
awards granted in 2010 vested in the year under review. 
The elements vesting were subject to absolute and 
relative TSR performance with the performance period 
ending in October 2013 with these elements vesting in 
full. This was the result of a three-year growth in TSR 
of 127% which exceeded the absolute growth targets 
and ranked the company above the upper quartile in 
relative terms. One-third of these awards vested based 
on EPS growth over the three-year period ending 
31 December 2012 with this element of the awards 
vesting at 62.0% of the maximum based on EPS 
growth of 11.35% p.a. over three financial years.
One-third of the PSP awards granted in 2011 will vest 
subject to an earnings per share (“EPS”) performance 
measure ending 31 December 2013. This part of the 
awards is expected to vest at 47.5%, subject to the 
Committee’s approval, based on EPS growth of 9.45% 
p.a. over three financial years. The remaining two-thirds 
of the 2011 awards vests based on relative and absolute 
TSR performance which will be measured over 
a three-year period ending November 2014.
The Committee has reviewed the variable incentive 
payouts based on the financial period ended 
31 December 2013 and is satisfied that the reward 
reflects the performance delivered. 
Policy for 2014
The Committee has reviewed the remuneration policy in 
line with the current business strategy and considers it to 
remain fit for purpose. As such, no material changes have 
been proposed for 2014 and beyond, save that the fees 
for the Chairman and Non-executive Directors have 
been increased. 
Shareholder feedback
The Committee has not proposed any significant 
changes to the remuneration policy for 2013 or 2014 
that necessitated any direct consultations with 
shareholders during the year. However, the Committee 
welcomes any feedback on this Report and the 
remuneration policy in general and hopes for your 
continued support at the AGM.

Remuneration report
for the year ended 31 December 2013
This Report has been prepared in accordance with 
the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts & Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 
(the “Regulations”). 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report will be subject 
to a binding shareholder vote at the AGM with an effective 
date of 13 May 2014 and will apply for the three-year period 
thereafter. In practice the policy detailed in the report will 
operate for the entire current financial year. The Annual 
Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the AGM. This Report is intended to be 
in full compliance with the requirements of the Regulations 
and the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council (the “Code”). 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the contents of 
the Report to the extent required by the Regulations.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Committee’s key objectives are to: (i) establish a 
competitive remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors; and (ii) align Senior Executives’ remuneration 
with the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders, 
including customers and employees. 
In connection with this, the Committee aims to ensure that 
the remuneration packages offered to Executive Directors 
and Senior Executives:
  are competitive and attract, retain and motivate 
Executives of the right calibre;
  reflect their responsibility and experience within 
the business; 
  incorporate a significant element of performance related 
pay linked to the achievement of challenging performance 
criteria that are aligned with the Group’s strategy and 
increased shareholder value but remain appropriate given 
the Group’s risk profile;
  provide a total remuneration offering at ‘target’ levels of 
performance that is competitive in the relevant market;
  incentivise performance beyond ‘target’ levels, to be 
achieved by offering a significant proportion of remuneration 
to be delivered through incentive related pay; 
  create a strong alignment between the interests of Senior 
Management and the sustained delivery of shareholder value;
  take due account/full consideration of the principles set 
out in the Code;
  take due account of pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group;
  provide the foundation for overall reward and remuneration 
structures at Senior Management levels; and
  provide an appropriate balance between 
non-performance related and performance related pay.
The Committee reviews the remuneration policy and 
in particular performance related pay scheme structures 
on an annual basis to ensure that they continue to operate 
within the agreed risk framework of the Group. The 
Committee also ensures that an effective system of 
control and risk management is in place with regards 
to remuneration, which includes access to the Audit 
Committee to discuss matters of operational and financial 
risk. The Committee is satisfied that the current policy 
does not encourage or reward for undue risk taking. 
The Committee ensures that performance related 
pay structures will not raise environmental, social or 
governance (“ESG”) risks by inadvertently motivating 
irresponsible behaviour. More generally, with regard to 
the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction 
on the Committee which prevents it from taking into 
account corporate governance on ESG matters.
The policy, in relation to subsequent years, will be kept under 
review to ensure that it reflects any changing circumstances.
Remuneration for Executive Directors
The main component parts of the remuneration packages 
for Executive Directors are detailed in the table on pages 
38 to 41, which should be read in conjunction with the 
recruitment/promotion policy on page 44, and the

Poilcy table
Remuneration element  and purpose O p e r at i o n Op p o r tu n i t y   Performance metrics
Base salary
To attract and retain key individuals. 
Reflects the relevant skills and experience in role.
  Salaries are set on 1 January each year and reviewed 
annually against performance, experience, 
responsibilities, relevant market information and the 
level of workforce pay increases.
The salaries set for 1 January 2014 are:
  CEO – £385,000
  COO, Consumer Facing Business – £256,000
  CFO – £245,000
Annual increases will usually be commensurate with those 
of the wider workforce.
If there are significant changes in responsibility or a 
change in scope, increases may exceed this level.
New joiners, where pay is initially set below market levels, 
may experience larger increases as their salary is 
progressed towards the market rate, based on their 
development in the role.
A broad-based assessment of individual and Company 
performance is considered as part of any salary review. 
Pension
To provide cost-effective, yet market competitive, 
retirement benefits.
  Contribution to a personal pension arrangement or 
cash in lieu of pension by way of a salary supplement.
  8% of salary for Executive Directors. Only basic annual 
salary is pensionable.
Not applicable.
Benefits
To provide cost-effective, yet market competitive, benefits.
  A car allowance for certain Executive Directors, private 
health insurance and life insurance cover.
  The Committee may offer Executive Directors other 
employee benefits on broadly similar terms to those 
of the wider workforce.
  Car allowance of £16,000 for the Chief Executive and 
£12,300 for the Chief Operating Officer, Consumer 
Facing Business. 
  Family cover private health insurance.
  Life insurance cover of four times salary.
  The value of insured benefits may vary from year to year 
based on the third-party costs of supplying the benefits. 
  Where Executive Directors are recruited from overseas, 
benefits more tailored to their geographical location may 
be provided.
Not applicable.
Annual bonus plan
To motivate Executive Directors and incentivise the 
achievement of key financial and strategic goals and 
targets over the financial year.
  Bonus is paid wholly in cash. 
  Based on the achievement of performance metrics 
with a sliding scale from a threshold to maximum level 
of performance.
  Clawback may be applied in the event of material 
misconduct and/or an error in the calculation of the 
bonus payable.
  Maximum bonus potential is 100% of salary for the 
Chief Executive and 75% of salary for other Directors.
  The Committee, in its discretion, acting fairly and 
reasonably, may alter the bonus outcome (upwards or 
downwards) if it feels that the payout is inconsistent with 
the Company’s overall performance and events taking 
place during the year along with any other factors it 
considers relevant. The Committee will consult with the 
Company’s major shareholders before any exercise of its 
discretion to increase the bonus outcome and will explain 
the use of any such discretion in the relevant Annual 
Report on Remuneration. 
The majority of the bonus will be based on financial 
measures such as EBITDA targeted performance of the 
Group (and operating divisions as appropriate), which 
takes into account market forecasts, and a minority of 
the bonus will be based on Group strategic objectives 
and/or personal objectives tailored to the achievement 
of the Group strategic goals.
The proportion of the maximum bonus that may 
become payable at the threshold performance level 
where financial targets are set will be 0% of that part 
of the bonus. Bonuses above this level are earned on 
a graduated basis to the maximum performance level. 
Where strategic targets are set, it is not always 
practicable to operate targets that can be assessed

Remuneration element  and purpose O p e r at i o n Op p o r tu n i t y   Performance metrics
Base salary
To attract and retain key individuals. 
Reflects the relevant skills and experience in role.
  Salaries are set on 1 January each year and reviewed 
annually against performance, experience, 
responsibilities, relevant market information and the 
level of workforce pay increases.
The salaries set for 1 January 2014 are:
  CEO – £385,000
  COO, Consumer Facing Business – £256,000
  CFO – £245,000
Annual increases will usually be commensurate with those 
of the wider workforce.
If there are significant changes in responsibility or a 
change in scope, increases may exceed this level.
New joiners, where pay is initially set below market levels, 
may experience larger increases as their salary is 
progressed towards the market rate, based on their 
development in the role.
A broad-based assessment of individual and Company 
performance is considered as part of any salary review. 
Pension
To provide cost-effective, yet market competitive, 
retirement benefits.
  Contribution to a personal pension arrangement or 
cash in lieu of pension by way of a salary supplement.
  8% of salary for Executive Directors. Only basic annual 
salary is pensionable.
Not applicable.
Benefits
To provide cost-effective, yet market competitive, benefits.
  A car allowance for certain Executive Directors, private 
health insurance and life insurance cover.
  The Committee may offer Executive Directors other 
employee benefits on broadly similar terms to those 
of the wider workforce.
  Car allowance of £16,000 for the Chief Executive and 
£12,300 for the Chief Operating Officer, Consumer 
Facing Business. 
  Family cover private health insurance.
  Life insurance cover of four times salary.
  The value of insured benefits may vary from year to year 
based on the third-party costs of supplying the benefits. 
  Where Executive Directors are recruited from overseas, 
benefits more tailored to their geographical location may 
be provided.
Not applicable.
Annual bonus plan
To motivate Executive Directors and incentivise the 
achievement of key financial and strategic goals and 
targets over the financial year.
  Bonus is paid wholly in cash. 
  Based on the achievement of performance metrics 
with a sliding scale from a threshold to maximum level 
of performance.
  Clawback may be applied in the event of material 
misconduct and/or an error in the calculation of the 
bonus payable.
  Maximum bonus potential is 100% of salary for the 
Chief Executive and 75% of salary for other Directors.
  The Committee, in its discretion, acting fairly and 
reasonably, may alter the bonus outcome (upwards or 
downwards) if it feels that the payout is inconsistent with 
the Company’s overall performance and events taking 
place during the year along with any other factors it 
considers relevant. The Committee will consult with the 
Company’s major shareholders before any exercise of its 
discretion to increase the bonus outcome and will explain 
the use of any such discretion in the relevant Annual 
Report on Remuneration. 
The majority of the bonus will be based on financial 
measures such as EBITDA targeted performance of the 
Group (and operating divisions as appropriate), which 
takes into account market forecasts, and a minority of 
the bonus will be based on Group strategic objectives 
and/or personal objectives tailored to the achievement 
of the Group strategic goals.
The proportion of the maximum bonus that may 
become payable at the threshold performance level 
where financial targets are set will be 0% of that part 
of the bonus. Bonuses above this level are earned on 
a graduated basis to the maximum performance level. 
Where strategic targets are set, it is not always 
practicable to operate targets that can be assessed 
using a graduated scale.

Remuneration for Executive Directors continued
The Committee operates the annual bonus plan and long 
term incentive plans according to their respective rules 
and consistent with normal market practice, the Listing 
Rules and HMRC rules where relevant, including flexibility 
in a number of regards. These include:
  timing of awards and payments;
  the size of an award (within the limits noted in the 
table above), and when and how much should vest;
  who receives an award or payment;
  dealing with a change of control or restructuring 
of the Group;
  determining whether a participant is a good/bad leaver 
for incentive plan purposes and whether and what 
proportion of awards vest; 
  any adjustments required to awards in certain 
circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, 
events and special dividends); and
  the weightings, measures and targets for the annual 
bonus plan and LTIP from year to year.
The Committee retains the discretion to adjust the targets 
and/or set different measures and alter weightings for the 
annual bonus plan and to adjust targets for the LTIP if 
events occur (e.g. a major acquisition or disposal) which 
cause it to determine that the conditions are unable to 
fulfil their original intended purpose and the change would 
not be materially less difficult to satisfy. 
The relative proportions of fixed and performance related remuneration for the Executive Directors, based on the 
remuneration policy, is shown below based on three performance scenarios: minimum, target and maximum.
1. Minimum = fixed pay only (base salary, benefits and pension);
2. Target = 50% of annual bonus and 25% vesting of the PSP awards; and
3. Maximum = 100% of annual bonus payable and 100% vesting of the PSP awards.
Salary levels are based on those applying on 1 January 2014.
The value of taxable benefits is the estimated cost of supplying those benefits (using the cost for the year ended 
31 December 2013 as a proxy). 
The pension value is based on an 8% of salary contribution/supplement. 
Amounts have been rounded to the nearest £1,000. Share price growth has been ignored.

Existing awards
The Committee intends to honour any commitments, 
including outstanding PSP awards, on the terms applicable 
at the time each such commitment was made. The relevant 
outstanding awards are described in more detail on page 49. 
Policy on contracts of service
All Directors have rolling contracts with notice periods 
of no more than twelve months.

Copies are available for inspection on request to the 
Company Secretary. 
It is the Committee’s policy for the notice periods of 
Executive Directors to be twelve months or less. 
In the event of termination, the Committee’s policy is 
that payments on termination should reflect the specific 
circumstances prevailing. In general it would be the 
Committee’s policy to make a payment in lieu of notice 
where necessary, limited to base salary and benefits. To the 
extent that an individual might otherwise seek to bring a 
claim against the Company in relation to the termination 
of their employment (e.g. for breach of contract or unfair 
dismissal), the Committee retains the right to make an 
appropriate payment in settlement of such potential or 
actual claims. Payments in connection with any statutory 
entitlements (e.g. in relation to redundancy) may be made as 
required. In connection with the foregoing, the Committee 
reserves the right to award to an Executive Director a bonus 
in respect of the period of the year in which notice of 
termination had not been served (and, in certain exceptional 
circumstances, in respect of any period following receipt of 
notice of resignation) that the individual remained in 
employment, subject to the appropriate performance 
measures being achieved. The determination of any share 
incentive vesting would be subject to the rules of the 
relevant plan, but in general where an individual is a good 
leaver (death, injury or disability, retirement, redundancy 
transfer of business outside of the Group and any other 
reason the Committee decides) their awards would vest on 
the cessation date, unless the Committee decides the award 
should continue to the original vesting date and remain 
subject to the appropriate performance measures being 
achieved and time pro rating (unless the Committee decides 
it is inappropriate to apply time pro rating). 
The Committee would intend to apply the above policy 
for any new appointment, which may include the ability 
to make phased payments with mitigation. 
The Non-executive Directors have letters of appointment 
which provide for notice by either party giving to the other 
not less than three months’ notice in writing. The Company 
may also terminate by making a payment in lieu of notice.
None of the employment contracts of the Directors 
contain special contractual termination provisions.
Policy on external appointments
Sportech PLC recognises that its Directors are likely 
to be invited to become Non-executive Directors of 
other companies and that such exposure can broaden 
experience and knowledge, which will benefit the 
Company. Executive Directors are therefore allowed to 
accept Non-executive appointments and retain any fees 
earned, with the Board’s prior permission, as long as these 
are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest. In this regard, 
Ian Penrose is a Trustee of the National Football Museum, 
a registered charity, and he receives no remuneration in 
respect of this appointment.
Other employees’ pay
The Committee did not consult with employees directly 
on matters of Executive remuneration. However, the 
Committee is aware of the disconnect which can be 
created if Executive Director remuneration is set in 
isolation and therefore is updated during the year with 
details of the pay and employment conditions in the wider 
workforce. In particular the Committee is made aware of 
general salary increases, general benefit provision and the 
proposed level of annual bonuses. The Committee is also 
responsible for reviewing the participants of the LTIPs 
and participation levels in the all-employee plans. 
Base salary increases across the Group were in the range 
of 0% to 2.0% for 2014, reflecting the RPI prevailing in the 
country in which the individual is employed. The Executive 
Directors are employed in the UK and therefore their 
increase of 2.0% is consistent with the general pay award 
for UK-based employees. 
Remuneration policy across the Group
The remuneration policy described in this Report is 
broadly consistent with the policy used for other Senior 
Executives of the Company. A significant proportion of 
remuneration remains performance related, although 
lower quantums will operate. 
The majority of employees will participate in annual bonus 
schemes, although the limits and performance metrics will 
vary according to the seniority and location of the role.
Participation in the LTIPs is targeted at Senior 
Management and key staff, to align employees’ interests 
with those of shareholders. 
The majority of new employees are eligible to join a 
defined contribution pension plan.  CORPOR A TE GOVERNANCE

Policy on Executive Director recruitments/promotions 
In relation to an external executive recruitment or an internal promotion the Committee will follow the principles 
outlined in the table below:
Element of remuneration Policy
Base salary Salary levels will be set based on:
  the particular experience, knowledge and skill of the individual; 
  market rates for comparable positions in companies of a similar size and complexity; and 
  internal Company relativities. 
Where considered appropriate the Committee may wish to set the initial salary below 
the perceived market rate (e.g. to reflect an individual’s limited experience at a PLC 
board level) but with the view to make phased increases, potentially above those of 
the wider workforce as a percentage of salary, to achieve the desired market 
positioning over time. Any increases would be subject to the individual’s continued 
development and performance in the role. 
Benefits A new appointment would be offered the same benefits package (or equivalent in line 
with local market practice) as that provided to current Executive Directors. 
Where considered necessary, the Committee may be required to pay certain 
relocation expenses, legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual in relation 
to their appointment.
Pension A defined contribution or cash supplement (or equivalent in line with local market 
practice) at the level provided to current Executive Directors may be provided.
Annual bonus The Committee would envisage the annual bonus for any new appointment operating 
as set out in the Policy Table for current Executive Directors. The annual bonus 
maximum would be limited to that of the current Chief Executive. 
However, the Committee may consider it necessary (depending on timing and the 
nature of the appointment) to set different tailored performance measures for the 
initial bonus year.
Long term incentives Ongoing LTIP awards will be made on the same terms as current Executives, 
albeit possibly with different performance periods depending on the timing of the 
appointment. The maximum ongoing award will be no higher than that of the current 
Chief Executive. An award may be made shortly after an appointment.
For internal promotions, existing awards will continue over their original vesting period 
and remain subject to their terms as at the date of grant.
A new appointment would be eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plan under the 
same terms as all other employees. 
Buy-out awards To facilitate an external recruitment, it may be necessary to buy out remuneration 
which would be forfeited on the appointee leaving their previous employer. When 
determining the quantum and structure of any buy-out awards the Committee will, 
where possible, use a consistent basis, taking into account the form of remuneration 
(cash or shares), timing horizons and the application of any performance criteria. 
Buy-out awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s existing share plans 
to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes 
if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.   BUSINESS OVERVIEW CORPOR A TE GOVERNANCE STR A TEG IC R E P ORT FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS

Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
Shareholder engagement
The Committee considers an open and constructive 
dialogue with investors to be vitally important to 
establishing a successful remuneration policy which is 
considered fair by both Executives and shareholders. 
Therefore, the Committee will consult with major investors 
whenever material changes to the policy are proposed. 
The Committee also welcomes investor feedback and will 
consider views raised at the AGM and regular meetings 
throughout the year when establishing the overall policy. 
Annual Report on Remuneration
The Committee’s Terms of Reference are available from 
the Company Secretary and can be found on the 
Company’s website at www.sportechplc.com/investor_
centre/corporate_governance/remuneration_committee_
terms_of_reference.
The Committee met six times during the year and the 
following key activities have been undertaken:
  review of best practice;
  approval and grant of annual awards under the PSP in the 
year under review;
  review of the PSP performance conditions and approval 
to retain both challenging financial growth conditions 
and Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) conditions. For 
2013, the weighting on each performance metric was 
changed so that vesting will take place based on relative 
TSR performance and EPS growth (i.e. absolute TSR 
performance is no longer to be retained as a long term 
performance metric), as described on pages 50 and 51. 
This basis is to be kept for the 2014 issue;
  in February 2014, approval of bonus awards, paid out in 
line with the 2013 bonus policy and approval of bonus 
policy for 2014;
  review of the Chairman’s remuneration;
  review of base salaries for the Executive team; and
  review and approval of terms of employment for Cliff Baty.
The Committee’s recommendations in 2013 and early 2014 
were all accepted and implemented by the Board.
Compliance with best practice 
During 2013, the Committee has, with the assistance of its 
independent remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street 
(“NBS”) (a trading name of Aon Plc), reviewed its practices 
and policies to ensure they are in line with what it perceives 
to be best practice and the Company’s strategic objectives. 
The Committee continues to be committed to the principles 
of good governance as set out in the Code.
Composition of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee currently consists of Peter Williams 
(Chairman), David McKeith and Rich Roberts, who are 
all Independent Non-executive Directors. John Barnes 
was a member of the Committee until his resignation 
on 3 December 2013. Rich Roberts was appointed as 
a member of the Committee on 27 January 2014. None 
of the Committee has any personal financial interest 
(other than as a shareholder), conflicts of interest from 
cross-Directorships or day-to-day involvement in the 
running of the business. 
Peter Williams became Chairman of the Committee in 
April 2011, taking over from John Barnes. The Chief 
Executive and Chairman are invited to attend meetings 
although neither is present when matters affecting his own 
remuneration are discussed. The Company Secretary acts 
as secretary to the Committee. 
The Committee retains independent remuneration 
consultants, NBS, to advise on all aspects of Executive 
remuneration. NBS is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and has signed up to its Code of 
Conduct. NBS has no connection with Sportech other 
than in the provision of advice on Executive remuneration. 
The terms of engagement with NBS are available from 
the Company Secretary on request. The fees of the 
independent remuneration consultants in relation to the 
services provided by them to the Company during the 
financial year were £64,415, of which £33,000 related 
to advice to the Company on the implementation and 
administration of share incentive schemes.
The Committee reviews its relationships with external 
advisers on a regular basis and believes that no conflicts 
of interest exist.
Detailed remuneration policy for 2014 
Basic annual salary
Each Executive Director’s basic salary is reviewed 
and determined by the Committee annually, taking into 
account the individual’s performance and experience. 
The Committee also makes use of independent benchmark 
data provided by external remuneration consultants, 
takes due account of market median data in separate 
comparator groups based on sector, size and complexity, 
and is aware of the level of salary increases awarded to 
other employees within the Group. 
  Ian Penrose, Chief Executive, was awarded a salary 
increase of 2%, which is consistent with the general pay 
award for all UK-based employees. He is paid a salary of 
£385,000 per annum with effect from 1 January 2014.
  Cliff Baty, Chief Financial Officer, is paid a salary of 
£245,000 per annum with effect from 1 January 2014, an 
increase of 2%, which is consistent with the general pay 
award for all UK-based employees.
  Ian Hogg, Chief Operating Officer, Consumer Facing 
Business, is paid a salary of £256,000 per annum with effect 
from 1 January 2014, an increase of 2%, which is consistent 
with the general pay award for all UK-based employees.
Performance related bonus
The maximum bonus potential for the Chief Executive for 
2014 is 100% of basic salary and for the Chief Operating 
Officer, Consumer Facing Business and Chief Financial 
Officer is 75% of basic salary. 
For each Executive Director, their performance related 
bonus is based on the EBITDA performance of the Group 
(and operating divisions as appropriate), delivering on   CORPOR A TE GOVERNANCE

Performance related bonus continued
Group strategic objectives and meeting personal targets. 
The EBITDA-based proportion of the bonus, which 
represents 70% of each Director’s bonus entitlement, is 
operated with a range set around a budgeted EBITDA figure 
(taking into account City forecasts). Strategic and personal 
objectives include continuing to develop our multiple 
business interests in Connecticut and California, rolling out 
our racing and digital footprint and developing the Sportech 
team to take advantage of these new and innovative 
business opportunities. Further detail about such strategic 
and personal objectives is considered commercially sensitive 
and will therefore not be disclosed prospectively. The 
Committee will consider whether retrospective disclosure 
is appropriate. This bonus is wholly payable in cash.
Pension arrangements
The Company will contribute into a defined contribution 
scheme for the Executive Directors at a rate of 8%. Only 
basic annual salary is pensionable.
Other benefits
Executive Directors are entitled to the following other 
main benefits:
  Chief Executive – 29 working days’ holiday per annum 
in addition to normal bank and public holidays. Other 
Executive Directors – 25 working days’ holiday per annum 
in addition to normal bank and public holidays;
  a car allowance of £16,000 for the Chief Executive 
and £12,300 for the COO, Consumer Facing Business;
  private health insurance for themselves, their spouse 
and children; and
  life insurance of four times salary.
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
The Committee believes that share ownership and the 
granting of share-based incentives strengthens the link 
between Executives’ personal interests and those of the 
shareholders. The Company has two long term share plans 
in place, being a share option scheme and a performance 
share plan (“PSP”). The Company’s policy has been to only 
grant awards under the PSP since its adoption in 2007.
It is the Committee’s intention to grant awards in 2014 at 100% 
of salary to the Chief Executive and 75% of salary to the other 
Directors. The targets to apply to the 2014 awards will be the 
same as those applied to the 2013 awards being, 50% based 
on the Company’s relative TSR performance (Part A) and 50% 
based on performance against a challenging range of EPS 
growth targets (Part B). 
The vesting of Part A of each such award will be dependent 
on Sportech’s TSR over a fixed three-year period relative 
to the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE Small Cap 
Index (excluding investment trusts) over the same period 
(the comparator group set as at the date of grant). 
No portion of Part A will vest unless Sportech’s TSR 
performance at least matches the median of the TSR 
performance within the comparator group; thereafter the 
following vesting schedule will apply:
The Company’s TSR rank against the TSR 
of the comparator companies Extent of vesting of Part A 
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between
25% and 100%
Upper quartile (or better) 100%
The vesting of Part B of each such award will be 
dependent on Sportech’s EPS performance over a fixed 
three-year period. No portion of Part B will vest unless 
Sportech’s EPS growth is at least equal to the Retail Prices 
Index (“RPI”) plus 4% per annum; thereafter the following 
vesting schedule will apply:
The Company’s EPS growth Extent of vesting of Part B 
At least RPI + 4% p.a. 25%
Between a minimum of RPI + 4% p.a. 
and 10% p.a.
Pro rata between 
25% and 100%
At least RPI + 10% p.a. 100%
EPS performance will be tested from a base year 
ended 31 December 2013 with EPS being calculated 
on such adjusted basis as the Remuneration Committee 
determines appropriate. Adjusted EPS for such purposes 
will be disclosed in due course at the time of vesting in the 
Remuneration Report. 
Policy on Executive share ownership
The Board has adopted a formal policy in respect of 
Executive share ownership, pursuant to which all Executives 
are expected to invest in the Company to a level of at least 
100% of annual salary over time, save that under such 
policy Executives may build to this level using 50% of net 
awards under the Company’s long term incentive plans. 
Current share ownerships are set out on page 52.
Non-executive Directors’ fees and incentives 
The fees of the Non-executive Directors are set by the 
Board following a review against fee levels operated in 
companies of a comparable size and after taking into 
account the anticipated time commitment of each role. 
The Non-executive Directors do not participate in any 
incentive, pension or benefit schemes of the Company, 
other than in the case of Lorne Weil who was issued an 
incentive award in October 2010 (see page 51). 
The fees set for 1 January 2014 are £120,000 for the Chairman 
and a set fee of £47,500 (with a further £5,000 for each 
Committee they sit on) for UK-based Non-executives and 
a set fee of $100,000 for US-based Non-executives. The 
fees set for Non-executives are at the top end of the upper 
quartile for comparable companies, reflecting the onerous 
international regulatory environment for Sportech and the 
fact that Board meetings will be held in both the US and the 
UK, necessitating additional travel and time commitments.

Performance related bonus
The maximum bonus potential for the Chief Executive 
in the year under review was 100% of basic salary, and for 
each of the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Operating 
Officer, Consumer Facing Business was 75% of basic salary. 
For each Executive Director their performance related 
bonus was based on (i) the EBITDA performance of the 
Group (with EBITDA of individual operating divisions 
included within the targets set for the Chief Operating 
Officer, Consumer Facing Business) and (ii) strategic 
objectives aligned with Group strategic goals.
EBITDA performance
The Committee considered the Group’s EBITDA performance 
for these purposes excluding the e-Gaming business and 
exercised its discretion to scale back the bonuses based on 
this performance test to take account of the losses made 
during the year in the e-Gaming business prior to achieving 
what was considered a successful sale out of the Group. With 
this in mind, in respect of both the Chief Executive and the 
Chief Financial Officer, achievement was determined to 
be 10% out of a maximum target of 70% of potential bonus, 
and for the Chief Operating Officer, Consumer Facing 
Business achievement was deemed to be 6% out of a 
maximum target of 85% of potential bonus (it being noted 
that his target had a split of Group and operating divisional 
EBITDA (being up to 30% and 55% respectively of this part 
of his bonus), and no bonus was payable with regards to 
the EBITDA performance of the relevant individual 
operating division).
The actual targets set (e.g. the numbers included in 
the Group’s financial plans) are considered to remain 
commercially sensitive and consideration will be given 
to disclosing these in future years. 
Strategic objectives
With regards to the Chief Executive, his strategic targets 
related to delivering against a number of growth focused 
initiatives primarily in relation to the Group’s activities in the 
USA. These included the development of the Bradley sports 
bar, restaurant and betting venue, achieving a successful 
outcome in relation to exclusive online opportunities in 
Connecticut, establishing business opportunities in California 
and developing the Group’s operational team and structure. 
These were assessed to have been achieved in full, resulting in 
an award of 30% out of a maximum target of 30% of potential 
bonus. The strategic targets relating to the Chief Financial 
Officer included improving the operational capability and 
reporting of the finance function within the Group and 
undertaking a detailed evaluation and assessment of 
opportunities in the e-Gaming market. These targets were 
considered to have been largely met, resulting in an award of 
25% out of a maximum target of 30% of potential bonus. The 
strategic targets for the Chief Operating Officer, Consumer 
Facing Business related to the ongoing development of 
the UK Football Pools business and its move to stabilising 
profitability and cash flows, and the targets relating to this 
objective were met in full, resulting in an award of 15% 
out of a maximum target of 15% of potential bonus.
The bonus payable to the Chief Financial Officer was in 
respect of the full year under review (i.e. based on his full 
year salary) notwithstanding that he joined the Company 
in May 2013. This was agreed as part of the terms of his 
recruitment to offset the forfeiture of the bonus he would 
have earned but forfeited when he agreed to join Sportech 
and resigned from his then employment. The Remuneration 
Committee was comfortable taking this approach (i.e. offering 
performance related compensation based on performance 
at Sportech) as opposed to estimating the cash value of 
a bonus forfeited on leaving his former employer.
The table below summarises the overall bonus result. 
Individual Total bonus: % Maximum (% salary payable)
Chief Executive 40% of maximum (40% of salary payable)
Chief Financial Officer 35% of maximum (26.25% of salary payable)
Chief Operating Officer, Consumer Facing Business 21% of maximum (15.75% of salary payable)  BUSINESS OVERVIEW CORPOR A TE GOVERNANCE STR A TEG IC R E P ORT FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS

The Committee is comfortable that the level of bonuses 
paid to Executive Directors reflects both the Company and 
individual performance during the year. 
Pension arrangements
The Company contributed into a defined contribution scheme 
for the Executive Directors at a rate of 8%. Only basic annual 
salary was pensionable. Four Directors (2012: three Directors) 
were members of defined contribution schemes during the 
year. Contributions paid by the Company in respect of these 
Directors are as shown in the table on page 47. 
Long Term Incentive Plans (“LTIPs”)
Awards vested in relation to performance 
ending 2013
Part of the awards granted in 2010 and 2011 reached the 
end of their performance periods in the year under review. 
This includes the two-thirds of the 2010 award subject to 
relative TSR and absolute TSR (performance period ended 
5 October 2013) and one-third of the 2011 award subject 
to EPS (performance period ended 31 December 2013). 
Summary details of the full conditions applying to the 2010 
and 2011 awards are included as a footnote to the PSP table 
on page 51.
In terms of the 2010 award, the assessment of the TSR 
measures was made independently by NBS who advised 
that Sportech’s TSR achieved a three-year TSR which 
ranked above the upper quartile and greater than the 15% p.a. 
maximum absolute target, thereby triggering full vesting for 
each element of this award.
In terms of the 2011 award, the EPS growth over the three-year 
period to 31 December 2013 was 9.45% p.a. thereby triggering 
47.5% vesting of this element of the award, subject to 
Committee approval.
In summary the total number of awards for each Executive 
is shown in the table below.  CORPOR A TE GOVERNANCE

LTIP awards granted during 2013
Share option scheme
A share option scheme is in place, the details of which are 
described in note 26. The last award under such a scheme 
was made in 2005.
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) 
The PSP was introduced in 2007. Under the rules of the 
PSP, awards may normally be granted up to 100% of 
salary, other than in exceptional circumstances, when they 
may be granted up to 200% of salary. 
The Committee had previously approved the introduction 
of an annual award policy from 2012 at up to 100% of salary 
to Executive Directors. An award was made to Cliff Baty 
shortly after appointment at 115% of salary, as an exceptional 
award, to reflect remuneration forfeited on leaving his 
previous employment.
The award was set after the Committee had considered 
the awards that lapsed on leaving his former employer 
and the Company’s normal LTIP policy. It was not 
considered appropriate to provide any non-performance 
related compensation for potential value lost on leaving 
his former employer.
2013 awards – targets
In connection with the awards to the Executive Directors, 
two distinct performance conditions apply, each in relation 
to one-half of each award. 
For ease of reference such halves are referred to below as 
Part A and Part B respectively. 
The vesting of Part A of each such award will be dependent 
on Sportech’s TSR over a fixed three-year period relative 
to the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE Small Cap 
Index (excluding investment trusts) over the same period 
(the comparator group set as at the date of grant).
No portion of Part A will vest unless Sportech’s TSR 
performance at least matches the median of the TSR 
performance within the comparator group; thereafter the 
following vesting schedule will apply:
The Company’s TSR rank against the TSR 
of the comparator companies Extent of vesting of Part A 
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between
25% and 100%
Upper quartile (or better) 100%
The vesting of Part B of each such award will be 
dependent on Sportech’s EPS performance over a fixed 
three-year period. No portion of Part B will vest unless 
Sportech’s EPS growth is at least equal to the Retail Prices 
Index (“RPI”) plus 4% per annum; thereafter the following 
vesting schedule will apply: 
The Company’s EPS growth Extent of vesting of Part B 
At least RPI + 4% p.a. 25%
Between a minimum of RPI + 4% p.a. 
and 10% p.a.
Pro rata between 
25% and 100%
At least RPI + 10% p.a. 100%
EPS performance will be tested from a base year 
ended 31 December 2012 with EPS being calculated 
on such adjusted basis as the Remuneration Committee 
determines appropriate. Adjusted EPS for such purposes 
will be disclosed in due course at the time of vesting in 
the Remuneration Report.

1  2010, 2011 and 2012 awards were subject to relative TSR, 
absolute TSR and EPS growth performance targets each 
applying to one-third of the awards. The performance targets

structure with the specific details outlined on pages 34 and 35 
of the 2012 Annual Report.

date subject to satisfaction of applicable performance criteria, 
with the full amount of his 2010 award under the PSP, one-third 
of his 2011 award under the PSP and one-third of his 2012 award 
under the PSP being transferred. 
4   Lorne Weil’s award was a one-off shareholder approved award 
made subject to the same performance conditions as set out 
in note 1, but also conditional on Lorne Weil investing in and 
retaining 2,000,000 ordinary shares in the Company. Summary 
details were included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
the year ended 31 December 2010.
The number of ordinary shares that may be issued under 
the PSP and any other share plan may not exceed 10% 
in any ten-year period. As at 31 December 2013 the 
Company’s potential dilution was 6.7%.

Payment for loss of office
As explained in last year’s report, pursuant to an 
agreement in relation to his departure from the Board, 
Steve Cunliffe, whose employment with the Company 
terminated on 6 March 2013, received: (i) payment of eight 
months’ salary and benefits in lieu of notice; and (ii) 
subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria, 
a bonus in respect of the year under review, pro rated 
to 14 November 2012 (the date notice was served). Steve 
Cunliffe was treated as a good leaver under the rules of the 
PSP following a restructuring of the Board, which resulted 
in his individual role effectively being made redundant 
(i.e. different skill sets were required for the future of the 
Group). As such, he retained the full amount of his 2010 
award under the PSP, one-third of his 2011 award under 
the PSP and one-third of his 2012 award under the PSP, 
subject to satisfaction of applicable performance criteria. 
Payment of salary and benefits in lieu of notice was made 
on a monthly basis. The bonus was paid in March 2013. The 
PSP awards will vest on their normal vesting date subject 
to the relevant performance conditions being achieved. 
Payments to former Directors
Details of payments received by Steve Cunliffe in 2013 are 
as set out above, such payments being included in the 
single total figure.
Brooks Pierce was treated as a good leaver under the rules 
of the PSP following a restructuring of the Board, which 
resulted in his individual role effectively being made 
redundant. As such, subject to satisfaction of applicable 
performance criteria, he retained each of his 2010, 2011 and 
2012 awards under the PSP pro rated according to his 
termination date of 10 May 2012. Further to this, in 2013, he 
received a total payment under the 2010 award of £333,000 
plus the amount set out in the single total figure for 2012 
(on page 47 of this Report) which was also received in 2013.
In addition, in March 2013 he received his bonus in relation 
to the year ended 31 December 2012, as set out in the 
previous financial year’s Remuneration Report.

All Executive Directors are expected to hold an investment 
of at least 100% of base salary in Company shares. This 
requirement can be achieved over a period of time using 
50% of net awards which vest under the Company’s LTIPs. 
The table above shows shareholdings as at 31 December 2013 
and the percentage of the guideline currently met.
Total shareholding which counts towards the 
measurement of the guideline is calculated on the basis 
of legally owned shares plus vested PSP awards. 
The percentage of guideline met is based on the annual 
base salary and the higher of the acquisition cost of the 
total shareholding or the current market value of the total 
shareholding. Once an Executive Director meets the 
required holding, the Executive Director is only required to 
purchase additional shares equivalent to the value of any 
increase in base salary.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW CORPOR A TE GOVERNANCE STR A TEG IC R E P ORT FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS

Substantial shareholdings continued 
On 5 March 2014, interests representing 3% or more of 
the issued share capital of the Company had been notified 
to the Company as shown on page 54.
The Company and Scientific Games Corporation Inc. (“SGC”) 
had entered into a Lock-Up Agreement pursuant to which 
SGC agreed not to dispose of any of the shares it acquired 
as part of the Sportech Racing acquisition (“Consideration 
Shares”) for a period commencing on completion of the 
acquisition of Sportech Racing (5 October 2010) up to 
and including the third anniversary of completion, which 
has now passed. The Lock-Up Agreement did not prohibit 
SGC from transferring the Consideration Shares, inter alia, 
to its connected persons or from accepting a takeover 
offer in respect of the Consideration Shares made under 
the City Code. The Lock-Up Agreement could have been 
terminated if, inter alia, the Company or its connected 
persons enters into certain types of lottery business, the 
Company or certain of its affiliated persons are in violation 
of the law or the Company breaches certain obligations to 
provide information pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.
As at 31 December 2013 there are no restrictions on the 
transfer of securities in the Company or on voting rights. 
Dividend
No dividend is proposed (2012: £nil) and no dividend 
has been paid during the year (2012: £nil).
Environmental matters
The Corporate Social Responsibility Report provides 
information with respect to the Group’s impact on 
the environment and can be found on page 23.
Corporate governance
The Group’s statement on corporate governance is set out 
on pages 28 to 35 and forms part of this Directors’ Report.
Significant agreements
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or 
potentially terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid, such as commercial contracts and 
employees’ share plans. None of these are deemed to be 
individually significant in terms of their potential impact 
on the day-to-day running of the business of the Group 
as a whole, other than as noted below:
  the main banking facilities with the three principal lenders, 
Bank of Scotland plc, Barclays Bank PLC and Royal Bank 
of Scotland plc, have mandatory pre-payment provisions 
in respect of a change of control or trade sale, with the 
facilities cancelled and all outstanding debt becoming 
immediately due and payable if a lender so requires; and
  the Group operates under a number of licences in various 
territories awarded to it by regulatory bodies. In the event 
of a change of control, certain regulatory bodies retain 
the right to pre-approve the acquirer in order for a 
change of control to be permitted.
There are no clauses in any of the Directors’ contracts 
that are triggered by a change of control of the Company. 
Takeover Directive
The Company has only one class of ordinary shares and 
these shares have equal voting rights. The nature of individual 
Director’s holdings and individually significant shareholders are 
disclosed on page 52. There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of shares following the end of the Lock-Up Agreement with 
Scientific Games Corporation Inc. on 5 October 2010 as 
described earlier. 
As part of the resolutions approved at the 2013 AGM, 
shareholders’ authority was given to the Company’s Directors 
for the allotment of up to 66,270,100 ordinary shares of 50p 
each if the authority is not utilised in connection with a rights 
issue, representing 33.3% of the issued share capital of the 
Company as at the date of the 2013 AGM. During the year, 
the Directors did not exercise the authorities given to them 
(to allot shares). As at 31 December 2013, the Directors have 
the power to allot up to 132,540,201 ordinary shares of 50p 
each, representing 66.7% of the issued share capital as at 
the date of the 2013 AGM in connection with a rights issue, 
subject to a reduction of any amount of shares issued 
in accordance with the preceding reference. 
Certain of the Company’s share incentive schemes contain 
provisions that permit awards or options to vest or become 
exercisable on a change of control in accordance with the 
rules of the schemes.
Going concern
The Group has committed revolving credit banking 
facilities totalling £75m in place with Bank of Scotland plc, 
Barclays Bank PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland plc until 
August 2015. The Group meets its day-to-day working 
capital requirements through working capital facilities. 
At 31 December 2013, a £2.5m overdraft facility was carved 
out of the overall £75m revolving credit facility in the UK 
with Bank of Scotland plc. This facility is due for renewal in 
July 2014. The Group’s forecasts and projections, which have 
been prepared for the period to 30 June 2015 and take into 
account reasonably possible changes in performance, show 
that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its 
current facilities and comply with its banking covenants.
After making reasonable enquiries, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements.  CORPOR A TE GOVERNANCE

Disclosure of information to auditors 
So far as each Director is aware, at the date of the approval of 
the financial statements there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. Each Director 
has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have indicated 
their willingness to continue in office, and a resolution 
that they be re-appointed will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group and Parent Company 
(the “Company”) financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
  make judgements and accounting estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Directors 
consider that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules
Each of the Directors whose names and functions are listed in 
the Board of Directors section on pages 24 and 25 confirm 
that, to the best of each person’s knowledge and belief:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit of the Group; and
  the Strategic Report and other reports contained in the 
Annual Report include a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group and Company, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
The Notice convening the AGM of the Company on 13 May 2014 
is being sent to shareholders with this report.
In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, 
Roger Withers and Peter Williams retire by rotation and offer 
themselves for re-appointment at the AGM. Cliff Baty and 
Rich Roberts will retire and offer themselves for re-appointment 
as they were appointed to the Board since the last AGM. 
Profiles of these Directors appear on pages 24 and 25.
Resolutions will also be proposed at the AGM to receive 
the Accounts and the Directors’ and Independent Auditors’ 
Reports, to approve the Remuneration Report set out on 
pages 37 to 53, to re-appoint the auditors and to authorise 
the Directors to fix their remuneration.

Report on the financial statements
Our opinion 
In our opinion:
  the financial statements, defined below, give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and Parent Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit and of the Group’s and Parent Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
  the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements and Parent Company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’), which are prepared 
by Sportech Plc (the ‘Parent Company’), comprise:
  the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
  the Group and Parent Company balance sheets as at 31 December 2013;
  the Group and Parent Company statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended; and
  the Accounting Policies and the notes to the financial statements which include other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
What an audit of financial statements involves 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of:
  whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
  the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
  the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts ( the ‘Annual Report’) to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be 
£650,000. This approximates to 2.5% of adjusted EBITDA, which we consider to be the most appropriate benchmark 
because it is reflective of the underlying profitability of the business.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above 
£30,000 as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons
Overview of the scope of our audit
The Group is structured along two principal geographical business lines, being the UK and US. The UK operations and the 
UK and group accounting functions are based in Liverpool with the US operations being based in Connecticut and Atlanta. 
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of their reporting units, comprising the group’s operating businesses 
and centralised functions. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed 
by us, as the group engagement team, at the reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.   CORPOR A TE GOVERNANCE
SPORTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 58
Report on the financial statements continued
Overview of our audit approach continued
Overview of the scope of our audit continued
Accordingly, of the group's 27 reporting units, we identified 14 which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial 
information, either due to their size or their risk characteristics. This, together with additional procedures performed at the 
Group level, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the directors made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of 
significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently 
uncertain. We primarily focused our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, 
forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we 
considered necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of 
all risks or areas of focus identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. Their report on 
those matters that they considered to be significant issues in relation to the financial statements is set out on pages 32 to 34. 
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Goodwill Impairment assessment
We focused on this area because the directors’ 
assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets, and the annual impairment review the 
directors are required to perform, involves complex and 
subjective judgments about the future results of the 
business. 
(Refer to note 12 to the financial statements.)
We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts, 
including comparing them to the latest Board approved 
budgets and challenged the assumptions therein. We 
challenged the directors’ key assumptions for discount 
and long term growth rates. We also performed sensitivity 
analysis around the key drivers (being forecast growth 
rates and cost savings) of the cash flow forecasts. Having 
ascertained the extent of change in those assumptions that 
either individually or collectively would be required for the 
asset to be impaired, we considered the likelihood of such 
movement in those key assumptions arising.
T axation
The tax affairs of the Group are complicated by the 
diversity of its geography and type of operations.
(Refer to note 8 to the financial statements.)
We assessed the directors’ current and deferred tax 
calculations and the assumptions on which they are based, 
utilising our knowledge and experience of tax matters in 
both the UK and US.
We also assessed the level of provisioning in respect of 
potential current tax liabilities, as well as considering the 
recoverability of recognised deferred tax assets.
Fraud in revenue recognition 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud 
in revenue recognition because of the pressure 
management may feel to achieve the planned results. 
We focused on the timing of revenue recognition and 
its presentation in the income statement because of the 
inherent complexities. 
As the foundation of the evidence we obtained regarding 
the revenue recognised during the year, we evaluated the 
relevant IT systems and tested the internal controls over the 
completeness, accuracy and timing of revenue recognised in 
the financial statements. We also tested journal entries posted 
to revenue accounts to identify unusual or irregular items. 
We tested the timing of revenue recognition, taking into 
account contractual obligations, and in particular considered 
whether the Group appropriately recorded revenue. We also 
tested the reconciliations between the revenue systems used 
by the Group and its financial ledgers.
Risk of management override of internal controls 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this. 
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, 
including the arrangements for staff to “whistle-blow” 
inappropriate actions, and interviewed senior management 
and the Group’s internal audit function. We examined the 
significant accounting estimates and judgements relevant to 
the financial statements for evidence of bias by the directors 
that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to 
fraud. We also tested journal entries and transactions which 
we identified as being unusual. 
The Audit Committee’s consideration of the judgments referred to above is set out on pages 32 to 34.

Going Concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 55, in relation to going concern. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group’s and Parent 
Company’s financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the 
Group and Parent Company have adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend them to do so, 
for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the 
directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Opinions on matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
  the part of the Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received

SPORTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 66
General information
Sportech PLC (the “Company”) is a company domiciled and incorporated in the UK and listed on the London Stock 
Exchange. The Company’s registered office is Collins House, Rutland Square, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland EH1 2AA. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2013 comprise the 
Company, its subsidiaries and joint ventures (together referred to as the “Group”). The principal activities of the Group 
are sports betting entertainment and provision of wagering technology solutions.
Going concern
The Group has committed revolving credit banking facilities totalling £75m in place with Bank of Scotland plc, 
Barclays Bank PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland plc until August 2015. The Group’s forecasts and projections, which have 
been prepared for the period to 30 June 2015 and taking into account reasonably possible changes in performance, show 
that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its current facilities and comply with its banking covenants. 
After making reasonable enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
and International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations as adopted by the European 
Union (“IFRSs as adopted by the European Union”) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRSs. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, 
as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair 
value through profit or loss.
Comparatives have been restated to exclude the results of discontinued operations and also for the revision of the estimated 
contingent consideration payable for eBet Online Inc. and the resultant decrease in goodwill recognised.
The Group’s accounting policies have been set by management, approved by the Audit Committee and consistently 
applied. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts 
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best 
knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. 
(a) Critical judgements
Critical judgements have been made in the following areas:
Carrying value of goodwill and acquired intangible fixed assets
For the purposes of determining whether an impairment of goodwill and intangibles from the Littlewoods, Vernons 
and eBet Online Inc. acquisitions has occurred, and the extent of any impairment or its reversal, the key assumptions the 
Group uses in estimating future cash flows for value-in-use measures are spend per player, impact of the introduction of 
new distribution routes and extra pool games, revenue from customer contracts, and cost reductions from ongoing cost 
reviews. These assumptions and the judgements of management that are based on them are subject to change as new 
information becomes available. Changes in economic conditions and government policy can also affect the rate used to 
discount future cash flow estimates. The discount rate applied is reviewed annually. Changes in assumptions could affect 
the carrying amounts of assets and impairment charges and reversals will affect income. Further details are disclosed 
within notes 11 and 12.
Value of other intangible fixed assets
Intangible assets recognised on the Group’s balance sheet include software assets and licences. Management is required 
to assess the carrying value of assets with an indefinite life at least annually and other assets when an indication of 
impairment arises. The key assumptions used in estimating the future cash flows for value-in-use measures include 
estimating capital expenditure and projected revenue levels. For fair value measures, external market information of resale 
valuations is used to estimate recoverable amount. Management uses its judgement and industry knowledge as well as 
external indicators in the assessments of carrying value of intangible fixed assets. Changes in assumptions could affect 
the carrying amounts of assets. Further details are disclosed within note 12.
F air value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on acquisition of subsidiaries
The Group is required to recognise assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value at the date of acquisition under 
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (revised). Management takes into account where required independent valuation of 
assets or where market valuations are not available, the future discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the 
assets acquired. Where further information arises in the twelve months post acquisition, relevant to the fair value of assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed, those valuations are revised and restated in the prior year comparative amounts.
During the year, the Group acquired Datatote (England) Limited (“Data Tote”); further details of the fair value of assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed, together with the judgements made, are disclosed within note 16.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 SPORTECH PLC 67
Basis of accounting continued
(a) Critical judgements continued
Share options
The fair value of employee options awarded under the Sportech Share Option Scheme is calculated using the Black-Scholes 
model. The fair value of employee PSP awards is valued using a stochastic (Monte Carlo) valuation model. In accordance 
with IFRS 2, the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options/awards. At each 
balance sheet date, management uses its judgement to revise its estimates of the number of options that are expected 
to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates in the income statement, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.
Taxation
Tax provisions are recognised when it is considered probable (more likely than not) that there will be a future outflow 
of funds to a taxing authority. In such cases, provision is made for the amount that is expected to be settled, where this 
can be reasonably estimated. This requires the application of judgement as to the ultimate outcome, which can change 
over time depending on facts and circumstances. A change in estimate of the likelihood of a future outflow and/or in 
the expected amount to be settled would be recognised in income in the period in which the change occurs. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable. This involves 
an assessment of when those deferred tax assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will 
be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the tax assets when they do reverse. This requires assumptions regarding 
future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain. To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, 
there can be an increase or decrease in the amounts recognised in respect of deferred tax assets as well as the amounts 
recognised in income in the period in which the change occurs. Tax provisions are based on enacted or substantively 
enacted laws. Changes in those laws could affect amounts recognised in income both in the period of change, which 
would include any impact on cumulative provisions, and in future periods. Note 20 contains information on tax charges, 
on the deferred tax assets that are recognised, including periodic movements, and on the losses on which deferred tax 
is not currently recognised.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out on pages 66 to 74. These policies have been 
applied consistently to all the years presented.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with a 
share of the results, assets and liabilities of its joint ventures using the equity method of accounting, all of which have 
consistent reporting dates with the Company. The Company’s accounting reference date is 31 December. Consistent with the 
normal monthly reporting process, the actual date to which the balance sheet has been drawn up is to 5 January 2014 
(2012: 30 December 2012). For ease of reference in these financial statements, all references to the results for the year 
are for the year ended 31 December 2013 (2012: 31 December 2012) and the financial position at 31 December 2013 
(2012: 31 December 2012).
(c) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one-half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from 
the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The consideration 
transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability 
resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Contingent consideration is recognised at fair value at the acquisition 
date and re-measured at each balance sheet date until settlement. The revaluation amount is debited/credited to the income 
statement in the period in which the estimated fair value is increased/decreased. Acquisition related costs are expensed as 
incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net 
assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies 
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.  FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
SPORTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 68
Basis of accounting continued
(d) Joint ventures
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long term basis and which is jointly controlled 
by the Group and one or more venturers under a contractual agreement. The Group’s share of its joint ventures’ post 
acquisition profits and losses is recognised in the income statement and its share of post acquisition movements in other 
comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post acquisition movements are 
adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or 
exceeds its interest in the joint venture, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further 
losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s 
interest in the joint venture. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an 
impairment of the asset transferred. The accounting policies of the joint venture have been changed where necessary 
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
(e) Revenue
Revenue from external customers, net of VAT, excise duties, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales 
within the Group, represents:
  the value of entry fees, net of winnings paid, receivable in respect of Football Pools recognised on the date of the event;
  e-Gaming revenues, being the net amount receivable from various contracted third parties after certain deductions 
for outsourced e-Gaming activities and gains and losses from wagering activity in the period where the Group is the 'bet 
taker' and gaming licence holder. As well as gains and losses from positions that have closed, revenue from online poker 
reflects the net income (“rake”) earned from poker games and various poker tournament fees completed by the period end;
  the value of bets, net of winnings paid, received in relation to fixed-odds betting activities recognised on the date 
of the event; 
  the value of goods and services sold to external customers, including management fees to registered charities for 
the management of charity lotteries, is recognised when the goods and services are consumed;
  sale of terminals and systems, recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred, 
which is when title passes to the customer, generally being at the point of customer acceptance; and
  the value of services delivered under service contracts generally based on either a percentage of amounts wagered 
or on a predetermined fixed amount depending on contract terms.
Although the value of entry fees net of winnings paid and the value of bets net of winnings paid is reported as revenue, 
both meet the definition of a gain under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. Under multiple 
element arrangements, revenue is allocated to the various elements based on fair value determined by the price charged 
when the same element is sold separately.
(f) Accruals and deferred income
Accruals and deferred income includes the value of stakes placed prior to the end of the financial period in respect 
of competitions and sporting events held subsequent to the end of the financial period and income received in advance 
of a service or product being delivered.
(g) Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance 
of the operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Committee, which makes strategic and operational decisions.
The Group has identified its business segments as outlined below:
  Football Pools – Football Pools and associated games through traditional channels such as mail, telephone, agent-based 
collection, retail outlets, third-party licensed betting offices, and through online and digital channels;
  Sportech Racing and Digital – provision of pari-mutuel wagering services and systems worldwide principally to the 
horseracing industry; 
  Sportech Venues – off-track betting venue management; and
  corporate costs – central costs relating to the Company in its capacity as the PLC holding company of the Group.

(h) Taxation
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management 
periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject 
to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the 
tax authorities.
T ax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income 
tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax 
is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and 
are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority, on either the same or different taxable entities, where there is an intention to settle the balances 
on a net basis.
(i) Foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements are 
presented in Sterling (£), which is the Company’s functional currency and the Group’s presentation currency.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses, resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised 
in the income statement, except where deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the income 
statement within finance income or costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income 
statement within operating profit.
Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) 
that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a 
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income 
and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
  all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.  FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
SPORTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 70
Basis of accounting continued
(j) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment. Cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable in bringing the asset to its working condition 
for its intended use and any associated borrowing costs. Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until 
the asset is completed. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, 
as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and 
the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs 
and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised 
within administrative expenses in the income statement.
Assets in the course of construction are capitalised when first brought into use and depreciated from this date.
(k) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment down to residual 
value over their anticipated useful lives at the following annual rates:
Long leasehold and owned land   Not depreciated
Long leasehold and owned buildings  4.0%–5.0%
Short leasehold land and buildings   Over the period of the lease
Plant, equipment and other fixtures and fittings 10.0%–33.3%
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
(l) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the fair value of consideration given over the fair value of 
the separately identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs 
(4 January 2005) has been frozen at the previous UK GAAP net book value at the date of transition, subject to being 
tested for impairment annually at the year end date.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (“CGU”) for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made 
to the CGU that is expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
(m) Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets are held at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is charged on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible fixed asset.
Customer contracts and relationships
Intangible customer contracts and relationship assets relate to the acquisition of Vernons, eBet Online Inc. and Datatote 
(England) Limited. Customer contracts and relationships are capitalised in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ 
(revised) and on the basis of a value-in-use calculation using an income-based approach. Amortisation is calculated using 
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows:
  Vernons    five years from 1 July 2009
  eBet Online Inc.   four years from 19 December 2012
  Datatote (England) Limited four years from 27 September 2013

Software
Externally acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to 
use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives or contractual period if shorter (six to 
ten years). 
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products 
controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
  it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
  management intends to complete the software product;
  it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
  adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product 
are available; and
  the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee 
costs and an appropriate proportion of relevant overhead. Other development expenditure that does not meet these 
criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not 
recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Software development costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed 15 years.
Other intangibles
Other intangible assets include intangible assets acquired as part of the Vernons acquisition which include distribution 
agreement assets. These assets are amortised over their contractual period (five years). Also included within other 
intangibles are separately acquired licences recognised at historical cost. Licences acquired in a business combination are 
recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Licences that have a finite useful life are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate cost of licences over their estimated 
useful lives of 15 to 20 years. Licences with an infinite life (licences granted in perpetuity) are held at cost or fair value at 
acquisition date and tested annually for impairment.
During 2012, the Group acquired eBet Online Inc., giving rise to the recognition of licences, trade names and a non-compete 
agreement. The trade name fair value has been determined through a relief from royalty method and is amortised over two 
years from 19 December 2012. The non-compete agreement fair value was derived from a comparative income differential 
method and is amortised over the life of the agreement being three years.
(n) Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at historic cost less any impairment. Annual impairment reviews are performed.
(o) Impairment reviews
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite 
lives are subject to an annual review for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairments, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels at which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Any impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement in the year in which they occur. Any impairment loss recognised on goodwill is 
not reversed.
All other individual assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for 
indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist at each reporting date.
(p) Pension obligation
The Group operates various pension schemes. The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance 
companies or Trustee administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The Group has both defined 
benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed 
contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if 
the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and 
prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically, defined benefit 
plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more 
factors such as age, years of service and compensation.  FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
SPORTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 72
Basis of accounting continued
(p) Pension obligation continued
The asset or liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension plan is the fair value of plan 
assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation 
is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined 
benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or 
credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to privately administered pension insurance plans on a 
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have 
been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions 
are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
(q) Financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate and exchange rate movements. The 
Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Financial assets and liabilities are 
recognised on the Group’s balance sheet initially at fair value when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument. Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument in accordance with IAS 39 
‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative 
is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain 
derivatives as hedges of the variability of cash flows (cash flow hedge).
The Group documents, at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged 
items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is 
recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately 
in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect 
profit or loss (for example, when the forecast transaction that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast 
transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, the gains and losses previously 
deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any 
cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative 
gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
(r) Share-based payments
The fair value of employee options awarded under the Sportech Share Option Scheme is calculated using the Black-Scholes 
model. The fair value of employee PSP awards is valued using a stochastic (Monte Carlo) valuation model. In accordance 
with IFRS 2, the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options/awards. The total 
amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options/awards granted including any market 
performance conditions, which are those that are based on Sportech PLC’s share price, and excluding the impact of any 
service and non-market performance vesting conditions, being profitability and remaining an employee over a specified 
time period. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to 
vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.
The charge in relation to employees who provide services to subsidiary companies is recharged to those subsidiaries. 
Where the charge is not required to be settled in cash, the Company’s investment in that subsidiary is increased by the 
value of the charge and a corresponding increase in equity is recognised in the subsidiary.

(s) Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents represent cash in hand, operational cash held at 
trading venues and cash held in current accounts with banks, including overdrafts. Cash and cash equivalents shown on 
the balance sheet represent cash in hand, cash in vaults and cash held in current accounts; bank overdrafts are shown 
within current liabilities.
(t) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at 
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in 
the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as 
current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months 
after the balance sheet date. 
(u) Exceptional items
The Group defines exceptional items as those items which, by their nature or size, would distort the comparability of the 
Group’s results from year to year.
(v) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment being the difference between the assets’ carrying amounts and the 
present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Individually significant 
receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other objective evidence is received that a 
specific customer will default or delinquency in payment will arise. Any subsequent recovery of amounts written off is 
credited to the income statement.
(w) Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
(x) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the first in, first out method. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business.
(y) Provisions
Provisions for onerous contracts, onerous leases, restructuring costs, legal claims and dilapidations are recognised 
when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not 
recognised for future operating losses where the Group has no contractual obligation to deliver the service or product.
(z) Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to 
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
(aa) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the value of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds in the share premium account where the shares were issued at a 
premium or, where issued at par or where the issue costs exceed the premium on the issue, to retained earnings.
(ab) Discontinued operations
Cash flows and operations that relate to a major component of the business that has been sold or is classified as held for 
sale are shown separately from continuing operations. Finance income or costs are included in discontinued operations 
only in respect of financial assets or liabilities classified as held for sale or derecognised on sale.  FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS

Amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes 1 January 2013
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2011 Various 1 January 2013
Under IAS 19R the interest cost on the defined benefit obligation, and the expected rate of return on plan assets, has 
been replaced with a net interest charge that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability. 
In addition, administration expenses must be charged to the income statement.
The prior period income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2012 have 
not been restated, as the impacts to profit and other comprehensive income are not material to the Group.
The Group has adopted IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’. It establishes a single source of guidance for fair value 
measurements. The standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires disclosures 
about fair value measurements. In general, the disclosure requirements in IFRS 13 are more extensive than those required in 
the current standards. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the results or financial position of 
the Group; however, additional disclosures to reflect the requirements of the standard have been included in these financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2013.
(ad) New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not adopted by  
the Group

The Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted EBITDA 
which excludes the effects of non-recurring expenditure such as restructuring costs and impairments of assets. The share 
option expense is also excluded. Interest is not allocated to segments as the Group’s cash position is controlled by the 
central finance team. Sales between segments are at arm’s length.

Profit before taxation 5.2 1.3

– deferred tax not previously provided (0.1) —
– effect of changes in tax rates 0.2 0.2
– adjustments in respect of prior years — (0.1)
Total taxation charge 1.9 0.8
The weighted average applicable tax rate was 26.8% (2012: 36.5%). The decrease is as a result of a change in mix of profits 
in jurisdictions with varying tax rates.
For UK taxation, as the Group’s year end is after the substantive enactment date (2 July 2013) of the Finance Act 2013 and 
after the substantive enactment date of the March 2013 UK Budget Statement changes, these financial statements account 
for the change in UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013, the change in tax rate from 23% 
to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and the change in tax rate from 21% to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015 and therefore 
the rate at which deferred tax is calculated has changed. Deferred tax in the UK is provided at 21%, a blended rate of 21.5% 
or at 20%, depending on when the deferred tax is expected to unwind. 
9. Loss of holding company
Of the profit for the year, a loss of £10.9m (2012: £3.9m) is dealt with in the accounts of Sportech PLC and the statement 
of changes in equity. The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and have not presented an income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the Company alone.
The individual income statement of Sportech PLC was approved by the Board on 5 March 2014.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

Profit from continuing operations attributable to the owners of the Parent 3.3 0.5

Total 3.4 1.3
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (‘000) 200,227 198,810
b) Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 
to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Certain employee options (707,070 in number; 2012: 707,070) 
have been excluded from the calculated diluted EPS as their exercise price is greater than the weighted average share 
price during the year and therefore would not be dilutive. The weighted average number of shares that have a dilutive 
effect on adjusted EPS is 13,161,000 (2012: 13,742,000). Diluted basic EPS is 1.6p (2012: 0.6p) and diluted adjusted EPS 
is 4.9p (2012: 5.0p).
c) Basic adjusted 
The calculations of adjusted EPS are based on the following profits attributable to ordinary shareholders, the weighted 
average number of shares and an estimated adjusted tax charge of 27.7% (2012: 28.2%):

The goodwill brought forward in the accounts relates to the acquisition of Littlewoods Leisure, including the Littlewoods 
Football Pools business, in September 2000 amounting to £145.2m, the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Vernons 
Football Pools in December 2007 amounting to £20.3m, and the goodwill arising on the acquisition of eBet Online Inc. 
Goodwill has been restated by £0.3m as a result of changes to fair value assumptions as detailed within note 16. During 
the year the Group carried out its annual impairment review of the carrying value of its goodwill. The goodwill from the 
Littlewoods Leisure and Vernons acquisitions is attributed to the Football Pools segment. The goodwill from the eBet 
Online Inc. acquisition is attributed to the Sportech Racing and Digital segment.  FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
SPORTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 82
11. Goodwill continued
For the purpose of the annual impairment review of the Football Pools goodwill, the recoverable amounts are measured based 
on value in use, calculated using discounted future cash flows. The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations were:
  the cash flow forecasts used are based upon the budget approved by the Board for 2014 and on cash flow projections 
for 2015 to 2018 also approved by the Board, with a terminal value at 2018 calculated in accordance with IAS 36;
  revenue forecasts for the core Football Pools business reflect the improvement in spend per player from core customer 
numbers within the last four years, the introduction of new customers and acquisition activities and additional 
distribution routes, the improvement in technology following the continued investment through 2013, additional 
investment in the Football Pools online presence and the increase to 104 pool games, the impact all of which the Board 
believes will lead to a stabilisation of revenues within the core Football Pools business;
  the terminal value is based on a nil growth rate given the expected stabilisation of profit streams;
  cash flows have been discounted at 8.3% (2012: 8.3%), reflecting the weighted average cost of capital for the Group; and
  there are no material adverse changes in legislation.
For the purpose of the annual impairment review of the eBet Online Inc. goodwill, the recoverable amounts are measured based 
on value in use, calculated using discounted future cash flows. The key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations were:
  the cash flow forecasts used are based upon the budget approved by the Board for 2014 and on cash flow projections 
for 2015 to 2018 also approved by the Board, with a terminal value at 2018 calculated in accordance with IAS 36;
  the terminal value is based on a nil growth rate given the expected maturity of the business by 2018;
  cash flows have been discounted at 8.3% (2012: 8.3%), reflecting the weighted average cost of capital for the Group; and
  there are no material adverse changes in legislation.
Following the impairment review an impairment of £nil was charged to the income statement (2012: £nil). Various 
sensitivity tests were performed on the calculation of value in use. These indicated that changes to the revenue forecasts 
generated the greatest sensitivity and in certain scenarios an impairment may arise. The Football Pools goodwill impairment 
test cash flows are taken from the Group's strategic plans and rely on the objectives being achieved. If these do not come 
to fruition then an impairment may also arise. If the WACC were to increase to above 9.3% an impairment in The Football 
Pools goodwill would result. However, a reasonably possible combination of changes in assumptions did not result in an 
impairment for either The Football Pools or eBet Online Inc. goodwill.

Software
Included in software are assets under construction with a cost of £1.0m (2012: £1.9m). Accordingly, these assets are not 
currently amortised.
Other intangibles
The Group holds a licence in perpetuity to offer pari-mutuel off-track betting in the state of Connecticut in the USA. Given 
this licence is in perpetuity, the book value of the asset amounting to £15.2m (2012: £15.5m) is not amortised and the useful 
economic life allocated to the asset is indefinite. The movement in net book value is as a result of movement in exchange 
rates given the asset is denominated in US Dollars. As required by IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ an impairment test has 
been carried out as at 31 December 2013. 
The recoverable amount of the asset has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation and is allocated to the 
Sportech Racing CGU. The calculation used post tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts 
approved by management covering a five-year period. The following assumptions were made in determining the 
recoverable amount:
  the CGU was determined to be the assets which require the licence in order to provide off-track betting to the public. 
Only the cash flows expected to be generated from these assets were included in the calculation;
  EBITDA forecasts are in line with the approved 2014 budget and 2015 to 2018 strategic plans;
  capital expenditure was included in the cash flows at management’s best estimate of industry norm for re-investment 
in retail outlets of the kind under review;
  cash flows beyond the fifth year were extrapolated using a nil growth rate given the expected stabilisation of cash flows 
over time; and
  a post tax discount rate of 8.3% was used representing the weighted average cost of capital of the Group. The CGU 
operates in a highly regulated market, equivalent to the majority of the Group’s activities and therefore the use of the 
Group’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) in the value-in-use calculation is considered to be appropriate.
The impairment test showed significant headroom over the book value of the asset and various sensitivity tests were 
performed showing that no reasonably possible change to a key assumption would cause the CGU’s carrying amount 
to exceed the recoverable amount.

* Ownership is directly held by the Company, Sportech PLC.
All of these companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements. A full list of Group subsidiaries can 
be found in the Company’s annual return available from Companies House.
The Directors believe that the carrying value of investments is supported by their underlying net assets. An impairment 
test has been carried out in relation to the investment held by Sportech PLC in Sportech Gaming Limited (carrying value 
of £167.1m) which specifically related to the onward investment in The Football Pools Limited, following an indication of 
a potential impairment. The recoverable amount was determined based on value-in-use calculations. The calculations used 
post tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period. Cash flows 
beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of nil%. The headroom in the impairment 
calculation is tight. Relatively small changes in the discount rate or cash flows would lead to an impairment. While the 
Directors are confident that there is no impairment, they continue to monitor the position closely.  FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS

16. Business combinations
a) Datatote (England) Limited
On 27 September 2013, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Datatote (England) Limited ("Data Tote"), 
a leading UK betting operator and technology and services provider focused on the European greyhound and horseracing 
betting market. 
The acquisition of Data Tote further reinforces Sportech's position as one of the largest operators and providers of betting 
technologies and services in the world. Data Tote brings an incremental customer base with strong year-on-year revenue 
growth that will broaden Sportech's share of the European betting market.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition amounted to £nil.
The following table summarises the fair value of consideration paid for Data Tote and the amounts of the assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed recognised at acquisition date.

Deferred contingent consideration
There is potential for contingent consideration of up to £1.0m to be payable if the Data Tote business’ EBITDA for the 
period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2016 reaches the following:
  less than £2.0m – the contingent consideration payable will equal £nil; and
  equal or greater than £2.0m – the contingent consideration payable will equal £0.5m plus £1.00 for every £1.00 that the 
Data Tote business exceeds £2.0m by, up to a maximum amount payable of £1.0m.
The amount payable is due five business days after the date on which the calculation of the earn out EBITDA becomes 
final and binding. 
The Directors have reviewed the potential consideration payable based on the above performance requirements and 
accordingly recognised a fair value of £0.1m, representing the present value of the Group’s estimate of the probability 
weighted cash outflow (discounted at 8.3%). An additional £0.9m of potential consideration payable has been treated as 
employment costs under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (revised) and will accordingly be accrued on a time apportioned 
basis to 30 June 2016. This expectation will be reviewed annually in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ (revised).
Acquisition costs
Acquisition related costs amounting to £0.2m have been recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement 
as an exceptional item.
Provisional fair value amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
The fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are considered provisional in nature due to the 
business combination occurring close to the year end. Management will continue to monitor the provisional values during 
the year ended 31 December 2014 to ensure any fair value amendments are identified as a hindsight adjustment.
The fair value of trade and other receivables is £0.6m. The gross contractual amount for trade receivables due is £0.6m, 
of which £nil is expected to be uncollectable. 
No contingent liabilities have been recognised as at the acquisition date.  FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS

a) Datatote (England) Limited continued
Data Tote contribution to the Group results
Data Tote has contributed £0.3m and £nil to the Group’s revenues and profit, respectively, from the acquisition date to 
31 December 2013. Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2013, the Group’s revenue for the period ended 31 December 2013 
would have been £112.5m and the Group’s profit for the year would have been £3.7m. These amounts have been determined by 
applying the Group’s accounting policies and adjusting the results of Data T ote to reflect additional depreciation and amortisation 
that would have been charged, assuming the fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets had 
been applied from 1 January 2013, together with their consequential tax effects.
b) eBet Online Inc.
On 19 December 2012, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of eBet Online Inc. ("eBet"). There were no 
changes to the fair value assumptions applied by management at acquisition during the hindsight period in relation to net 
assets acquired and consideration paid other than in relation to the contingent deferred consideration expected to be paid 
in early 2016. EBITDA estimates for the combined Interactive Products and Services business have been revised down and 
as a result the estimate of deferred contingent consideration expected to be paid have been revised down from £0.8m 
($1.3m) to £0.5m ($0.9m). Given the reassessment was within the hindsight period, the prior year accounting for the 
acquisition has been restated as follows:

c) Sportech Racing
On 5 October 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of the racing businesses and venues management 
business of Scientific Games Corporation Inc.
The performance period for the contingent consideration targets ended on 31 December 2013 and it has been confirmed 
that no contingent consideration is payable due to failure to meet minimum EBITDA targets. No liability was recognised 
in the consolidated financial statements in relation to this potential liability and as a result there has been no effect on the 
2013 income statement.

The losses in the Company have been fully surrendered as Group relief. In addition to the deferred tax asset which has 
been recognised, the Group has not recognised further deferred tax assets of £3.1m (2012: £2.8m) arising from unutilised 
trading losses. The Directors do not consider there will be sufficient future profits against which these losses can be offset

Bank loans and revolving credit facility
On 18 July 2012, the Group entered a senior facility agreement which made available a multi-currency, revolving credit 
facility of £75.0m including up to £5.0m of ancillary facilities bearing interest of LIBOR plus a bank margin dependent on 
leverage levels, initially 3.5% to 31 December 2012. The borrowings are secured by a composite debenture incorporating 
fixed and floating charges over all assets (excluding monies standing to credit of trust accounts) and undertakings 
of Sportech PLC, all UK trading companies, UK holding companies of overseas entities, Sportech Mauritius Limited 
and Racing Technology Ireland Limited. In addition, share charges have been entered into in respect of shares in 
Racing Technology Ireland Limited, Sportech Racing BV (a Netherlands company), Sportech Inc., Sportech Venues Inc., 
Sportech Venues CA Holdco LLC, Sportech Venues California LLC, Sportech Games Holdco LLC, Sportech Racing LLC, 
Trackplay LLC (all seven are US companies) and Sportech Mauritius Limited. Furthermore, a Guernsey law security 
interest agreement has been entered into by Sportech Alderney Limited.
During the year ended 31 December 2013, the Group obtained proceeds from borrowings of £6.0m. 
Covenants on the Group’s borrowings include a leverage covenant (being the ratio of EBITDA to net bank debt) and an interest 
cover covenant (being the ratio of EBITDA to senior finance charges). None of the covenants were breached during the period.
Deferred and deferred contingent consideration
Deferred consideration of £6.5m in relation to the acquisition of Sportech Racing in October 2010 was paid on 
30 September 2013. Interest was charged at the average daily Bank of England base rate plus 1% for the period 
5 October 2010 (inclusive) to 30 September 2013 (inclusive).
Deferred and deferred contingent consideration of £1.8m and £1.0m in relation to the acquisitions of eBet Online Inc. 
and Datatote (England) Limited respectively is payable or potentially payable as outlined in note 16.
25. Financial instruments 
Financial risk management policies and objectives
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: fair value and cash flow interest rate risk; liquidity risk; 
credit risk; and foreign exchange risk. Where appropriate the Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge 
certain risk exposures.
The policy for each of the above risks is described in more detail below:
F air value and cash flow interest rate risk
As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, the Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially 
independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from its long term bank borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable interest rates expose the 
Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group’s 
bank borrowings are a multi-currency, revolving credit facility with Bank of Scotland plc, Barclays Bank PLC and Royal Bank of 
Scotland plc until August 2015 and at variable interest rates (a debt margin payable of between 250 and 375 basis points per 
annum) dependent on leverage ratio. The Group’s policy is to hedge interest rate risk where appropriate using interest rate swaps 
at contract lengths consistent with the expected levels of the long term bank borrowings. This policy is a cash flow hedge and is 
approved by the Board and the Board receives updates on a regular basis in respect of the hedging position. 
The Group has entered into a number of swap agreements with terms remaining of between one month and two years, on 
a total of £30.0m, at an average swap rate before any lending margin of 4.80%. The hedges comprise three £10.0m hedges 
with expiry dates ranging from 2014 to 2016. The contracts are not designated effective hedges and, as a result, gains 
and losses are recognised in the income statement within finance costs. 
As at 31 December 2013 the fair value of these interest rate swaps was a liability of £1.3m (2012: £2.6m). 
At 31 December 2013, if interest rates on borrowings had been 50 basis points higher/lower with all variables held constant, post 
tax profit for the year would have been £0.2m (2012: £0.1m) higher/lower as a result of higher/lower interest expense on unhedged 
variable rate borrowings. This sensitivity is considered a reasonable assumption based on current economic conditions.
Liquidity risk
Cash flow forecasting is performed on a regular basis in the operating entities of the Group and is aggregated by Group 
Finance. Group Finance monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure each operating entity 
has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing 
facilities at all times so that the Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants on any of its borrowing facilities. 
The Group’s borrowing facilities are with Bank of Scotland plc, Barclays Bank PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland plc. Group 
Finance monitors the level of excess cash over and above that required for working capital management and ensures the 
excess is loaned to the UK to minimise the facility required to be drawn. Bank facilities have been agreed at appropriate 
levels having regard to the Group’s operating cash flows and future development plans.   FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
SPORTECH PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2013 96
25. Financial instruments continued
Financial risk management policies and objectives continued
Credit risk
The Group’s UK operation has limited exposure to credit risk. Transactions within the Football Pools segment are 
predominantly either weekly cash receipts in advance or multiple weeks in advance by credit card, debit card or direct 
debit. Credit exposure is limited to overseas collection agencies on short credit terms, managed centrally by the UK 
finance function. The Group’s main exposure to credit risk is in accounts receivable in the Sportech Racing and Digital 
segment. Credit risk in these entities is managed locally by assessing the creditworthiness of each new customer before 
agreeing payment and delivery terms. The Group does not hold significant amounts of deposits with banks and financial 
institutions. Amounts held in cash for the Sportech Venue division are held in highly secure environments.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, 
primarily with respect to the Euro and US Dollar. Foreign exchange risk arises from transactions undertaken in foreign 
currencies, the translation of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities and from the translation into Sterling of 
the results and net assets of overseas operations.
The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risk and takes steps, where practical, to ensure that the net exposure 
is kept to an acceptable level, inter alia, by using foreign exchange forward contracts designed to fix the economic impact 
of forecasted profitability. At 31 December 2013, the notional principal amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts 
outstanding were $2.0m (2012: $10.5m). The contracts are not designated effective hedges and, as a result, gains and 
losses are recognised in the income statement within finance costs. At 31 December 2013, the fair value of these forward 
contracts was £nil (2012: £0.1m). No charge or credit has thus been recognised in profit and loss arising from fair value 
movement (2012: debit from fair value movement of £0.1m).
The average rate of the US Dollar during the year was 1.56 and the Euro was 1.18; if the USD had averaged at 1.65 and the 
Euro at 1.25, profit after tax would have been £3.2m and net assets would have been £139.7m at 31 December 2013.

(that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and
  level 3 – inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) 
is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data 
where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value 
an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based 
on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on 
observable yield curves. Note that all of the resulting fair value estimates are included in level 2.

Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order 
to provide returns for shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to achieve an efficient capital structure to minimise 
the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. 
Net debt is calculated as total financial liabilities (including current and non-current), as shown in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
plus net debt.
The Group’s strategy has been to target a reasonable level of gearing for a group of Sportech's size and industry presence. 
The Board considers gearing of between 20% and 40% to be appropriate. During 2013, net debt (including deferred 
consideration) was increased by £0.1m (0.2%) (2012: reduced by £0.4m (0.6%)). Gearing has remained static principally 
due to the cash generated by the Group from operations during the year offset by cash used to purchase tangible and 
intangible assets and to acquire Data Tote. The total net debt and gearing ratios at 31 December 2013 and 2012 were 
as follows:

to £1.064 (2012: £0.817 to £1.064) under Sportech share option schemes approved by the shareholders. Share options at 
the end of the period had a weighted average exercise price of £0.888 (2012: £0.888). The number of shares subject to 
options, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in which they may be exercised are given below. There

Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of the 
grant. Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. No performance conditions are included in the 
fair value calculation. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:
2005 2006
Risk-free interest rate 4.18% 4.40%
Vesting period 3 years 3 years
Option life 10 years 10 years
Expected life of options 5 years 5 years
Expected share price volatility 66.29% 48.61%
Dividend growth — —
Fair value of option £0.556 £0.601
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years. The expected life is the average expected 
period to exercise. The risk-free rate is based on Bank of England bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life. 
Dividend growth is based on historical dividends over the last three years.
The Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
Certain Executive Directors and Senior Executives have been awarded grants to acquire shares in the Company under 
the PSP, subject to performance conditions. During the year ended 31 December 2013, 2,406,000 shares have been awarded 
(2012: 4,123,000), 1,649,000 awards lapsed due to failure to meet the performance conditions (2012: nil), 674,000 awards 
lapsed due to employees ceasing to be employed by the Group (2012: 1,662,000) and no awards were cancelled during the 
year (2012: nil). 6,041,000 shares vested during the period of which 4,072,000 remain unexercised as at 31 December 2013. 
8,608,000 (2012: 13,563,000) share awards remained outstanding (unvested) at 31 December 2013.
Performance conditions
The Remuneration Committee can set different performance conditions from those described below for future awards 
provided that, in the reasonable opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the new targets are not materially less 
challenging in the circumstances than those described below. The Remuneration Committee determines the comparator 
group for each award.
The Remuneration Committee may also vary the performance conditions applying to existing awards if an event has 
occurred that causes the Remuneration Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance 
conditions, provided that the Remuneration Committee considers the varied conditions are fair and reasonable and not 
materially less challenging than the original conditions would have been but for the event in question.
The awards are at nil cost to the employee. Awards will normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant subject 
to the participants’ continued employment within the Group and the satisfaction of the performance conditions noted below.
2013 grants
The vesting of one-half of the award (“Part A”) will be dependent on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) over 
a fixed three-year period beginning on the date of grant relative to that of the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding investment 
trusts). For the purpose of calculating TSR, the base figure is averaged over the six weeks preceding the start of the 
performance period and the end figure is averaged over the last six weeks of the performance period.
No portion of Part A will vest unless the Company’s TSR performance at least matches that of the index. Thereafter, a 
vesting schedule no less demanding than the following will apply:
The Company’s TSR performance over the performance period relative to comparator index Extent of vesting of Part A
Equal to the index 25%
Between equal to the index and upper quartile Pro rata between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile or better 100%

The vesting of the second half of the award is dependent on an EPS performance criterion (“Part B”); the average annual 
percentage growth in the Company’s EPS in excess of the UK Retail Prices Index (“RPI”) over the EPS performance period 
must at least equal 4%. Vesting is determined by the following schedule:
The Company’s average annual growth in EPS in excess of RPI during the performance period Extent of vesting of Part B

The vesting of one-third of the award (“Part A”) will be dependent on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) over 
a fixed three-year period beginning on the date of grant relative to that of the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding investment 
trusts). For the purpose of calculating TSR, the base figure is averaged over the six weeks preceding the start of the 
performance period and the end figure is averaged over the last six weeks of the performance period.
No portion of Part A will vest unless the Company’s TSR performance at least matches that of the index. Thereafter, 
a vesting schedule no less demanding than the following will apply:
The Company’s TSR performance over the performance period relative to comparator index Extent of vesting of Part A
Equal to the index 25%
Between equal to the index and upper quartile Pro rata between 25% and 100%
Upper quartile or better 100%
The vesting of the second one-third of the award (“Part B”) will be dependent on the Company’s absolute TSR over the 
same performance period as for Part A; the TSR calculation is the same as that for Part A with the exception that the final 
figure for the purpose of calculating TSR is the highest six-week average over the final year of the performance period. 
Vesting is determined by the following schedule:
The Company’s compound annual TSR during the performance period Extent of vesting of Part B
At least 6% 25%
Between 6% and 15% Pro rata between 25% and 100%
15% or better 100%
The vesting of the final third of the award is dependent on an EPS performance criterion (“Part C”); the average annual 
percentage growth in the Company’s EPS in excess of the UK Retail Prices Index (“RPI”) over the EPS performance period 
must at least equal 4%. Vesting is determined by the following schedule:
The Company’s average annual growth in EPS in excess of RPI during the performance period Extent of vesting of Part C

The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding awards under the PSP at 31 December 2013 was one year 
and five months (2012: one year and four months). The weighted average exercise price of awards granted during the 
period was £nil (2012: £nil). 
PSP awards are not affected by the risk-free rate input since no payment is required by the recipient and therefore no 
interest could be earned elsewhere.
The expected volatility is based on movements in the historical return index (share price with dividends re-invested) for 
the three years prior to the award date. The dividend yield does not affect the fair value of the award as the rules of the 
PSP entitle a participant to receive cash equal in value to the dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares 
in respect of dividends paid during the vesting period and is therefore assumed to be 0%.
See note 6 and note 7 for the total expense recognised in the income statement for share options granted and PSP awards 
made to Directors and employees respectively.

Contingent assets
The Board has previously announced that the Group had submitted a claim for in excess of £40.0m to HMRC for the repayment 
of VAT overpaid in respect of the “Spot the Ball” game from 1979 to 1996. Interest may also be added to the principal sum 
claimed, which, if successful, given the timeframe of the claim, could increase the sum claimed to approximately £95.0m. The 
Group was informed on 7 March 2013 that the First-tier Tax Tribunal had found in favour of the Group. HMRC has been given 
leave to appeal and the case will be heard at the Upper Tribunal on 29 and 30 April 2014. Accordingly, the claim has not been 
recognised in the Group’s financial statements.
Contingent liabilities
The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of legal claims in the ordinary course of business; it is not considered that 
any material liabilities will arise from these.
In respect of the acquisition of eBet Online Inc. on 19 December 2012, additional consideration is payable under certain 
circumstances as outlined in note 16.
In addition, additional consideration is payable under certain circumstances as outlined in note 16 in respect of the

30. Other financial commitments
In December 1996, an incentive scheme to reward Football Pools collectors was established by a subsidiary company. 
Under the terms of the scheme, the collectors earn points on the basis of their sales. These points can be converted into 
vouchers to purchase items from high street shops. On the basis of similar schemes, a redemption rate attributable to 
these points has been established and an appropriate charge made in these accounts. The potential liability in respect 
of these points not provided for in these financial statements is £0.4m (2012: £0.4m). This liability has not been provided 
for as it is the judgement of management that it will never crystallise.
The Group was required to enter into a performance guarantee bond in October 2010, which is reviewed annually, for 15% 
of the contract value, being $190,000 at 31 December 2013, in relation to a contract to provide and maintain pari-mutuel 
betting terminals to a customer in Turkey.

amount outstanding for interest receivable on inter-company loan balances was £0.2m (2012: £2.0m). All inter-company 
transactions are on an arm's length basis. 
c.  The Company had no transactions with the joint ventures during the year (2012: no transactions). The Group invested £0.2m 
cash into its Indian joint venture and contributed £nil to capital expenditure (2012: invested £0.3m and contributed £0.1m).
d.  Scientific Games Corporation (“SGC”) was a 19.99% shareholder in Sportech PLC throughout the period and until the 
disposal of 100% of its holding on 9 January 2014. SGC is therefore considered to be a related party for the whole of the 
period and as at 31 December 2013. Lorne Weil, Non-executive Director and shareholder (see Directors’ Report on pages 
54 to 56), was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SGC until his resignation in December 2013.

e.  Playtech Limited was a 10% shareholder in Sportech PLC until the disposal of 100% of its holding in June 2013. Roger Withers, 
Chairman, was also Chairman of Playtech Limited and Mor Weizer, former Non-executive Director until his resignation 
in June 2013, is Chief Executive of Playtech Limited (see Directors’ Report on pages 54 to 56). Playtech Limited is therefore

Those employees who joined the Group consequent to the acquisition of Littlewoods Gaming (formerly Littlewoods Leisure) 
and who were aged under 50 on 4 September 2000 and all other UK employees of Sportech can join either a stakeholder 
pension scheme established on 6 April 2001 or alternate defined contribution arrangements. The contributions are made 
at a maximum rate of 8% of pensionable salaries.
A defined contribution scheme for non-unionised employees is operated in the USA, into which the Group contributes 
37.5% of the first 6% of participant contributions. A further defined contribution scheme is available for unionised employees; 
the Group does not make contributions into this scheme. The pension scheme in the Netherlands provides benefits 
to employees on a percentage of salary basis. The Group contributes 7.5% of salary less state pension allowance, which 
is currently €12,000 (2012: €12,000) per annum, into a defined contribution scheme for employees in Ireland.
Defined benefit schemes
Pursuant to the sale agreement between Littlewoods plc and Sportech PLC, a defined benefit scheme was set up for those 
employees who joined the Group consequent to the acquisition of Littlewoods Gaming (formerly Littlewoods Leisure) and 
who were aged 50 or over on 4 September 2000, the date of the acquisition. The scheme was formed on 6 April 2001 
and is governed by a Definitive Trust Deed and Rules. It is a Registered Pension Scheme under Chapter 2 of Part 4 of the 
Finance Act 2004. The scheme is contracted out of the State Second Pension Scheme. The scheme is currently not open 
to new members.
The US defined benefit scheme is administered by an insurance company in the USA and provides retirement benefits to 
employees who are members of a collective bargaining unit represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers. Benefits are based on value times credited service.

For the UK, under the adopted mortality tables, if the future life expectancy were to be plus/minus one year the liabilities 
would increase/decrease by £60,000.
For the USA scheme, under the adopted mortality tables, if the future life expectancy were to be plus/minus one year the 
liabilities would increase/decrease by £6,000.
For the UK, if the discount rate were +4.65% the liabilities would decrease by £70,000. For the US, if the discount rate were 
5% the liabilities would decrease by £154,000.

The assets of the UK scheme are held in an independent Trustee administered fund. The Trustee of the scheme is Sportech 
Trustees Limited. The Directors of Sportech Trustees Limited include Carl Lynn, a Sportech employee, who also acts 
as Chair of the Trustee company. The assets of the US scheme are held by an insurance company.
The actuarial method for calculating the liabilities of the scheme is the projected unit method.
The expected employer annual contributions to the schemes for the financial year ending 31 December 2014 amounted 
to £0.4m (year ended 31 December 2013: £0.2m).

The UK Company is required to agree a schedule of contributions with the Trustee of the Scheme following an actuarial 
valuation which must be carried out at least once every three years. A valuation of the Scheme is currently in progress with 
an effective date of 31 December 2012, but is yet to be completed. This valuation must be finalised by 31 March 2014. Based 
on current discussions the Company expects to pay contributions of around £118,000 into the Scheme in the year ending 
31 December 2014, but this is subject to change. 
The weighted average duration of the UK Scheme obligation is approximately twelve years. Sportech PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2013

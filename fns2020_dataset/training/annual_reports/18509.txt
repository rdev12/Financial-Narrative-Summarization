03 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015  Chairman’s statement
FirstGroup is a very important company 
to the customers and communities we 
serve. Operating in ﬁve major divisions, 
each a leader in its market, we provide 
vital transport links for millions of passengers 
across our core markets in the UK and 
North America. We are a signiﬁcant 
corporate employer with around 110,000 
staff, and our services make a vital 
contribution to linking people together, 
supporting the economic activity and 
social well-being of the communities 
in which we operate.
Innovative, efﬁcient and customer-focused transport services play 
an increasingly important role in responding to the economic and 
environmental challenges of continued urbanisation, congestion 
and demographic change. FirstGroup’s portfolio of leading transport 
businesses is well positioned to provide the transport solutions 
needed, and as such has opportunities for sustainable growth and 
good ﬁnancial returns in all of its markets. All of this was clear to me 
when I took on the role of Chairman in January 2014, but it was also 
obvious that the Group had not been delivering fully on this potential 
for some time. Two divisions in particular, First Student and UK Bus, 
were delivering margins well short of their competitors, parts of the 
business had suffered from a lack of appropriate investment, and 
the Group as a whole was not achieving acceptable returns for 
shareholders. Turning this situation round has therefore been 
the key priority. 
The multi-year turnaround programme we are executing is designed 
to sustainably improve the ﬁnancial returns of the Group as a whole, 
mainly through more robust decision-making around pricing, 
productivity and capital allocation. These areas are of particular 
importance in First Student and UK Bus, which together account for 
around two thirds of our annual capital investment budget and have 
underperformed. With the support of shareholders through the 2013 
rights issue, the Group has been able to reinvest in its future growth 
and commit to ambitious business plans that will deliver sustainable 
improvements in performance over the medium term, by addressing 
the Group’s core challenges. With improved balance sheet stability, 
and a strong and experienced Board of Directors providing challenge 
and support, the executive team have the platform to make the 
disciplined, long term decisions necessary to improve the Group’s 
sustainable returns on capital and cash generation. Over time this 
will reduce Group leverage and the associated interest burden 
towards its optimum long term level, and increase shareholder 
returns. As a matter of course, we continue to review alternative 
and additional actions to create shareholder value, but nothing 
compelling has become evident to date. 
With a continued focus on 
execution and a commitment 
to change, I remain conﬁdent 
that the Group will succeed 
in turning its attractive portfolio 
of market-leading transport 
businesses into acceptable 
returns for shareholders 
as planned.
John McFarlane
Chairman
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 04 During the year the Group has made important progress in several 
key areas. In this respect, I would highlight in particular the success 
of First Student’s contract portfolio pricing strategy, as well as the 
ongoing execution of the UK Bus turnaround plan, which has 
successfully stimulated renewed passenger volume growth and is 
beginning to capture yield. Both of these key divisions have taken 
important strategic steps to reposition themselves in their markets 
for the medium term, while also executing signiﬁcant cost reduction 
programmes. Continued disciplined execution over the coming years 
will be required to deliver the full beneﬁts of these important changes, 
but we are encouraged by the margin improvements these divisions 
have delivered in the year. Although Greyhound’s performance this 
year has been signiﬁcantly affected by the sharp fall in fuel prices in 
the second half, we remain on track with its transformation into a 
yield-managed, customer-oriented business, which will enhance 
returns from this division in the future, whatever the oil price. 
In the year the Department for Transport (DfT) awarded us a contract 
to continue operating our largest rail franchise, First Great Western, to 
at least March 2019, and a contract to run First TransPennine Express 
for an additional year. We were disappointed not to secure the renewal 
of the First ScotRail franchise, and were unsuccessful in four other bids 
but these were awarded at economic levels that were unacceptable 
to us. We were and will remain disciplined in our approach to bidding 
for these signiﬁcant contracts. 
Overall, the Group is broadly where we expected to be at this stage 
of the transformation plan, and has begun to demonstrate the 
improvements in ﬁnancial performance that were clearly required. 
Underlying
1
 Group revenue increased by 4. 1%, but more importantly 
operating proﬁt
2
 increased by 13.3%, adjusted proﬁt before tax 
improved by 46.5%, and adjusted proﬁt attributable to ordinary 
shareholders increased by 48.2%. Adjusted EPS increased by 30.7%, 
less than attributable proﬁt because of the increased number of shares 
following the rights issue. Group ROCE was 7 .8%, or 8.5% at constant 
exchange rates, a 0.3 percentage point improvement compared with 
8.2% in 2013/14. Group cash ﬂow, though still signiﬁcantly below our 
potential, was better than our initial expectations, and we expect the 
actions we are taking will increase this substantially over time. In due 
course, the Board is conﬁdent that the business plans being executed 
will return the Group to a sustainable cash generative position, with the 
potential to resume payment of a dividend. However at this stage of the 
Group’s transformation, and having regard to the commitment to the 
capital investment programme and the importance of strengthening the 
balance sheet further, the Board considers it appropriate to continue 
to refrain from reinstating a dividend at this point. 
In some respects, the signiﬁcant improvements in ﬁnancial results 
this year are a reﬂection of past underperformance, and there remain 
a number of headwinds to navigate, but I am conﬁdent that we are 
executing the most appropriate actions to return the Group to a 
sustainably stronger long term position. We have made encouraging 
progress in the year, and some of the most important actions have 
yet to manifest themselves fully in the ﬁnancial results. The improving 
ﬁnancial results from First Student and UK Bus, our most capital 
intensive businesses, reinforce our conﬁdence in the future. With a 
continued focus on execution and a commitment to change, I remain 
conﬁdent that the Group will succeed in turning its attractive portfolio 
of market-leading transport businesses into acceptable returns for 
shareholders as planned. 
Of course all of this progress is only made possible by the continued 
commitment of our employees to delivering quality services for our 
customers and communities. On behalf of the Board I would like to 
extend my sincere gratitude to all our employees for their hard work 
and dedication.
Chris Surch will be retiring from the role of Group Finance Director on 
8 January 2016, following his decision to step down from a full-time 
executive role for personal reasons. The Board has commenced 
a formal search for his replacement. On behalf of the Board and 
everyone at FirstGroup I would like to thank Chris for his commitment 
to the transformation of the Group over the last three years. We respect 
his decision to step down and he will be leaving with our good wishes 
for the future.
In May I was pleased to welcome Wolfhart Hauser to the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director and Chairman Designate. He has an exemplary 
track record of sustained value creation and is a highly experienced 
Non-Executive Director. It is with regret that I am required to step down 
from the Chairmanship of FirstGroup at the AGM in July, in order to fully 
dedicate myself to the task of bringing Barclays to full health. However, 
with Wolfhart succeeding me as Chairman, I will be leaving FirstGroup 
in capable hands. I wish him and all at FirstGroup well for the future.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 07
Strategic report  Chief Executive’s strategic review 
We keep customers moving and communities 
prospering by providing solutions for today’s 
transportation challenges.
The demands placed on transport systems both within and between 
cities are becoming increasingly complex, and customer expectations 
for safety and punctuality, value for money, comfort and connectivity 
are higher than ever. In meeting these challenges we have a unique 
competitive advantage: the scale, diversity and track record of our 
portfolio of transport businesses means we have a huge range of 
expertise and experience across the Group to draw on. 
Our strategy is designed to leverage our scale by harnessing all of 
our international expertise and experience for the beneﬁt of our local 
markets. We focus on ﬁve strategic objectives where our strengths 
and capabilities across the Group have the most potential to add value: 
these are focused and disciplined bidding in our contract businesses, 
driving growth through attractive commercial propositions in our 
passenger revenue businesses, continuous improvement in operating 
and ﬁnancial performance, prudent investment in our key assets (ﬂeets, 
systems and people), and maintaining responsible partnerships with 
our customers and communities. 
In this strategic report we set out our business model, strategy and
objectives in detail and review how we performed operationally and
ﬁnancially in the year against our plans. We explain how we measure 
our progress against a range of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial indicators, 
and review the principal risks and uncertainties that we face, together 
with the approach we take to managing them. Effective transport links 
play a vital role in the prosperity of any economy, and responsible 
partnerships with our customers and communities are therefore 
one of our strategic objectives. The corporate responsibility section 
of our website expands on the summary contained in this report.
Progress with our transformation plans
In 2013 we put forward a multi-year programme to reposition the 
Group for improved ﬁnancial performance and to restore us to a proﬁle 
of consistent ﬁnancial returns, more reﬂective of our leading market 
positions and our international capabilities. We strengthened the 
balance sheet to give us the ﬂexibility to invest in this transformation, 
and set out detailed medium term ﬁnancial targets. We are conﬁdent 
that this programme represents the most compelling way to drive 
a sustained improvement in returns for our shareholders while 
continuing to deliver for our other stakeholders. 
I am pleased to say that the Group as a whole has made good 
progress in our transformation over the last two years, notwithstanding 
some unexpected external challenges since that time. In First Student 
we continue to make progress in renewing our contract portfolio at 
prices more reﬂective of the capital we employ whilst delivering 
signiﬁcant cost efﬁciencies, despite the unusually severe winter in North 
America in 2013/14. In UK Bus our tailored market-by-market approach 
has restored our ability to deliver passenger volume growth and 
market-based pricing yields whilst also reducing our cost base. In 
Greyhound our programme to adopt yield management and customer 
relationship management systems is on track – and the importance of 
having these tools has been amply highlighted by the impact of fuel 
price volatility on passenger demand this year. We have secured 
Our improved ﬁnancial 
performance this year 
demonstrates that our 
multi-year transformation 
programme is making 
progress, though we must 
maintain the momentum of 
change to meet our medium 
term ﬁnancial targets.
Tim O’Toole
Chief Executive
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 08 continued operation of First Great Western until at least March 2019, 
which provides us with an important foundation to build on in the UK 
rail industry. We were disappointed with the outcome of recent 
franchise competitions, but we remain conﬁdent that our disciplined 
bidding process is the most appropriate approach for us. Moreover, 
our track record of operational delivery stands us in good stead as 
the remaining two thirds of the franchises by value are awarded over 
the next ﬁve years. Importantly during a period when we have been 
reinvesting in the business, our cash generation is ahead of our 
initial expectations. 
As our transformation plans move forward, we will continue to build 
on the improvements in our revenue and proﬁtability towards our 
medium term growth and margin targets. We expect to continue to 
invest across the Group at similar absolute levels for the medium term, 
with our free cash ﬂow improving over time as our operating earnings 
increase. We also expect our ﬁnancing costs to continue to reduce, 
as cash generation increases and our relatively high coupon bonds 
mature over time. We continue to target a ROCE of 10-12% and a 
net debt:EBITDA ratio of two times in the medium term, and remain 
committed to reinstating a sustainable dividend policy at the 
appropriate time. 
People
In March 2015 we were pleased to announce that Wolfhart Hauser 
would join the Board from May, and will become Chairman following 
our AGM in July. Wolfhart recently retired after ten years as CEO of 
Intertek Group plc, the international quality and safety services provider 
and FTSE 100 constituent. Under his leadership, Intertek developed 
from a medium-sized group of separate testing businesses into an 
integrated global organisation with more than 38,000 employees 
and operations in more than 100 countries. Wolfhart’s track record 
of sustained value creation and his experience and counsel will be 
invaluable as we continue to drive forward the transformation of the 
Group. On behalf of the Board and our employees, I would also like 
to thank John McFarlane for the important contribution he has made 
during his tenure as Chairman and we wish him every success as 
Chairman of Barclays.
I would like to echo the sentiments of the Chairman in thanking Chris 
Surch for his contribution to the Group since he joined in 2012. During 
this time of signiﬁcant transformation he has played a key role in placing 
the business on a stronger footing and he will leave with our good 
wishes in all his future endeavours.
During the year our former colleagues at First Capital Connect and 
First ScotRail transferred into new franchise owners. We worked hard 
to ensure smooth transitions and we wish them well for the future.
We continue to invest in our people throughout the Group, giving 
them the leadership, professional development and other tools which 
are strengthening our ability to deliver our transformation plans and 
leverage the extraordinary breadth of expertise across our business. 
Outlook 
We intend to deliver further progress from our multi-year transformation 
plans in our 2015/16 ﬁnancial year. We currently anticipate strong 
progression in our non-rail businesses, driven mainly by the ongoing 
turnarounds of First Student and UK Bus, to largely offset the 
substantially lower contribution from UK Rail as a result of the end of 
the First ScotRail and First Capital Connect franchises. 
First Student will continue to seek higher pricing with the resultant risk 
of some contract losses during the 2015 bid season, though with just 
over half of the negotiations completed so far, we are encouraged by 
our progress, with average price increases achieved to date of over 5%. 
We anticipate this improvement together with further cost efﬁciencies 
to result in further margin progress for First Student in 2015/16, despite 
an impact of approximately $17m to operating proﬁt as a result of the 
lower number of operating days compared with the prior year. We 
expect First Transit to continue to bid for contracts offering good 
margins with modest capital investment, though we expect some 
reductions in demand for our shuttle services in the Canadian oil sands 
region as a result of lower oil prices. In Greyhound we expect our yield 
management systems to be operational from the middle of our 2015/16 
ﬁnancial year, with the ﬁnancial beneﬁts building over time. If recent oil 
prices are sustained throughout the year, we would expect Greyhound 
passenger demand to remain relatively muted, and we will continue to 
manage our variable costs in response. In UK Bus we will continue to 
drive overall volume growth and market-based yield enhancements 
while targeting further cost efﬁciencies in 2015/16, tailoring our actions 
to local conditions in the light of the progress each market has made 
through our turnaround plan. UK Rail’s contribution to Group earnings 
will be substantially lower in 2015/16, as a result of the First Capital 
Connect and First ScotRail franchises coming to an end. As previously 
indicated, we expect cash ﬂow in our 2015/16 year to be broadly 
ﬂat before the remaining UK Rail end of franchise outﬂows of 
approximately £30m. 
Our improved ﬁnancial performance this year demonstrates that our 
multi-year transformation programme is making progress, though we 
must maintain the momentum of change to meet our medium term 
ﬁnancial targets. Accordingly we will continue to work hard to deliver 
the considerable potential of the Group and return to a consistent 
proﬁle of cash generation and sustainable value creation.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 09
Strategic report  The world we live in
Keeping people moving and communities 
prospering in an increasingly congested 
world is ever more important.
Meeting the diverse needs 
of passengers in our 
increasingly complex and 
congested world will require 
ever more sophisticated 
transport solutions. 
Improvements in personal mobility and efﬁcient transportation of goods 
and services have always been important for economic growth, at least 
as long ago as the catalytic effect of the steam train on the industrial 
revolution. People need to travel for a wide range of reasons – 
business, education, healthcare, social and recreational – and the ease, 
speed and efﬁciency with which they do so has a major impact on the 
prosperity of their local economy and the ﬂourishing of their community. 
As the time, effort and ﬁnancial costs of travel reduce, the addressable 
market of a business increases, the catchment area of an employer 
widens, and the coverage range of highly specialised institutions such 
as universities, healthcare services or cultural centres grows. As a 
result, the need for efﬁciency and innovation in transport at all levels is a 
critical enabler of prosperity. 
Urbanisation
The inﬂuence of transport availability can be seen most clearly on 
two scales – efﬁciency and density. The falling costs of long distance 
transport have resulted in an increasingly efﬁcient, globalised economy. 
In addition, cities and mega-cities continue to grow in importance 
because their high densities allow so many more people to interact 
with each other. As a result cities are centres of innovation and change, 
social mobility, and economic growth. More than half of global GDP is 
generated in just the largest 600 cities globally, a proportion that is 
expected to increase. More than half of the world’s population today 
already live in urban areas, up a quarter from as recently as 1950. 
Despite the advent of ever more sophisticated forms of long distance 
communication, the rapid rise of cities globally is expected to continue, 
given the importance of face-to-face interactions in increasingly 
knowledge-based economies. 
Congestion, quality of life and complexity
Urbanisation and the prosperity it brings also create new challenges. 
With 1.5 million people moving into urban areas every week worldwide, 
it is becoming increasingly critical that transport services both within 
and between cities innovate and change to keep pace with demand. 
Increasing congestion and poor connectivity threaten the rationale for 
living closer together, and exact an increasing cost in lost productivity – 
for example, some estimates
2
 put the annual cost of trafﬁc congestion 
in the hundreds of billions for the US by the 2030s. 
Our core markets Our core markets in the UK and North 
America share several demographic, social 
and political characteristics which make them 
attractive for transport operators. Both are 
heavily and increasingly urbanised – just over 
80% of the population in the UK and North 
America live in urban areas today, increasing 
to nearly 90% by 2050
1
. High and increasing 
proportions of both populations are either in 
education or retirement age, demographic 
bands where use of our services is 
proportionately higher – just over 40% 
currently, rising to more than 45% by 2050
3
 in 
both. Although car ownership is relatively high 
(53 passenger vehicles per 100 people in the 
UK and 78 per 100 in the US
4
), national and 
local authorities in both markets are actively 
seeking to encourage greater use of 
alternatives. Indeed some analysts believe that 
‘peak car’ has already occurred in the UK and 
potentially in the US
5
. Both markets also have 
a long history of transport deregulation, with 
mature business models and regulatory 
frameworks that encourage partnering with 
the private sector for transport infrastructure 
and services.

 UK data from DfT National Travel 
Survey (2012). US data from US 
Department of Commerce, Census 
Bureau (2011).
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 10 In many cities which continue to rely heavily on the passenger car, the 
cost of urbanisation is also counted in air quality degradation and an 
increasing contribution to carbon emissions. Where alternative modes 
of transportation to the car do exist, they are under increasing pressure 
as demographic and social changes increase the proportion of city 
dwellers who are reliant on mass transportation, such as those in 
education, retired, or unable to drive themselves. In addition, more 
and more (particularly young) urban dwellers are choosing not to 
drive, given the costs of buying and maintaining a car and the issues 
of parking congestion and sustainability concerns. The digital economy 
is also offering more opportunities to access ‘transport as a service’, 
through car sharing and other applications.
In response national and local governments have encouraged a range 
of measures to improve the connectivity and efﬁciency of transport 
networks, such as a multiplication of the number of transport modes, 
investment in improved infrastructure and increased interconnectivity 
between modes. Passengers are being encouraged to use a broader 
range of travel options than ever before, but with this complexity comes 
additional challenges in terms of interconnecting the various options and 
giving passengers access to the information necessary to make best use 
of them all. Employing a range of measures such as differentiated pricing, 
advertising and loyalty programmes to manage demand for different 
transport options has also become increasingly important.
Meeting a diverse range of needs
While urban areas continue to grow and the range of transport options 
becomes more complex, passenger requirements for safety, comfort 
and convenience are continuing to increase. Competition between 
different transport options and amongst different operators continues 
to drive up quality and performance standards throughout the industry. 
It is becoming increasingly important to deliver services that are highly 
responsive to changing passenger needs, especially as value for 
money remains an important criterion for passengers and taxpayers. 
Travellers often use more than one mode of transport to complete 
their journeys, so thinking on a transport system-wide level is also 
increasingly vital.
The future 
Access to efﬁcient and attractive transport solutions will continue to 
play a vitally important role in keeping people moving to and from the 
activities that they value and need. Their quality of life and the prosperity 
of their communities is enabled by the transport options linking people 
together. Increasing urbanisation will continue to create challenges of 
congestion, environmental impact and complexity, and more and more 
people will become reliant on mass transport solutions. An increasingly 
broad range of skills, expertise and capabilities – and the ability to link 
them together – is becoming more and more important to the delivery 
of the transport services passengers will want and need in the future.

Strategic report  Business model
Our services help to create strong,  
vibrant and sustainable local economies  
and our opportunity is to be the provider  
of choice for the customers and  
communities we serve.
Our vision 
Our vision is to provide solutions  
for an increasingly congested  
world… keeping people moving 
and communities prospering.
Our values
Committed to our customers  
We keep our customers at the heart 
of everything we do.
Dedicated to safety  
Always front of mind, safety is our 
way of life.
Supportive of each other  
We trust each other to deliver and work 
to help one another succeed.
Accountable for performance  
Every decision matters, we do the right 
thing to achieve our goals.
Setting the highest standards  
We want to be the best, continually 
seeking a better way to do things. 
FirstGroup has a competitive advantage 
as a result of our scale and the diversity 
of our market-leading portfolio of transport 
businesses: we design and operate more 
networks in partnership with more communities, 
we hire, train and manage more employees, 
we procure, maintain and deploy more 
vehicles, and we transport more passengers 
than any other operator. 
Our overall strategy is to leverage our scale and the breadth of our 
global expertise for the beneﬁt of our local markets. Through this 
strategy we are ideally placed to provide the transport solutions 
increasingly needed by our customers (see pages 10-1 1), and to deliver 
the promises embodied in our vision and underpinned by our values. 
Each of our ﬁve divisions are exposed to different geographies, 
customers, revenue models, demand drivers and competitors within 
the overall transport industry, and are therefore run in a decentralised 
way so as to be responsive to the needs of our local customers. The 
diversity of our revenues by geography and customer type typically 
makes the overall Group relatively resilient through the business cycle. 
Our lean corporate centre focuses on fostering a high performance 
culture, sets the strategic direction, raises and allocates capital, 
establishes key targets and standards, monitors performance and 
provides challenge. 
While the detailed drivers differ by division, and are reviewed in depth 
in the business review (see pages 20-39), the business model of any 
transport operator is in principle simple. Revenues are generated either 
from passengers paying for the transportation service directly, or the 
service is procured on behalf of passengers by government or other 
parties. The operator must ensure appropriate vehicles are available 
where and when they are needed, staffed by suitably qualiﬁed and 
engaged employees, and that the service provided meets the safety, 
reliability, environmental and other needs of the passengers and 
communities served. Successful execution of this business model 
delivers gains for a wide range of stakeholders: passengers get 
where they want to go via attractive, modern services; employees 
have a rewarding career; governments facilitate increased economic 
activity; local communities limit congestion and other environmental 
costs of transport; suppliers are part of a successful ecosystem; and 
shareholders receive an appropriate return, even after the substantial 
reinvestment necessary to sustain the business model for the 
long term.
Successful delivery of our ﬁnancial targets, and sustained value 
creation as a Group in the longer term, depend on our ﬁve strategic 
objectives. With the strategic objectives guiding our actions, and our 
values underpinning the way we work together as a Group, we will 
deliver the promises made to our customers and communities as 
embodied in our vision, and the commitments made to our other 
stakeholders including shareholders.

Our business model
1
  Focused and disciplined bidding  
in our contract businesses
Approximately half our revenues are backed by contracts or franchise 
agreements with national government, regional and local authorities in 
the UK, and state and municipal authorities, local school boards, 
universities and private companies in North America. Across the Group 
we manage over 1,600 such contracts, which are typically competitively 
tendered, and of multi-year duration. Continuing to build on our many 
years of experience formulating successful bids at appropriate levels 
of risk, and managing the delivery of the resulting contracts, is critically 
important for our business. 
2
  Driving growth through attractive commercial propositions  
in our passenger revenue businesses
Our other main source of revenues is directly from our passengers, 
who represent a very broad demographic mix and use our services for 
a wide range of business, commuting, educational, medical, social and 
recreational purposes. All of our markets are highly competitive, and 
therefore a strong understanding of the changing needs of our local 
customers is vital to ensure our services continue to grow. Offering 
a responsive range of destinations, frequencies and ticket options at 
competitive prices is a key objective in our passenger revenue businesses. 
3
  Continuous improvement in operating and  
ﬁnancial performance
By its nature, the transport industry involves the risk of injury to 
employees, passengers and third parties, which is why it is central to our 
culture and values to keep safety front of mind. No less important for our 
customers is delivering a consistent and attractive service on which they 
can rely. In both areas we constantly reinforce standards and seek out 
best practice from across the Group and beyond in order to strive for 
ever more stretching improvement targets. This focus on disciplined 
operations and continuous improvement is also brought to bear on our 
ﬁnancial performance, where we must manage employee productivity, 
asset/fuel efﬁciency, procurement, overheads, insurance and other costs 
to ensure efﬁcient use of our resources. 
4
  Prudent investment in our key assets (ﬂeets, systems  
and people)
Through successful execution of the ﬁrst three strategic objectives, 
we delivered safe and reliable transportation services for around 
2.4 billion people last year, and generated proﬁts and substantial 
operating cash ﬂow. To continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders 
over the longer term, reinvesting appropriately in the future is vital. 
Our most important assets are our 110,000 people – we invest heavily in 
hiring, supporting and developing our employees to ensure we continue 
to have the best people delivering our services. We also invest to ensure 
our ﬂeets of nearly 60,000 vehicles across the Group are ﬁt for purpose 
and offer the safety systems and other services that passengers want 
(such as smart ticketing, real-time information and Wi-Fi). We also invest 
in our systems and processes to support other strategic objectives, 
such as the current programme to transform Greyhound’s pricing, 
seat management and ticketing systems, for example. 
5
  Maintain responsible partnerships with our customers  
and communities
Our ﬁnal strategic objective is to invest time, energy and capital in 
what matters to our key stakeholders. We focus on building long term 
partnerships with our customers and communities, learning what 
they want and striving to deliver it for them. Our long term success 
is built on being a responsible partner to all our stakeholders, an 
approach that is about much more than meeting certain ‘licence to 
operate’ contractual stipulations. In reality we act as a responsible 
corporate citizen because the long term success of our business is 
tightly entwined with the aspirations, opportunities and success of our 
customers and communities. We can only create value and deliver 
sustainable returns to our shareholders if our services help to create 
strong, vibrant and sustainable local economies, where we are the 
provider of choice for the customers and the communities we serve.

In our North American contract businesses we 
typically expect to maintain contract retention levels 
of around 90% by revenue. 
In First Student, our contract retention rate during 
the 2014 bid season was 90% of all contracts up 
for bid, towards the upper end of our expectations 
given our focus on improving contract returns, 
which yielded an average price increase of 4.5%. 
In First Transit, our contract retention rate was just 
below 90% in the year, after adjusting for the loss 
of one of our larger contracts which was delivering 
margins below the divisional average.
Like-for-like revenue adjusts for changes in the 
composition of the divisional portfolio and other 
factors that distort the underlying year-on-year 
trends in our passenger revenue businesses.
Greyhound’s like-for-like revenue decreased by 
0.1% in 2014/15, due to the adverse effect on 
customer demand from sharply lower fuel prices. 
UK Bus like-for-like passenger revenue increased 
by 2.3% in 2015, as a result of further passenger 
volume growth and some yield from local 
market-based pricing strategies. UK Rail like-for-like 
revenue (up 6.7%) continued to beneﬁt from growth 
in passenger volume.
Reported Group revenue decreased by 9.9% in the 
period to £6,050.7m, although adjusting for UK Rail 
franchise changes, non-recurring revenues from UK 
Bus operations sold or closed in the prior year and 
foreign exchange translation, underlying Group 
revenue increased by 4.1%.

Greyhound’s on time performance (percentage 
of services leaving within 15 minutes of scheduled 
departure from origin) improved during 2014/15 as 
we introduced service processes modelled on best 
practice at Greyhound Express. Enhanced boarding 
processes and new technology will also drive this 
measurement going forwards.
Our UK Bus punctuality (percentage of services 
no more than one minute early or ﬁve minutes late) 
has been affected by road repair programmes in a 
number of urban areas. We are working with local 
authorities on these temporary issues, and in the 
worst affected areas we have increased the number 
of buses and drivers deployed.
Our UK Rail PPM scores of punctuality and reliability 
suffered from disruption caused by infrastructure 
failures affecting our networks, whilst First ScotRail 
was also affected by congestion during the 
Commonwealth Games. First TransPennine 
Express’s score was affected by service issues 
following the implementation of a new timetable, but 
by the end of the year performance had recovered.
Our lost time injury rate reduced by 3% to 8.1 
instances per 1,000 employees in 2014/15. This 
was better than target in all divisions except UK 
Bus, where this KPI remains an important focus.
The rate of passenger injuries per million miles 
improved signiﬁcantly across all of our North 
American divisions in 2014/15, but was below 
target in the UK, resulting in an overall adverse trend 
of 5% year on year. Plans for augmenting our safety 
culture are ongoing, led in the coming year by a 
programme to reinforce safety as a personal core 
value for all employees throughout the Group.
Adjusted operating proﬁt and adjusted EPS highlight 
the recurring ﬁnancial results of the Group before 
amortisation charges and certain other items (as 
set out in note 4 to the ﬁnancial statements) which 
distort year-on-year comparisons.
Group adjusted operating proﬁt increased by 
13.3%, while adjusted EPS increased by 30.7%, 
reﬂecting increased operating proﬁt and lower net 
ﬁnance costs, partly offset by the increased number 
of shares in issue following the rights issue 
completed in the prior year.

Employee engagement, as measured through 
our ‘Your Voice’ employee survey and pulse 
checks, has continued to increase year-on-year. 
Our Group-wide engagement score is now at 
72%, demonstrating our commitment to listening 
and acting on employee feedback.
A number of parts of the Group are above the norm 
for employee engagement, including in Greyhound, 
who were listed for the ﬁrst time in the Forbes 
magazine ‘America’s Best Employers’ list in 2015.
In First Student our average ﬂeet age remains 
around 7.5 years, with the cost of our continued 
investment in our ﬂeets partially offset by cascading 
some buses released from completed contracts to 
fulﬁl roles elsewhere in the division. 
The vast majority of Greyhound’s active ﬂeet is either 
new or has been extensively refurbished in recent 
years – such that while the reported age is 10.0 
years, the effective average age is 7.9 years.
 
Having increased with the disposal of our London 
operations in 2013/14, UK Bus average ﬂeet age 
has begun to reduce in 2014/15, reﬂecting ongoing 
reinvestment in our ﬂeet. 
Reported return on capital employed (ROCE) is 
calculated by dividing adjusted operating proﬁt 
after tax by net assets excluding debt items. 
Group ROCE was 7.8% in 2015, reﬂecting 
increased adjusted operating proﬁt offset by an 
increase in capital employed as translated at 
year-end currency rates. On a constant currency 
basis, ROCE improved to 8.5% in the year.
Customer satisfaction in both First Student and First 
Transit has continued to increase, with First Student 
making gains for the sixth year in a row. 
As well as strong overall satisfaction scores, both 
divisions saw continued gains in other key metrics, 
such as likelihood to recommend, commitment to 
safety and satisfaction with local teams.

This year we contributed £1.7m to our communities 
across the UK and North America, as measured by 
the London Benchmarking Group model. This 
includes cash contributions made directly by the 
Company (such as donations and matched funding), 
time (including over 3,600 hours of employee 
volunteering), in kind support (of items like travel 
tickets or advertising space), and leverage (including 
contributions from other sources such as 
employees, customers and suppliers). Overall, more 
than 1,500 organisations beneﬁted from our 
support. Read more on page 43.
Our emissions are quantiﬁed and reported in line with 
the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol. We 
report our emissions from all activities for which we are 
responsible across our global operations expressed 
in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO
2
(e)), 
normalised per £1m of revenue. All data now excludes 
First Capital Connect, which we no longer operate.
In 2014/15 our normalised emissions increased by 
5.95% to 464 tonnes of CO
2
(e) per £1m of revenue. 
The longer term trend shows a 0.09% reduction 
against our 2010/11 baseline. Read more on  
page 42.
Satisfaction with our Greyhound brands remained 
high in 2014/15, particularly in Greyhound Express, 
with a majority of passengers across Greyhound 
stating that they would recommend our services 
to others. Nonetheless, bad weather again affected 
scheduling this winter which reduced levels of 
customer satisfaction, especially in the 
traditional business.
Our UK Bus division achieved an 86% overall 
passenger satisfaction score. This equals  
our record, following a 5 percentage point rise  
in 2013. We also scored record value for money 
satisfaction, which is key to our strategy, increasing 
17 percentage points over two years to 65%, which 
is 2% above the national average. Satisfaction with 
punctuality reduced slightly due, in part, to the 
impact of local authority roadworks mentioned 
above. As we deliver further improvements to 
service performance, investment in our bus ﬂeet 
and smart and mobile ticketing options, it is 
expected that these satisfaction numbers will 
increase further.
A national average of 81% of train passengers were 
satisﬁed in autumn 2014 according to the latest 
ﬁgures published by Transport Focus. Their poll 
of 27,000 people looked at topics ranging from 
reliability to staff attitudes and value for money. All 
our train operating companies scored the average or 
higher, with First ScotRail scoring 88% satisfaction 
overall and with just 3% saying they were 
dissatisﬁed with their service. 82% of passengers 
were satisﬁed on First TransPennine Express, 81% 
satisﬁed on First Great Western and 89% satisﬁed 
on First Hull Trains.

Market review and trends
School buses provide home to school transportation for millions of 
students in the US and Canada. There are more than 15,000 school 
districts in North America, which deploy more than 500,000 school 
buses. The total North American market is estimated to be worth 
around $24bn per annum, of which school districts directly operate 
approximately 63%, with 37% outsourced to private operators. 
Charter services are also operated, typically of limited duration and 
scope, either for school customers separate from scheduled school 
runs or for other customers such as church and community groups 
or businesses. 
Long term demand for school transportation services is principally 
driven by the size of the school-age population; however other factors 
including the propensity of school boards to outsource and changes 
in the local criteria for service provision (such as the distance to school 
bands within which the service is offered) can play a part in the 
addressable market for private operators. In the last three years, the 
market has stabilised with some positive but limited organic growth, 
following a period when the economic downturn put pressure on 
customer budgets, which led to organic retraction, price pressure, and 
atypical levels of contract churn. While school board budget pressures 
have eased, high quality, high efﬁciency outsourced providers offer an 
increasingly attractive value proposition to potential customers.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 20 Financial performance
Revenue in our First Student division was $2,368.6m or £1,478.8m 
(2014: $2,339.3m or £1,467 .4m), 1.3% higher on a US Dollar basis, 
beneﬁting from our successful pricing strategy during the 2014 
bid season and modest organic growth. Operating proﬁt was  
$177 .3m or £1 14.9m (2014: $152.8m or £93.5m), resulting in a 
US Dollar margin of 7 .5% (2014: 6.5%). The one percentage point 
improvement in margin reﬂects the beneﬁts of our pricing strategy 
in respect of the approximately one third of the portfolio retendered 
in the 2014 bid season, recovery of operating days lost to the severe 
weather in the prior year, a beneﬁt of $19m in the year from our 
ongoing $50m per annum cost efﬁciency programme, partially 
offset by continued pockets of driver shortage in parts of the 
business and cost inﬂation running slightly ahead of price indexation 
on the bulk of our contracts not yet rebid under our pricing strategy. 
Our strengths
Clear market leader (bigger than next four competitors 
combined) – scale economies in vehicle and parts procurement, 
insurance, fleet management, technology development, etc.
Differentiated offering – technology, safety programme, strong 
customer relationships and satisfaction scores
Turnaround plan is progressing – disciplined contract portfolio 
management, capital discipline and cost efficiency plans are 
driving margins and returns
Repositioning business to sustainably deliver profitable growth 
and returns from market leadership in the long term.
Customers
School districts provide transportation for students depending on 
varying criteria determined at state level. Contracts typically specify 
either ﬁxed or annually indexed pricing, meaning that private operators 
bear cost risk. These contracts are typically three to ﬁve years in duration, 
after which they are competitively retendered. School districts receive 
their funding from state and local sources, including property tax 
receipts, and their budgets for all expenditure, including transportation, 
tend to be linked to economic factors. In addition to school districts 
outsourcing student transportation for the ﬁrst time (known as ‘conversion’), 
growth is driven by additional routes for a given school due to 
population growth or other factors (‘organic growth’), as well as 
inﬂation-related price indexation built into some contracts.
Competitors
The private outsourced market is highly fragmented with 14 operators 
running more than 1,000 buses. The largest four companies, including 
our business, account for just below half of the outsourced market. The 
next 45 largest contractors operate approximately 25,000 buses, and 
the remaining outsourced contracts are operated by several thousand 
companies, often termed ‘mom and pop’ operators. ‘Share shift’, or 
winning contracts previously managed by other outsourced providers, 
together with acquisitions, provide additional avenues of growth.
Market attractions
 Contracted revenue with public sector customers, typically low 
credit risk
 Typically high levels of contract retention
 Security and safety track record at least as important as price
 Established relationships with local communities a barrier to entry

Focused and disciplined bidding
A key element of our turnaround plan in First Student is addressing 
contract portfolio pricing on new bids and renewals to ensure that we 
achieve appropriate returns on capital on our contract portfolio. As is 
typical, approximately one third of our bus portfolio was up for renewal 
in the 2014 bid season, and we were pleased to achieve average price 
increases on these contracts of approximately 4.5%. Our contract 
retention rate of 90% on those contracts up for bid was at the upper 
end of our range of expectations. As a result, the proportion of First 
Student’s contract portfolio earning margins below 5% has reduced 
from 36% in 2014 to below 30% in the current year. The level of 
acceptance of our price increases, together with a third year of 
modest organic growth under existing contracts, suggests that 
market conditions are continuing to improve. We continue to compete 
effectively in the conversion market from in-house to privately operated 
services, which we believe offers signiﬁcantly better value, though at 
present the number of new outsourcing opportunities continues to be 
limited. Together with some ‘share shift’ wins from competitors and a 
small tuck-in acquisition in New York, our overall bus ﬂeet reduced by 
around 60 buses, remaining just over 49,000.
Continuous improvement in operating 
and ﬁnancial performance
In addition to the pricing strategy, we made good progress on the 
next phase of our cost efﬁciency programme. We are rolling out a 
programme to address the recruitment challenges we have faced in 
some localised parts of our business, which includes an applicant 
tracking system developed in our UK divisions, and further savings 
continue to be driven by implementing and monitoring compliance 
with identiﬁed best practice operating procedures throughout our more 
than 500 locations. This programme has now delivered around $120m 
in annual cost efﬁciencies including $19m in 2014/15 as targeted, 
and we expect to deliver a further $30m per annum in savings by 
the end of the 2016/17 ﬁnancial year. Almost three quarters of our 
engineering locations have achieved silver or gold ‘lean’ certiﬁcation. 
Key areas of opportunity going forward include further savings from 
lean engineering and maintenance procedures, employee productivity, 
procurement and more efﬁcient use of fuel. 
Prudent investment in our key assets
We continue to increase our use of technology to raise customer 
service levels, promote environmental beneﬁts and differentiate our 
services. Our FOCUS GPS system (which links onboard data to back 
ofﬁce systems) is now ﬁtted throughout the bus ﬂeet, and functions as 
a platform for additional improvements. For example, our DriveSMART 
initiative, which combines driver training with fuel use data from 
FOCUS, incrementally saved nearly $6m in fuel costs in the year. 
We are also carrying out ﬁeld trials this year on a system using 
FOCUS to give parents the ability to track bus location in real time, 
which will be ready for roll out in time for the 2016 bid season. 
Our MyFirstPass system continues to be deployed in selected 
locations, giving parents and schools timely information on student 
ridership through swipe card technology. We invested approximately 
$280m in new buses, refurbishments and onboard technology in 
the year; our average ﬂeet age remained constant at 7 .5 years.
First Student is at the initial stages of introducing a 
consolidated recruiting model allowing online application, 
which will replace the previous paper-based, decentralised 
driver recruiting process. The new system, which is based 
on a similar successful model developed by our UK 
divisions, allows a more consistent approach to recruitment 
across different locations and online application, saving time 
for our management teams. A pilot was launched at 53 
locations in late 2014, and learnings from this pilot will help 
inform the phased roll out of this new system which will 
take place across the division over the next three months.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 22 We also continue to develop our more structured approach to charter 
business, which delivers very strong incremental returns on capital 
employed as it utilises the existing bus ﬂeet in between the contracted 
services at the beginning and end of the school day. In the year we 
opened three regional charter centres, handling almost a third of all 
our non-school charter work, which grew by 7% in the year.
Responsible partnerships with our customers 
and communities
Our services form an integral part of the school experience for the 
millions of children in our care each day, and we take our responsibilities 
to them and to their parents, schools and communities very seriously. 
We are pleased to have achieved a sixth consecutive year of improved 
customer service scores, and we had a strong performance in our 
safety KPIs. Continuous improvement in our customer service and 
safety track record is deeply embedded in our values as an 
organisation, and is also a competitive advantage. 
In addition to cost savings, the 2% improvement in fuel efﬁciency from 
our DriveSMART initiative reduces our environmental impact, and our 
alternative fuel ﬂeet continues to grow, increasing by 250 buses in 
the year.
Future priorities
First Student is a leader in our marketplace, both in terms of our size 
and the quality and safety of the services we provide. Through the 
continuation of our turnaround plan, we will deliver our medium term 
target of double digit margins by ensuring that we continue to bid or 
renew contracts only at prices that reﬂect the quality of service we 
provide and the capital that we employ. In addition we continue to 
implement and monitor best practice policies and procedures in all 
key areas throughout our business to reduce cost. In the longer term, 
First Student’s unique market position, value proposition and 
increasing operational efﬁciency will ensure we are increasingly 
well placed to grow through further share shift, tuck-in acquisitions 
and organic opportunities.
Outlook
During the 2015 bid season First Student is continuing to seek higher 
pricing with the resultant risk of some contract losses. With just over 
half of the negotiations completed so far, we are encouraged by our 
progress, with average price increases achieved to date of over 5%. 
We expect this improvement, together with additional cost efﬁciencies, 
to result in further margin improvement in 2015/16, despite an impact 
of approximately $17m to operating proﬁt as a result of fewer 
operating days due to the timing of Easter and Labor Day, which 
will reverse in our 2016/17 ﬁnancial year.

Brad Thomas 
President, First Transit and First Vehicle Services Market review and trends
The transit market is worth around $30bn per annum in North America, 
of which around 30% is outsourced. The market includes the provision 
of ﬁxed route bus services (approximately $20bn segment, of which 
more than 10% is outsourced), paratransit bus services (approximately 
$5bn segment, of which three quarters is outsourced), private shuttle 
services (approximately $2bn segment, of which around 90% is 
outsourced) and vehicle maintenance services (approximately $3bn 
segment, of which around one third is outsourced). Private 
transportation companies manage, operate, maintain and organise 
transportation services under contracts which typically last for three 
to ﬁve years or longer. 
As populations continue to age and urban congestion increases, 
the scope and sophistication of municipal and other transportation 
services required is rising, which enhances the attraction of bringing 
in private sector expertise. Although North American state and local 
government ﬁnances are improving with the economy, they continue 
to seek opportunities to increase the cost effectiveness of their 
transportation spending, which supports growth in outsourcing of 
certain services where private contractors can maintain or improve 
efﬁciency while reducing overall cost. The shuttle segment continues 
to grow, with private companies, universities and airports seeking to 
offer additional services to their own customers and employees. 
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 24 Financial performance
Revenue in our First Transit division was $1,362. 1m or £844.8m  
(2014: $1,290.5m or £81 1.9m). US Dollar revenue increased by 
5.5%, with revenue growth during the year in all of our divisional 
sub-segments, driven by the timing of contract awards and higher 
than anticipated organic growth on existing contracts. Operating 
proﬁt was $96. 1m or £59.7m (2014: $95.7m or £60.3m), resulting in 
a margin of 7 . 1% (2014: 7 .4%), which is in line with our expectations 
and medium term objectives.
Our strengths
Established credentials and track record – First Transit is 
a market leader and has a pedigree extending over 60 years
Diverse segments and large volume of relatively small 
contracts – our exceptional bidding and management expertise 
are well embedded
Industry-leading programmes – including safety and 
maintenance training
Technology investment is delivering efficiency gains and 
service enhancements for our customers
Our scale and breadth of management expertise will 
support future growth.
Customers
A wide range of customers contract out transportation services, 
including transit authorities, federal, state and local agencies, as 
well as private institutions including universities, hospitals and airports. 
The vehicle ﬂeet maintenance services market includes contracting 
for private and public sector clients, including municipalities, and ﬁre 
and police departments.
Competitors
First Transit has over 15% of the outsourced market in the United 
States, which accounts for approximately 30% of the total market. 
The outsourced transit market is fragmented although First Transit 
has two large competitors, MV Transportation, Inc., and Transdev 
North America. The outsourced ﬂeet maintenance market is highly 
competitive and our First Vehicle Services segment is estimated to 
be one of the largest providers in the market, with Penske and Ryder 
being the principal competitors. A number of small and medium sized 
companies represent a signiﬁcant proportion of the outsourced market. 
The market continues to attract new entrants, though reputation and 
track record remain important differentiators in the bidding process.
Market attractions
 Contracted revenue mainly with public sector customers, 
low credit risk

continued
Focused and disciplined bidding
During the year, we continued to maintain our track record of proﬁtable 
growth in a range of segments, whilst developing opportunities in new 
markets. Through collaborative partnerships with public transit authorities 
and private customers, we also generated organic growth on existing 
contracts at the higher end of our planning range. Contract retention 
remained at a high level, as our customers continued to respond 
positively to our capabilities and competitive pricing. As previously 
indicated two of our larger contracts came to an end during the 
second half of the year, including one which was delivering margins 
below the divisional average, and few recently awarded contracts 
started up in the second half, though we continued to win additional 
new business that will commence in 2015/16.
In the year we were awarded new paratransit contracts in Minnesota, 
Florida and the San Francisco Bay area; ﬁxed route contracts in 
Orange County, California and shuttle bus operations at colleges 
in New York state and Rhode Island, as well as a shuttle bus contract 
at Oklahoma City airport. In addition, we used expertise from our 
UK-based divisions and First T ransit’s existing client relationships to win 
business in the rapidly growing North American Bus Rapid Transit 
(BRT) market. We continue to see further opportunities to grow our 
shuttle business in the years ahead, which is the only part of the 
division that requires signiﬁcant capital investment.
Key contract retentions during the year included our paratransit 
contract with Metropolitan Council in Minneapolis, our transit 
management contract with Connecticut Transit, and our shuttle bus 
operations at New Jersey University and Kennesaw State University. 
We also extended contracts for one of our ﬁxed route operations in 
Denver and our shuttle bus operation at Houston International Airport.
Continuous improvement in operating 
and ﬁnancial performance
First Transit’s opportunities continue to arise from successful 
competitive bidding, but also through attracting business that 
is being outsourced to the private sector for the ﬁrst time. Our 
continued service and efﬁciency innovations help give us a 
competitive advantage compared to both public and private 
counterparts – in particular, our national service platform, 
technology infrastructure and management expertise are 
important differentiators. We continue to invest in our industry-
leading technology including a suite of innovative real-time 
information solutions which will deliver cost efﬁciencies and better 
data for our clients, and improved performance for us.
Prudent investment in our key assets
In First Transit we continue to focus investment spending on three 
principal areas: people, technology solutions and on vehicles for the 
shuttle segment, where typically we own the ﬂeets and are continuing 
to invest to grow our leading university and airport shuttle portfolio. 
We maintained our signiﬁcant investment in recruitment, retention 
and continuous training of our people to ensure we have the depth of 
expertise required for our bid submissions and for subsequent service 
delivery that meets customer expectations. We are introducing an 
applicant tracking system for prospective new employees in the year, 
based on a successful system developed in our UK divisions.
Last year we initiated the roll out of our upgraded management 
dashboard, providing automated operational, maintenance and 
ﬁnancial information, which is delivering cost savings. Our local 
management and regional support teams are now better 
equipped, with rapid and detailed information on their businesses 
readily available, increasing their ability to address any issues quickly 
and more completely. The dashboard provides a centralised repository 
of operational data and the ability to display KPIs in a user-friendly 
graphical interface, and allows management to make better and more 
informed decisions on the day-to-day operations of their systems, as 
well as plan for long term operational improvements. Other initiatives 
we have progressed through the year include predictive maintenance 
analytics and paperless workshop systems using tablet computers 
to improve performance.
We introduced a versatile and scalable secure mobile app 
during 2014, designed to keep passengers in touch with 
their paratransit service. The app utilises scheduling and 
real-time information from the transit authority’s scheduling 
systems and the information displayed can be customised 
using the transit authority’s own branding. This enhances 
customer service, particularly for those who are hearing 
impaired, and joins a suite of similar tools that we offer.

Our commitment to safety, technical and operational knowledge 
and professionalism is particularly recognised by our customers and 
our safety KPIs and customer service trends improved in the year. 
We are also at the forefront of the industry in developing mobile 
apps for our clients, allowing registered riders to monitor service 
disruptions, timetables and the location of services in real time. 
We have enhanced our leading safety programme through the 
continued roll out of DriveCam technology, an event capture and 
driver behaviour monitoring system, which has the added beneﬁt 
of improving fuel efﬁciency.
Future priorities
There is continued growth potential in each of our markets, particularly 
in the shuttle segment and in paratransit work for larger cities. The 
outlook for further outsourcing opportunities is positive and potential 
opportunities are also growing in light rail, commuter rail and BRT , where 
we will seek to harness the strong expertise in our UK divisions as we 
examine potential bids in these areas. The expertise of our people and 
the quality of our technology gives First Transit a competitive advantage. 
We have a track record of innovation and in delivering cost efﬁciencies, 
which in turn ensures that, despite an increasingly competitive market, 
we will remain the low cost supplier of choice for our customers. We 
continue to anticipate achieving a margin of approximately 7% in the 
medium term, which we believe is attractive in the context of the limited 
capital employed in the division.
Outlook
The overall pipeline of potential new business remains attractive as 
local authorities continue to consider ways to deliver transport services 
more cost effectively. Whilst we do anticipate some reductions in 
our provision of shuttle services to the Canadian oil sands sector 
during the year as a result of the lower oil price, we have a number 
of new business opportunities to help offset that impact.

US and Canada, serving 48 US States and 
ten Canadian Provinces and T erritories.

Market review and trends
The US intercity coach transportation industry has grown overall 
every year since 2006 – reversing the trend of the previous 25 years, 
when the industry declined by an average of 2.9% a year. Growth has 
been driven principally by improvements in the onboard experience,  
new or enhanced service offerings, including point-to-point ‘express’ 
services on high density routes. The size of the potential market 
remains a signiﬁcant opportunity for ongoing growth, with 
42m people considering coach travel every year, of whom around 
a quarter currently use Greyhound. Even regular coach users 
choose competing modes 75% of the time, but a combination of 
more destinations, tailored services and price has the potential to 
grow this market and frequency of use.
Since the substantial and rapid fall in at-pump fuel prices for 
consumers in the ﬁnal months of 2014, passenger demand has fallen 
as the marginal cost of driving has become more attractive compared 
with taking the coach. The longer term impact on the intercity coach 
market growth trend since 2006 will depend in part on future fuel 
price movements. 
As well as passenger revenues, income is generated from package 
express services, charter and tour organisation and also catering 
outlets in terminals. Partnerships between Greyhound and 
independent bus lines, known as ‘interlining’, extends the reach 
of the national network. Greyhound also partners with Amtrak 
to offer passengers a through ticket to their ﬁnal destination if 
not served by rail. 
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 28 Financial performance
During the year US Dollar revenue decreased by 0.5% to $986.0m or 
£609.6m (2014: $990.6m or £624.6m), reﬂecting the adverse effect 
on customer demand from sharply lower fuel prices, which improves 
the affordability of other forms of transport for some trips compared 
with Greyhound. As a result of the more ﬂexible operating model 
introduced in recent years, we were able to react rapidly to the 
situation, actively managing mileage, timetables and pricing in 
response to these changed market conditions. Nevertheless 
Greyhound’s operating proﬁt was $68.5m or £41.7m (2014: $73.2m 
or £46.4m), resulting in a US Dollar margin below the prior year level 
at 6.9% (2014: 7 .4%). Although our point-to-point brands were also 
somewhat affected by the sharply lower fuel prices, Greyhound 
Express continued to grow proﬁtably, with like-for-like revenue 
growth of 3.0% during the year, compared with a like-for-like revenue 
decrease of 0. 1% for the division as a whole. 
Driving growth through attractive commercial 
propositions
Greyhound is one of the most iconic brands in transport, with a 
unique national network giving us a competitive advantage and an 
established base for future growth. Passengers from our traditional 
network, which operates from some 3,800 locations across North 
America, help us feed our point-to-point brands including Greyhound 
Express and BoltBus. Our point-to-point brands have always operated 
modern, environmentally friendly buses equipped with features such 
as free Wi-Fi, power outlets, leather seats, extra legroom and guaranteed 
seating, and some of these amenities are being extended throughout 
the traditional network. Last summer we added additional destinations in 
Texas, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico, to take our Greyhound 
Express footprint to 135 markets.
 
Our strengths
Iconic brand synonymous with long distance coach travel
Only national network of scheduled intercity coach 
services – passenger feed from 48,000 city pairs provides 
operating leverage to point-to-point services
A business that is reconnecting with customers – operating 
a refreshed fleet with improved onboard amenities and additional 
sales and distribution channels
Range of brands and price points to target new markets.
Customers
North American intercity coach ﬁrms serve a wide customer base, 
many of whom prioritise value and whose primary purpose is to visit 
friends and family. Direct point-to-point services, such as Greyhound 
Express which now serves 135 markets across North America, are 
encouraging a new, younger passenger demographic. Increased 
urbanisation and city congestion are also beginning to have an impact 
on car ownership statistics, particularly for younger drivers. Historically, 
customers typically bought walk-up tickets on their day of travel, but 
new online and mobile services are driving an increasing trend for 
advance booking. 
Competitors
Intercity coach transportation competes with many other modes of 
mid to long distance travel across North America, including budget 
airlines and the private car. There is a highly competitive intercity 
coach market in dense travel corridors such as the north east and 
north west of the US, where coach transportation also competes 
with air and rail services.

gives access to scheduling information as well as the ability to purchase 
tickets and view completed bookings, was based on the BoltBus 
product. Similarly the recently launched app for BoltBus drivers, which 
streamlines boarding by allowing our drivers to scan tickets and allows 
us to manage inventory better, is acting as a test bed for a product 
which we will launch across the much larger and more complex 
traditional Greyhound network in the coming year.
Continuous improvement in operating 
and ﬁnancial performance
We have invested in the quality of our services and have improved 
our ability to ﬂex costs in response to changes in demand, although 
our traditional network today remains relatively dependent on macro-
economic factors such as fuel prices or employment levels. In response 
to changes in demand, we were able to react rapidly to the changed 
market conditions and manage our variable costs in order to mitigate 
the impact on margin performance year on year. We continue to make 
progress towards returning Greyhound Canada to proﬁtability through 
our ongoing efforts to optimise our network in the country. Our 
Greyhound Package Express business, which carries parcels on our 
buses, is evolving to adopt more modernised technology and now 
offers the ability to track and trace parcels.
Prudent investment in our key assets
Our most important area of investment is a programme to replicate 
the successful business model developed in our newer point-to-point 
services across the whole Greyhound network. As we have previously 
indicated, we are equipping our traditional business with real-time 
dynamic pricing and yield management capabilities, together with 
improved customer relationship management tools. Amongst other 
opportunities, these tools will increase our ability to stimulate demand 
throughout the macro-economic cycle, and allow us to shift demand 
to off-peak times more easily, resulting in better utilisation of existing 
seat inventory.
The most time intensive aspect of the project has been to transform 
Greyhound’s proprietary pricing and routing system into a position 
where it was able to be augmented with additional software 
components. Our bespoke but ageing system, which had been built 
over many years to manage the unique challenges of a network with 
more than 3,800 destinations and 48,000 routing combinations, has 
now been upgraded and transferred to a more robust infrastructure 
in line with our plans. The current focus of the project is the complex 
integration into the system of software packages similar to those used 
in aviation, retailing and other industries. We are also augmenting our 
commercial team with individuals experienced in these industries. The 
programme is on track to be operational across the network during our 
2015/16 ﬁnancial year. We have already begun taking pricing and yield 
management actions in certain regions and gathering the resulting 
data, in order to help reﬁne the parameters of the nationwide systems 
and processes that are being introduced. 
As part of the project we are also making good progress with our 
plans to upgrade our retail distribution strategy. Web ticket sales are 
now a very important sales channel where we see more than half of our 
transactions. Within that, mobile sales are the fastest growing segment 
accounting for a third of web sales, and our apps account for 20% of 
the mobile total. A completely refreshed Greyhound website with 
augmented functionality is due to go live in summer 2015. Increased 
During the year we updated our Wi-Fi platform allowing passengers to 
stay connected throughout their journey, and launched an onboard 
catalogue of destination packages that allows them to purchase tickets 
to theatrical events, attractions and onward transportation offers, 
including shuttles and taxis, all from their seat using their own Wi-Fi 
enabled devices. We are using learnings from our point-to-point brands 
to improve the customer offering in our traditional business and attract 
a new demographic to bus travel. As an example of this, Greyhound’s 
passenger app for smartphone users, which launched this year and 
To commemorate its 100th anniversary, Greyhound 
promoted a Centennial Tour around the United States 
to showcase the company’s growth and transformation, 
allowing guests of all ages to get a glimpse of Greyhound’s 
rich heritage. The tour comprised two mobile museum 
convoys simultaneously moving across the United States, 
beginning in Boston in May and ending in Los Angeles in 
December, visiting nearly 40 cities. The tour featured 
displays of memorabilia such as signage, vintage driver 
uniforms and an entire wall of history where guests could 
see Greyhound’s transformation over the years. The tour 
also showed off restored classic coaches and several of 
Greyhound’s new, modern coaches with amenities 
including free Wi-Fi, leather seats, power outlets and 
extra legroom. Further events throughout the year included 
a reception hosted by the US Department of Transport at 
the White House.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 30 use of web and mobile sales channels improves our ability to 
communicate our prices to customers, making our yield and price 
management actions more effective. In addition our customers can 
more easily act on the price beneﬁts of advance ticket purchases when 
they have the ﬂexibility to do so, which in turn enables us to operate 
more efﬁciently as we have increased visibility of demand. Further 
customer relationship management enhancements are also planned 
for the next year, including upgrading our customer loyalty programme.
During the year we introduced 100 new vehicles to our ﬂeet, completing 
the balance of the large coach order placed in the prior year. We also 
refurbished around 70 coaches to the same standard, which means 
that a substantial majority of our operational ﬂeet is now either new or 
recently refurbished.
Responsible partnerships with our customers 
and communities
The increased customer engagement that our new systems will bring 
will allow us to use technology to better understand the needs of our 
individual passengers. This will enable us to improve our customer 
satisfaction scores and better align our services with the needs of 
our passengers.
In the year, we were selected by Forbes magazine in its list of top 500 
companies to work for in the United States, ranked ahead of hundreds 
of well known companies across 25 industries, and Greyhound was 
the only intercity bus company to be recognised. More than 20,000 
American workers at companies with at least 2,500 employees were 
involved in the survey, which asked employees how likely they would 
be to recommend their employer to someone else.
During 2014 we celebrated our centenary with a series of events 
throughout the year including exhibitions, in-terminal commemorations, 
employee awards and a centennial tour which travelled across the 
US featuring our restored classic ﬂeet and showcasing the best of 
today’s business. We also increased traditional marketing efforts in 
conjunction with the centenary in order to drive additional interest in 
our improved offering. 
Future priorities
Our efforts to introduce real-time pricing, yield management and 
customer relationship management capabilities into the business will give 
us far greater visibility and granularity on passenger demand over time, 
allowing us to optimise our schedules, assets and pricing to maximise 
demand for our services. We will also continue to grow our point-to-point 
business, although the rate of growth in new services is likely to slow now 
that many of the closer cities in North America are already connected. 
We remain conﬁdent of achieving our 12% margin target, recognising 
however that long term oil price trends may impact the timing. 
Outlook
We will continue to actively manage our pricing, frequencies and other 
variable costs in response to trends in passenger demand growth, 
which we anticipate will remain relatively muted if recent oil price levels 
are sustained throughout the year. Meanwhile, we will continue to take 
actions to return our Canadian network to proﬁtability. We expect our 
yield management systems to be operational from the middle of our 
2015/16 ﬁnancial year, with the ﬁnancial beneﬁts building over time as 
we develop our expertise in analysing and using the new tools at our 
disposal, and passengers begin to respond to our actions.

UK Bus
Market overview
UK Bus is one of the largest bus operators 
in the UK, with around a ﬁfth of the 
deregulated market.
Passengers are responding 
to the improvements we have 
made to our services over 
recent years – we will continue 
to work tirelessly to sustain 
the momentum. 
Giles Fearnley
Managing Director, UK Bus
Market review and trends
Local bus services in the UK (outside London) have been 
deregulated since the 1980s, with most services being provided by 
private operators, although a small number of local authority owned 
operators still exist. Bus markets are local and services operate on a 
ﬂexible model with operators setting fares, frequencies and routes on 
a commercial basis and operating ‘socially necessary’ services under 
contract to local authorities. Around 2.8bn passenger journeys are 
made on local bus services outside of London, generating revenues 
of approximately £4.4bn a year.
Partnership with local authorities remains a core principle for both 
the bus industry and central Government in order to deliver service 
improvements, innovation and investment cost effectively. The DfT 
promotes this agenda through initiatives including Better Bus Area 
grants and the Green Bus Fund. Private operators increasingly offer 
tailored local brands and services, including premium routes serving 
distinct markets, and implement new technology including multi-
operator ticketing on smart platforms and apps delivering improved 
passenger information. Local authorities have legislative powers to 
regulate services in their area through ‘quality contracts’, where they 
can demonstrate the existing model is failing to deliver for passengers. 
To date this has not been implemented anywhere, but a number of 
authorities do consider this option periodically, and the Tyne and Wear 
metropolitan area is currently pursuing a quality contract (FirstGroup do 
not operate in this market). Increasing political consensus in favour of 
devolution of certain transport powers to city regions, including Greater 
Manchester (a FirstGroup market), may result in further changes to the 
current business model. Economic weakness continues in parts of the 
UK where provision of bus services remain as crucial to support 
recovery as they do to support growth.

Revenue in our UK Bus division was £896. 1m (2014: £930.2m) 
with like-for-like passenger revenue increasing by 2.3% excluding 
the contribution from discontinued and disposed businesses in the 
prior year. Responding to the changes we have made to our fares, 
networks and service quality, and despite mixed economic conditions 
across the division, like-for-like passenger volumes increased by 
1. 1% in the year. Within this, commercial passenger volume growth 
increased by 2.6% on a like-for-like basis, whilst concession volumes 
were modestly lower. In the second half of the year, many parts of 
our business reached the anniversary of our fare rebasing actions, 
and have begun to beneﬁt from positive yield from periodic price 
increases in line with the market. Operating proﬁt increased to 
£51.8m (2014: £44.4m) and operating margin increased by one 
percentage point to 5.8% (2014: 4.8%), reﬂecting operating leverage 
to growth and our ongoing cost efﬁciency programmes. 
Our strengths
Strong position in the deregulated market (outside 
London) – c.20% market share
Compelling positions in key markets – operations in seven 
of the 12 most densely populated cities – now delivering good 
volume growth
Repositioned to focus greater management expertise at 
the local level, delivering tailored network and fares offers to 
reflect local needs
Customer response – including passenger volume growth and 
satisfaction scores – demonstrates positive reaction to 
commercial proposition changes.
Customers
Revenues in the bus market principally comprise passenger ticket sales 
and concessionary fare schemes (reimbursements by local authorities 
for passengers entitled to free or reduced fares). Signiﬁcant proportions 
of passengers use bus services for commuting – to work, school, 
college or university – for shopping and for leisure purposes. 
Commercial passenger revenues are typically linked to economic 
activity in a local market. Income may also be generated through 
tendered services. 
Competitors
The UK bus market (outside London) is deregulated and highly 
competitive with more than 1,200 bus operators; we face competition 
in all markets in which we operate. Operators continue to increase 
market share through acquisition and through the year operators have 
both entered and left the market. The main competitor to bus services 
in the UK, however, remains the private car.

Driving growth through attractive 
commercial propositions
With our initial programme of signiﬁcant network changes largely 
completed in the year, the focus is now on the commercial 
opportunities that our empowered local management teams can 
deliver through deploying their resources and adjusting networks, 
timetables and pricing to serve the needs of their markets. During 
the year examples included the introduction of a single brand, the 
Cymru Clipper, covering all our inter-urban services across South 
Wales. In both Bristol and Glasgow we are pleased to be launching 
routes serving major new hospitals, whilst in Manchester the acquisition 
of the Finglands business in the prior year meant that we were able 
to launch a second cross-city service connecting the two major 
universities in the year. We worked closely with a number of local 
authorities to integrate tendered services into commercial networks 
in order to meet passenger needs in the face of reduced Government 
subsidy. In the year we worked closely with Cornwall County Council 
to minimise the impact on customers of the closure of rival operator 
Western Greyhound.
We have also rebased our fares structures throughout the division, 
with the majority of our networks seeing some reductions in prices, 
particularly of period ticket products. With rebased pricing and good 
volume growth, we now have a platform to consider further periodic 
price increases in line with the market across our local networks. 
Our focus remains on offering attractive fares products to deliver 
loyalty and attract new customers. 
During the year we acted on our two major fares consultations in 
Bristol and the West of England and, as a result of the thousands of 
comments received from our customers, the majority of our single fares 
were reduced and ﬂat fares were introduced in the area, with consistent 
child and young person discounts on all products of 50% and 30% 
respectively. We have seen strong results with passenger volumes in 
Bristol up by 19% year-on-year.
We were pleased with the results of the independent Bus Passenger 
Survey, undertaken during the year by Transport Focus, in which we 
equalled our record score of 86% for overall customer satisfaction 
across the country, following a 5 percentage point rise in 2013.  
Our networks in both York and East Scotland were amongst the 
highest scoring of any bus operator, whilst we were particularly 
encouraged by our overall value for money score, which has  
improved by 17 percentage points over two years and is now  
above the national average.
Continuous improvement in operating 
and ﬁnancial performance
Operating discipline, cost optimisation and focused investment in 
our ﬂeets and our people are improving our service delivery while 
increasing customer satisfaction. We delivered cost reductions 
relating to productivity, fuel efﬁciency, procurement, engineering and 
maintenance of approximately £15m during the year. Our drive to 
improve our engineering performance, through investment in ﬂeet 
and depot transformation, has led to decreases in both defects and 
breakdowns with a corresponding increase in service performance. 
However in some areas we have experienced disruption due to road 
repair programmes which has affected punctuality. We work hard with 
local authorities to overcome these issues, and in many instances we 
have redeployed ﬂeet and drivers to help ease the situation. 
Prudent investment in our key assets
We successfully bid for a number of shuttle bus contracts, including 
new Park & Ride sites in Leeds, Taunton, Portsmouth and in York, 
where our ﬂeet now consists of 12 electric buses. In Aberdeen we 
operate our full complement of hydrogen vehicles, partnering with 
numerous organisations including the city council. During the year we 
took delivery of more than 270 Wrightbus StreetLite Micro Hybrid buses, 
which improve fuel efﬁciency by up to 30%, and which we played a 
large part in developing with the manufacturer. After the year end 
we placed a £77 .6m order for 385 vehicles for delivery in 2015/16, with 
more than 90% ﬁtted with Euro 6 engines, the biggest investment in 
such lower emission engines in the UK to date. The buses will be ﬁtted 
with free Wi-Fi and we will trial USB charging points on some vehicles. 
During the year we introduced mobile ticketing onto all of our networks, 
and take up of this new sales channel has been encouraging. We are 
seeing particularly good growth in student markets, where we invested 
in promotion at the beginning of the academic year. The development 
and marketing of our apps, with period products enabled, gives us 
a strong base to offer more ticket products on this platform. 
Our UK Bus division worked with manufacturer Wrightbus 
to develop the most fuel efﬁcient bus on the market – the 
StreetLite Micro Hybrid, which began to be introduced into 
our ﬂeet in 2014. Each is equipped with leather seats, free 
Wi-Fi for customers and extra room for wheelchairs and 
passengers with buggies. They are also ﬁtted with the latest 
technology which captures energy during braking which 
can then be used later to power other parts of the bus. The 
micro hybrid buses are also lighter than conventional single

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 34 We are also playing a leading role to deliver the industry commitment 
to launch multi-operator smart ticketing across the city regions in 
England by December 2015. During the year smartcard schemes 
were launched in West Yorkshire, Hampshire and Bristol, and these 
will continue to develop further going forward.
Responsible partnerships with our customers 
and communities
We continue to explore opportunities to work in closer partnership 
with local authorities in all of our markets, as our objective to get more 
people onto buses typically aligns very well with their ambition to 
reduce congestion and stimulate economic activity. Our approach 
complements the Government’s ‘Northern Powerhouse’ agenda, 
a focus for many of the local markets in which we operate. Across 
all our networks we are actively promoting enhanced partnership 
arrangements, building on the success we have had in South Yorkshire 
– where passenger volumes in both Shefﬁeld and Rotherham have 
risen strongly since partnerships were introduced. 
We were key transport partners for a number of high proﬁle events 
during the year and were particularly delighted to be Ofﬁcial Supporter 
– Passenger Transport Services to the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth 
Games. We also provided shuttle buses for the Ryder Cup golf 
tournament at Gleneagles in September. We are a sponsor of Bristol 
European Green Capital 2015, and are partnering with the city on 
events and logistics throughout the year while trialling a number of 
sustainable technologies and processes.
Future priorities
While there is still some way to go, we are delivering our turnaround 
plan as forecasted to restore double digit margins to UK Bus by the 
end of 2017 , which will be achieved from a continuation of our efforts to 
drive increased volume, coupled with market-based yield enhancement 
and continuing cost efﬁciencies. We believe that our strategy, which is 
based on delivering a competitive customer proposition coupled with 
improved operating discipline and strong partnerships with local 
authorities, is the most responsive, efﬁcient and cost-effective way to 
deliver the outcomes that bus passengers and taxpayers want and 
we will continue to promote this strategy going forwards. By tailoring 
our actions to local market conditions in the light of the progress each 
part of our business has made through our turnaround plan, we will 
continue to create a business focused on passenger needs with 
engaged local management, delivering increasingly attractive services 
at competitive prices. 
Outlook
We expect our transformation plan to deliver further volume growth 
in 2015/16, and now that many parts of our business have passed 
the anniversary of our fare rebasing actions, revenue growth is also 
expected to beneﬁt from positive yield from periodic price increases in 
line with the market. Operating leverage from this growth, coupled with 
our cost efﬁciency programmes, are expected to ensure that we will 
make further progress during 2015/16 towards our medium term target 
of double digit margins.

city centre and bus services for all client groups during the 
Games including athletes, technical ofﬁcials and the 
media. UK Bus also provided around 260 coaches during 
The 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, transporting Ryder 
Cup ofﬁcials, the media, sponsors and VIPs. We also 
ran coaches for most of the event’s hospitality packages.

four days by the time golf’s most popular event came 
to a close.

Market overview
One of the UK’ s most experienced rail 
operators, carrying around 280m passengers 
and operating over a ﬁfth of the UK’ s 
passenger rail network in the year.
Since rail franchising began 
we have built up expertise and 
experience running every type 
of network, which gives us 
conﬁdence that we will grow 
our franchise portfolio through 
disciplined bidding over time. 
Dave Gausby
Interim Managing Director, UK Rail Market review and trends
Passenger rail services are primarily provided by private train operating 
companies through franchises awarded by the relevant authority, 
but may also be provided on an ‘open access’ basis. Operators are 
responsible for the day-to-day management and operation of train 
services. Many elements of the service provided to passengers are 
mandated as part of the franchise contract and others are left to 
commercial judgement. Total franchised passenger revenues in the 
UK are more than £9bn per annum. Rail tracks and infrastructure 
(signalling and some major stations) are owned and managed by 
Network Rail. Operators typically lease rolling stock from 
leasing companies.
Passenger growth across the industry continues to increase year on 
year, and recently reached a post-war high of 1.6bn. The Government 
continues to invest in infrastructure and new rolling stock across the 
country to maintain performance and meet passengers’ requirements 
on the increasingly congested network. Innovations such as smart 
ticketing, social media and mobile phone technology continue to be 
incorporated across the sector. Closer working relationships between 
Network Rail, regulators and train operating companies continue to 
be positively encouraged by Government in order to facilitate these 
infrastructure upgrades and innovations. During the year the 
Department for Transport (DfT) has continued to progress its 
competition timetable, with a number of third generation franchises 
being awarded.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 36 Financial performance
Our UK Rail division continues to beneﬁt from robust growth in 
passenger volumes, with like-for-like passenger revenue increasing 
by 6.7% during the year, at the top end of our expectations. On a 
reported basis revenues declined to £2,207 . 1m (2014: £2,870. 1m), 
reﬂecting a reduction in First ScotRail subsidy (with a matching 
reduction in track access charges, so does not affect operating proﬁt), 
the end of revenue support arrangements in First Great Western and 
First Capital Connect, and the completion of the First Capital Connect 
franchise at the end of the ﬁrst half. Adjusted operating proﬁt was 
£7 4. 1m (2014: £55.2m), representing a margin of 3.4% (2014: 1.9%), 
in part reﬂecting First Great Western moving to normal commercial 
terms part way through last year. Like-for-like passenger volumes 
increased by 4.2% in the year.
Our strengths
Significant participant in the UK rail market since 
privatisation
Experienced in running every type of passenger rail 
operation – intercity, regional, commuter, sleeper and open access
Strong commercial, rolling stock and major infrastructure 
upgrade project capabilities
Highly experienced management team – with a strong 
record of operational delivery and disciplined bidding.
Customers
Rail markets differ but are generally categorised into three sectors: 
London and south east commuter services; regional; and long distance. 
In addition, certain networks also offer sleeper services. Parts of the 
First Great Western franchise fall into all four categories, though 
it and First Hull Trains have a large proportion of long distance and 
leisure travellers. First TransPennine Express and First ScotRail carry 
a large number of commuters into the major towns and cities on their 
networks, and also serve a signiﬁcant leisure market, while First Capital 
Connect passengers were principally commuters to and from London.
Competitors
The main competitor to rail services in the UK is the private car. We 
also face competition on some of our passenger ﬂows from other rail 
services and, to a lesser extent, from long distance coach services and 
airlines. Our UK Rail division bids for franchises against other operators 
of current UK rail franchises and public transport operators from 
other countries.
Market attractions
 More than £9bn of long term contract-backed passenger revenue

continued
Focused and disciplined bidding
During the year the DfT has made progress in line with its UK rail 
refranchising timetable originally announced in March 2013 and 
updated periodically since then. As part of this timetable, we were 
pleased to sign two agreements in March 2015 with the DfT, 
securing First Great Western for up to four and a half more years 
and First TransPennine Express for an additional year. As a result we 
will continue to run our largest franchise First Great Western to at least 
1 April 2019, with a further extension of up to one year at the DfT’s 
discretion. This underscores the DfT’s conﬁdence in our ability to 
deliver stability, good value and better services for our passengers 
during the period in which the Great Western Mainline modernisation 
programme is being implemented. The programme involves signiﬁcant 
upgrades to infrastructure including signalling and electriﬁcation, which 
will allow for new or refurbished trains on every part of the network, 
resulting in more frequent and faster journeys and an increase in the 
number of seats over the period to the end of the decade. We will also 
be running First TransPennine Express to the start of the next 
competitive franchise, expected on 1 April 2016 (the contract includes 
an extension clause of up to 1 1 months at the DfT’s discretion). As one 
of three shortlisted bidders for that competition, we submitted our bid 
proposal at the end of May. The new franchise is due to be awarded in 
October 2015.
Naturally we were disappointed not to secure any of the franchise 
competition awards announced in the year. As a result two of our 
franchises ended during the year, with First Capital Connect and 
First ScotRail being handed over to their new operators on 14 
September 2014 and 1 April 2015 respectively. Our approach to 
bidding for UK rail franchises has been and will continue to be 
disciplined, aiming to deliver ambitious improvements for passengers 
and appropriate returns for shareholders, at an acceptable level of risk.
Continuous improvement in operating 
and ﬁnancial performance
Our operating companies have continued to outperform the industry 
in delivering punctuality and customer satisfaction improvements since 
2006, despite some signiﬁcant infrastructure challenges over that time. 
We pioneered closer partnership working with Network Rail and other 
industry participants to deliver infrastructure upgrade projects whilst 
minimising disruption for passengers, expertise which is increasingly 
vital as the Government’s reinvestment in the national rail infrastructure 
continues to increase over the coming years. One of the largest such 
programmes is the £7 .5bn Great Western Mainline upgrade, where 
First Great Western will continue to support the substantial infrastructure 
upgrade work taking place throughout the network, as well as 
preparations for the introduction of the InterCity Express Programme, 
Crossrail and a new ﬂeet of local electric trains. In the year, the £895m 
Reading area remodelling project saw the entry into operation of a 
new viaduct, substantially increasing capacity at a major network 
bottleneck, and the reopening of the upgraded Reading station itself. 
The overall project remains a year ahead of schedule thanks in part to 
excellent partnership working across the industry. First Capital Connect 
supported the preparations for the Class 700 train ﬂeet introduction 
during the year as part of the £6bn Thameslink Programme. First 
TransPennine Express began operating new trains and an upgraded 
timetable in May 2014, delivering 90,000 extra seats per week, 
beneﬁting from the Government’s North of England electriﬁcation 
projects, part of a national investment of more than £1bn in the North’s 
railways, and helping central and local government achieve its vision for 
a ‘Northern Powerhouse’. 
Prudent investment in our key assets
We continue to innovate and invest in our service offerings for 
passengers. First Great Western has reconﬁgured its carriages to 
deliver 3,000 more peak time standard class seats into Paddington 
station per day. As part of the project, the ﬁrst class experience on 
First Great Western has been upgraded and additional Pullman 
dining services introduced. First Great Western has also invested 
in additional customer-facing employees on long distance routes.
During the year we continued to progress the roll out of free Wi-Fi 
services both on-train and in-station throughout the First Great Western 
and First ScotRail networks, while First Hull Trains won innovation 
awards for its free 4G single-sign-up Wi-Fi service. First ScotRail has 
also rolled out smart ticketing-enabled equipment at more than 300 
stations during the year, the largest such project in the UK, and the 
Fine dining on trains has returned as First Great Western 
offers a Pullman menu for selected trains that run between 
London and Swansea and the South West. In 2013 we 
promised to ﬁll our menu with as many products sourced 
from as close to the railway line as possible. Now almost 
90 locally made products have replaced their mass-market 
counterparts – up from 50 since we launched the initiative. 
The menu includes award-winning produce from a third 
generation family butcher, fourth generation family baker 
and ﬁfth generation family cheese maker. On the new 
trains to be introduced from summer 2017, hot food will 
be available at seat to passengers in all classes of travel.

achieving the UK’s most recognised employee investment award.
Responsible partnerships with our customers 
and communities
In the latest Transport Focus survey (completed during the autumn) 
First ScotRail, First Great Western and First Hull Trains achieved year- 
on-year improvements in overall customer satisfaction, while First 
TransPennine Express saw a decrease related to service issues after 
introduction of the new timetable, which have since been rectiﬁed. 
During the year First TransPennine Express was the ﬁrst train operating 
company to win the British Quality Foundation UK Excellence Award, 
which recognises high performing businesses as assessed against the 
European Foundation for Quality Management model. First Great 
Western succeeded First ScotRail as Rail Business of the Year at the 
national Rail Business Awards, while both First Hull Trains and First 
TransPennine Express were runners-up for Best Train Operator. First 
Great Western also received a special award jointly with Network Rail, 
recognising their response to the collapse of the sea wall at Dawlish.
Future priorities
We have been actively involved in the UK rail industry since privatisation 
and have a breadth of experience and expertise in running every type 
of network. Our management team has been involved in some of the 
highest proﬁle infrastructure and rolling stock upgrade programmes 
of recent years, experiences that are increasingly important as 
reinvestment in the national rail network continues to gather pace 
over the coming years. Having secured First Great Western until at 
least March 2019, we have a strong position in rail to build on over 
the medium term. Approximately two thirds of the UK rail network 
by passenger revenue is expected to be refranchised over the next 
ﬁve years, and our approach to these competitions will continue to 
be disciplined. We will examine each franchise on its merits and decide 
whether it presents an opportunity to deliver ambitious improvements 
for passengers and appropriate returns for shareholders, at an 
acceptable level of risk.
Outlook
In the year ahead we expect our ongoing rail operations (First Great 
Western, First TransPennine Express and First Hull Trains) to deliver 
solid revenue growth underpinned by continued increases in passenger 
volumes. However, UK Rail’s contribution to Group earnings will be 
substantially lower in 2015/16 following the end of the First Capital 
Connect and First ScotRail franchises. Having submitted our proposal 
for the TransPennine Express franchise in May 2015, we look forward 
to the announcement of the competition winner in October. We were 
recently shortlisted for the East Anglia competition, and we will examine 
the other upcoming franchise competition opportunities in the DfT’s 
timetable before determining whether to proceed with a bid.
Two thirds of DfT franchise 
revenues yet to be awarded 
in the current cycle… 
…representing around £6bn

Following our agreement with the DfT to operate First 
Great Western in the coming years, we will continue to 
support the introduction of the new Super Express trains 
from Summer 2017. These trains will offer more capacity 
and faster, more frequent services for communities in 
London, the Thames Valley, the South West, Cotswolds 
and Wales. The trains will be painted in a livery that draws 
on the heritage of the route, ﬁtting for an extensive £7.5bn 
investment programme, the largest since Brunel.

Strategic report Corporate responsibility
We understand the vital role we play in creating  
strong, vibrant and sustainable local economies,  
and have continued to deliver our commitments  
to our people, customers and communities  
throughout the year. 
In line with the trend for integrated reporting, in this section we highlight 
our corporate responsibility priorities and performance this year. Further 
information can be found in the Responsibility section of our website. 
Our approach
Our long term success is built on being a responsible partner to all of 
our stakeholders. We are leveraging our scale and global expertise 
to address our social, economic and environmental impacts, and 
investing time, energy and capital in what matters to our stakeholders. 
We are already innovating through the use of low carbon vehicle 
technologies, ﬁnding new ways to meet changing customer 
expectations, doing more with fewer resources and investing in the 
future potential of our people and our communities. We know we can 
only create value and deliver sustainable returns to our shareholders 
if our services help to create strong, vibrant and sustainable local 
economies where we are the provider of choice for our customers 
and the communities we serve.
We benchmark ourselves against our peers across all sectors and 
learn from best practice through expert networks and groups. In 
2014/15, we were members of Business in the Community, Forum for 
the Future, the Mercer Vanguard Diversity Network, and the London 
Benchmarking Group, whose steering group we joined in April 2014.
We also measure our performance annually through sustainability 
benchmarks and indices. We are pleased to report that our 2014/15 
FTSE Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) rating made us 
a leading scorer in the Travel and Leisure supersector, and we are 
a longstanding constituent of the FTSE4Good Index series.
In 2014/15 we maintained ISO 14001 accreditation for environmental 
management across our UK operations, and ISO 50001 for energy 
management in UK Rail, as well as the triple Carbon Trust Standard, 
and we are working towards embedding the principles of BS 8903 
for sustainable procurement into our UK procurement practices.
This year we have focused on enhancing our non-ﬁnancial reporting 
processes, most notably by implementing the award-winning software 
platform CRedit360, which will allow us to capture and analyse a wide 
range of environmental, community and other non-ﬁnancial business 
data across the Group from 2016 onwards.
Valuing our people
The way we work is based on our clear vision and the ﬁrm foundation 
of our strong common values. Over the last 12 months, we have 
continued to invest in the development of our people and reinvigorated 
our approach to employee engagement with an increased emphasis 
on employee development. 
Employee engagement
We recognise the value of engaging our people. An engaged workforce 
delivers better customer experiences and higher levels of productivity. 
Our 15 percentage point increase in engagement scores over the past 
four years demonstrates our determination to improve in this area. 
This year we expanded the remit of our employee engagement expert 
group, which aims to identify, share and embed best practice at every 
stage of an employee’s journey with us. Over the last year, this group 
has listened to the views of people from across our businesses, 
implemented best practice guides, videos and other toolkits, and 
radically improved the way we recruit and retain the best people.
Our year-on-year increases in employee engagement, as measured 
through our ‘Your Voice’ employee survey, have continued in 2014/15 
with a number of divisions and functions exceeding the national norm 
for engagement for the ﬁrst time. All divisions continue to focus on 
improving levels of employee engagement, with our Greyhound division 
being listed for the ﬁrst time in the Forbes magazine ‘America’s Best 
Employers’ list, at number 105. 
We also continue to enhance employee well-being through our 
‘Live well, Be well, Work well’ health campaigns in the UK, and 
our ‘Route to Better Health’ campaigns in North America.
Diversity and inclusion
We have around 1 10,000 employees from all over the world, with a 
great breadth of backgrounds, ideas and talents. It is these unique 
skills and experiences that make us what we are. The more varied our 
workforce, the broader our expertise and the greater our opportunities 
for innovation and success. We are committed to equality of 
opportunity, diversity and inclusion at every level. 
In 2014/15, we developed a clear and concise FirstGroup policy that 
outlines our principles and commitments for equality, diversity and 
inclusion, and a supporting framework which includes training content, 
promotional videos and a poster campaign. Focus groups have been 
held to discuss the policy and these have helped us understand the 
challenges our people face. Transport is not traditionally a diverse 
sector, but our plans are designed to address this in a systematic way 
over the coming years.
Developing our people
In early 2014 we launched a new Performance Management and 
Development framework that provides a clear line of sight to our vision, 
strategy and values for everyone throughout the Group. In support 
of the framework is our Dynamic Performance and Development 
programme. This is a series of face-to-face and online workshops 
around topics identiﬁed as important by our managers, including ‘Great 
feedback’, ‘Courageous conversations’ and ‘Performance coaching’. 
So far more than 10,000 delegates have attended our workshops, 
and nearly 90% of attendees report they will be able to apply what 
they have learnt and would recommend the training to others.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 40 In the UK, we have signiﬁcantly enhanced our ability to attract great 
people to work for us from the communities we serve, thanks to our 
new job applicant tracking system, which processed more than 
75,000 completed job applications and 3,000 successful hires in 
2014/15. The system has streamlined our processes internally, 
and provides a seamless experience for job applicants and hiring 
managers. Following this success, we are now introducing this 
system into our North American businesses.
Our integrated talent and succession plan identiﬁes our top talent 
and determines development opportunities. The plan aims to make 
the most of our leaders and minimise continuity risks, and supports the 
retention and engagement of these key people. Over the next year we 
will develop regional planning processes so that our people may be 
placed into the global roles where we believe they will have the biggest 
impact. Enhancing the degree of integration and placing key talent in 
roles regardless of geography will help leverage our scale and expertise 
around the Group to support our growth over the longer term.
We provide access to a wide range of courses and accredited 
qualiﬁcations for our employees, including adult apprenticeships. 
Across our UK Bus and UK Rail divisions this year, 85 young people 
(16-25 year olds) enrolled in our full time apprenticeships in engineering, 
customer service, operations and management roles. 
Our graduate scheme is a two-year development programme 
preparing our graduate entrants to successfully step into management 
roles in the commercial, engineering and operations areas of our 
business. Each year, we calculate the number of graduates we 
take on so that we ensure a steady ﬂow of new talent moving into 
management posts. Our 2013 cohort of 14 graduates is more than 
half way through its second year, and our 2014 intake of 18 follows 
them and will be joined by a new cohort in September 2015.
Dedicated to safety
Always front of mind, safety is our way of life. We continue to 
reinvigorate our safety programmes to build on the progress and 
momentum of previous years, and to meet our goal of eliminating 
serious injuries and fatalities.
Sadly there was one employee fatality this year in First Student, and one 
passenger fatality in UK Bus. The impact of tragic incidents that occur in 
the course of our business, such as these, cannot be overestimated and 
reafﬁrms the importance we attach to our goal.
We are never complacent and always look to improve. In December 
2014, colleagues from across the Group came together to share best 
practice and learn from leading experts at our Group Safety Conference, 
focusing on the science of behaviour change for safety. We also 
relaunched our Injury Prevention database this year and introduced a 
new mobile app to help record injury prevention conversations and tours. 
Over the next year our focus will be on delivering ‘Be Safe’ , the Group’s 
safety culture transformation programme. Our aim is to reinforce safety 
as a personal core value of each of our employees, delivering an even 
stronger culture and climate of safety across all of our operations.
Leadership on safety comes from the top through our Executive Safety 
Committee. This is chaired by the Chief Executive, and meets on a 
monthly basis to review the Group’s safety performance and practices, 
and to approve Group safety policies and procedures. Our Board 
Safety Committee reviews the safety performance of the Group on 
We partnered with the Confederation of Passenger 
Transport and other operators to trial a new smartphone 
app for blind and visually impaired passengers. The app 
provides users with real-time audio and visual alert 
notiﬁcations, direct to their handset. It means passengers 
know exactly where they are on a journey and at which 
stop to get off. The app was available during an eight week 
pilot in Leeds and offered easy-to-use route maps, as well 
as next service information and a facility to save favourite 
and frequently used stops and bus routes. If the results 
of the trial prove successful then the app has the potential 
to revolutionise bus travel for the blind and visually 
impaired community.

Greener, cleaner futures for our communities
We take a systematic approach to managing our impacts on the 
environment, with Group-wide policies, standards and robust targets 
for our most material impacts, including energy and climate change, air 
emissions, waste and water. Notably, we generate a signiﬁcant amount 
of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (a major contributor to climate 
change) through our operations. More than 94% of our emissions 
come from powering our road and rail ﬂeets (with the remainder 
primarily from energy use in our buildings), so our climate change 
mitigation strategy is focused on innovation and investment in energy 
efﬁciency and low carbon vehicle technology.
In late 2014, we successfully achieved triple certiﬁcation to the Carbon 
Trust Standard for reducing carbon emissions, water use and waste 
across our UK operations. The certiﬁcation recognises our efforts to 
reduce our impacts year on year through greater efﬁciencies in energy 
and fuel use, improving waste disposal, the ﬁtting of water-saving 
controls, a programme of leak repairs, and rainwater harvesting. This 
year we also continued to see improvement in our Carbon Disclosure 
Project score, which has increased by 43% since 2012 and is well 
above our industry’s average, highlighting our commitment to climate 
change mitigation, adaptation and transparency.
Our 2015 carbon footprint
The table below provides a summary of the emissions for which we 
are responsible. Our absolute carbon emissions (adjusted to remove 
First Capital Connect, which we no longer operate) increased by 0.83% 
this year to 2,675,664 tonnes of CO 2(e). This 2.42% reduction against 
our 2010/1 1 baseline is a result of our ongoing focus on fuel efﬁciency. 
Our normalised emissions increased by 5.95% to 464 tonnes of CO 2(e) 
per £1m of revenue (a 0.09% increase against our 2010/1 1 baseline), 
driven primarily by changes in our revenue ﬁgures this year. 
 Performance against longer term carbon reduction targets for individual 
divisions (per passenger or vehicle kilometre against a 2010/1 1 
baseline) has been mixed. UK Rail is slightly behind target overall, with 
performance varying across the division. First Transit is slightly behind 
target, due to changes in the ﬂeet mix requested by customers, whilst 
UK Bus, First Student and Greyhound are making good progress. 
We will set new targets within our climate change strategy in 2016.
As part of this strategy, we have continued to introduce bio-methane, 
electric, and hydrogen fuel cell powered buses to our road ﬂeets this 
year, as well as highly fuel efﬁcient StreetLite Micro Hybrid buses, which 
hold Low Carbon Emission Bus Certiﬁcation in the UK. We have also 
invested in new vehicles that meet 2010 EPA emissions standards in 
North America, and have retroﬁtted technology to existing ﬂeets, such 
as more fuel efﬁcient engines, gearboxes and cooling systems. We also 
continue to use driver advisory systems in our bus and rail ﬂeets to 
optimise fuel efﬁciency through driving style.
We know that local air quality is also important to our communities 
so we continue to invest in cleaner ﬂeets, and are working to ensure 
that the most efﬁcient buses are utilised the most. For example, over 
80% of our annual UK Bus mileage is completed using vehicles ﬁtted 
with engines at Euro 3 standard or higher.
Our performance and plans around our wider environmental impacts, 
including waste, water and local air emissions will be available in the 
Responsibility section of our website in the summer of 2015.

been independently veriﬁed by Carbon Credentials Energy Services Ltd and 
is covered by an assurance report which is available in full on our website. 
Veriﬁcation activities were performed in accordance with ISO 14064-3:2006.
Scope 1 – direct emissions from vehicle fuel usage (owned and leased), fugitive 
refrigerant gases and heating fuels used in buildings.
Scope 2 – indirect emissions from electricity used in our buildings and to power 
our electric rail ﬂeet.
Scope 3 – indirect emissions from First Rail Support and business travel by air.
Out of scope – emissions from burning biofuels in our vehicles in our UK Bus 
division, reported in line with DEFRA reporting guidelines.
Our reporting follows the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard, applying the operating control approach to our organisational 
reporting boundary with a materiality threshold set at 5%. We have reported 
all material emission sources using the following emission factors:
 DEFRA/DECC UK Government conversion factors for GHG Company 
Reporting 2014
 World Resources Institute (2008) GHG Protocol tool for Mobile Combustion, 
Version 2.3
 World Resources Institute (2008) GHG Protocol tool for stationary 
combustion, Version 4.0.
The reporting period is deﬁned as 1 April to 31 March, in line with the Group’s 
ﬁnancial year. However, emissions from energy consumption within buildings in 
our North American operations are reported by calendar year due to the current 
availability of consumption data. In addition, scope 2 emissions from electricity 
consumption in North America were calculated using CO2 and not CO2(e) due 
to limited conversion factors being available.
Our carbon emissions have been recalculated (back to our baseline year) to 
reﬂect that we no longer operate the First Capital Connect rail franchise (as of 
14 September 2014) in line with our Base Year Recalculation Policy. Revenue 
ﬁgures have also been recalculated to reﬂect this change for the purposes of 
reporting our normalised carbon footprint (tonnes of CO2(e) per £1m revenue). 
This year we have quantiﬁed and reported fugitive refrigerant emissions from air 
conditioning systems within our North American vehicle ﬂeets and from buildings 
in UK Bus. We are taking steps to report fugitive emissions from UK Rail next year.
The Company’s baseline year is 2010/11. The same baseline year is also used 
in FirstGroup’s climate change strategy, which contains the Group’s carbon 
reduction strategy and targets for 2015/16.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 42 Helping our communities to prosper
With our knowledge of local issues, strengthened by our wider expertise 
and skills, our ambition is to be the preferred partner of the communities 
we serve. 
Community engagement
We believe that excellence in community engagement is critical to 
sustaining and improving the long term partnerships we have with 
our key stakeholders, including our customers, government and 
political stakeholders, industry partners, and all those within our local 
communities. This year we rolled out a consistent framework for 
community engagement, supported by best practice tools and case 
studies, to more than 2,000 managers across the Group through training 
and orientation sessions, and through cross-divisional collaboration 
meetings. We also launched our new stakeholder survey, which will 
allow us to benchmark and monitor our success in engaging with our 
communities in a consistent way across the Group on an annual basis.
Community investment
One of the ways we engage with our communities is by developing long 
term partnerships with charitable organisations. Our programmes focus 
on those areas where we believe we can deploy our scale and expertise 
to achieve the greatest impact and deliver the maximum shared value to 
our business and local communities. This year we contributed almost 
£1.7m to our communities across the UK and North America, as 
measured by the London Benchmarking Group model. Our employees 
across the Group gave over 3,600 hours of volunteer time, and more 
than 1,500 organisations have beneﬁted from our support. This has 
included our Green Grants scheme in partnership with The Forestry 
Commission in First TransPennine Express, our support for National 
Runaway Safeline’s Home Free Program in Greyhound, and UK Bus’s 
work with the Ahead Partnership on their Make the Grade project, 
providing coaching and support to prepare for the world of work to 
pupils of Roundhay School in Leeds.
Our UK Charity of Choice partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support 
drew to a close this year, with a total partnership value of £1, 122m in the 
three years to 31 March 2015. Our new UK Charity of Choice partnership 
with Prostate Cancer UK was launched in April 2015 following an 
employee vote in late 2014. We will continue to support our communities 
and our employees in their charitable efforts over the coming year.
Human Rights
FirstGroup recognises all human rights as deﬁned in the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and supports the principles 
set out in the International Labour Organization Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises established by the Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD). Our Corporate Responsibility 
Policy (available on our website) is aimed at translating that support into 
guidelines and standards that set a common approach for the Group 
and provide practical guidance for our managers and employees on 
the ground. We are committed to ensuring that our operations do not 
infringe human rights, in particular: 
 We will conduct every aspect of our business with honesty, 
integrity and openness, respecting human rights and the interests 
of our employees, customers and third parties, as detailed in our 
Code of Business Ethics
 We are committed to creating and maintaining a safe and healthy 
working environment for our employees, customers and the 
community. We recognise our employees’ rights to freedom of 
association and have a high degree of unionisation across our 
businesses both in the UK and North America
 Through our procurement processes (enshrined in our Supplier 
Code of Conduct, and Procurement and Supplier Management 
Policy), we seek to ensure that goods and services are from 
sources that do not jeopardise human rights, safety or the 
environment, and expect suppliers to adhere to business 
principles consistent with our own.
Bristol, under Mayor George Ferguson, is the ﬁrst UK city to 
be awarded European Green Capital status, which over the 
course of 2015 will showcase the city as a sustainable place 
to live and work. As the leading transport operator in Bristol, 
FirstGroup is proud to be supporting Bristol European Green 
Capital 2015 as an ofﬁcial partner. We are investing in 
sustainable technologies at First Great Western’s St Philips 
Marsh train depot and using innovative driver technology 
and techniques to improve fuel efﬁciency and cut emissions, 
all with the aim of making Bristol a truly sustainable place 
to live. Over the course of the year, First West of England 
will be putting 39 brand new buses into service in Bristol. 
These will be the cleanest diesel vehicles yet seen in the 
city, meeting the latest Euro 6 emissions speciﬁcation.

Strategic report Principal risks and uncertainties
Our risk management approach
We have a well-established risk management methodology which we 
use throughout the business to allow us to identify and manage the 
principal risks that could:
 adversely impact the safety or security of the Group’s employees, 
customers and/or assets
 have a material impact on the financial or operational performance 
of the Group
 impede achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives and 
financial targets; and/or
 adversely impact the Group’s reputation or stakeholder 
expectations.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal 
control. Following publication of the revised UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the recent Financial Reporting Council Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting, a review of the Group’s risk management framework will be 
undertaken in 2016.
Risk management structure
Whilst some risks such as fuel costs and treasury risk are managed 
at a Group level, all of our businesses own and manage the risks 
they face with appropriate assistance from the Group functions 
as necessary. 
The current structure is as follows:
Responsibility
The Board has overall 
responsibility for the Group’s 
systems of internal control and 
their effectiveness.
The Audit Committee has a 
speciﬁc responsibility to review 
and validate the systems of risk 
management and internal control.
The Risk Group has oversight of 
the Group’s risk management 
processes.
Internal Audit provide assurance 
on the key risk mitigating controls 
and ensure that the audit plan is 
appropriately risk-based.
Business division and Group 
function management have 
responsibility for the identiﬁcation 
and management of risks, 
developing appropriate mitigating 
actions and the maintenance of 
risk registers.
Process
Review and conﬁrmation of Group 
and divisional risks presented to 
the Board and Audit Committee.
The Risk Group and Internal Audit 
review and challenge Group and 
divisional risk submissions.
Facilitated by the Risk Group, 
divisional and Group risk 
champions maintain and 
update risk registers for their 
function or division. Risks and 
mitigating actions are monitored 
through normal business 
management processes.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 44 Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group’s principal risks are set out below. These risks have been  
assessed taking into account their potential impact, the likelihood of 
occurrence and any change to this compared to the prior year and the 
residual risk after the implementation of controls. Each risk is linked to 
the relevant strategic objectives, which are detailed on page 14. 
Further information on our risk management processes is contained 
in the Corporate governance report on pages 58 to 75.

Economic conditions 1
 
2
 
3
 
Economic conditions affect our businesses in different ways. 
A downturn could have a negative impact on our businesses in terms of 
reduced demand and reduced opportunities for growth or to retain or 
secure new business. The same factors could also affect our key suppliers. 
An improving economic climate, particularly when combined with lower 
fuel prices, may result in reduced demand for public transportation in our 
Greyhound business as alternative modes of transport become relatively 
more affordable. 
Improving economic conditions may also result in a tightening of labour 
markets resulting in employee shortages or pressure to increase pay.
Whilst economic 
conditions have 
generally improved in 
our markets, in some 
areas economic 
recovery has been 
varied, for example 
in some of our local 
UK Bus markets.
To an extent, our UK Bus and Greyhound operating 
companies are able to modify services to react to 
economic impacts.
An applicant tracking system has been 
introduced in our UK divisions to streamline the 
recruitment process and assist in providing 
a suitable pool of drivers to help manage any 
shortages in an efﬁcient and cost-effective way. 
A similar system is being rolled out in our North 
American divisions.
Political and regulatory issues 2
 
3
 
4
 
5
Our businesses are all subject to numerous laws and regulations covering a 
wide range of matters including health and safety, equipment, employment 
(including working time, wage and hour, mandatory breaks and holiday pay), 
competition and anti-trust, data protection and security, bribery and 
corruption, environmental (including carbon and air emissions), insurance 
coverage, consumer protection, and other operational issues. Failure to 
comply could have ﬁnancial or reputational implications, could result in 
increased litigation and claims and have a negative impact on the Group’s 
ability to bid for new contracts.
These laws and regulations are constantly subject to change, the impact 
of which could include increased compliance costs and/or a reduction in 
operational ﬂexibility or efﬁciency.
Political risk remains an issue, particularly in the UK where the new 
Government is proposing to devolve powers for cities to regulate bus 
services in their area. Any such regulation could impact the proﬁtability 
of our operations or impose additional costs or operating constraints.
Our businesses are at 
risk from further political 
and regulatory change.
The Group has embedded operating policies and 
procedures in all of our businesses to ensure 
compliance with existing legislation and regulation.
The Group has dedicated legal teams in the UK 
and North America who oversee the Group’s 
compliance and training programmes and 
advise on emerging issues.
The Group actively engages with the relevant 
government and transport bodies and policy 
makers to help ensure that we are properly 
positioned to respond to any proposed changes.
Strategic objectives
1 Focused and disciplined bidding in our contract businesses
2 Driving growth through attractive commercial propositions in our  
passenger revenue businesses
3 Continuous improvement in operating and ﬁnancial performance
4 Prudent investment in our key assets (ﬂeets, systems and people)
5 Maintain responsible partnerships with our customers and communities

Contracted businesses 1
 
3
 
5
 
The Group’s First Student, First Transit and UK Rail divisions are contracted 
businesses dependent on the ability to renew and secure new contract wins 
on profitable terms. Failure to do so would result in reduced revenue and 
profitability and incorrect modelling or bid assumptions could lead to greater 
than anticipated costs or losses. 
Failure to comply with contract terms could result in termination, litigation and 
financial penalties and failure to win new or non-renewal of existing contracts.
No material change 
during the year.
The relevant divisions have experienced and 
dedicated bid teams who undertake careful 
economic modelling of contract bids and, 
where possible, seek to negotiate risk sharing 
arrangements with the relevant customer or 
contracting authority.
Competition  1
 
2
 
3
 
All of the Group’s businesses (both contracted and non-contracted) 
compete in the areas of pricing and service and face competition from 
a number of sources.
Our main competitors include the private car and existing and new public 
and private transport operators across all our markets. 
Increased competition can result in lost business, revenue and 
reduced profitability.
No material change 
during the year.
The Group continues to focus on service quality 
and performance as priorities in making our 
services attractive to passengers and other 
customers. 
In our contract businesses, contract compliance, 
a competitive bidding strategy and a strong 
bidding team are key. 
In addition, wherever possible, the Group works 
with local and national bodies to promote 
measures aimed at increasing demand for public 
transport and the other services that we offer.
Information technology  2
 
3
 
4
 
5
The Group relies on information technology in all aspects of our businesses. 
Any significant disruption or failure, caused by external factors, denial of 
service, computer viruses or human error could result in a service interruption, 
accident or misappropriation of confidential information (including credit card 
and personal data). Process failure, security breach or other operational 
difficulties may also lead to revenue loss or increased costs, fines, penalties 
or additional insurance requirements. Prolonged failure of our sales websites 
could also adversely affect revenues.
Continued successful delivery and implementation of the Greyhound IT 
transformation plan is required to improve yield management and drive 
future growth.
Failure to manage the implementation of new IT systems properly may result 
in increased costs and/or lost revenue.
Web and mobile sales 
channels are of 
increasing importance 
across many of our 
businesses.
As a result of the continuing threat of cyber-attacks, 
our operations are implementing new threat 
detection systems.
The Group has also increased its focus on asset 
management and further enhanced its IT security 
processes and procedures during the year. 
The Group has further strengthened its IT project 
management capability during the year, particularly 
within Greyhound.
Rail franchises/bidding  1
 
3
 
5
 
Competition for new rail franchises is intense. We bid against operators of 
current UK rail franchises and rail operators from other countries, principally 
from within the European Union. Whilst our current UK rail franchises have 
been extended, failure to win franchises in the future will result in a lower 
UK Rail division contribution and profitability.
Rail franchises are large and complex arrangements and incorrect modelling or 
bid assumptions could lead to greater than anticipated costs or losses. Breach 
of the Group’s existing franchise agreements could potentially result in their 
termination causing loss of revenue and cash flow as well as some or all of 
the amounts set aside as security for performance and season ticket bonds.
The new First Great Western franchise will cover a period during which there 
will be significant change in the franchise including major infrastructure work, 
electrification and re-signalling as well as the introduction of new trains, which 
will require careful planning and management. Failure to manage these risks 
adequately in accordance with our plans could result in financial and reputational 
risk to the Group.
Direct awards have 
been made in the year 
to extend the First 
TransPennine Express 
and First Great Western 
rail franchises.
The Group has an experienced and dedicated 
rail bid team which will continue to compete for 
franchises as they are re-let.
The Group also has a comprehensive review 
process for bids as they are developed and 
finalised involving a number of divisional and 
Group functions as well as final Board sign off. 
Compliance with our rail franchise agreements 
is closely managed and monitored on a monthly 
basis by senior management and procedures are 
in place to minimise the risk of non-compliance.

Mitigation
Treasury risks 1
 
3
 
4
 
As set out in further detail in note 23 to the ﬁnancial statements on pages 136 
to 140, treasury risks include liquidity risks, risks arising from changes to foreign 
exchange rates and interest rates and hedging risk. 
Foreign currency and interest rate movements impact proﬁt, balance sheet and 
cash ﬂows of the Group. 
Ineffective hedging arrangements may not fully mitigate losses or may 
increase them.
The Group is credit rated by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch. A downgrade in 
the Group’s credit ratings to below investment grade may lead to increased 
ﬁnancing costs and other consequences and affect the Group’s ability to 
invest in its operations.
No change in the year.
The Group’s treasury policy and delegated 
authorities are reviewed periodically to ensure 
compliance with best practice and to control 
and monitor these risks appropriately. 
The Group is continuously focused on improving 
operating and ﬁnancial efﬁciency as part of our 
strategic objectives as outlined on page 14.
Pensions 3
 
4
 
The Group sponsors or participates in a number of signiﬁcant deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension schemes, primarily in the UK
Future cash contribution requirements may increase or decrease based upon 
ﬁnancial markets, notably investment returns/valuations, the rates used to 
value the liabilities and through changes to life expectancy and could result 
in material changes in the accounting cost and cash contributions required.
No material change 
during the year.
Through diversiﬁcation of investments, hedging 
of liabilities, amendment of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
promises and the introduction of a deﬁned 
contribution scheme for new starters in UK Bus 
and Group, the Group has reduced these risks. 
Under the UK Rail franchise arrangements, 
the Group’s train operating companies are not 
responsible for any residual deﬁcit at the end of a 
franchise so there is only short term cash ﬂow risk 
within a particular franchise.
Fuel costs 1
 
3
 
4
 
Fuel is a signiﬁcant component of the Group’s operating costs. Fuel prices 
and supply levels can be inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly by international, political and 
economic circumstances.
Volatility in fuel prices or supply restrictions, shortages or interruptions could 
adversely impact the Group’s operations, cash ﬂow and proﬁtability. For 
example, Greyhound’s passenger revenues were adversely affected during 
the year by the rapid decline in oil prices. 
The Group may be unable to pass fuel cost volatility on fully to customers 
and hedging arrangements may not fully mitigate losses or may 
increase them. 
Oil prices may also adversely affect the economic activity of those customers 
which are dependent on oil and gas revenues, reducing demand for 
our services.
No overall material 
change during the year.
The Group has a forward hedging programme 
providing ﬁxed fuel prices and cost certainty.
Some of the Group’s contracts also enable us 
to pass on fuel cost increases to customers.
The Group’s businesses may have the opportunity 
to limit the impact of unexpected fuel price rises or 
revenue reductions caused by lower oil prices through 
efﬁciency, pricing and cost control measures.
First Student’s DriveSMART and the purchase 
of new fuel efﬁcient buses in our UK Bus division 
are initiatives aimed at reducing fuel usage in 
our businesses.
Terrorism 5
The threat from terrorism is enduring and continues to exist in all of our 
markets. Public transport has previously been subject to attack and across 
our businesses, we take all reasonable steps to help guard against such 
activity on the services we operate. 
An attack or threat of attack could lead to reduced public conﬁdence in 
public transportation, and/or speciﬁcally in the Group’s security and safety 
record and could reduce demand for our services, increase costs or security 
requirements and cause operational disruption.
No material change 
during the year.
We continue to develop and apply good practice, 
and train our employees so that they can identify 
and respond effectively to any potential threat 
or incident. 
Our focus is enhanced through close working 
relationships with specialist government agencies 
both in the UK and North America.

Customer service 2
 
3
 
5
The Group’s revenues are at risk if we do not continue to provide the level 
of service expected by our customers. Failure to provide acceptable levels of 
customer service could lead to non-renewal of contracts, reductions in 
passenger revenues and/or have negative reputational impact.
No overall material 
change in the year. 
Our commitment to our customers is embedded in 
our values (see page 12). The relevant employees 
undertake intensive training programmes to ensure 
that they are aware of, and abide by, the levels of 
service that are required by our customers in each 
business.
Ongoing engagement with customers and 
community stakeholders takes place across the 
Group, including through ‘meet the manager’ 
events, customer panels, consultations and 
local partnerships.
The Board also monitors customer service KPIs 
to ensure that strict targets are being met.
Litigation and claims 3
 
The Group has three main insurable risks: third party injury and other claims 
arising from vehicle and general operations, employee injuries and 
property damage. 
The Group is also subject to other litigation, which is not insured, particularly 
in North America, including contractual claims and those relating to employee 
wage and hour and meal and break matters.
A higher volume of litigation and claims can lead to increased costs, 
reduced availability of insurance cover, and/or reputational impact. 
A large single claim or a large number of smaller claims may negatively 
affect proﬁtability and cash ﬂow.
The claims environment, 
particularly in our North 
American businesses, 
remains a challenge 
despite our continued 
focus on safety.
The Group has a very strong focus on safety and, 
as described on page 12, it is one of our ﬁve values. 
The Group self-insures third party and employee 
injury claims up to a certain level commensurate with 
the historical risk proﬁle. We purchase insurance 
above these limits from reputable global insurance 
ﬁrms. Claims are managed by experienced claims 
handlers. 
Non-insured claims are managed by the Group’s 
dedicated in-house legal team with external 
assistance as appropriate.
Attraction and retention of key management  2
 
3
 
4
 
5
Attracting and retaining key members of senior management is a vital part of 
ensuring that the Group continues to have the necessary expertise and 
continuity to execute its strategy and turnaround plans.
Our deﬁned business 
plans have enabled us 
to attract and retain high 
quality management.
Our Group-wide succession planning process and 
performance development approach is designed 
to identify talented individuals, set development 
goals for progression to other roles and to assess 
the depth of talent and any gaps throughout the 
leadership of FirstGroup. The Group also offers 
market-based compensation packages 
consisting of an appropriate mix of long and 
short term incentives.
Employee costs and relations 1
 
2
 
3
 
4
 
5
Employee costs represent the largest component of the Group’s operating 
costs, and political or union pressure to increase wages could increase these 
costs. Improving economic conditions resulting in labour shortages or 
decreasing unemployment rates could hinder our ability to recruit and retain 
qualiﬁed employees. Our employees are key to service delivery and therefore 
it is important that good employee relations are maintained. 
High employee turnover could lead to higher than expected increases in the 
cost of recruitment, training and employee costs and operational disruption. 
Similarly, industrial action could adversely impact customer service and have 
a ﬁnancial impact on the Group’s operations.
No material change 
during the year.
The Group seeks to mitigate these risks via its 
recruitment and retention policies, training 
schemes and working practices. 
An applicant tracking system has been introduced 
in our UK divisions to streamline the recruitment 
process and assist in providing a suitable pool of 
drivers to help manage any shortages in an 
efﬁcient and cost-effective way. A similar system 
is being rolled out in our North American divisions.
Our working practices include building 
communication and engagement with trade 
unions and the wider workforce. Examples 
of this engagement include regular leadership 
conferences, employee surveys and the presence 
of Employee Directors (Directors voted for by the 
employees to represent them) on many of the 
Group’s UK divisional boards and the Board.

Environmental 3
 
4
 
5
The Group’s operations store and manage large quantities of fuel which 
presents a potential regulatory, reputational and ﬁnancial risk in the event of 
signiﬁcant loss or spillage. 
As a leading transport provider, we face the challenge of addressing climate 
change, both through managing its impact and reducing emissions. The 
Group’s businesses are at risk from future changes in the regulatory regime 
which could increase compliance costs or impose operational constraints.
No material change 
overall during the year.
To mitigate these risks, the Group’s storage 
facilities are subject to regular inspection and 
we have detailed fuel handling procedures 
which are regularly audited. 
Robust environmental policies, strategies and 
management systems are maintained across 
the Group.
The Group continues to target reductions in our 
emissions, including through behaviour change 
initiatives and investment in new technology.
Severe weather and natural disasters 3
 
Greater and more frequent adverse weather could lead to interruptions or 
disruption to service performance and reduced customer demand with 
consequent ﬁnancial impact, potential increased costs and accident rates.
Severe weather can reduce proﬁts, for example through lower demand for 
our services, increased costs, business disruption and increased accidents.
Whilst the Group’s 
North American 
operations were not 
as badly affected by 
severe weather as they 
were in the prior year, 
adverse weather in 
the north eastern US 
in the last quarter still 
had an impact.
The geographic spread of the Group’s businesses 
offers some protection. In addition, some of our 
contract-based businesses have force majeure 
clauses in place. We have severe weather action 
plans and procedures to manage the impact on 
our operations. 
The risks listed are not all of those highlighted by our risk management processes and are not set out in any order of priority. Additional risks and uncertainties 
not presently known to us, or currently deemed to be less material, may also impact our business. Indication of a movement in a risk may not indicate a change 
in the overall net risk position after taking into account risk mitigations.

Financial performance in the year
Reported Group revenue decreased by 9.9% in the year to £6,050.7m 
(2014: £6,717 .4m), principally reﬂecting UK Rail franchise changes, 
non-recurring revenues from UK Bus operations sold or closed in the 
prior year and foreign exchange translation. Excluding these items, 
revenue increased by 4. 1 %. Adjusted Group margin increased to 5.0% 
(2014: 4.0%). The US Dollar margin of our largest division First Student 
improved by 1.0%, reﬂecting the successful outcome of the ﬁrst year 
of our new contract bidding strategy and no repeat of the exceptionally 
severe winter weather conditions in the prior year. The UK Bus margin 
also improved by 1.0% as a result of continued progress in our 
turnaround programme. During the second half of the year Greyhound 
margins deteriorated due to the adverse effect on customer demand 
from sharply lower fuel prices, closing the year at 6.9% (2014: 7 .4%).  
UK Rail proﬁtability improved signiﬁcantly, reﬂecting good passenger 
revenue growth and First Great Western moving to normal commercial 
terms part way through last year. Group adjusted operating proﬁt 
increased by 13.3% to £303.6m (2014: £268.0m). Adjusted proﬁt 
attributable to ordinary shareholders increased by 48.2% to £1 17 .5m 
(2014: £79.3m), due to higher adjusted operating proﬁt and lower net 
ﬁnance costs. Adjusted EPS increased by a lower percentage to 9.8p 
(2014: 7 .5p), due to the increased weighted average number of shares in 
issue following the rights issue completed in the prior year. Adjusted 
EBITDA increased 7 .7% to £624.4m (2014: £579.8m). Statutory operating 
proﬁt was £245.8m (2014: £232.2m), reﬂecting the higher adjusted 
operating proﬁt partly offset by the gain on disposal of London operations 
in UK Bus last year. The net debt:EBITDA ratio was 2.25 times (2014: 2.25 
times), in part reﬂecting the UK Rail end of franchise cash outﬂows in 
the year and foreign exchange translation. ROCE was 7 .8%, or 8.5% 
(2014: 8.2%) at constant exchange rates. All references to ‘adjusted’ 
ﬁgures throughout this document are before amortisation charges 
and certain other items as set out in note 4 to the ﬁnancial statements.
The net cash inﬂow for the year before UK Rail end of franchise cash 
ﬂows was £39.4m (2014: £26.9m). This cash inﬂow, combined with 
the end of franchise outﬂows and movements in debt due to foreign 
exchange, contributed to an increase in net debt of £103.5m (2014: 
decrease of £675.3m, including £584.4m in net proceeds of the rights 
issue). The net cash inﬂow before UK Rail end of franchise cash ﬂows 
was slightly higher than the prior year, principally reﬂecting stronger 
cash generation by our operations, lower tax and interest payments 
and higher proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, 
partly offset by the planned higher capital expenditure and the London 
disposal proceeds in UK Bus last year. 
Liquidity within the Group has remained strong. At 31 March 2015 
there was £1,023.8m (2014: £988.5m) of committed headroom and 
free cash, being £800.0m (2014: £796.2m) of committed headroom 
and £223.8m (2014: £192.3m) of free cash. The Group’s average debt 
maturity was 5.2 years (2014: 6. 1 years). 
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 50 During the year gross capital investment of £425. 1m (2014: £464.7m) 
was invested in our business to continue our transformation 
programme and help reposition the Group for future growth. We 
expect to continue investing approximately £400m per annum in 
capital expenditure in our businesses in the medium term. 
Progress with the transformation programme in the year has reinforced 
our conﬁdence in delivering our medium term ﬁnancial objectives, 
which are as follows: 
 We aim to increase Group revenue (excluding UK Rail) at a faster 
rate than the economies we serve, through attractive customer 
propositions in our passenger revenue-based services, and 
disciplined bidding in our contract-based businesses. 
 In First Student and UK Bus we aim to improve margins to double 
digit levels through the detailed turnaround plans underway. 
Greyhound targets a margin of approximately 12% in part through 
investment in yield management systems. In First Transit we will 
continue our record of growth while maintaining margins of 
approximately 7%, and in UK Rail we will maintain our disciplined 
approach to bidding in a range of future franchise competitions 
where we see an opportunity to deliver ambitious improvements 
for passengers and appropriate returns for shareholders, at an 
acceptable level of risk. 
 Overall our objective is to achieve ROCE in the range of 10% 
to 12% in the medium term. 
 We also aim to maintain an investment grade credit rating and 
appropriate balance sheet liquidity and headroom. In the medium 
term we are targeting net debt:EBITDA of approximately two times.
Finance costs and investment income
Net ﬁnance costs before adjustments were £139.7m (2014: £156. 1m) 
with the decrease principally reﬂecting lower debt levels following the 
rights issue which completed part way through last year, and lower 
interest rates as a result of cancelling certain interest rate swaps and 
having more ﬂoating rate debt.
Proﬁt before tax
Adjusted proﬁt before tax as set out in note 4 to the ﬁnancial statements 
was £163.9m (201 4: £1 1 1 .9m), with the increase due principally to higher 
adjusted operating proﬁt and lower adjusted net ﬁnance costs. An overall 
charge of £58. 1m (201 4: £53.4m) for adjustments including amortisation 
charges of £54.3m (201 4: £53.4m) resulted in statutory proﬁt before tax of 
£105.8m (201 4: £58.5m).
Tax
The tax charge, on adjusted proﬁt before tax, for the year was £36. 1m 
(2014: £22.4m) representing an effective rate of 22.0% (2014: 20.0%). 
There was a tax credit of £15.8m (2014: credit of £24.9m) relating to 
amortisation charges and other adjustments. The total tax charge was 
£20.3m (2014: credit of £5.7m). The 2014 total tax credit also included 
a one-off credit adjustment of £3.2m to the UK deferred tax liability as a 
result of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 20%, 
which will apply from April 2016. The actual tax paid during the year 
was £4.5m (2014: £8.2m).
EPS
Adjusted EPS increased by 30.7% to 9.8p (2014: 7 .5p). Basic EPS 
increased 21.6% to 6.2p (2014: 5. 1p), with both improvements primarily 
due to higher operating proﬁt and lower net ﬁnance costs.

 Adjusted operating proﬁt less capital grant amortisation plus depreciation.
Reconciliation to non-GAAP measures and performance
Note 4 to the ﬁnancial statements sets out the reconciliations of 
operating proﬁt and proﬁt before tax to their adjusted equivalents. 
The principal reconciling items are as follows:
Amortisation charges
The charge for the year was £54.3m (2014: £53.4m).
Gain on disposal of property
A gain on disposal of £25.3m (2014: £nil) was realised on the sale 
of a Greyhound garage in Miami. The proceeds of this disposal of 
£31.6m were received during the year. 
Legal claims
Two separate legal claims that pre-date the Laidlaw acquisition and were 
acquired with the former Laidlaw entities had adverse developments 
during the year and we now estimate that it will cost signiﬁcantly more to 
settle these cases. As a result there was a charge of £12.2m (2014: £nil). 
IT licences 
A number of Group IT licences have been written off as the projects 
to which they relate will now be achieved in an alternative, less costly 
and more appropriate way. The charge for these licences was 
£8.7m (2014: £nil).
UK Bus depot sales and closures
There was a charge of £7 .5m (2014: credit of £13.0m) in the year 
relating to operating losses and ﬁxed asset impairments. The credit 
in 2014 largely represents the gain on disposal of London operations. 
UK Rail First Great Western contract provision
There was a charge of £nil (2014: credit of £4.6m) in the year. 
The credit in 2014 reﬂected the fact that losses in the ﬁnal seven 
periods of the old franchise were not as high as initially projected, 
partly due to contractual changes agreed with the DfT. 
Ineffectiveness on ﬁnancial derivatives
There was a £0.3m (2014: £17 .6m) non-cash charge during the year 
due to ineffectiveness on ﬁnancial derivatives. The principal component 
of the 2014 charge related to certain US Dollar swaps which were no 
longer required as the underlying borrowings were repaid from 
proceeds of the rights issue. 
Capital expenditure
As planned we continue to invest in our businesses. Cash capital 
expenditure was £428.9m (2014: £334.5m) and comprised First 
Student £17 4.9m (2014: £130.8m), First Transit £21.6m (2014: £18. 1m), 
Greyhound £49.8m (2014: £45.8m), UK Bus £104. 1m (2014: £67 .4m), 
UK Rail £75.0m (2014: £68.5m) and Group items £3.5m (2014: £3.9m). 
UK Rail capital expenditure is typically matched by franchise receipts. 
In addition during the year we entered into operating leases for 
passenger carrying vehicles with capital values in First Student of 
£nil (2014: £25.2m), First Transit of £9.2m (2014: £19.5m), Greyhound 
of £nil (2014: £14.7m) and UK Bus of £nil (2014: £24.3m).
Gross capital investment was £425. 1m (201 4: £464.7m) and comprised 
First Student £1 70.4m (201 4: £194.3m), First T ransit £30.3m (201 4: £37 .2m), 
Greyhound £50.9m (201 4: £60.5m), UK Bus £93.9m (201 4: £101 .7m), 
UK Rail £76. 1m (201 4: £69.4m) and Group items £3.5m (201 4: £1 .6m).
Cash ﬂow
The net cash inﬂow for the year before UK Rail end of franchise 
cash ﬂows was £39.4m (2014: £26.9m). This cash inﬂow combined 
with the end of franchise outﬂows of £107 .9m (£58.7m for First Capital 
Connect and £49.2m for First ScotRail) and movements in debt due 
to foreign exchange contributed to a net debt increase of £103.5m 
(2014: decrease of £675.3m) as detailed on the following page:
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 52 The net cash inﬂow before UK Rail end of franchise cash ﬂows was 
slightly higher than the prior year, principally reﬂecting stronger cash 
generation by operations, lower tax and interest payments and higher 
proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, partly offset 
by the planned higher capital expenditure and the London disposal 
proceeds last year. 
We expect there will be a further working capital outﬂow of approximately 
£30m in 2015/16 as a result of the end of UK Rail franchises. 
Funding and risk management
Liquidity within the Group has remained strong. At 31 March 2015 
there was £1,023.8m (2014: £988.5m) of committed headroom and 
free cash, being £800.0m (2014: £796.2m) of committed headroom 
and £223.8m (2014: £192.3m) of free cash. Largely due to the 
seasonality of First Student, committed headroom typically reduces 
during the ﬁnancial year up to October and increases thereafter. 
Treasury policy requires a minimum of £250m of committed headroom 
at all times. Our average debt maturity was 5.2 years (2014: 6. 1 years). 
The Group’s main revolving bank facilities require renewal in June 2019.
The Group does not enter into speculative ﬁnancial transactions 
and uses only authorised ﬁnancial instruments for certain risk 
management purposes. 
Interest rate risk
We reduce our exposure by using a combination of ﬁxed rate debt and 
interest rate derivatives to achieve an overall ﬁxed rate position over the 
medium term of more than 75% of net debt.
Fuel price risk
We use a progressive forward hedging programme to manage 
commodity risk. In 2014/15 in the UK, 93% of our ‘at risk’ 
crude requirements (2.2m barrels p.a.) were hedged at an average rate 
of $101 per barrel. At year end we had hedged 65% of our ‘at risk’ UK 
crude requirements for the year to 31 March 2016 at $97 per barrel and 
34% of our requirements for the year to 31 March 2017 at $89 per barrel.
In North America 81 % of 2014/15 ‘at risk’ crude oil volumes  
(1.5m barrels p.a.) were hedged at an average rate of $90 per barrel. At 
year end we had hedged 71 % of the volumes for the year to 31 March 
2016 at $86 per barrel and 36% of our volumes for the year to 31 March 
2017 at $83 per barrel.
Foreign currency risk
Group policies on foreign currency risk affecting cash ﬂow, proﬁts and 
net assets are maintained to minimise exposures to the Group by using 
a combination of natural hedge positions and derivative instruments 
where appropriate. Translation risk relating to US Dollar earnings arising 
in the US is mitigated by US Dollar denominated costs incurred in the 
UK, principally UK fuel costs, US Dollar interest and tax costs.
Shares in issue
As at 31 March 2015 there were 1,203.7m shares in issue (2014: 
1,204.2m), excluding treasury shares and own shares held in trust for 
employees of 1.2m (2014: 0.7m). The weighted average number of 
shares in issue for the purpose of basic EPS calculations (excluding 
treasury shares and own shares held in trust for employees) was 
1,204.0m (2014: 1,059.3m).
Goodwill
The carrying value (net assets including goodwill but excluding 
intercompany balances) of each cash generating unit (CGU) was tested 
for impairment during the year and there continues to be sufﬁcient 
headroom in all of the CGUs.

Strategic report Operating and ﬁnancial review
continued
Under the terms of the UK Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be 
distributed by the TOCs either up to the lower amount of their retained 
proﬁts or the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios. The 
ring-fenced cash represents that which is not available for distribution or 
the amount required to satisfy the liquidity ratio at the balance sheet date.
Balance sheet
Net assets have increased by £263.2m since the start of the year . The 
principal reasons for this are the retained proﬁt for the year of £85.5m, 
favourable translation reserve movements of £223.9m and actuarial gains 
on deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes (net of deferred tax) of £27 .2m partly 
offset by unfavourable after tax hedging reserve movements of £63.3m.

Pensions
We have updated our pension assumptions as at 31 March 2015 for 
the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes in the UK and North America. The net 
pension deﬁcit of £260.7m at the beginning of the year has decreased 
to £239.4m at the end of the year principally due to actual returns on 
assets more than offsetting lower net discount rates in the UK and 
North America. 
The main factors that inﬂuence the balance sheet position for 
pensions and the sensitivities to their movement at 31 March 2015 
are set out below:
Movement Impact
Discount rate +0.1% Reduce deﬁcit by £32m
Inﬂation +0.1% Increase deﬁcit by £24m
Seasonality
First Student generates lower revenues and proﬁts in the ﬁrst half of the 
ﬁnancial year than in the second half of the year as the school summer 
holidays fall into the ﬁrst half. Greyhound operating proﬁts are typically 
higher in the ﬁrst half of the year due to demand being stronger in the 
summer months. 
Going concern
The Group has established a strong balanced portfolio of businesses 
with approximately 50% of Group revenues secured under medium 
term contracts with government agencies and other large organisations 
in the UK and North America.
The Group has a diversiﬁed funding structure with average debt 
duration at 31 March 2015 of 5.2 years (2014: 6. 1 years) and which 
is largely represented by medium term unsecured bank facilities and 
long term unsecured bond debt. The Group has an £800m committed 
revolving banking facility of which £800m (2014: $1,200m under previous 
$1,250m facility) was undrawn at the year end. This new facility has a 
maturity of June 2019.
The Directors have carried out a detailed review of the Group’s budget 
for the year to 31 March 2016 and medium term plans, with due 
regard for the risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed, 
the uncertain economic climate and the impact that this could have on 
trading performance. Based on this review, the Directors believe that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the 
ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, 
and details of the going concern review are shown on pages 103 and 
104 of the Directors’ Report.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 57
Governance A number of candidates were considered for the role and it was agreed 
that Wolfhart Hauser met the speciﬁcation of the role, possessing all 
the necessary ﬁnancial and operational acumen to provide both strong 
challenge and able support to the executive team as well as a proven 
track record of long term value creation as CEO of a FTSE 100 
company and strong corporate governance insight gained through 
being a non-executive director on FTSE 100 boards. As announced 
on 1 1 March 2015, Wolfhart Hauser will assume the role of Chairman 
following the conclusion of the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 
16 July 2015, having joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 
18 May 2015. More detailed information on the process to identify the 
new Chairman is set out in the Nomination Committee report below.
Committee framework
FirstGroup has a structured and established corporate governance 
framework which underpins the Board’s aim of achieving long term 
success and sustainable shareholder value. As a Board, we believe 
that for a framework to work well, constant evaluation is required to 
ensure that the overall aims and objectives are stretching but 
achievable. The Board has four principal Committees to deal with 
speciﬁc aspects of the Group’s affairs: the Audit Committee; Board 
Safety Committee; Remuneration Committee; and Nomination 
Committee. Detailed information on the roles and responsibilities, 
and the activities undertaken during the year by each Committee, 
are set out in their respective sections within this Corporate 
Governance report.
Board and Committee evaluation
The Board believes regular and appropriate Board and Committee 
evaluation is key to achieving and improving Board effectiveness. 
Given the important changes to the Board with the appointment 
of a new Chairman and three new Non-Executive Directors, we 
chose again to conduct an externally facilitated evaluation process. 
This was delayed slightly compared to our normal practice with 
the results presented at the June 2015 Board meeting to allow 
Wolfhart to be part of the Board discussions on the evaluation 
results. We will therefore report on the outcomes of the evaluation 
in next year’s Annual Report and Accounts.
Succession planning
Proper planning for Board and senior management succession and 
refreshing and selecting the right individuals for the Board and senior 
management positions from a diverse talent pool are key issues for 
the Board. It is essential in ensuring a continuous level of quality in 
management, in avoiding instability by helping mitigate the risks which 
may be associated with unforeseen events, such as the departure of 
a key individual, and in promoting diversity. During the year, the Board 
reviewed the status of succession planning and engaged Spencer 
Stuart to assist in assessing individuals able to progress to Board 
and executive management positions. 
Dear fellow shareholder
Good governance is the cornerstone of 
a successful and sustainable company. 
The Board is committed to maintaining 
the highest standards of corporate 
governance in its management of the 
affairs of the Group and its accountability 
to shareholders and other stakeholders. 
Board role and effectiveness
The core purpose of the Board is to create and deliver the long term 
success of the Company and long term returns for shareholders. This 
requires the Board to set the Company’s strategic aims, ensure that 
the necessary ﬁnancial and human resource structures are in place to 
achieve the Company’s objectives, provide oversight of management’s 
performance in delivering against strategy on a day-to-day basis and 
set the Company’s risk appetite. The Board is aware of its obligations 
to the Company’s shareholders and other stakeholders and responds 
to their needs by transparent reporting and active engagement. 
My role as Chairman is to lead the Board and to ensure that FirstGroup 
has a Board which works effectively on all aspects of its role. A key 
part of that role is to ensure the Board works collaboratively with the 
executive team, providing support and guidance to complement and 
enhance the work undertaken, constructively challenges management 
when necessary and exercises an appropriate level of rigorous enquiry 
and intellectual debate. This involves having Directors with the right 
range and balance of skills, experience and attributes, including a 
broad diversity of perspectives, for the Board and for FirstGroup. 
I believe we have this on our Board, enhanced by the appointments 
of Warwick Brady, Drummond Hall and Imelda Walsh in June 2014. 
Chairman designate
It was with regret that I announced in September 2014 the difﬁcult 
decision to step down from the Chairmanship and Board of FirstGroup 
so early in my tenure, as a condition of assuming the chairman’s 
position at Barclays plc earlier this year. The process to identify a new 
Chair was led by Drummond Hall, as Senior Independent Director. 
A comprehensive and rigorous search process was put in place with a 
candidate proﬁle and position speciﬁcation prepared, and an executive 
search consultant, JCA Group, appointed to assist with the process. 
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 58
Corporate governance report Diversity 
The Board has previously highlighted that it is an advocate of diversity 
in the boardroom and a supporter of Lord Davies’ aim to raise the 
proportion of women on UK Boards, as reﬂected in the 2013 Women 
on Boards report. 
The Board consists of Directors with a wide range of skills and 
business experience drawn from a number of industries, which is 
critical for bringing both the expertise required, and to enable different 
perspectives to be brought to Board discussions. The combination 
of these factors mean that the Board beneﬁts from a diverse range 
of competencies, perspectives and thoughts, providing an ability 
to challenge on strategic issues and a dynamic environment for  
decision-making.
The Board continues to aim towards its aspiration of 25% of Board 
positions ﬁlled by women. The Board remains of the opinion that 
appointments to the Board should be made on merit relative to a 
number of different criteria including diversity of gender, background 
and personal attributes, alongside the appropriate skill set, experience 
and expertise. Future appointments to the Board must also 
complement the balance of skills that the Board already possesses. 
Further details of the Group’s approach to diversity can be found 
on the FirstGroup website at www.ﬁrstgroupplc.com. 
The Board recognises the need to create the conditions that foster 
talent and encourage all employees to achieve their full career potential 
in the Group. As part of our overall approach to human resource 
management we encourage employee diversity and aspire to be an 
inclusive organisation, representative of the communities that we serve.
Remuneration
In light of comments expressed by some shareholders on the 2014 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Remuneration Committee has 
undertaken a full review of executive remuneration, which has been 
its main activity during the year. As well as endeavouring to address 
the shareholder concerns raised, the purpose of the review has also 
been to ensure that remuneration is aligned to the Group’s strategy 
and turnaround plans. As a result of this, the Committee concluded 
that a number of changes to the remuneration policy are required, 
which will be voted upon at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management and for reviewing the effectiveness of this 
system. The Board has adopted a risk-based approach in establishing 
the Group’s system of internal control and in reviewing its effectiveness. 
The Group, in the course of its business activities, is exposed to 
strategic, ﬁnancial, operational and compliance risks. Overall 
management of these risks is vested in the Board, with the Audit 
Committee having delegated authority for reviewing the Group’s risk 
management framework. More detailed information on the Group’s 
system of internal control and risk management can be found in the 
Principal risks and uncertainties section and this Corporate 
Governance report. 
Engaging with shareholders
Engaging with shareholders is one of the key aspects of corporate 
governance. I and my fellow Directors welcome open, meaningful 
discussion with shareholders, particularly with regard to governance, 
strategy and remuneration. The Board and management have 
undertaken a number of activities in this regard during the year, 
many of which are detailed in this Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Board also receives regular reports on investor relations activities 
and, in particular, on shareholder sentiment and feedback. The Board 
continues to believe that ongoing engagement with shareholders and 
other stakeholders is vital to ensuring their views and perspectives are 
fully understood and taken into consideration. This will remain a key 
focus for the Board in 2015/16. At the Company’s forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting, all Directors who are able to attend will be available, 
as usual, to meet with shareholders after the meeting to discuss any 
issues they may have. I encourage as many shareholders as possible 
to attend the Annual General Meeting on 16 July 2015. 
Looking ahead
This is my last report to you as Chairman, as I will retire from the Board 
at the conclusion of the AGM on 16 July 2015. I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank my Board colleagues, both present and past, for 
the invaluable support and guidance they have given me, through their 
contribution on the Board and Board Committees and more widely, 
during my period as Chairman. As I hand over to my successor, 
Wolfhart Hauser, I would like to wish my Board colleagues every 
success for the future.

Governance Governance framework
The Annual Report and Accounts has been prepared in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code which was issued in 
September 2012 (the Code) by the Financial Reporting Council 
(the FRC) and is available to view at www.frc.org.uk. The Company 
is currently reviewing the provisions of the revised edition of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published by the FRC in September 2014 
which applies to companies with a premium listing on the London 
Stock Exchange with accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 October 2014. These provisions will apply to the Company for 
the ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2016 and we are considering how 
best we can comply with them to ensure continued high standards 
of governance.
Code compliance
The Board conﬁrms that throughout the year the Company has applied 
the main principles and complied with the provisions of the Code, save 
for the Remuneration Committee has comprised only two independent 
Non-Executive Directors since June 2014. The Committee dealt 
effectively and ably with the matters it was required to address during 
this period. Following the succession of Wolfhart Hauser as Chairman 
after the conclusion of the 2015 Annual General Meeting the matter will 
be further considered and addressed.

continued Leadership
The role of the Board 
The Board is accountable for managing the Company on behalf of 
its shareholders and each Director acts in a way which promotes the 
long term success of the Company for the beneﬁt of the shareholders 
as a whole. The Board ensures that an appropriate balance between 
promoting long term growth and delivering short term objectives 
is achieved.
The Board provides entrepreneurial leadership of the Company 
within a framework of prudent and effective controls for risk 
assessment and management. The Board is primarily responsible for: 
determining strategic direction and demonstrating leadership; focusing 
on matters that consistently add value for shareholders of the Company 
both present and future; the governance and stewardship of the Group 
to provide protection and security for the shareholders’ assets; the 
management of the Group’s employees; setting the Group’s standards 
and values, and ensuring that its obligations to shareholders and other 
stakeholders are understood and met; and determining the nature and 
extent of the signiﬁcant risks the Group is willing to take to achieve its 
strategic objectives. Another key responsibility of the Board is to ensure 
that management maintains a system of internal control that provides 
assurance of effective and efﬁcient operations, internal ﬁnancial controls 
and compliance with laws and regulations.
The Board is the decision-making body for all matters of such 
importance as to be signiﬁcant to the Group as a whole because of 
their strategic, ﬁnancial or reputational implications or consequences. 
Speciﬁc key matters have been reserved for approval by the Board. 
These include approval of:
 the Group’s strategy;
 risk appetite;
 major acquisitions, mergers or disposals;
 UK rail franchise bids;
 dealings with regulatory authorities on matters of significance;
 capital and liquidity matters;
 the five-year plan and annual budget; 
 Board and Committee membership; and
 financial results and governance.
Board meetings and visits
The core activities of the Board are carried out in scheduled 
meetings of the Board and its Committees. Additional ad hoc 
meetings and conference calls of the Board and its Committees 
are arranged to consider matters which require decisions outside 
the scheduled meetings. 
To ensure the Board sees the Group’s operations overseas, the Board 
normally holds at least one meeting each year at one of the principal 
overseas ofﬁces of the Group. This provides senior management from 
across the Group with the opportunity to present to the Board and its 
Committees and to meet Board members informally. It also provides 
the Board with the opportunity to assess senior managers at ﬁrst hand 
and to review operational matters. For example, during the year the 
Board visited the ofﬁces of Greyhound in Dallas, which included 
a presentation from senior management on Greyhound’s 
commercial strategy.
In order to carry out its work, the Board has established a planned 
programme of agendas to ensure all necessary matters are covered 
and to allow sufﬁcient time for debate and challenge. The Board 
also takes time to review past decisions where necessary. At Board 
meetings, the Board receives and considers papers and presentations 
from management on relevant topics and senior executives are 
regularly invited to attend meetings for speciﬁc items. Effective review 
and decision-making is supported by providing the Board with high 
quality, accurate, clear and timely information including input from 
advisers where necessary.
Board meetings are structured around the following areas:
 divisional updates;
 financial updates;
 strategy and transformation plans;
 progress against strategy and transformation plans;
 other reporting items for approval, including UK rail franchise 
bids; and
 feedback from Committees.
Division of responsibilities
The Board has agreed a clear division of responsibilities between 
the Chairman and the Chief Executive. The roles of the Chairman, 
Chief Executive and other Directors are clearly deﬁned so that no 
single individual has unrestricted powers of decision.
Roles and responsibilities
Chairman 
In addition to being a Board member responsible to the Company, 
shareholders and other stakeholders, the key roles and responsibilities 
of the Chairman include:
 promoting the interests of the Company with special regard to Group 
planning and development to secure the Group’s future success;
 ensuring the effective operation of the Board and its Committees 
in conformity with the highest standards of corporate governance;
 providing leadership to the Board, setting its agenda, style and 
tone of meeting discussions to promote open and constructive 
debate and effective decision-making, as well as ensuring that 
adequate time is available for discussion of all agenda items and 
taking account of all views of the Directors;
 ensuring that shareholders and the Board receive accurate, timely, 
clear and high quality information on all important matters;
 ensuring that the Board determines significant risks, that the 
Directors have effective oversight of risks and that the Board 
has effective decision-making processes and applies sufficient 
challenge to management;
 chairing the Nomination Committee and assembling an effective, 
complementary Board by initiating change and succession 
planning of Board and Committee members;
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 61
Governance ensuring comprehensive induction programmes for new Directors 
and that the needs of all Directors are identified and met;
 ensuring the performance of the Board, its Committees and 
individual Directors is formally evaluated annually, with an 
externally facilitated evaluation performed at least every 
three years;
 promoting effective and constructive relationships and 
communications between Non-Executive Directors and Executive 
Directors and senior management, and holding meetings with the 
Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors 
being present;
 ensuring effective communication with shareholders and other 
stakeholders, and that their views are understood by the Board; and
 maintaining an effective working relationship with the 
Chief Executive.
Chief Executive 
In addition to being a Board member accountable to the Company, 
shareholders and other stakeholders, the key roles and responsibilities 
of the Chief Executive include:
 ensuring the creation and maintenance of a safe working 
environment and a safety-focused culture across the Group;
 leading the management team in the day-to-day running of the 
Group’s business;
 developing the Group’s objectives and strategy having regard 
to the Group’s responsibilities to its shareholders, customers, 
employees and other stakeholders;
 establishing and maintaining an organisational structure that 
will enable the Group’s strategy to be implemented effectively;
 responsibility to the Board for the performance of the business, 
consistent with agreed plans, strategies and policies;
 developing through investment and divestment an appropriate 
asset base for the Group to execute its strategy;
 developing and promoting effective communication with 
shareholders and other interested parties;
 ensuring at all times that the Group conducts its business in

which it operates and the Company’s standards, if higher;

business objectives both now and in the future;
 developing and maintaining an effective framework of internal 
controls over risk in relation to all business activities;
 managing the Group’s risk profile in line with what is deemed 
acceptable by the Board; and
 ensuring the Board is kept appraised in a timely manner of the 
issues facing the Group and of events and developments as 
they arise.
Senior Independent Director
In addition to being a Board member responsible to the Company, 
shareholders and other stakeholders, the key roles and responsibilities 
of the Senior Independent Director include:
 acting as a point of contact for shareholders and other 
stakeholders to discuss matters of concern which would not 
be appropriate through the normal channels of communication 
with the Chairman, Chief Executive or Group Finance Director. 
No such matters of concern were raised by shareholders or 
stakeholders during the year ended 31 March 2015;
 acting as a sounding board for the Chairman and serving as 
an intermediary for the other Directors when necessary;
 meeting with the Non-Executive Directors (without the Chairman 
being present) at least annually and leading the Board in the 
ongoing monitoring and annual performance evaluation of 
the Chairman;
 monitoring the training and development requirements of 
Directors; and
 availability to meet with a range of major shareholders when 
requested, to develop a balanced understanding of their issues 
and concerns and reporting the outcome of such meetings at 
subsequent Board meetings.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors provide a strong independent element 
to the Board and a solid foundation for good corporate governance. 
Although all Directors are equally accountable under the law for the 
stewardship of the Company’s affairs, the Non-Executive Directors 
fulﬁl a vital role in corporate accountability. They have responsibility for 
constructively challenging the strategies proposed by the Executive 
Directors, scrutinising the performance of management in achieving 
agreed goals and objectives, as well as playing a leading role in the 
functioning of the main Board committees. Between them, the 
current Non-Executive Directors have the appropriate balance of skills, 
experience, knowledge and independent judgement gained through 
experience in a variety of business sectors.
Board Committees
The four principal Committees of the Board are: Audit; Board Safety; 
Nomination; and Remuneration. Board Committee members are 
appointed by the Board upon the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee, which reviews the composition of each Committee 
regularly. The Committee memberships are spread between the 
Non-Executive Directors, drawing on each of their relevant skills 
and experience. 
Committee members are expected to attend each Committee meeting, 
unless there are exceptional circumstances which prevent them from 
doing so. Only members of the Committees are entitled to attend their 
meetings, but others may attend at the Committee’s request.
The terms of reference of each Committee are available to view on the 
Company’s website (www.ﬁrstgroupplc.com) and on request from the 
Company Secretary at the Company’s registered ofﬁce. The terms of 
reference are normally reviewed annually.

Effectiveness
Board balance and independence
Effective management and good stewardship of the Group are led 
by the Board. The Board is currently comprised of the Chairman, 
two Executive Directors and seven Non-Executive Directors. John 
McFarlane will step down from the Chairmanship and Board at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting and will be succeeded by 
Wolfhart Hauser. The balance of Directors on the Board ensures that 
no individual or small group of Directors can dominate the decision-
making process and that the interests of the minority shareholders 
are protected. Biographies of all current Directors are set out on 
pages 56 and 57 .
It is the Company’s policy that at least half the Board should be 
independent Non-Executive Directors. Other than Mick Barker, the 
Board considers each of its current Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent in character and judgement. In reaching its determination 
of independence, the Board has concluded that each provides 
objective challenge to management, is willing to stand up and defend 
his or her own beliefs and viewpoints in order to support the ultimate 
good of the Company and there are no business or other relationships 
likely to affect, or which could appear to affect, the judgement of 
Warwick Brady, Drummond Hall, Wolfhart Hauser, Brian Wallace, 
Imelda Walsh or Jim Winestock. The Board carries out a review of 
the independence of its Directors on an annual basis. Mick Barker is 
not considered by the Board to be independent as he is an employee 
of one of the Group’s subsidiaries. The Board considers, however, that 
it is extremely beneﬁcial for its employees to be represented on the 
Board in this way as it enables employee-related issues to be raised 
directly at the Board and provides a two-way communication between 
the Board and employees.
Commitment
All Directors are expected to attend each Board meeting and each 
Committee meeting for which they are members, save for in exceptional 
circumstances. To help enable this, scheduled Board and Committee 
meetings are arranged at least a year in advance to allow Directors to 
manage other commitments. If a Director is unable to attend a meeting 
because of exceptional circumstances, he or she still receives the 
papers and other relevant information in advance of the meeting and 
has the opportunity to discuss with the relevant Chair or the Company 
Secretary any matters he or she wishes to raise and to follow up on the 
decisions taken at the meeting. The Chairman, Chief Executive and 
Company Secretary are always available to discuss issues relating 
to meetings or other matters with the Directors. Reasons for  
non-attendance are generally prior business and personal 
commitments or illness.
The Board is satisﬁed that each of the Non-Executive Directors is able 
to devote sufﬁcient time to the Company’s business. Non-Executive 
Directors are advised on appointment of the time required to fulﬁl the 
role and are asked to conﬁrm that they can make the required 
commitment. One of the key criteria considered for the appointment

Warwick Brady was unable to attend two meetings and Imelda Walsh one

the Board.
Development
On appointment, all new Directors receive a comprehensive and 
structured induction, tailored to their individual requirements. The 
induction programme, which is arranged by the Company Secretary, 
includes visits to the Group’s businesses and meetings with senior 
managers and advisers, as appropriate. The programme is designed 
to facilitate their understanding of the Group, the key drivers of 
business performance, the role of the Board and its Committees, 
the Company’s corporate governance practices and procedures, 
as well as providing them with appropriate training and guidance 
as to their duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a director of a 
public limited company.
To assist Directors in the performance of their duties, there are 
procedures in place to provide them with appropriate and timely 
information, including receiving information between meetings 
regarding Group business development and ﬁnancial performance. 
This enables the Directors to discharge their duties on strategic, 
ﬁnancial, operational, compliance and governance issues effectively. 
Where appropriate, additional training and updates on particular 
issues are provided. 
All Directors are provided with the opportunity for, and encouraged to 
attend, training to ensure they are kept up to date on relevant legal and 
ﬁnancial developments or changes in best practice. Typical training for 
Directors includes attendance at seminars, forums, conferences and 
working groups as well as receiving updates from relevant bodies on 
various legal, regulatory and corporate governance matters.
To ensure the Board as a whole remains fully informed of the views 
of shareholders, the Board receives regular reports on shareholder 
sentiment at Board meetings.
Although not part of their induction programme, all Non-Executive 
Directors can attend shareholder meetings and analyst presentations, 
and shareholders may meet informally with Directors at the 
Annual General Meeting.
Information and support
The Company Secretary, through the Chairman, is responsible for 
advising the Board on all governance matters and for ensuring that 
Board procedures are followed, applicable rules and regulations are 
complied with and that due account is taken of relevant codes of best 
practice. The Company Secretary is also responsible for ensuring 
communication ﬂows between the Board and its Committees, and 
between senior management and Non-Executive Directors. All 
Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary and, 
in appropriate circumstances, may obtain independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense. The appointment and removal of 
the Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board as a whole.
All Directors receive detailed papers and other relevant information on 
the business to be conducted at each Board or Committee meeting 
well in advance and all Directors have direct access to senior 
management should they wish to receive additional information on 
any of the items for discussion. The head of each division attends 
Board meetings on a regular basis to ensure that the Board is 
properly informed about the performance of that division and any 
issues that it faces. Directors are provided between meetings with 
relevant information on matters affecting the business. Such updates 
were carried out by a variety of methods, including conference calls 
amongst the full Board or between the Chairman and/or the Chief 
Executive and the Non-Executive Directors, and by way of the 
Company Secretary circulating monthly ﬁnancial results as well 
as papers and updates on relevant issues.
Throughout the year a fully encrypted electronic portal system was 
operated, which enabled the Board and Committee papers to be 
delivered securely to the Directors. This enables a faster and more 
secure distribution of information, accessed using electronic tablets, 
and reduced resource usage.
The Company Secretary is Robert Welch, who joined the Group 
in 2014. Robert Welch is secretary to all of the Board Committees, 
except the Audit Committee and Board Safety Committee. The 
secretary to the Audit Committee and Board Safety Committee 
is Eileen Malcolmson, Deputy Company Secretary.
Conﬂicts of interest
The Directors have a statutory duty under the Companies Act 2006 
to avoid situations in which they have or can have a direct or indirect 
interest that conﬂicts or may conﬂict with the interests of the Company. 
This duty is in addition to the existing duty that a Director owes to the 
Company to disclose to the Board any transaction or arrangement 
under consideration by the Company. The Company’s conﬂict of 
interest procedures are reﬂected in the Articles of Association. In line 
with that Act, the Company’s Articles of Association allow the Directors 
to authorise conﬂicts and potential conﬂicts of interest where 
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 64
Corporate governance report
continued appropriate. The decision to authorise a conﬂict can only be made 
by non-conﬂicted Directors. Directors do not participate in decisions 
concerning their own remuneration or interests. 
The Company Secretary minutes the consideration of any conﬂict or 
potential conﬂict of interest and authorisations granted by the Board. 
On an ongoing basis, the Directors inform the Company Secretary of 
any new, actual or potential conﬂict of interest that may arise or if there 
are any changes in circumstances that may affect an authorisation 
previously given. Even when authorisation is given, a Director is not 
absolved from his duty to promote the success of the Company.
Furthermore, the Company’s Articles of Association include provisions 
relating to conﬁdential information, attendance at Board meetings and 
availability of Board papers to protect a Director from breaching his or 
her duty if a conﬂict of interest arises. These provisions will only apply 
where the circumstance giving rise to the potential conﬂict of interest 
has previously been authorised by the Directors.
Performance evaluation
The Board undertakes regular evaluations of its own performance 
as well as that of its Committees. The last externally conducted 
Board performance evaluation was conducted in 2014 by 
Independent Board Evaluation.
A Board evaluation was commenced in March 2015, facilitated by 
Independent Board Evaluation, in respect of the year ended 31 March 
2015. The process was carefully structured but pragmatic, designed 
to bring about a genuine debate on issues that were relevant, check 
on progress against matters identiﬁed in the previous evaluation and 
assist in identifying any potential for improvement in the Company’s 
processes. It entailed interviews with each of the Directors and the 
Company Secretary on the performance of the Board, its Committees 
and its Executive and Non-Executive Directors and the preparation of 
a composite report. The results of the performance evaluation were 
presented and discussed at the June 2015 Board meeting and 
therefore will be disclosed in next year’s Annual Report and Accounts. 
As set out in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts, an external 
Board performance evaluation process was undertaken in mid-2014. 
The results of the Board performance evaluation report were presented 
at the May 2014 Board meeting and it was concluded that the culture 
of the Board was changing and becoming more effective. The main 
areas identiﬁed for improvement and corresponding actions taken 
during 2014/15 were as follows:
Area identiﬁed Action taken
Board composition 
and diversity
The Board initiated a recruitment process 
and appointed three new Non-Executive 
Directors, Warwick Brady, Drummond Hall 
and Imelda Walsh.
Succession planning A detailed review of Executive Directors and 
senior executives, facilitated by Spencer Stuart, 
was conducted in 2014 identifying the skills, 
attributes, development needs and potential of 
each person.
Management of 
Board meetings and 
focus of discussion
The format of the agenda was amended to focus 
on the key priorities of the Group and allow 
greater time to discuss and debate these issues.
During the year, the Chairman held a number of meetings with 
Non-Executive Directors without Executive Directors being present. 
The Senior Independent Director also led the Non-Executive Directors 
in evaluating the performance of the Chairman.
Election and re-election of Directors
Directors newly appointed by the Board are required to submit 
themselves for election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
following their appointment. Wolfhart Hauser having been appointed 
as a Director on 18 May 2015, will retire and submit himself for election 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. In accordance with best 
practice and the Code, all other Directors will be submitted for 
re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, save for 
John McFarlane who will be stepping down from the Board at the 
conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and 
therefore will not be seeking re-election.
UK Bribery Act
The Group is committed to the highest standards of integrity and 
professionalism in all its activities. In line with this commitment, and 
as required by the Group Code of Business Ethics, an anti-bribery 
policy has been implemented which applies to all employees across 
the Group. The policy addresses areas such as corporate gifts and 
hospitality, facilitation payments, breach reporting, risk assessments 
and training. 
In 2014, a refreshed anti-bribery training programme was delivered to 
all employees whose role and/or seniority puts them at risk. Procedures 
are in place to ensure that new employees and existing employees, who 
switch roles, also receive this training as appropriate. Each business 
unit and Group function is required to complete annual risk assessments 
in relation to anti-bribery and fraud. A 24-hour/seven-days-a-week 
conﬁdential reporting hotline to report any concerns, including those 
relating to bribery or corruption, is available to all employees.
Accountability 
The Board is responsible for promoting the long term success of the 
Company for the beneﬁt of shareholders. This includes ensuring that 
an appropriate system of governance is in place throughout the Group. 
To discharge this responsibility, the Board has established a framework 
for risk management and internal control which identiﬁes, evaluates and 
manages the signiﬁcant risks associated with the Group’s achievement 
of its business objectives, with a view to safeguarding the shareholders’ 
investment and the Group’s assets. 
The Group’s internal control system is bespoke to the Company’s 
particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed, and is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate risk. Due to the limitations inherent in 
any system of internal control, this system provides reasonable, but 
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control is reviewed 
by the Board annually. The Board conﬁrms that throughout the year 
ended 31 March 2015 and up to the date of approval of this Annual 
Report and Accounts, there have been processes in place to identify, 
evaluate and manage the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group in 
accordance with the Turnbull Guidance. The Company is aware that 
the FRC published a revised edition of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code in September 2014, together with its Guidance on Risk 
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 65
Governance Management and Internal Control. Accordingly, the Company is 
reviewing its internal control and risk management policies and 
procedures to take account of these changes and it is anticipated 
that it will report on any changes made in the 2016 Annual Report 
and Accounts.
The Board has adopted a risk-based approach in establishing the 
Group’s system of internal control and in reviewing its effectiveness. 
To assist in the identiﬁcation and management of key risks, the 
Board has:
 established a number of Group-wide procedures, policies and 
standards; 
 set up a framework for reporting matters of significance; 
 authorised the Audit Committee to review the Group’s approach 
to risk management and the effectiveness of the Group’s financial 
reporting, internal control and assurance systems; 
 developed a system of regular reports from management; and 
 reserved specific key matters for its decision. 
The process is designed to provide assurance by way of 
cumulative assessment. 
Key elements of the Group’s system of internal control which have 
operated throughout the year are:
 a clearly defined organisation structure with established 
responsibilities;
 a focused business strategy, thus restricting potential risk 
exposures;
 Group financial, treasury, operating, compliance and administrative 
policies and procedures which incorporate statements of required 
behaviour;
 continuous review of safety, operating and financial performance 
of the Group’s businesses;
 regular reports to the Board, Board Safety Committee and 
Executive Safety Committee on safety matters;
 monitoring by the Board of a comprehensive reporting system, 
including monthly results, periodic short term forecasts, annual 
budgets and a five-year plan;
 approval by the Board of all major investments, with proposals 
being subject to rigorous strategic, financial and commercial 
examination;
 divisions identifying and reviewing their significant risks and 
controls for monitoring and managing risks, which are reviewed by 
senior executive management. The updated divisional and Group 
risk profiles, which are reviewed by the Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director, are presented to the Audit Committee;
 an established methodology for ranking the level of risk in each 
of its business operations and the significant risk issues 
associated therewith;
 implementation of appropriate strategies to deal with significant 
risks, including measures such as insurance and the use of 
external specialists;
 a centrally coordinated internal audit programme to support the 
Board in the requirement to ensure a sound control environment;
 a confidential reporting system to allow employees to raise 
concerns about possible legal, regulatory, financial reporting or 
any other improprieties;
 regular reports to the Audit Committee on the adequacy and 
effectiveness of internal controls;
 a Board sponsored Risk Group comprising representatives from 
major functions and presentations from relevant divisional senior 
management, which reviews the identification and assessment 
of key risks and controls; and
 a remuneration policy for executives which motivates them, 
without delivering excessive benefits or encouraging excessive 
risk-taking.
Reviews of internal controls within operating units by internal audit have 
sometimes highlighted control weaknesses, which are discussed with 
management and remedial action plans are agreed. Where appropriate, 
follow up visits to the operating entity then conﬁrm that the action plans 
have been completed and that the controls that have been put in place 
are working effectively. No material losses, contingencies or 
uncertainties that would require disclosure in the Annual Report 
and Accounts have been identiﬁed during the year by this process.
The Board, in conjunction with management, continues to review 
and develop the internal control environment where appropriate.
The Group’s approach to risk management and how it proﬁles 
the risks identiﬁed is set out on pages 44.
Financial and business reporting
In its reporting to shareholders the Board recognises its responsibility to 
present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s 
position and prospects. This responsibility encompasses all published 
information including, but not limited to: the year-end and half-yearly 
ﬁnancial statements; regulatory news announcements; and other public 
information. The Board considers this Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
The quality of the Company’s reporting is ensured by having in 
place procedures for the review of information by management. 
There are also strict procedures determining who has authority to 
release information. A statement of the Directors’ responsibilities for 
preparing the ﬁnancial statements can be found on page 104.
The Group adopts a ﬁnancial reporting and information system 
which complies with generally accepted accounting practice. 
A Group Finance Manual details the Group’s accounting policies 
and procedures with which subsidiaries must comply. Budgets 
are prepared by subsidiary company management which are then 
consolidated into divisional budgets. These are subject to review 
by both senior management and the Executive Directors followed 
by formal approval by the Board. Regular forecast updates are 
completed during the year and compared against actions required. 
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 66
 Corporate governance report
continued Each subsidiary unit prepares a monthly report of operating performance 
with a commentary on variances against budget and prior year, which 
is reviewed by the executive senior management team. Similar 
reports are prepared at a Group level. Key performance indicators, 
both ﬁnancial and operational, are monitored on a weekly basis. In 
addition, business units participate in strategic reviews, which include 
consideration of long term ﬁnancial projections and the evaluation 
of business alternatives.
Treasury operations
The Board has set a policy for the management of the risks from 
treasury operations and this is set out in more detail in note 23 to the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. A Group Treasury Policy has been 
formulated and adopted to ensure compliance with best practice and 
to control and monitor effectively the risks attendant upon treasury 
and banking operations.
Internal audit
Internal audit advises management on the extent to which systems 
of internal control are adequate and effective to manage business risk, 
safeguard the Group’s resources, and ensure compliance with legal 
and regulatory requirements. It provides objective assurance on risk 
and controls to senior management and the Audit Committee.
Internal audit’s work is focused on the Group’s signiﬁcant risks. The 
mandate and programme of work of the internal audit department is 
approved by the Audit Committee. Based on the approved audit plan, 
a number of internal audits took place across the Group’s divisions 
to review internal controls, identify any weaknesses and facilitate 
improvement of the Group’s internal controls. Reports on the ﬁndings 
of internal audit are provided to relevant operational management and 
the Audit Committee receives at each of its meetings reports from the 
Group Director of Internal Audit on the department’s work and ﬁndings. 
Internal audit reports include recommendations to improve internal 
controls together with agreed management action plans to resolve 
the issues raised. Internal audit follows up on the implementation of 
recommendations and reports on progress to senior management 
and the Audit Committee.
The effectiveness of the internal audit function is reviewed by the 
Audit Committee. This is done by the review of the internal audit plan 
of work for the year and monitoring progress against the plan and 
actions identiﬁed by internal audit.
Relations with shareholders
As set out in the Chairman’s Governance Statement commencing 
on page 58, the Board welcomes the opportunity to openly and 
purposefully engage with shareholders as it recognises the 
importance of a continuing effective dialogue, whether with major 
institutional shareholders, private or employee shareholders. 
The Board takes responsibility for ensuring that such dialogue 
takes place and recognises that regular dialogue is particularly 
important while the plans to transform the Group’s ﬁnancial 
performance are ongoing. The Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director are closely involved in investor relations, and the Corporate 
Services Director has day-to-day responsibility for such matters. 
Feedback from shareholders is provided at Board meetings.
The Executive Directors are available, through the Corporate Services 
Director, to discuss the concerns of major shareholders at any time 
during the year and the Chairman is available to discuss governance 
and strategy with major shareholders. Non-Executive Directors make 
themselves available to attend meetings with shareholders in order to 
develop an understanding of their views.
The Company responds as necessary to requests from individual 
shareholders on a wide range of issues. There is regular dialogue with 
key institutional shareholders, fund managers and sell-side analysts 
to discuss strategy, ﬁnancial performance and investment activities 
throughout the Group. General presentations to shareholders and the 
wider ﬁnancial community are made by the Chief Executive and Group 
Finance Director following the announcement of trading updates and 
half and full-year results. Speciﬁc consultations have been carried out 
with leading shareholders during the year on the appointment of 
the new Chairman and the new remuneration policy. 
Investors are kept informed of key business activities, decisions, 
appointments and other key announcements on an ongoing basis via 
the regulatory news service and press releases. The Group’s website 
(www.ﬁrstgroupplc.com) contains all of this information together 
with ﬁnancial reports, presentations and other information on the 
Group’s operations. 
Annual General Meeting
The Notice of Annual General Meeting is circulated to all shareholders 
at least 20 working days prior to such meeting and it is Company policy 
not to combine resolutions. All shareholders are invited to attend the 
Annual General Meeting where there is an opportunity for individual 
shareholders to question the Chairman and, through him, the Chairs 
of the principal Board Committees. After the Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders can meet informally with the Directors.
At the Annual General Meeting, the Chairman provides a brief summary 
of the Company’s activities for the previous year to shareholders and 
the Chief Executive provides a business update. All resolutions at the 
2014 Annual General Meeting were voted on by way of a poll. The 
procedure for voting on a poll follows best practice and allows the 
Company to count all votes rather than just those of the shareholders 
attending the meeting. 
As recommended by the Code, all resolutions proposed at the 2014 
Annual General Meeting were voted separately and the voting results, 
which included all votes cast for, against and those withheld, together 
with all proxies lodged prior to the meeting, were announced to the 
London Stock Exchange and made available on the Company’s 
website as soon as practicable after the meeting. As in previous years, 
the Form of Proxy clearly advised that a vote withheld is not a vote in 
law and is not used in calculating the votes for or against a resolution.

Governance Nomination Committee
 
Dear fellow shareholder
As this will be my ﬁnal report as Chairman 
of the Nomination Committee, I am pleased 
to report on how the Committee has 
continued to undertake its role. 
The Committee is primarily responsible for leading the process for 
Board appointments and for keeping under review the balance of skills, 
experience, independence, knowledge and diversity, including gender, 
on the Board to ensure the orderly evolution of the membership of the 
Board and its Committees. In identifying and nominating candidates for 
approval by the Board, the Committee continues to take account of the 
Board’s aims in relation to diversity, whilst ensuring that the right people 
with the right range of skills and experience are on the Board and in 
senior management positions in the coming years.
The Committee has had a busy year, securing the appointment 
of a new Chairman and three new Non-Executive Directors, details 
of which were provided in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts, 
and refreshing the membership of the Board Committees. 
As previously reported I will be stepping down both as Chairman of 
the Board and of the Committee at the conclusion of the Company’s 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. I am delighted that Wolfhart 
Hauser will replace me in both roles.
John McFarlane
Chair, Nomination Committee
Role and responsibilities
The key roles and responsibilities of the Committee are to:
 regularly review the structure, size and composition (including 
skills, experience, independence, knowledge and diversity, 
including gender) of the Board and make recommendations 
to the Board with regard to any changes;
 identify and nominate for Board approval, candidates to fill Board 
vacancies having regard to, amongst other things, the benefits 
of diversity including gender, as and when they arise;
 recommend to the Board suitable candidates for the role of Senior 
Independent Director, and membership of the Board Committees;
 ensure that the Company’s Board and executive leadership skills 
are fully aligned to the Company’s long term strategy;
 oversee succession planning for Directors and other senior 
executives, taking into account the challenges and opportunities 
facing the Company, and the skills and experience that will be 
needed on the Board in the future; 
 ensure any appointees have sufficient time to undertake their role; 
 recommend the re-appointment of any Non-Executive Director at 
the conclusion of their specified term of office having given regard 
to their length of tenure, performance and ability to continue to

independence and knowledge required;
 recommend the re-election by shareholders of any Director in 
accordance with the provisions of the Code having due regard 
to his or her performance and ability to continue to contribute 
to the Board taking into consideration the skills, experience 
and knowledge required and the need for progressive 
refreshing of the Board; and
 report formally to the Board on how the Committee has 
discharged its responsibilities.
When considering the recruitment of a new Director: the Committee 
prepares a full description of the role, skills and capabilities required; 
appoints external search ﬁrms, each time reviewing available options, 
and ensuring that the ﬁrm selected has signed up to the relevant 
industry codes (for example, on diversity) and has no connection 
with the Company; and ﬁnally, engages from time-to-time with the 
Group’s major shareholders on future skills requirements and ideas 
for potential candidates.
The Employee Director is elected by the Employee Directors’ forum, 
which comprises the Employee Directors of the Company’s UK 
subsidiaries, and serves a maximum of three, three-year terms.
The full terms of reference of the Committee can be found on the 
Company’s website (www.ﬁrstgroupplc.com).

Nomination Committee.
Recruitment of Chairman of the Board
Following the announcement by John McFarlane that he would be 
stepping down as Chairman of the Board at the conclusion of the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the Committee commenced 
the process for the appointment of a successor. The process to identify 
a new Non-Executive Chair commenced in September 2014 and was 
led by Drummond Hall, as Senior Independent Director. In accordance 
with best practice, John McFarlane was not involved in the selection 
process, but was consulted for views and insights into the role. 
A comprehensive and rigorous search process was put in place 
with a candidate proﬁle and position speciﬁcation prepared including 
time commitment expected, experience, ability to lead the Board, 
ability to be the public face of the Company with investors and other 
stakeholders, overall responsibility for corporate governance and 
ability to ensure matters of safety, strategy, performance and ﬁnance 
were appropriately implemented by the management team. 
JCA Group, an external search consultancy, was engaged to assist 
with the selection process and conducted a search to identify suitable, 
qualiﬁed candidates. JCA Group held meetings with all current 
Directors to assess their opinion on the attributes required for the new 
Non-Executive Chair. JCA Group has no other connection with the 
Group apart from the provision of senior executive recruitment services. 
An initial candidate list was reduced to a shortlist by Drummond Hall 
and JCA Group following consultations with each Committee member, 
for consideration by the Committee. A number of interviews and 
meetings were then held with shortlisted candidates. As Wolfhart 
Hauser emerged as the preferred candidate, he had the opportunity to 
meet most of the Directors and a number of discussions were held with 
major investors who responded positively on the proposed appointment. 
In addition to regular communications with Directors individually, the 
Board was kept informed of developments and Directors were given 
the opportunity to share their feedback on Wolfhart Hauser before 
unanimously approving his appointment.

Governance Audit Committee
 
Dear fellow shareholder
As Chairman of the Audit Committee, 
I am pleased to present the report of the 
Audit Committee for the year ended 
31 March 2015. 
During the period the Committee has monitored the integrity of the 
Group’s ﬁnancial statements, including the signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting 
judgements, reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal control, reviewed the divisional and Group risk 
proﬁles and monitored the effectiveness, performance and objectivity 
of the internal and external auditors. In addition to these core 
responsibilities, the Committee spent time appointing a new lead 
external audit partner from Deloitte and undertook an in depth 
review of the Insurance function. 
The Committee continues to work closely with the Group Director 
of Internal Audit to ensure the delivery of a comprehensive internal 
audit plan which addresses the Group’s key risks and controls. 
The Committee further considered its approach to external tendering 
and this is set out in further details in this report.
Looking forward to 2015/16, the Committee will keep its agenda 
under review to ensure it addresses the right issues. We will continue 
to monitor and respond to the changing regulatory environment and, 
in particular, the provisions of the revised edition of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code published by the FRC in September 2014 relating 
to risk, going concern and liabilities which will apply to the Company 
for the ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2016.

Chair, Audit Committee
Diversity
The Company takes account of diversity when recruiting, including 
when it considers Board appointments, and will continue to do so 
in the future. All appointments to the Board are made on merit and 
relevant experience, against the criteria identiﬁed by the Committee, 
having regard to the beneﬁts of diversity, including gender. 
The Board recognises the need to create the conditions that foster 
talent and encourage more women to achieve their full potential in their 
careers in the Group. As part of an overall approach to human resource 
management a framework has been developed which includes an 
Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy as well as posters, training and 
promotional videos to support its communication across the Group. 
In addition, focus groups have been held in the UK to discuss the 
policy and better understand the challenges employees face, which 
will help in shaping future diversity and inclusion programmes. 
Whilst the Board is currently below its target of 25% female 
representation at 1 1%, it remains committed to achieving that 
goal as soon as practicable.

 Corporate governance report
continued Role and responsibilities
The Committee acts independently of management to ensure that the 
interests of shareholders are properly protected in relation to ﬁnancial 
reporting, the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control 
and risk management, and in maintaining an appropriate relationship 
with the external auditor. The key responsibilities of the Committee 
are to:
 review the significant issues and judgements of management, 
the methodology and assumptions used in relation to the Group’s 
financial statements and the integrity of the preliminary and 
half-yearly announcements on the Group’s financial performance;
 review the Group’s going concern assumption;
 review and oversee the Group’s relationship with the external 
auditor, monitoring its independence and objectivity;
 review the activities, findings, conclusions and recommendations 
of the external auditor, alongside its reporting to the Committee, 
the management representation letter and the final audit report;
 consider and make recommendations to the Board in respect 
of the appointment, re-appointment, dismissal or resignation, 
effectiveness and remuneration of the external auditor;
 assess the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control 
and risk management, including financial reporting, financial 
controls and the internal audit function; and
 report formally to the Board on how the Committee has 
discharged its responsibilities.
Revised Terms of Reference of the Committee were adopted in 
October 2014 following an annual refresh. The full terms of reference 
of the Committee can be found on the Company’s website  
(www.ﬁrstgroupplc.com). 
Membership and meetings
The current members of the Committee are:
Brian Wallace, Chair
Warwick Brady
Jim Winestock
Brian Wallace has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience, being 
a chartered accountant and having held a number of senior ﬁnance 
roles. The other Committee members have signiﬁcant current or 
recent executive experience in the transport and distribution industries. 
This range and depth of ﬁnancial and commercial experience enables 
the Committee to deal effectively with the matters it is required 
to address and to challenge management when necessary. The 
Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Employee Director, 
Company Secretary, Director of Finance, Group Director of 
Internal Audit and the external auditors are normally invited to 
attend Committee meetings. In addition, Divisional Finance 
Directors and Heads of Group functions are regularly invited 
to present to the Committee.
At the beginning of each meeting the Committee normally meets with 
the external auditor and twice a year with the Group Director of Internal 
Audit, without management present, to discuss any matters relating to 
their remit and any matters arising from external and internal audits. The 
Committee also met during the year with the Group Finance Director 
to discuss the strength of the Finance function.

Audit Committee performance evaluation 
As part of the Board’s annual performance review, an assessment 
of the Committee’s performance was commenced in March 2015, 
facilitated by Independent Board Evaluation, in respect of the year 
ended 31 March 2015. The results of the performance assessment 
were presented and discussed at the June 2015 Board meeting and 
therefore will be disclosed in next year’s Annual Report and Accounts. 
Activities in 2014/15
At its meetings in 2014/15, the Committee considered and 
discharged its responsibilities on the following matters:
Integrity of reported ﬁnancial information
 following a review by senior executive management, assessed 
the Group’s full-year and half-yearly results, and considered the 
significant accounting policies, principal estimates and accounting 
judgements used in their preparation and the transparency and 
clarity of disclosures within them;
 reviewed the matters which informed the Board’s assessment that 
it was appropriate to prepare accounts on a going concern basis;
 reviewed reports from the external auditor on its audit in respect 
of the full-year and review of the half-yearly results prior to them 
being signed on behalf of the Board; and
 reviewed and assessed the process by which the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, was fair, balanced and 
understandable and provided the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 71
Governance Other activities
 reviewed the terms of reference of the Committee and 
recommended certain changes to the Board to ensure they 
were up to date and reflected relevant UK Corporate Governance 
Code provisions;
 received reports on governance and regulatory changes; and
 received a report on matters raised on the confidential reporting 
system and the process for the investigation of such matters to 
ensure that confidential arrangements are in place by which 
employees may raise concerns about possible legal, regulatory 
or other improprieties in matters of financial reporting and 
other matters. 
Policy on the provision of non-audit services
The Committee’s policy on the use of the external auditor for non-audit 
services includes the identiﬁcation of non-audit services which may 
be provided and those prohibited, and a process through which other 
non-audit services may be provided. The policy can be summarised 
as follows:
 Audit-related services – the external auditor can be invited to 
provide services, which in its position as external auditor, it must 
or is best placed to undertake as it is clearly audit related. These 
include review of half-yearly and other interim financial information, 
advice on correct accounting treatment of proposed transactions 
and reporting on regulatory returns.
 Permitted non-audit services – there are a number of projects or 
engagements where the external auditor is best placed to perform 
the work due to their skills and knowledge of the business, or 
experience and market leadership in a particular area. These are 
set out in the policy and include providing tax compliance advice, 
formalities relating to shareholder circulars and various other 
regulatory reports, and professional training. Before engaging in 
any work of this type, approval is required from the Group Finance 
Director, with services likely to cost more than £125,000 requiring 
the approval of the Committee.
 Other permitted non-audit services – for those projects or 
engagements which are not covered by the permitted non-audit 
services category and where the external auditor is best placed 
to provide them, approval is required from the Group Finance 
Director, with services likely to cost more than £75,000 requiring 
the approval of the Committee. In addition, the Committee shall 
consider whether a tender should be conducted before awarding 
such work to the external auditor. 
 Not permitted – there are some projects that are not to be 
performed by the external auditor because these projects 
would represent a threat to the independence of the audit team, 
for example where the external auditor is remunerated through 
a success fee or where the project could lead to the external 
auditor being in a position of auditing their own work or making 
management decisions for the Company or its subsidiaries.
Internal control, risk management and internal audit
 reviewed the design and effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal control and the disclosures made in the Annual 
Report and Accounts on this matter;
 reviewed and challenged the Group’s significant risks identified 
by management in the Group risk map, and reviewed the 
effectiveness of the risk management processes followed 
by the divisions and at Group level;
 monitored and assessed the Group’s insurance arrangements;
 approved the annual internal audit plan and reviewed reports from 
the Internal Audit department relating to control matters. Progress 
against the internal audit plan was monitored and any deviations 
to the plan were agreed, and considered reports on resourcing 
and expertise of the Internal Audit department;
 approved revised delegated authority limits for capital expenditure;
 approved new terms of reference of the Internal Audit department;
 received reports from the Group Legal Director on litigation 
matters; and
 reviewed the Group’s approach to cyber risk, disaster recovery 
and business continuity planning.
External auditor
 approved the terms of engagement of the external auditor, the 
fees paid to them and the scope of work carried out by them;
 considered and approved a policy on the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor, and recommended for approval 
by the Board policies on the use of the external auditor for 
non-audit services and the employment of former employees 
of the external auditor;
 reviewed the performance and effectiveness of the external 
auditor in respect of the previous financial year;
 assessed the objectivity and independence of the external auditor. 
In assessing independence and objectivity, the Committee 
considered the level and nature of service provided by the external 
auditor as well as confirmation from the external auditor that it has 
remained independent within the meaning of the APB Ethical 
Standards for Auditors; 
 received reports on the findings of the external auditor during 
the half-yearly review and annual audit, and reviewed the 
recommendations made to management by the external 
auditor and management’s responses;
 following a thorough selection process, approved the 
appointment of a new lead audit partner; and
 recommended to the Board the re-appointment of the 
external auditor.

 Corporate governance report
continued Assessing the effectiveness of the external audit process
The Audit Committee manages the relationship with the external 
auditor, on behalf of the Board. During 2014/15, the effectiveness 
of the external audit process was reviewed by the Committee and 
the ﬁndings reported to the Board. This involved an initial assessment 
of the delivery and performance of the external auditor against the 
external audit plan for the year, which includes the reports and updates 
provided to the Committee. An annual assessment was then carried 
out by the Committee, taking into account the results of questionnaires 
completed by each of the divisions and Group management. These 
questionnaires covered a variety of topics including: the audit partners 
and team; the planning and execution of the audit approach; and 
insights and added value provided by the audit process. Feedback 
from the annual assessment was shared with the external auditor so 
that any areas for improvement could be followed up. The Committee 
concluded that the external audit process was effective overall. 
Signiﬁcant issues and judgements How the Audit Committee addressed these issues
Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets 
Management exercises a signiﬁcant amount of judgement 
during the impairment testing process as it is based on an 
estimation of future cash ﬂows and a suitable discount rate.
The Committee has considered the inputs for the impairment test model. 
The cash ﬂow forecasts have been reviewed alongside past performance 
and committed operational changes to the business. The discount rate 
has been benchmarked to externally available data. The growth rate 
assumptions have been applied in line with both market data and the 
macro-economic environment in the UK and North America. Sensitivities 
to the model inputs have been tested for reasonableness.
Legal provisions
Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of 
the likelihood and valuation of the expense required to settle 
the  relevant obligation and, where applicable, the discount 
rate used to calculate the expected settlement.
The Committee has considered the assumptions used for estimating the 
valuation of provisions. The legal issues are regularly reviewed, with the 
related provisions being based on advice from external legal counsel.
Self-insurance provisions
Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate 
of the likely settlement of all known incidents. A valuation of the 
expense required to settle the obligation and, where applicable, 
the discount rate is used to calculate the expected settlement.
The Committee has reviewed the provision and considered the assumptions 
used to calculate the liability. Independent actuarial expert advice on the 
adequacy of the provisions against such liabilities is sought on a regular 
basis and the discount rate has been benchmarked against external data.
Pensions 
The Group participates in a number of deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
schemes. Management exercises signiﬁcant judgement when 
determining the assumptions used to value the pension 
liabilities as these are materially sensitive to changes in the 
underlying assumptions.
Management has engaged with external experts and the Committee has 
considered the assumptions used for calculating the liability. Sensitivity 
analysis has been performed on the key assumptions which are: the 
discount rate; the inﬂation rate; and the mortality rates. The overall liability 
has also been assessed for reasonableness.
Revenue recognition 
Management must exercise judgement when determining the 
recoverability of amounts due and the carrying value of related 
assets and liabilities arising from franchises and long term 
service contracts.
The Committee has reviewed the revenue recognition policies. These 
policies and their application are in line with accounting standards. Regular 
forecasts are compiled on the outcome of these types of franchises and 
contracts to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions applied.
Signiﬁcant issues
The external audit process identiﬁes signiﬁcant issues and accounting 
judgements which are reviewed by the Committee. These are 
summarised in the table below. Management prepared papers 
and analysis on the signiﬁcant issues and judgements which were 
discussed in Committee meetings during the year. The Committee 
also discussed these issues with the external auditor at the half year 
and year end. All the signiﬁcant issues were also areas of focus for 
the external auditor as detailed in the auditor’s report.

Governance Board Safety Committee
 
Dear fellow shareholder
I have been impressed by FirstGroup’s 
approach and dedication to creating a 
strong safety culture throughout the Group 
and its similarities to UPS, one of the largest 
global courier and providers of supply chain 
management solutions, where I worked for 
over 40 years, and where safety is ingrained 
in the culture. I was therefore delighted to 
accept the role of the Chair of the Board 
Safety Committee and use my experience 
to further embed safety as a personal core 
value throughout the Group. 
The Board Safety Committee was established in 2013/14 to assist 
the Board in overseeing management’s processes, standards and 
strategies for managing safety commitments and responsibilities 
across the Group as well as challenging the Group to review and 
improve its operational safety performance and culture. 
The Committee met twice during the year, the Committee’s agenda 
covered a range of safety issues including: reviewing a number of the 
Group’s safety initiatives; the role of divisional safety committees; 
reviewing safety performance and the development of the Group’s 
safety culture with a key focus on work conducted by Aubrey Daniels 
International, external safety advisers, on behavioural safety. Going 
forward, there will be three scheduled meetings of the Committee 
a year.
In December 2014, I had the opportunity to join Tim O’Toole and 
over 170 general managers at the Group’s annual safety conference 
in London. The key focus of the conference was on making safety a 
personal core value, with those attending required to make a personal 
commitment to changing their safety behaviour. The safety conference, 
combined with the recommendations from Aubrey Daniels International, 
has resulted in a number of changes to the way the Group approaches 
safety, which I am conﬁdent will enhance its culture and performance 
going forward.
Jim Winestock
Chair, Board Safety Committee
External audit tendering
As disclosed in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts, in light of 
changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to audit 
tendering and the publication of the FRC transitional guidance, the 
Committee agreed to review its approach to audit tendering in 2014/15. 
The current external auditor, Deloitte LLP , was appointed in 1998 
following a tendering process. The Committee has undertaken a review 
of Deloitte’s performance every year since its appointment. Following a 
thorough selection process, the Committee appointed a new lead audit 
partner in 2015, who will assume his role following the conclusion of 
the 2014/15 audit. As the Group implements its transformation plans, 
consistency of approach in the audit is considered to be of particular 
importance. The Company will not, therefore, be putting its audit out 
to tender in the next year, but the Committee will review this annually.
In 2014, the Competition and Markets Authority set out a package of 
remedies in response to its ﬁndings on its market investigation into the 
supply of statutory audit services. One of its principal remedies is that 
FTSE 350 companies must put their statutory audit engagement out 
to tender at least every ten years. Under the transitional arrangements 
proposed by the Competition and Markets Authority, FirstGroup would 
be required to put its external audit out to tender by 31 March 2023. 
Under the EU audit reform rules which become effective in 2016, the 
mandatory rotation of external audit ﬁrms after ten years is required, 
extendable to 20 years with a tender at the end of the initial ten year 
period by way of derogation from the UK Government. Under the 
transitional provisions set out in the rules, Deloitte’s last possible 
audit of the Group would be for the year ending 31 March 2024.
Based on the above, it would appear likely that a tender for external 
audit services and a change of external auditor will not be required 
before 31 March 2023. Notwithstanding these requirements, it remains 
the Committee’s intention to put the external audit out to tender during 
the new lead audit partner’s ﬁve year tenure, which is due to expire at 
the conclusion of the 2019/20 audit. This means that the latest time the 
external audit will be put out to tender is 2019 so that the process is 
completed by the conclusion of the 2019/20 audit.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 75
Governance Dear fellow shareholder
I am pleased to present my ﬁrst Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for FirstGroup 
following my appointment to the Board 
and as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee in June 2014. I trust you will 
ﬁnd this report clear and comprehensive 
and that it provides you with the necessary 
information to demonstrate the link 
between the Group’s strategy and 
transformation plans, its performance 
and the remuneration outcomes for 
our Executive Directors.
Firstly, I am delighted to welcome Drummond Hall, who joined the 
Committee in June 2014. David Begg, Colin Hood, John Sievwright 
and Jim Winestock stood down from the Committee in June 2014. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires the Committee to 
comprise three independent Non-Executive Directors. Since June 2014 
the Committee has had two members, both of whom are independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Given the large time commitment required 
from Committee members over the past year and the existing 
commitments of the other Non-Executive Directors, it was not 
possible to appoint a Committee member with the time to contribute 
fully to the Committee. The appointment of a further member will be 
discussed with Wolfhart Hauser following his appointment as Chairman 
at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting and a new Committee 
member appointed during the 2015/16 ﬁnancial year.
My priority as a new Non-Executive Director and Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee has been to understand the business strategy 
and then, with the Committee, review whether the remuneration policies 
and practices as they apply to the Executive Directors and senior 
managers are aligned with the strategy and appropriately support 
the delivery of the signiﬁcant improvement required. 
Approach to remuneration
The Group’s strategic objectives as set out in the Strategic Report are: 
 driving growth through attractive commercial propositions in our 
passenger revenue businesses;
 continuous improvement in operating and financial performance;
 prudent investment in our key assets (fleets, systems and people); 
 focused and disciplined bidding in our contract businesses; and 
 maintaining responsible partnerships with our customers and 
communities.
The Committee believes that achievement against these objectives, 
which underpin the transformation plans and medium term targets that 
have been communicated to shareholders, will deliver strong long term 
ﬁnancial performance and shareholder value on a sustainable basis. 
 Statement by Chair of the  
Remuneration Committee
Remuneration philosophy
The key principles underpinning the Committee’s approach 
to executive remuneration are:
Alignment with strategy and business objectives – 
remuneration for FirstGroup’s Executive Directors and senior 
managers incentivises the delivery of both.
Reward performance – remuneration provides a strong and 
demonstrable link between incentives and performance delivery 
in a consistent and responsible way, ensuring there is a clear line 
of sight between the performance of the Company and payments 
made to Executive Directors and senior managers. Alignment 
between the interests of shareholders and Executive Directors 
to build a sustainable performance culture is a key focus.
Performance biased framework – components of remuneration 
offer a performance-biased framework for remuneration which is 
consistent with the Group’s scale and unique circumstances, and 
which enables Executive Directors and senior managers to share 
in the long term success of the Group, without delivering  
over-generous benefits or encouraging short term measures or 
excessive risk taking. 
Competitive remuneration – designed to facilitate the long 
term success of the Company and framed in the context of 
total remuneration packages offered by relevant comparator 
companies. The ability to recruit and retain high calibre executives 
with the appropriate skills to implement FirstGroup’s strategy and 
transformation plans is critical to its success.
Simplicity and transparency – the Committee seeks to deliver 
both for our shareholders and participants, with performance 
targets clearly aligned with the Company’s short and long 
term goals.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 76
 Directors’ remuneration report Appointment of new Chairman
As reported on 1 1 March 2015, Wolfhart Hauser joined the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director and Chairman designate on 18 May 2015 and will 
become Chairman at the conclusion of the 2015 Annual General Meeting. 
The Committee carefully considered the fees payable to Wolfhart and 
agreed that given his skills and experience as well as the time commitment 
and responsibilities of the role he should receive the normal base 
Non-Executive Director fee of £52,500 per annum as Chairman designate 
and £280,000 per annum as Chairman. No termination payments will be 
made to John McFarlane in respect of his standing down from the Board.
2014/15 performance and reward
Over the course of the year, the Group has made important progress 
in several key areas. In particular, the success of First Student’s 
contract portfolio improvements as well as the continued progress 
of the UK Bus turnaround plan. Whilst demand for Greyhound 
services was adversely affected by the signiﬁcant and rapid reduction 
in fuel prices, despite the rapid and extensive actions of management 
to mitigate, this was offset by good performances in our First Transit 
and UK Rail operations, which both achieved growth towards the top 
end of our expectations with robust margins.
Overall, we are broadly where we expected to be at this stage of the 
transformation plan. However, the Group lost three rail franchises in 
the year, which will impact future earnings.
The Committee reviewed the outcome of the 2014/15 bonus for 
the Executive Directors in this context. The bonus outcome was 75% 
of maximum potential, compared to a target of 50% and a maximum 
of 100%, with Group adjusted operating proﬁt generating 48%, Group 
cash ﬂow 10%, non-ﬁnancial elements 7% and individual performance 
10%. The Committee also reviewed other performance factors, in 
particular the rail franchise losses. After careful consideration, the 
Committee determined that the Group adjusted operating proﬁt 
element should be reduced to 30%, equivalent to the target 
performance, to reﬂect the loss of the rail franchises during the year 
and the future impact on earnings. Thus reducing the bonus outcome 
to 57% of maximum potential. The Committee believes that this 
represents a fair balance between the loss of the rail franchises 
and the progress made in the turnaround of the Group.
The 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan awards lapsed in 2015 after failing 
to achieve the required total shareholder return and earnings per 
share targets.
In recognition of the concerns raised by shareholders over the 
degree of disclosure provided to justify and explain previous bonus 
payments, the Committee has materially improved the level of 
disclosure in this Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Approach for 2015/16 onwards
The key task for the Committee this year has been to undertake a 
comprehensive review of Executive Director and senior management 
remuneration looking at all aspects of remuneration and how each best 
supports the future success of FirstGroup. We considered what was 
appropriate for the business and the market in which we operate, and 
have taken into account feedback from shareholders, best and market 
practice, and the key principles of good corporate governance. Prior to 
commencing the task, the Committee appointed new remuneration 
advisers, PwC. 
As a result of the review and following consultation with major 
shareholders, the Investment Association and Institutional Shareholder 
Services (ISS), the Committee has made a number of amendments to 
the Group’s remuneration framework that:
 with immediate effect, introduce a number of best practice 
features and strengthen the alignment of an Executive Director’s 
remuneration package with the Group’s strategy and with 
shareholder interests;
 provide a recruitment policy which enables any new Executive 
Director to be recruited with a package mix that reflects the 
chosen comparator group; and
 enable a transition strategy so that, over time, the package mix 
of existing Executive Directors will become more focused on 
variable pay, but with no intent to change the overall positioning 
of the value of the package against the market.
The key proposed changes to the remuneration framework are set out 
below and are split into two areas: those that will apply immediately and 
those that will be phased in over time or as future Executive Directors 
join the Board.
Immediate changes to remuneration policy:
 increase shareholding requirements to 200% of base salary for 
the CEO and 150% of base salary for other Executive Directors 
providing greater alignment with shareholder value over the 
long term. From June 2015, Tim O’Toole will allocate £15,000 
of his gross monthly base salary (equivalent to over 20% of his 
base salary) to acquire shares in the Company, with shares 
being purchased from the post-tax and post-National Insurance 
(NI) amount;
 in line with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, introduce clawback for the Executive Annual Bonus Plan 
(EABP) and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), in addition to malus 
that is currently in place, and a two year post-vesting holding 
period on future LTIP awards;
 during April and May 2015 the Committee consulted with a 
number of major investors on the inclusion of a returns-based 
metric (ROCE) alongside the existing LTIP performance metrics 
of EPS and TSR, with the TSR peer group amended to reflect the 
comparator group selected for benchmarking of remuneration 
policies and practices. Following feedback from major investors, 
which was supportive of the overall proposed approach, it is 
intended that future LTIP awards will be based on a combination 
of metrics which are aligned to the Company’s strategic objectives 
and hence with sustainable shareholder value creation. A further 
investor consultation will be conducted later in the year following 
the publication of the Company’s 2015 preliminary results and 
Annual Report and Accounts. The consultation will cover the 
choice of performance metrics as well as their definitions, 
weightings and target levels of performance. To enable the 
outcomes from the consultation to be appropriately reflected 
and to allow for full input from the new Chairman, grants of LTIP 
awards will be deferred until immediately after the announcement 
of the Company’s half-yearly results in November 2015; and

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 77
Governance as noted above, it is intended to utilise a single comparator group 
for the benchmarking of remuneration, and any relative TSR 
measurement retained in the LTIP . This group comprises 
companies in the travel, business services and industrial 
sectors, which are of comparable scale, complexity and activity 
to FirstGroup. The comparator group is set out on page 92. 
For current Executive Directors, no changes to base salary or incentive 
opportunity are planned for 2015/16, as the Committee considers 
overall pay to be competitive for the current post holders against our 
newly deﬁned comparator group. 
Medium term changes to remuneration policy 
Analysis of the current Executive Director structures showed that 
the incentive opportunities are signiﬁcantly behind market competitive 
levels. For the current Chief Executive and to a lesser extent the current 
Group Finance Director, this is offset by a base salary that is higher 
than the comparator group median, meaning that overall compensation 
is competitive against the newly deﬁned comparator group. Therefore, 
the Committee does not have any immediate plans to change incentive 
opportunities for the current Executive Directors. However, the 
Committee wishes to transition Executive Director remuneration 
over time to better align it with the practice in the chosen comparator 
group, with a greater weighting towards variable pay, and to have in 
place a policy that enables the recruitment of new Executive Directors, 
if required, on arrangements that are more reﬂective of the package 
mix within our chosen comparator group. Accordingly, for new 
recruits the policy will: 
 increase the Chief Executive’s and other Executive Directors’ 
maximum opportunity under the EABP to 150% of base salary 
(from 120% and 100% respectively); and
 set the maximum annual award under the LTIP at 200% of base 
salary for the Chief Executive and 175% for other Executive 
Directors (the current maximum award level as set out in our 
current remuneration policy is 150%; however, more recently 
awards have been limited to 120% of base salary). A maximum 
opportunity of 300% may be used in exceptional circumstances, 
such as to aid recruitment.
The Committee believes that the above approach is more aligned with 
market norms and will enable the Company to recruit competitively, as 
required, and ensure Executive Directors’ remuneration packages are 
fully aligned with business performance. Following the announcement 
on 10 June 2015 that Chris Surch will be retiring from the role of Group 
Finance Director in January 2016, his replacement will be recruited on 
this basis.
Impact on existing Executive Directors
Overall the Committee considers total remuneration for current 
Executive Directors to be broadly competitive, with lower than market 
incentive opportunities being offset by above median base salaries. 
No immediate adjustments to remuneration are therefore proposed. 
However, in light of the market positioning against the new comparator 
group, the Committee has determined that there will be no base salary 
increases for the current Executive Directors over the life of this policy. 
To the extent that any increases in remuneration are deemed justiﬁed, 
these will be achieved through changes to the variable pay opportunity 
rather than base pay. Substantial increases to the total pay opportunity 
are not envisaged and major investors will be consulted prior to any 
change in incentive opportunity for existing Executive Directors. 
However, this approach does allow, over time, the package for 
existing Executive Directors to be transitioned to be more aligned to 
performance and more aligned to our chosen comparator group. 
Owing to the changes set out above, a new remuneration policy will be 
presented to shareholders for approval in a binding vote at the Annual 
General Meeting on 16 July 2015. It will replace the previous policy, 
and the Committee expects it then to be in place for the next three 
years. The Annual Report on Remuneration, which describes how the 
current policy approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM has been 
implemented in the year under review and how the new remuneration 
policy will be implemented for the year ahead, will be subject to  
an advisory vote at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.  
The Committee ﬁrmly believes the changes to the remuneration policy 
are in the best interests of the Company and fully support the 
Company’s strategy and business objectives, and have no hesitation in 
recommending both resolutions to shareholders.
Senior managers’ remuneration
The Committee has also considered the structure of pay for those 
employees immediately below the Executive Directors. In order 
to provide a strong focus on each division achieving speciﬁc 
goals to underpin and drive overall Company performance, the 
Committee intends to align a proportion of the LTIP exclusively 
to divisional performance objectives for an interim period to 
incentivise divisional goals. Thereafter, the Committee will 
review whether it is still relevant and necessary, and may 
choose to return the LTIP to a fully Company-wide incentive.
Shareholder engagement
The Committee is committed to an open and transparent dialogue 
with shareholders on the issue of executive remuneration and 
considers these engagements vital to ensure its remuneration 
strategy continues to be aligned with the long term interests of 
FirstGroup’s shareholders.
I have appreciated the time various major shareholders and their 
representative bodies have put into helping us develop our new 
remuneration policy and practices over the past 12 months. 
The challenge of providing motivational and shareholder aligned 
remuneration arrangements in a recovery situation is complex, 
but we believe with the assistance of our major shareholders 
we can strike a fair balance. I look forward to your support at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Policy report
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the Company and has been prepared in accordance with 
The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The policy has been developed 
taking account of the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to remuneration. The Committee also takes signiﬁcant account 
of guidelines issued by the Investment Association, ISS and other shareholder bodies when setting the remuneration framework. It also seeks to 
maintain an active and constructive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance generally and 
any changes to the Company’s executive pay arrangements in particular.
The new remuneration policy will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting on 16 July 2015 and, subject to receiving 
majority shareholder support, the policy will operate from the date of approval and is intended to remain applicable for the following three 
years. Information on how the Company intends to implement the policy for the current ﬁnancial year is set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration section.

The Committee operates within its policy at all times. It will also operate the EABP and L TIP according to the rules of each respective plan and 
consistently with normal market practice and the Listing Rules, including ﬂexibility in a number of areas. How the Committee will retain ﬂexibility includes:
 when to make awards and payments;
 how to determine the size of an award, a payment, or when and how much of an award should vest;
 who receives an award or payment;
 how to deal with a change of control, restructuring or any other corporate event of the Group;
 whether an Executive Director or senior manager is a good/bad leaver for incentive plan purposes and whether and what proportion 
of awards vest at the time of leaving or at the original vesting date(s);
 how and whether an award or its performance conditions may be adjusted in certain circumstances (e.g. change of accounting policy);
 the choice of (and adjustment of) performance measures, weightings and targets for each incentive plan from year to year in accordance 
with the remuneration policy set out above and the rules of each plan; and
 amending plan rules in accordance with their terms.
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may, as appropriate, be the 
subject of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.
Setting performance measures and targets
In determining the levels of executive reward, the Committee places considerable emphasis on ensuring a strong and demonstrable link between 
actual remuneration received and the delivery of FirstGroup’s strategic plans. 
The measures and weightings used under the EABP are selected annually to reﬂect the Group’s key strategic initiatives for the year and reﬂect 
both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial objectives. The targets for the EABP are set by reference to the Company’s strategy and internal budgets as well 
as the external context, such as market forecasts. This approach seeks to ensure that the targets are appropriately challenging.
The LTIP provides a focus on delivering superior returns to shareholders by providing rewards for longer term growth and shareholder return 
outperformance. The Committee reviews annually whether the performance measures, weightings and calibration of targets remain appropriate 
and sufﬁciently challenging taking into account the Company’s strategic objectives and shareholder interests. 
All-employee share awards are not subject to performance conditions in line with the treatment of such awards for all employees and 
in accordance with the applicable tax legislation.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 82
 Directors’ remuneration report
 continued Shareholding guidelines
The CEO is expected to hold shares equivalent in value to a minimum of 200% of base salary and other Executive Directors 150% of base salary 
within a ﬁve-year period from the later of their date of appointment or the approval of this remuneration policy. Executive Directors are further 
required to retain at least 75% of the shares, net of tax, vesting under a Group share incentive plan or otherwise acquire shares in the Company 
until the shareholding guideline is met. The Committee reserves the right to relax or waive the application of the guidelines where it believes it is 
justiﬁed by the circumstances.
In addition, Executive Directors are required to hold shares which vest under the LTIP for an additional holding period of two years following the 
three year performance period, with only those shares required to cover a tax liability on exercise or vesting of an LTIP award permitted to be sold. 
Group employee considerations
In setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the overall approach to reward for employees in the 
Group. FirstGroup operates in a number of markets and its employees carry out a diverse range of roles across the UK and US. All employees, 
including Directors, are paid by reference to the market rate and base salary levels are reviewed regularly. When considering salary increases for 
Executive Directors, the Committee pays close attention to pay and employment conditions across the wider workforce.
The key difference between Executive Director remuneration and other employees is that, overall, the remuneration policy for Executive Directors 
is more heavily weighted towards variable pay linked to business performance than for other employees, so that remuneration will increase or 
decrease in line with business performance and align the interests of Executive Directors and shareholders. In particular, long term incentives 
are provided only to the most senior executives as they are reserved for those considered to have the greatest potential to inﬂuence overall levels 
of performance. 
The Committee does not formally consult with employees on Executive Director remuneration, but as a result of the Company’s all-employee 
share plans UK-based employees are able to become shareholders in the Company and can comment on the remuneration policy in the 
same way as other shareholders. In addition, the Company provides a number of forums for employees to provide feedback on remuneration 
as well as receiving employee views from the Group Employee Director, who attends meetings of the Committee at the invitation of the Chair 
of the Committee. 
Legacy arrangements
The Committee may approve payments to satisfy commitments agreed prior to the approval of this remuneration policy. This includes previous 
incentive awards that are currently outstanding and unvested which have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration reports. 
The Committee may also approve payments outside of this remuneration policy in order to satisfy legacy arrangements made to an employee 
prior to (and not in contemplation of) promotion to the Board of Directors.
All historic awards that were granted but remain outstanding remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms.

The basis of calculation and key assumptions used to complete the charts above are as follows:
Minimum – only ﬁxed pay is payable i.e. base salary, beneﬁts and pension or cash in lieu of pension. No bonus is payable i.e. performance is 
below threshold levels. Base salary levels (on which other elements of the remuneration package are calculated) are based on those applying for 
2015/16 and beneﬁts are based on the cash cost to the Company or the taxable value to the Executive Director. The value of the Chief Executive’s 
pension beneﬁt and allowance is assumed to be in line with that for 2014/15 as set out in the Executive Directors’ total remuneration table. The 
value of the Group Finance Director’s pension allowance is 20% of his base salary.
On-target – ﬁxed pay plus 50% of maximum EABP payout and a LTIP award with a face value of 120% of base salary vests at 25% of maximum.
Maximum – ﬁxed pay plus 100% of maximum EABP payout and a LTIP award with a face value of 120% of base salary vests in full.

Governance Approach to recruitment remuneration 
The Committee believes it is vital to be able to attract and recruit high calibre executives who are focused on delivering the Group’s strategic 
plans, while relating reward to performance in the context of appropriate risk management, and aligning the interests of Executive Directors and 
senior managers with those of shareholders to build a sustainable performance culture.
The Committee’s approach when considering the overall remuneration arrangements in the recruitment of a new Executive Director is to take 
account of his or her remuneration package in their prior role, the market positioning of the remuneration package and not to pay more than is 
necessary to facilitate their recruitment.
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director will be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved remuneration policy 
in force at the time of appointment, except:
Salary The salary level shall take into account companies in the comparator group, which comprises companies that are broadly 
in line with FirstGroup’s size, structure and complexity and have features that are comparable to FirstGroup. 
The Committee has the ﬂexibility to set the salary of a new Executive Director at a discount to the market level initially, 
with a series of planned increases implemented over the following few years to bring the salary to the desired positioning, 
subject to individual performance. 
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee has the ability to set the salary of a new Executive Director at a rate higher 
than the market level to reﬂect the criticality of the role and the experience and performance of the individual.
Beneﬁts The Company may award certain additional beneﬁts and other allowances including, but not limited to, those to assist with 
relocation support, temporary living and transportation expenses, educational costs for children and tax equalisation to 
allow ﬂexibility in employing an overseas national.
Pension beneﬁts Any new Executive Director based outside the UK will be eligible to participate in pension or pension allowance, insurance 
and other beneﬁt programmes in line with local practice.
Annual bonus The maximum bonus opportunity shall be 150% of base salary.
Long Term 
Incentive Plan
The maximum opportunity shall be 200% of base salary for a newly recruited Chief Executive and 175% of base salary 
for other newly recruited Executive Directors. However, a maximum opportunity of 300% of base salary may be used in 
exceptional circumstances, in addition to any buy-out of forteited awards.
Replacement  
awards
The Committee shall consider what cash or replacement share-based awards, if any, are reasonably necessary to 
facilitate the recruitment of a new Executive Director in all circumstances. This includes an assessment of the awards 
and any other compensation or beneﬁts item that would be forfeited on leaving their current employer.
These payments would not exceed what is considered by the Committee to be a fair estimate of remuneration lost 
when leaving the former employer and would reﬂect, as far as possible, the nature and time horizons attaching to that 
remuneration and the impact of any performance conditions.
If the Executive Director’s former employer pays a portion of the remuneration that was deemed foregone, the 
replacement payments will be reduced by an equivalent amount.
In the case of an internal executive appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will 
be allowed to pay out according to its existing terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In 
addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment will continue.
Notice periods The Committee shall utilise notice periods of up to 12 months.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fee arrangement shall be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy in force at that time.

 Directors’ remuneration report
 continued Executive Directors’ service agreements
The Executive Directors’ service agreements, including arrangements for early termination, are carefully considered by the Committee and 
are designed to recruit, retain and motivate Executive Directors of the calibre required to manage the Company. The Committee’s policy is for 
Executive Directors’ service contracts to be terminable on no more than one year’s notice. The details of existing Executive Directors’ service 
contracts are summarised in the table below:
Executive Director Date of service contract Notice period
Tim O’Toole 25 January 2011 12 months
Chris Surch 9 May 2012 6 months
Policy on payment for loss of ofﬁce
Executive Directors’ service agreements contain provisions for payment in lieu of notice. The Company is unequivocally against rewards for failure; 
the circumstances of any departure, including the individual’s performance, would be taken into account in every case. Directors’ service 
agreements are kept for inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered ofﬁce.
Service agreements may be terminated without notice and without payment in lieu of notice in certain circumstances, such as gross misconduct. 
The Company may require the Executive Director to work during their notice period or may choose to place the individual on garden leave, for 
example to ensure the protection of the Company’s and shareholders’ interests where the Executive Director has access to commercially 
sensitive information.
Except in the case of gross misconduct or resignation, the Company may at its absolute discretion reimburse for reasonable professional fees 
relating to the termination of employment and, where an Executive Director has been required to re-locate, to pay reasonable repatriation costs, 
including possible tax exposure costs. 
In the event of an Executive Director’s departure, any outstanding share awards will be treated in accordance with the plan rules as follows:
Plan Treatment on cessation
EABP The EABP provides no entitlement to a bonus following cessation of employment, unless the leaver is considered a good leaver. 
Where an individual is considered a good leaver (in the event of death or termination of employment by reason of ill-health, 
disability, injury, statutory redundancy, agreed retirement, sale of employing company or business out of the Group or at the 
discretion of the Committee) a performance-related bonus will be paid. This will be based on the proportion of the bonus year 
for which the individual has been actively employed and bonus (if any) will be paid at the normal time, although the Committee 
retains discretion to pay it earlier in appropriate circumstances. 
There is no entitlement to any bonus award under the EABP for any ﬁnancial year where an Executive Director has not been actively 
working, even if still in employment. The Committee has discretion to make an award in these circumstances, but would only 
consider exercising its discretion if this were justiﬁed by the circumstances and timing of the Executive Director’s departure. The 
Committee will not exercise that discretion in respect of any period when the Executive Director is on garden leave. Any resulting 
bonus payment will normally be time pro-rated and be based on the level of performance achieved.
Deferred share awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment or, at the Committee’s discretion, on service of notice of 
termination of employment. However, under ‘good leaver’ provisions (other than in the case of death) unvested EABP deferred 
shares will vest either at the end of the vesting period or in the event of termination by reason of ill-health on the date of cessation 
of employment or any other date determined by the Committee. Where an award vests early, the good leaver will receive a 
pro-rated number of shares to reﬂect the acceleration of vesting, although in the event of termination by reason of ill-health the 
Company may exercise discretion to waive pro-rating. In the case of death, deferred share awards vest on the date of death and 
no pro-rating is applied.
Long Term 
Incentive Plan
Awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment.
However, in ‘good leaver’ circumstances (other than in the case of death) unvested LTIP shares will vest either at the end of the 
performance period or in the event of termination of employment by reason of ill-health on the date of cessation of employment 
to the extent the performance conditions have been satisﬁed as determined by the Committee. A good leaver will normally 
receive a pro-rated proportion of any outstanding LTIP awards. The Committee may choose to allow certain awards to vest while 
others lapse, depending on the circumstances of the case. In the case of death, awards vest on the date of death and are not 
subject to the performance conditions, with pro-rating applying in the same way as for good leavers.

Governance Plan Treatment on cessation
All-employee 
share plans
Awards will vest in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan, which do not permit the exercise of any discretion 
by the Committee.
Policy on external appointments
The Committee believes that the Company can beneﬁt from Executive Directors holding one approved non-executive directorship of another 
company, offering Executive Directors the opportunity to broaden their experience and knowledge. Company policy is to allow Executive 
Directors to retain the fees earned from such appointments.
Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment
The Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, but each has a letter of appointment with the Company. Each 
letter of appointment generally provides for a three-month notice period. Non-Executive Directors are normally appointed for two consecutive 
three-year terms, with any third term of three years being subject to rigorous review and taking into account the need progressively to refresh 
the Board.
In line with the requirement of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman are subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders at each AGM. The appointment of each of the Non-Executive Directors is subject to early termination without 
compensation if he or she is not re-appointed at a meeting of shareholders.
Remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors may on occasion receive reimbursement of costs incurred in relation to professional advice. These payments, if made, 
are taxable beneﬁts to the Non-Executive Director and the tax arising is paid by the Company on the Director’s behalf.
Chairman’s fee
The fee for the Chairman is determined by the Committee and reﬂects the commitment, demands and responsibility of the role. The fee is paid 
monthly and can either be taken in cash or shares or a combination of both. The fee is inclusive of all Committee roles and is not performance-
related or pensionable. Limited beneﬁts relating to travel, accommodation and meals may also be payable in certain circumstances, with the tax 
arising being paid by the Company on the Chairman’s behalf.
John McFarlane receives a fee of £250,000 per annum and Wolfhart Hauser will receive a fee of £280,000 upon succession to the role. The fee 
payable to the Chairman may be varied (either up or down) from this level during the three year period that this remuneration policy operates to 
ensure it continues to appropriately recognise the requirements of the role.
Group Employee Director
The Group Employee Director receives a normal remuneration package, including participation in any beneﬁt and incentive arrangements 
and pension scheme, for his or her regular employment duties appropriate to the role performed. The Group Employee Director’s fee as 
a Non-Executive Director is payable in addition to normal remuneration as an employee of FirstGroup. 
 Directors’ remuneration report
 continued
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 86 Non-Executive Director fees
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole, upon the recommendation of the Executive Directors 
and the Chairman. 
The policy on Non-Executive Directors’ fees is:
Purpose and link 
to strategy
To be sufﬁcient to attract, motivate and retain Non-Executive Directors necessary to contribute to a high performing Board.
Operation Fees are determined by the Board, within the limits set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, with Non-Executive 
Directors abstaining from any discussion or decision on their fees.
The Board takes account of recognised best practice standards for such positions when determining the fee level 
and structure.
The Non-Executive Directors receive a base fee, with additional fees payable for chairmanship of the Company’s key 
Committees and for performing the Senior Independent Director role. Fees are paid monthly and can either be taken in 
cash or shares or a combination of both.
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment contain provisions for payment in lieu of notice.
Other than the Group Employee Director, Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Company’s incentive 
arrangements or receive any pension provision.
Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for expenses, and any tax arising on those expenses is settled directly by the 
Company. To the extent that these are deemed taxable beneﬁts, they will be included in the Annual Report on Remuneration, 
as required.
Reasonable costs of travel and accommodation for business purposes are reimbursed to Non-Executive Directors. On the 
limited occasions when it is appropriate for a Non-Executive Director’s spouse or partner to attend, such as to a business 
event, the Company will meet these costs. The Company will meet any tax liabilities that may arise on such expenses.
Fee levels Fees (per annum) are:
 Non-Executive Director base fee: £52,500
 Group Employee Director: £39,375
 Senior Independent Director: £7 ,500
 Chair of Audit Committee: £12,000
 Chairs of Remuneration Committee and Board Safety Committee: £10,000.
The above fee levels may be varied (either up or down) during the three year period that the remuneration policy operates 
to ensure they continue to appropriately recognise the time commitment and responsibilities of the role, increases or 
decreases to fee levels for Non-Executive Directors in general and fee levels in companies of a similar size and complexity.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee values its continued dialogue with shareholders and engages directly with them and their representative bodies at the earliest 
opportunity. Shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM, as well as any additional feedback and guidance received during the year 
is considered by the Committee as it develops the Company’s remuneration framework and practices.

  In 2011, Tim O’Toole was awarded 263,490 shares under a Retention Award Plan in the form of a conditional share award for nil consideration. It vested and shares 
were released on 6 November 2013 at a market value of 122.90 pence per share. This was a one-off award and no further awards will be made under the Plan.
Base salary
2014 2015 % increase
Tim O’Toole 846 846 Nil
Chris Surch 450 450 Nil
The Committee takes account of a number of factors when considering salaries, with particular focus on the experience, performance, and the 
internal and external relative positioning for total reward of the individuals, and also the average budgeted increase in base salaries of the Group’s 
workforce of 2.2%. As a result of these considerations and the emphasis on salary restraint from shareholders, the Committee determined that 
the base salaries of Tim O’Toole and Chris Surch would not increase in 2015/16. The Committee considers overall pay to be competitive for the 
current post holders against the newly deﬁned comparator group as set out on page 92.
Beneﬁts
For 2014 and 2015 beneﬁts for Executive Directors include the provision of a company car allowance for the Chief Executive, US and UK private 
medical cover, life assurance, travel expenses and advisory fees. 
Pension
Tim O’Toole participates in a deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme. His contributions to this scheme are paid via salary sacriﬁce with an equivalent 
contribution being paid directly to the pension scheme by the Company. This provides him with 1/50th accrual for each year of service, based on 
average pensionable salary for the three tax years prior to retirement. He has chosen a normal retirement age of 60 and can receive his beneﬁts 
unreduced at that time. Pensions normally increase in line with the consumer prices index and provide a dependant’s pension on a member’s 
death. There is a scheme earnings cap of £140,705 above which a pension allowance of 20% of base salary is paid.
Information in the table below includes the total accrued beneﬁt at 31 March 2015 which represents the annual pension that is expected to be 
payable on eventual retirement given the length of service and salary of Tim O’Toole.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 88 Each Executive Director employed after 1 April 201 1 receives a ‘pension allowance’ equal to 20% of their base salary. The allowances paid during 
the year to Tim O’Toole and Chris Surch were £141,000 and £90,000, respectively.
Performance-related pay
The Committee believes it is important that for Executive Directors a signiﬁcant proportion of the remuneration package is performance-related 
and the performance conditions applying to incentive arrangements support the delivery of the Company’s strategy and transformation plans. 
The Committee considers performance against a range of metrics to ensure that the assessment is rounded, taking into account both qualitative 
and quantitative factors.
The table below outlines each of the performance measures used in the Company’s current performance-related incentives and how they 
support the Company’s strategy, transformation plans and business objectives as outlined in the Strategic Review.

For 2014/15, the EABP comprised ﬁve discrete elements as set out below. 
Group adjusted operating proﬁt – a key KPI used in managing the business
Group cash ﬂow – adjusted for UK Rail franchise portfolio changes of £107 .9m, 
encourages management to devise operational plans focused on cash generation 
to create options for the Board in relation to, among other uses, investment in key 
assets of ﬂeet, systems and people
Safety – to ensure that risk controls, safety procedures and safety behaviours 
are constantly improved to reduce long term injuries and avoid safety incidents 
across all the divisions. Performance was assessed against a balanced scorecard 
across a broad range of indicators, including long term injuries, passenger injuries 
and collisions
Customer satisfaction – performance was assessed against a balanced 
scorecard of measures: customer satisfaction surveys, punctuality, cancellations 
and complaints across UK Bus, UK Rail, First Student, First Transit and Greyhound
Individual performance – performance was assessed against individual 
objectives for the year, which were aligned with the Group’s strategy and 
transformation plans, and the Executive Director’s core areas of responsibility
The Committee assessed each discrete element of the EABP separately as part of an overall balanced scorecard of measures. Within each 
element the Committee considered a number of sub-elements and formed a rounded assessment of the performance of Executive Directors 
at the end of the year. Awards were also subject to an underlying performance override enabling them to be scaled back to reﬂect the 
Group’s performance.

The maximum bonus potential of Tim O’Toole was 120% of base salary and for Chris Surch was 100% of base salary.
During the year, the Company achieved robust year on year operating proﬁt growth of 13.3%, principally reﬂecting increased proﬁts in First 
Student, UK Rail and UK Bus, resulting in a Group adjusted operating proﬁt of £303.6m. Group cash ﬂow of £39.4m was above the maximum 
target, principally driven by improved working capital, stronger cash generation from the Group’s operations and lower tax, interest and 
pension payments (this excludes the impact of rail end of franchise cash outﬂow, as the Committee believes this better reﬂects the 
underlying performance). The customer satisfaction measure was broadly in line with target and the safety measure was below target, 
with solid performances from First Student, First Transit and Greyhound offset by below target performances from UK Bus and UK Rail.
The individual performance element of the EABP represents 15% of the total award. The Committee also carefully reviewed the performance of 
the Executive Directors against objectives that were set at the start of the year. Tim O’Toole’s individual objectives related to supporting long term 
growth through effective leadership, delivery of the transformation plans and developing the management structure. The Committee judged that 
he had met the vast majority of his objectives and accordingly agreed a bonus of 10% against his individual objectives, relative to a target of 7 .5%. 
Chris Surch’s individual objectives related to corporate ﬁnance initiatives, supporting the divisions in achieving ﬁnancial objectives and driving cost 
savings across the Group. The Committee judged that he had also met the vast majority of his objectives and accordingly agreed a bonus of 10% 
against his individual objectives relative to a target of 7 .5%.
Whilst overall the Group is broadly where it was expected to be at this stage of the transformation plan, the Group lost three rail franchises in 
the year, which will impact future earnings. Therefore, after careful consideration, the Committee agreed that the Group adjusted operating proﬁt 
element should be reduced to 30%, the equivalent of target performance, to reﬂect the loss of the rail franchises and the future impact on 
earnings. This resulted in a bonus award of 57% of maximum potential to Tim O’Toole and Chris Surch.

 Share awards to Tim O’Toole will be granted as conditional share awards for nil consideration and those to Chris Surch as nil-cost options. Share awards are 
deferred for three years, subject to continued employment. 
2015/16 Executive Directors’ annual bonus awards
In line with the 2014/15 annual bonus awards, performance will be assessed against ﬁve metrics: Group operating proﬁt (65% of award), cash 
generation (10% of award), safety (7 .5% of award), customer satisfaction (7 .5% of award) and individual performance (10% of award). The Group 
operating proﬁt and cash generation targets were set against the Company’s budgeted performance and were subject to a rigorous process 
of challenge by the Committee and the Board. In particular, the impact of the loss of rail franchises means that in assessing performance, the 
Committee will continue to monitor each division and also the Company’s performance on a rail and non-rail basis. Speciﬁc targets will not be 
disclosed in advance as they would give a clear indication of the Group’s business objectives, which are commercially sensitive. Where bonus 
targets are no longer commercially sensitive, typically following the end of the ﬁnancial year, they will be disclosed in that year’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
Awards are subject to an underlying performance override enabling them to be scaled back to reﬂect the Group’s performance as well as malus 
and clawback. 
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for Tim O’Toole and Chris Surch will be 120% and 100% of base salary, respectively. Half of any bonus 
earned will be deferred into the Company’s shares for three years, conditional upon continued employment. 
Long Term Incentive Plan
2015 Long Term Incentive Awards
The Committee has reviewed the Company’s LTIP arrangements as part of its comprehensive review of Executive Director and senior 
management remuneration, which included consultations with major investors and their representative bodies on the inclusion of a returns-based 
metric (ROCE) alongside the existing LTIP performance metrics of EPS and TSR, with the TSR peer group amended to reﬂect the comparator 
group selected for benchmarking of remuneration policies and practices. Following feedback from major investors, which was supportive of the 
overall proposed approach, it is intended that the 2015 LTIP awards will be based on a combination of metrics which are aligned to the 
Company’s strategic objectives and hence with sustainable shareholder value creation. A further investor consultation will be conducted later in 
the year following the publication of the Company’s 2015 preliminary results and Annual Report and Accounts. The consultation will cover the 
choice of performance metrics as well as their deﬁnitions, weightings and target levels of performance.
To ensure the outcomes from the consultation are appropriately reﬂected, and to allow for full input from the new Chairman, grants of LTIP awards 
will be deferred until immediately after the announcement of the Company’s half-yearly results in November 2015. Awards will be subject to a 
holding period of two years following the three year performance period as well as malus and clawback. On this basis an award will be granted to 
an existing Executive Director as follows:
Face value  
(% of base salary)
Minimum threshold performance  
(% of maximum potential)
Maximum performance  
(% of maximum potential)
Performance  
period
120% 25% 100% 1.4.15 – 31.3.18
Before an award vests the Committee must be satisﬁed that the underlying performance of the Group is satisfactory. The Committee believes that 
having a performance underpin is an important feature of the plan as it mitigates the risk of unwarranted vesting outcomes.

In the event of one or more of the constituents undergoing a takeover, merger, dissolution, variation in capital or any other event that will materially 
affect the calculation of a ranking, the Committee shall determine how this should be reﬂected in the ranking calculation. 
In the event of a change of control, awards will normally vest on a pro-rata basis by reference to the length of time since the award was granted, 
and only if the performance conditions can effectively be regarded as having been satisﬁed at that time, although the Committee may decide not 
to pro-rate an award if it is inappropriate to do so in the particular circumstances.

Awards were calculated using the average ﬁve day closing mid-market share price at the time of grant.
The awards are exercisable at the end of a three-year performance period subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and continued 
employment. Half of the award is subject to the growth in the Company’s earnings per share and the remaining half of the award is subject to the 
Company’s relative total shareholder return. In addition, before an award vests the Committee must be satisﬁed that the underlying performance 
of the Group is satisfactory.

Shareholding guidelines
In accordance with the existing remuneration policy, Executive Directors are required to build up a speciﬁed shareholding in the Company. 
This is to create greater alignment of the Executive Directors’ interests with those of shareholders. The guidelines require Executive Directors 
to retain at least 50% of the shares, net of tax, vesting under a Group share incentive plan or otherwise acquire shares in the Company over 
a period of ﬁve years until a shareholding with a market value (calculated by reference to the year-end share price) equal to 100% of base salary 
is achieved. The Committee reserves the right to relax or waive the application of such guidelines in certain circumstances, including the 
impending retirement of an Executive Director.
The table below sets out the Executive Directors’ and their connected persons shareholdings (including beneﬁcial interests) and a summary of 
outstanding and unvested share awards as at 31 March 2015.

 Chris Surch was appointed a Director on 1 September 2012 and has until 2017 to meet the shareholding requirement.

 No changes in Executive Directors interests occurred in the period of 1 April to 10 June 2015.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 94 Subject to the approval by shareholders of the new remuneration policy at the 2015 Annual General Meeting, the shareholding requirement of the 
Chief Executive will be increased to 200% of base salary and for other Executive Directors to 150% of base salary within a ﬁve year time period. 
The new guidelines will also require Executive Directors to retain at least 75% of the shares, net of tax, vesting under a Group share incentive plan 
or otherwise acquire shares in the Company until the shareholding guideline is met. In addition, any shares vesting under the LTIP will be required 
to be held by Executive Directors for a further period of two years following the three year performance period.
From June 2015, Tim O’Toole will allocate £15,000 of his gross monthly base salary (equivalent to over 20% of his base salary) to acquire shares 
in the Company, with shares being purchased from the post-tax and post-NI amount.
All-employee share schemes
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Company’s Sharesave (SAYE) and Share Incentive Plan (BAYE) on the same terms as other 
eligible employees.
SAYE
The maximum participation level in the SAYE plan is £500 per calendar month with participants granted linked share options, by reference 
to projected savings, with a strike price up to a 20% discount to the prevailing share price at the time of grant. On the maturity of the savings 
contracts, participants can elect to use the accumulated savings to exercise the option or request the return of their savings. 
BAYE
The maximum participation level in the BAYE is as per HMRC limits and provides for a combination of the following:
 free shares – the Company can give each participant free shares worth up to £3,600 each;
 partnership shares – participants can use up to £1,800 per year out of pre-tax and pre-NI pay to buy partnership shares;
 matching shares – the Company can give matching shares at a ratio of up to two matching shares for each partnership share bought by 
the employee; and
 dividend shares – participants can use up to £1,800 of dividends from plan shares each year to buy further shares in the Company through 
the plan.
At present the Company provides two matching shares for every three partnership shares, subject to a maximum Company contribution of 
shares to the value of £20 a month and any dividend shares. No free shares are provided. The shares are held in trust for up to ﬁve years, in which 
case no income tax or NI will be payable. The matching shares will be forfeited if the corresponding partnership shares are removed from trust 
within three years from award. 
In accordance with the applicable legislation shares that remain subject to the plan are held on behalf of participants in a UK-based trust. 
Preventing rewards for failure
In respect of awards made under the EABP and LTIP , from 2015 onwards, in the event of a triggering event, such as a material mis-statement of 
accounts, gross misconduct or computational error, the Company will have the ability to clawback awards. For the EABP , annual cash bonuses 
may be clawed back at any time up to the end of the third ﬁnancial year after that in respect of which the payment is made and share awards will 
remain subject to clawback for three years following the date of grant. For the LTIP , awards will remain subject to clawback for two years following 
the end of the three-year performance period.
In addition, prior to the vesting of awards made under the EABP and LTIP , in respect of awards made from 2014 onwards, the Committee may 
reduce awards to reﬂect any triggering event, such as material mis-statement of accounts or gross misconduct. 
Dilution
The Company ensures that the level of shares granted under the Company’s share plans and the means of satisfying such awards remains within 
best practice guidelines so that dilution from employee share awards does not exceed 10% of the Company’s issued share capital for all share 
plans and 5% in respect of executive share plans in any ten-year rolling period. The Committee monitors dilution levels at least once a year. 
At 31 March 2015, 5.5% of the Company’s issued share capital had been allocated for the purposes of its share incentive plans over a  
ten-year period, including 2.6% in respect of the LTIP and EABP . 
Employee Beneﬁt Trust
The FirstGroup Employee Beneﬁt Trust has been established to acquire ordinary shares in the Company, by subscription or purchase, from funds 
provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise or vesting of awards under the Group’s share-based incentive plans. 
The trustees of the FirstGroup Employee Beneﬁt Trust have informed the Company that their intention is to abstain from voting in respect of the 
FirstGroup shares held in the trust. As at 31 March 2015, 1,063,008 shares were held by the Employee Beneﬁt Trust to hedge outstanding awards 
of 52,878,940. This means that the trust holds sufﬁcient to satisfy 2.0% of outstanding awards.

The table below shows the movement in the salary, beneﬁts and annual bonus for the Chief Executive between the current and previous ﬁnancial 
year compared to that for the average UK employee (UK Bus and UK Rail, but excluding Group). The Committee has chosen this comparator as it 
feels that it provides a more appropriate reﬂection of the earnings of the average worker than the movement in the Group’s total wage bill, which is 
distorted by movements in the number of employees and variations in wage practices in the US. For the beneﬁts and bonus per employee, the 
ﬁgures are based on those employees eligible to participate in such schemes.

External board appointments
Where Board approval is given for an Executive Director to accept an outside non-executive directorship, unless the appointment is in connection 
with the Group business, the individual Director is entitled to retain any fees received. For serving as a Director of CSX Corporation, Tim O’Toole 
receives a fee of $75,000 per annum which is taken in CSX common shares and an annual grant of $150,000 also in CSX common shares. 
Both elements are deferred until Tim O’Toole leaves the board of CSX Corporation and therefore he does not receive any current compensation.

Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Committee is primarily responsible for determining and recommending to the Board the framework for executive remuneration and for 
determining, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration of Executive Directors and senior managers. 
The Committee’s full terms of reference are available on the Company’s website. The Committee’s principal responsibilities are summarised below:
 determining and agreeing with the Board the framework for executive remuneration that ensures Executive Directors and senior managers 
are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are rewarded in a fair and responsible manner for their 
individual contribution towards the success of the Company;
 ensuring that the remuneration policy is appropriate and consistent with effective risk management;
 within the agreed framework, setting and determining the total individual remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors and senior 
managers, giving due regard to individual and Company performance, and remuneration trends across the Group;
 approving the design of, and determining the targets for, any performance-related plans and the total annual payments made under such 
plans to Executive Directors and senior managers;
 determining any share incentive plan performance targets; and
 determining the terms of employment and remuneration of each Executive Director and senior manager, including recruitment and 
termination arrangements.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 98 Composition of the Remuneration Committee
The current members of the Committee are Imelda Walsh (Chair) and Drummond Hall, both from 24 June 2014. All members of the Committee 
are independent Non-Executive Directors. David Begg, Colin Hood, John Sievwright and Jim Winestock stood down from the Committee on 
24 June 2014. Other attendees at the Committee meetings include the Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Employee 
Director, Group Reward & Pensions Director and PwC. The Company Secretary attends meetings as secretary to the Committee. Attendees 
are not involved in any decisions, and are not present for any discussions, regarding their own remuneration. 
Given the large time commitment required from Committee members over the past year and the existing commitments of the other Non-
Executive Directors, it was not possible to appoint a third Committee member with the time to commit fully to the Committee. The appointment 
of a further member will be discussed with Wolfhart Hauser following his appointment as Chairman at the conclusion of the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting and a new Committee member appointed during the 2015/16 ﬁnancial year.

After each meeting, the Chair of the Committee presented a report on its activities to the Board.
Committee activities
In line with its remit, amongst other matters, the Committee took the following actions during the year:
 reviewed the current trends in remuneration practice and updated UK governance requirements;
 reviewed the Annual General Meeting outcome and feedback from institutional shareholders and shareholder bodies, giving 
consideration to the implications for future remuneration policy;
 undertook a comprehensive review of the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and senior managers, including incentive 
arrangements and benchmarking comparator groups;
 approved individual remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors and senior managers;
 reviewed and agreed to a further consultation on the performance metrics, weightings and targets of the LTIP;
 reviewed and agreed to amend the structure of divisional incentives for certain senior managers;
 reviewed the remuneration arrangements for new Executive Directors;
 approved the introduction of clawback;
 approved revised shareholding guidelines and the introduction of holding periods for Executive Directors and senior managers;
 reviewed the fee for the new Chairman;
 assessed the level of achievement against objectives under the EABP and LTIP;

Priorities for 2015/16
For the coming year it is anticipated that the Committee will focus on the following areas:
 supporting the Group’s strategy and transformation plans;
 ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements;
 consulting with major shareholders on the definitions of LTIP performance metrics, weightings and targets;
 developing revised incentive arrangements for those senior managers immediately below the Executive Directors; 
 implementing the new remuneration policy, subject to approval by shareholders;
 ongoing training of Committee members; and
 ensuring that remuneration arrangements continue to attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors and senior managers, and reward 
Company performance, with a focus on maintaining the link between performance and reward, whilst maintaining a prudent approach to 
cost and the risk to the business.
External adviser
The Committee has authority to obtain the advice of external independent remuneration consultants. It is solely responsible for their appointment, 
retention and termination and for approval of the basis of their fees and other terms. During the year the Committee carried out a review of 
remuneration advisers to the Committee. As a result of the review, the Committee decided to appoint PwC to provide it with independent advice 
on executive remuneration. The Chair of the Committee agrees the protocols under which PwC provides advice and the Committee is satisﬁed 
that the advice it has received from PwC has been objective and independent.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK.
PwC provided independent commentary on matters under consideration by the Committee and provided updates on market practice and 
legislative requirements. PwC fees for advice provided to the Committee were £149,000. Fees were charged on a time and materials basis. 
PwC also provided general consultancy services to FirstGroup during the year; however, the Committee is satisﬁed that this does not 
compromise the independence of the advice it has received from PwC.
Shareholder engagement
During the year, the Committee wrote to, and had discussions with, a number of major investors and their representative bodies to seek their 
views on the remuneration policy to be submitted to shareholders on 16 July 2015 to provide them with an opportunity to see the policy at an 
early stage and provide feedback. The dialogue was constructive and shareholders were broadly supportive of the Committee’s approach on 
these matters. When reviewing the remuneration framework of Executive Directors and senior managers, the Committee takes into account the 
views and guidance expressed by major investors and their representative bodies. 
Shareholder votes on remuneration matters
At the AGM on 1 6 July 201 4, the resolutions on the remuneration policy and Annual Report on Remuneration received the following votes from shareholders:
Remuneration Policy
Annual Report on Remuneration (including the  
Annual Statement of the Chair of the Committee)
Votes for 767,562,067 (89%) 606,528,428 (74%)
Votes against 95,204,285 (11%) 208,086,339 (26%)
Total votes cast 862,766,352 814,614,767
Votes withheld 15,581,485 63,733,071
In light of the size of the vote against the Annual Report on Remuneration, the Committee has had positive and constructive discussions and 
dialogue with shareholders and their representative bodies regarding a revised remuneration policy and practices. The views of shareholders 
and their representative bodies are very important and the material points discussed have helped shape the revised remuneration policy to 
be proposed at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.

Directors
The Directors of the Company who served during the year and their 
biographical details are shown on pages 56 and 57 , together with 
David Begg, Colin Hood and John Sievwright who stood down from 
the Board on 24 June 2014. Details of Directors’ interests in shares 
can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that each Director 
who has been appointed by the Board since the last Annual General 
Meeting must retire from ofﬁce and stand for election by the shareholders 
at the ﬁrst Annual General Meeting after their appointment. Wolfhart 
Hauser, having been appointed to the Board on 18 May 2015, will be 
seeking election as a Director at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
all other Directors (excluding John McFarlane who will be stepping 
down from the Board at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting) will retire and submit themselves for re-election at 
the Company’s forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Details of 
Directors’ contracts or letters of appointment are included in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
The performance of each Director was reviewed and it was found that 
each of them continues to make an effective and valuable contribution 
to the deliberations of the Board and demonstrate commitment to the 
role. The performance of the Chairman was reviewed by the Senior 
Independent Director.
During the year, no Director had any interest in any shares or 
debentures in the Company’s subsidiaries, or any material interest 
in any contract with the Company or a subsidiary being a contract 
of signiﬁcance in relation to the Company’s business.
Directors’ indemnities and liability insurance
Directors’ and Ofﬁcers’ liability insurance is maintained by the Company 
and is in place at the date of this report. The Company reviews its level 
of cover on an annual basis and is satisﬁed that it remains adequate. 
The Directors also have the beneﬁt of indemnity provisions in the 
Company’s Articles of Association. These provisions are qualifying third 
party indemnity provisions as deﬁned in section 234 of the Companies 
Act 2006. 
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s Annual General Meeting will be held at 1.30pm

Results 
The results for the year are set out in the consolidated income 
statement on page 106. 
Articles of Association
The following description summarises certain provisions of the 
Company’s Articles of Association and applicable Scottish law 
concerning companies (the Companies Act 2006). This summary 
is qualiﬁed in its entirety by reference to this Company’s Articles of 
Association and the Companies Act 2006. The Company’s Articles 
of Association may be amended by a special resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders.
Shares
The rights attaching to the ordinary shares of the Company are deﬁned 
in the Company’s Articles of Association. No person has any special 
rights of control over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares 
are fully paid. Details of the Company’s issued share capital are set out 
in note 8 to the Company ﬁnancial statements.
Voting rights
Shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at any general meeting 
of the Company. It is the Company’s practice to hold a poll on every 
resolution at general meetings. Every member present in person or by 
proxy has, upon a poll, one vote for every share held. In the case of joint 
holders of a share the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether 
in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes 
of the other joint holders and, for this purpose, seniority shall be 
determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of 
Members in respect of the joint holding. The Notice of the 2015 Annual 
General Meeting accompanying this document speciﬁes the deadlines 
for exercising voting rights. 
Dividend rights
Shareholders may by ordinary resolution declare dividends but the 
amount of the dividend may not exceed the amount recommended 
by the Board. The Directors are not recommending payment of a ﬁnal 
dividend this year.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 101
Governance Employee involvement
An informed and consultative approach to employee communication 
is taken across the Group. As well as more traditional forms of 
communication, employees can also access online facilities. 
The employee portal provides an opportunity for employees to share 
information and work in collaboration with other Group employees 
on areas of mutual interest and beneﬁt to the Group. Work will be 
undertaken during the next 12 months to develop further the portal 
to provide learning and performance management capabilities. In 
addition, management teams work to ensure that communication is 
cascaded face to face throughout their business areas and employees 
are encouraged to discuss any issues with management at any time 
and events, such as executive roadshows, are arranged periodically 
to allow employees the chance to feed back to senior management.
A signiﬁcant proportion of the workforce belongs to trade unions, 
with our employees represented by approximately 30 different unions. 
The majority of our employees in North America, approximately 76% 
of our UK Bus employees and a signiﬁcant proportion of our UK Rail 
employees are represented by unions.
Throughout the Group, regular dialogue with employee representatives, 
such as trade unions, is maintained. Each division has its own 
information and consultation arrangements and levels of employee 
involvement in the business differ. 
As well as gathering feedback throughout the year through formal and 
informal channels, all employees are also given the opportunity to make 
their voice heard through regular employee surveys. These surveys at 
Group, divisional and local level provide a useful insight into what 
employees think about the Company. The priorities identiﬁed by 
employees help to shape the future employee strategy. 
Policies concerning disabled employees
Full and fair consideration is given to applications for employment 
by disabled persons. We are committed to supporting disabled 
employees including employees who become disabled persons 
during their employment with regards to training, career development 
and promotion.
Transfer of shares
There are no speciﬁc restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the 
transfer of shares which are both governed by the general provisions 
of the Company’s Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. 
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of 
the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of securities or on voting rights at any meeting of the Company.
Employee share plans
The Company operates a number of employee share plans details 
of which are set out in note 33 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Kleinwort Benson (Guernsey) Trustees Limited, as trustee of the 
FirstGroup plc Employee Beneﬁt Trust (EBT), holds shares in the 
Company in trust in order to satisfy awards made to participants in the 
Company’s LTIP , EABP and SAYE plan. The EBT waives its rights to 
vote and to dividends on the shares it holds which are unallocated. 
Under the rules of the FirstGroup plc Share Incentive Plan (BAYE), 
employees buy shares and receive free matching shares in the 
Company. In order to preserve certain tax beneﬁts these shares are 
held in a trust by Computershare for employees. Whilst these shares 
are held in trust, the voting rights attached to them are exercised by the 
trustee, but only at the direction of the employees. The trustee does not 
vote on the shares if no direction is given to it.
All of the Company’s employee share plans contain provisions relating 
to change of control. On a change of control, options and awards 
granted to employees may vest and become exercisable, subject to 
the satisfaction of any applicable performance conditions at the time.
Powers of the Directors
The Directors are responsible for the management of the business 
of the Company and may exercise all powers of the Company subject 
to applicable legislation and regulation and the Company’s Articles 
of Association.
Purchase of own shares
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company in 2014 authority was 
granted for the Company to purchase up to 10% of its ordinary shares. 
During the year no ordinary shares were purchased. Under the existing 
authority the Company may purchase up to 120,400,000 ordinary 
shares. This authority remains in place until the Annual General Meeting 
on 16 July 2015 when it is intended to seek a renewal.
Political donations
The Group did not give any money for political purposes in the United 
Kingdom nor did it make any donations to EU political organisations 
or incur any EU political expenditure during the year.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 102 Change of control – signiﬁcant agreements
(a) Financing agreements
The Group has a £800m multi-currency revolving credit and guarantee 
facility between, amongst others, the Company and The Royal Bank of 
Scotland plc dated 15 May 2014. This reﬁnanced the Group’s existing 
revolving credit and guarantee facility. Following any change of control 
of the Company, individual lenders may negotiate with the Company 
with a view to resolving any concerns arising from such change of 
control. If the matter has not been resolved within 30 days an individual 
bank may cancel its commitment and the Company must repay the 
relevant proportion of any drawdown.
The US$150m 4.26% notes due in three instalments of US$50m from 
2016 to 2017 , the £250m 6. 125% bonds due 2019, the £300m 8. 125% 
bonds due 2018, the £350m 8.750% bonds due 2021, the £200m 
6.875% bonds due 2024 and the £325m 5.250% bonds due 2022 
issued by the Company may also be affected by a change of control 
of the Company. A change of control in respect of the £250m 6. 125% 
bonds due 2019 may result in an increase of 1.5% per annum in the 
interest rate payable on those bonds. However, the interest rate on the 
bonds will only be so increased if certain further thresholds in relation 
to the credit rating of the bonds are also met. In respect of the £300m 
8. 125% bonds due 2018, the £350m 8.750% bonds due 2021, the 
£200m 6.875% bonds due 2024 and the £325m 5.250% bonds due 
2022, upon a change of control of the Company, provided that certain 
further thresholds in relation to the credit rating of the bonds are met, 
the bondholders have the option to require the Company to redeem 
the bonds. In respect of the US$150m 4.26% notes due from 2016 to 
2017 , upon a change of control, the Company must make an offer to 
noteholders to prepay the entire unpaid principal amount of the notes 
held by each bondholder (at par) together with interest accrued thereon 
but without any ‘yield maintenance’ amount.
(b) UK Rail
The Group’s franchised passenger rail operators, First TransPennine 
Express and First Great Western, are each party to a franchise 
agreement with the Secretary of State for Transport. These franchise 
agreements are subject to termination clauses which may apply on a 
change of control. These operators and the Group’s non-franchised rail 
operator, First Hull Trains, each hold railway licences as required by the 
Railways Act 1993 (as amended); these licences may be revoked on 
three months’ notice if a change of control occurs without the approval 
of the Ofﬁce of Rail and Road. All of these operators also require and 
hold track access agreements with Network Rail Infrastructure Limited 
under which they are permitted to access railway infrastructure. Failure 
by any of the operators to maintain its railway licence is a potential 
termination event under the terms of the track access agreements. The 
Group’s railway operators also lease rolling stock from specialist rolling 
stock leasing companies such as Eversholt Rail Group, Porterbrook 
Leasing Company Limited and Angel Trains Limited. A material number 
of the individual leasing agreements include change of control 
provisions. The Group is also involved from time to time in bidding 
processes for UK rail franchises and transport contracts further aﬁeld 
which customarily include change in circumstance provisions which 
would be triggered on a change of control and could result in termination 
or rejection from further participation in the relevant competitions.
(c) Joint venture agreements
The Company has joint venture agreements with Keolis (UK) Limited 
in relation to First TransPennine Express and with Danske Statsbaner 
(Danish State Railways) in relation to DSB/First Aps and DSB Sverige AB. 
As is customary, these joint venture agreements include provisions 
addressing change of control.
Financial risk management
The Company’s policies on ﬁnancial risk management, including the 
Company’s exposure to liquidity risk, credit risk and certain market-
based risks including foreign exchange rates, interest rates and fuel 
prices, can be found in note 23 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Audit information 
The Directors who held ofﬁce at the date of this Governance report 
conﬁrm that so far as they each are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information (being information needed by the auditors in connection 
with preparing their audit report), of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware, and each of the Directors has taken all the steps that he or 
she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself or 
herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Auditor
Deloitte LLP has indicated its willingness to continue in ofﬁce as 
auditors of the Company. Upon the recommendation of the Audit 
Committee, resolutions seeking to reappoint Deloitte as auditors 
and to authorise the Directors to determine its remuneration 
will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Going concern 
Whilst the Group is affected by macro-economic developments, 
it has a strong balanced portfolio of businesses with approximately 
half of Group revenues secured under medium term contracts with 
government agencies and other large organisations in the UK and 
North America.
While any changes in economic activity will impact UK Bus and UK Rail 
passenger numbers this potential risk is reduced in UK Bus by the 
ability of the Group to modify services on relatively short notice. In 
North America, the First Student and First Transit businesses are highly 
contracted and, whilst Greyhound is more susceptible to the economy, 
its costs are largely variable.
The Group has a diversiﬁed funding structure which is largely 
represented by medium term unsecured committed bank facilities and 
long term unsecured bond debt. The Group has a £800m committed 
revolving banking facility, which expires on 28 June 2019.
The Group’s management of exposure to ﬁnancial risk, including 
liquidity, currency, interest rate and commodity risks, is disclosed in 
note 23 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The Directors have carried out a detailed review of the Group’s 2015/16 
budget and medium term plans, with due regard to the risks and 
uncertainties to which the Group is exposed (of which the principal 
items are set out on pages 45 to 49), the uncertain economic climate 
and the impact that this could have on trading performance.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 103
Governance The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible 
for preparing a Strategy report, Directors’ remuneration report and 
Governance section that comply with that law and those regulations.
Responsibility statement
Each Director conﬁrms to the best of his or her knowledge that:
 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;
 the Strategic report and Governance section include a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of 
the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and
 the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s and the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy.
The Strategic report comprising pages 2 to 54 and the Governance 
section comprising pages 56 to 104, and including the sections of the 
Annual Report and Accounts referred to in these pages, have been 
approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by:
Robert Welch
Company Secretary
10 June 2015
395 King Street, Aberdeen AB24 5RP
Based on this review, the Directors believe that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future (which is for this purpose a period of at least 
12 months from the date of approval of these ﬁnancial statements). 
Accordingly, the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going 
concern basis. 
Post-balance sheet events
There have been no material post-balance sheet events as at the date 
of this report.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the annual report and the ﬁnancial statements
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for 
each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have chosen to prepare 
the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless they are 
satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the parent company ﬁnancial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group ﬁnancial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 present information including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.

 The rights issue which completed in June 2013 was effected through a legal structure that resulted in the excess of the proceeds over the nominal value of the share 
capital being recognised within retained earnings as a distributable reserve.

 On 14 August 2014, the Group purchased the non-controlling interests share of Hull Trains Limited for a consideration of £3.0m and on 24 March 2015, the Group 
purchased the non-controlling interests share of Cardinal Coach Lines UCL for a consideration of CAD$17.0m. As both of these represent a transaction with minority 
equity owners of the business without a change of control, they have been recognised as an equity transaction in the Group’s reserves and not as a business 
combination or investment.
3
 On 25 August 2014, the Group completed the acquisition of a 51% share in Miles Square Transportation, Inc, a school bus transportation company based in New 
York. Included within the purchase agreement is a put option for the Group to purchase the remaining 49% from the non-controlling interest party for a ﬁxed price of 
US$19.1m. As the put option is a contract to purchase the Group’s own equity instruments it gives rise to a ﬁnancial liability for the ﬁxed price amount in accordance 
with paragraph 23 in IAS 32. The ﬁnancial liability has been recognised in the balance sheet and the initial recognition is treated as reclassiﬁed from equity.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 110 1 General information
FirstGroup plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered ofﬁce is 395 King 
Street, Aberdeen AB24 5RP. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic report on pages 6 to 54.
These ﬁnancial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2.
2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted and endorsed for use in the European Union and therefore 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain ﬁnancial instruments, and on a 
going concern basis as described in the going concern statement in the Directors’ report on pages 103 to 104. The principal accounting policies 
adopted are set out below.
The ﬁgures for the year to 31 March 2015 include the results of the rail business for the year to 31 March 2015 and the results of all the other 
businesses for the 52 weeks ended 28 March 2015. The ﬁgures for the year to 31 March 2014 include the results of the rail businesses for the 
year to 31 March 2014 and the results of all the other businesses for the 52 weeks ended 29 March 2014. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to 
obtain beneﬁts from its activities.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identiﬁed separately from the Group’s equity interest therein. Those interests of non-controlling 
shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially be 
measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of their fair value of the acquiree’s identiﬁable net assets. The choice 
of measurement is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ 
share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-
controlling interests having a deﬁcit balance.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used 
by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate 
of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations 
are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, with the exception of deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to 
employee beneﬁt arrangements, liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment 
and non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classiﬁed as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling shareholder’s proportion of the net fair 
value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 111
Financial statements 2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Signiﬁcant 
inﬂuence is the power to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those 
policies. As a general rule, signiﬁcant inﬂuence will be presumed to exist when the Group holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, 20% 
or more of the voting power, of the investee. However, where it is clear that the Group, although holding 20% or more of the voting power does 
not have signiﬁcant inﬂuence, the investment is not accounted for as an associate. The Group has a 30% holding in DSBFirst but does not have 
signiﬁcant inﬂuence and therefore the holding is treated as an investment.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these ﬁnancial statements using the equity method of accounting, except 
when the investment is classiﬁed as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale 
and Discontinued Operations. 
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate 
in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net 
investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on 
behalf of the associate.
Assets held for sale
Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. 
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the 
date of classiﬁcation.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill arising on consolidation is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of 
the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs) which are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently where there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the 
carrying amount of the CGU, the impairment loss is allocated to the goodwill of the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on 
the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁt 
or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being 
tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included 
in determining any subsequent proﬁt or loss on disposal. 
The existing ﬁnite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised over their useful economic lives as follows:
Customer contracts – over the estimated life of the contract (9 to 10 years)
Greyhound brand and trade name – over the estimated life of the brand (20 years)
Franchise agreements – over the initial term of the franchise (2 to 10 years). 
In the event of a franchise extension a new intangible asset is set up and is amortised over the term of the extension on a straight-line basis.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue principally comprises revenue from train passenger services, road passenger transport, and certain management and maintenance 
services in the UK and North America. Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers’ travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as 
the proportion of total services to be provided. Receipts for season tickets and travel cards are deferred within ‘Season ticket deferred income’ 
and recognised in the income statement over the period covered by the relevant ticket. 
Revenue in UK Rail includes franchise subsidy receipts from the Department for Transport (DfT) and Transport Scotland and amounts receivable 
under franchise revenue support arrangements. Franchise premium payments to the DfT for amounts due under the terms of a franchise are 
included in operating costs. Revenue also includes amounts attributable to the Train Operating Companies (TOCs), predominantly based on 
models of route usage, by the Railway Settlement Plan in respect of passenger receipts. 
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 112 2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
UK Bus revenue principally comprises amounts receivable from ticket sales and concessionary fare schemes. Concessionary amounts are 
recognised in the period in which the service is provided based on a predetermined formula as agreed with the relevant local authority. 
Greyhound coach revenue mainly comprises of amounts receivable from ticket sales. Other Bus, including First Student and First Transit, 
and services revenue from contracts with government bodies and similar organisations is recognised as the services are provided.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Leasing
Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases and the rental charges are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the 
life of the lease.
Assets held under hire purchase contracts and ﬁnance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present 
value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet 
as a ﬁnance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁnance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs (see below).
Beneﬁts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies 
The individual ﬁnancial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the results and ﬁnancial position of each Group 
company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements.
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded at the 
rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in proﬁt or loss for the 
period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in proﬁt or loss for the period 
except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. 
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group holds currency swaps and borrowings in foreign currencies (see note 
23 for details of the Group’s policies in respect of foreign exchange risks). 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at the closing exchange rates on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly during 
that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising from the average or actual 
exchange rates used and the period end rate, if any, are classiﬁed as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take 
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in proﬁt or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
Non-GAAP measures and performance
In measuring the Group adjusted performance, additional ﬁnancial measures derived from the reported results have been used in order to 
eliminate factors which distort year on year comparisons. The Group’s adjusted performance is used to explain year on year changes when the 
effect of certain items are signiﬁcant, including amortisation, business disposals, aged legal claims and revisions to onerous contracts, as 
management consider that this basis more appropriately reﬂects operating performance and a better understanding of the key performance 
indicators of the business. See note 4 for the reconciliation to non-GAAP measures and performance.
Subsequent revisions to adjusting items are also recognised as an adjusting item in future periods. In the current year non-GAAP adjusting items 
principally relate to amortisation charges, gain on disposal of property, aged legal claims associated with previous acquisitions, the impairment of 
a number of Group IT licences and business disposals. In the prior year the non-GAAP adjusting items principally related to amortisation charges 
and business disposals.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 113
Financial statements 2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Retirement beneﬁt costs
The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes, which include both deﬁned beneﬁt schemes and deﬁned contribution schemes.
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. There is no legal or constructive 
obligation to pay additional contributions into a deﬁned contribution scheme if the fund has insufﬁcient assets to pay all employees’ beneﬁts 
relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, the cost of providing beneﬁts is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial updates being 
carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised 
outside the income statement and presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the beneﬁts are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis 
over the average period until the beneﬁts become vested.
The retirement beneﬁt position recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation as adjusted for 
unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past 
service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme. 
Various TOCs in the UK Rail business participate in the Railways Pension Scheme, which is an industry-wide deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. The Group 
is obligated to fund the relevant section of the scheme over the period for which the franchise is held. The full liability is recognised on the balance 
sheet, which is then reduced by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability reﬂects the Group’s obligations to fund the scheme over the 
franchise term.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁt differs from net proﬁt as reported in the income statement because 
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁt.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax 
is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis. 
Property, plant and equipment
Properties for provision of services or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes 
professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these 
assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Passenger carrying vehicles and other plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 114 2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets 
in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Freehold buildings  50 years straight-line
Long leasehold buildings  50 years straight-line
Short leasehold properties  period of lease
Passenger carrying vehicles  7 to 17 years straight-line 
Other plant and equipment  3 to 25 years straight-line
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the 
term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Capital grants
Capital grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected 
useful lives of the assets concerned. Capital grants are not recognised until there is a reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the 
conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash ﬂows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
speciﬁc to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ﬂows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is 
reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment 
loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately except in the 
case of goodwill, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a 
revaluation increase.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated 
costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
The Group measures ﬁnancial assets on initial recognition at fair value, and determines the classiﬁcation of such assets at initial recognition and 
on any subsequent reclassiﬁcation event.
Where there is no active market for a ﬁnancial asset, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions 
and discounted cash ﬂows. Otherwise ﬁnancial assets are carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are classiﬁed into one of four primary categories:
Fair value through proﬁt and loss
This covers any ﬁnancial asset designated on initial recognition to be measured at fair value with fair value changes to go through the proﬁt and 
loss, and ﬁnancial assets acquired principally for the purpose of trading in the short term.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 115
Financial statements 2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Held to maturity investments
Non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments and ﬁxed maturity are classiﬁed here when the Group has the intention and 
ability to hold to maturity. These ﬁnancial assets are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised 
in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
Loans and receivables 
Non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market have not been designated as either 
fair value through proﬁt or loss or available for sale. Such assets are carried at amortised cost. Gains and losses are recognised in the income 
statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation. 
The most signiﬁcant ﬁnancial assets under this category are trade receivables and bank deposits.
Trade receivables are measured at fair value, i.e. original invoice amount, less an allowance for uncollectable amounts. Appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in proﬁt or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. 
Bank deposits are included within cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents as deﬁned for the cash ﬂow statement comprise cash 
in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from 
the date of inception and bank overdrafts. In the consolidated balance sheet cash and cash equivalents exclude bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts 
that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities. All are carried on the 
balance sheet at cost. Cash and cash equivalents includes ring-fenced cash. The most signiﬁcant ring-fenced cash balances are held by the 
Group’s UK Rail subsidiaries. Under the terms of the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by the train operating companies up 
to the lower of the amount of retained proﬁts or the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios. The ring-fenced cash represents that which 
is not available for distribution or the amount required to satisfy the contractual liquidity ratio at the balance sheet date.
Available for sale ﬁnancial assets
Available for sale ﬁnancial assets are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classiﬁed in any of the other 
categories. After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of 
equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain 
or loss is included in the income statement. 
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued 
by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Sterling bonds and loan notes
These are measured either on an amortised cost basis or at fair value, if adopted.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks. Use of such ﬁnancial 
instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board. The Group does not use derivative ﬁnancial instruments for 
speculative purposes. 
The main derivative ﬁnancial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps, fuel swaps, and cross currency interest rate swaps. Such 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date. The fair values are 
calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by counterparty conﬁrmations. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash ﬂow hedges or foreign currency 
hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the income statement as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁes for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred 
to the income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or 
losses reported in the income statement.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 116 2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to 
settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance 
sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Amounts due within 12 months of the balance sheet date are 
considered to be reliably measured and are therefore included within accruals. 
Self-insurance
The Group’s policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses. In addition there are typically a smaller number of 
major claims during a ﬁnancial year which might be subject to an insurance deductible. To provide protection against these major losses, cover is 
obtained through third-party insurance policies. Provision is made under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets for the 
estimated cost of settling uninsured claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value 
at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest and is adjusted for the effects of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

The Directors do not anticipate the adoption of these other standards will have a material impact on the Group’s accounts in the period of 
initial application.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous ﬁnancial year except for the following new and revised Standards and 
Interpretations which have been adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had any signiﬁcant impact on the amounts reported in these 
ﬁnancial statements.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements – the standard establishes the principles for the presentation of consolidated accounts when an entity 
controls one or more other entities.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements – the standard determines the type of joint arrangement by assessing the rights and obligations, and accounts for 
those rights and obligations in accordance with that type of joint arrangement.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities – the standard sets out the requirements to disclose information that enables users of accounts to 
evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, its interests in other entities and the effects of these interests on its ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial 
performance and cash ﬂows.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 117
Financial statements 2 Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – the amendment to the standard clariﬁes the existing application 
issues relating to the offsetting rules. It clariﬁes the meaning of ‘currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off’ and ‘simultaneous realisation 
and settlement’.
Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets – the amendment to the standard restricts the requirement 
to disclose the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU to periods in which an impairment loss has been recognised or reverses. It also expands 
the disclosure requirements applicable when an asset or CGU’s recoverable amount has been determined on the basis of fair value less costs 
of disposal. 
Amendments to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting – this amendment allows the continuation of hedge 
accounting when a derivative is novated to a clearing counterparty and certain conditions are met.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies which are described above, management has made the following judgements and 
estimates that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements.
Impairment of intangible assets (including goodwill)
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated. The 
value in use requires the entity to estimate the future cash ﬂows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate 
present value. The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was £1,659.2m (2014: £1,509.5m; 2013: £1,665.8m) as set out in 
note 11 and the carrying amount of other intangible assets at the balance sheet date was £197.0m (2014: £217.9m; 2013: £281.8m) as set out 
in note 12. 
Contract and franchise accounting
Judgements are made on an ongoing basis with regards to the recoverability of amounts due and the carrying value of related assets and 
liabilities arising from franchises and long term service contracts. Regular forecasts are compiled on the outcome of these types of franchises and 
contracts, which require assessments and judgements relating to the expected level of revenues and costs and, in cases where options exist, 
the life of the contract or franchise.
The useful economic lives of assets are determined by reference to the length of a franchise and matched to the franchise end date. The residual 
value of assets is determined by their condition at the franchise end date and by the amount of maintenance that has been carried out during the 
period of operation.
In particular UK Rail has a number of contractual relationships including those with the DfT and Network Rail. Due to the regulated nature of the 
UK Rail industry, disputes and claims typically arise with such bodies as well as other TOCs where one or more TOCs have access to common 
infrastructure such as railway lines. Judgement is required by management as to the amounts receivable and also payable taking account of the 
information available at the time.
Deﬁned beneﬁt pension arrangements
Measurement of deﬁned beneﬁt pension obligations requires estimation of a suitable discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, 
expected rate of inﬂation of future salary and pension costs along with assumptions about mortality rates. The most signiﬁcant of these are the 
discount rate and inﬂation rate assumptions. A 0.1% movement in the discount rate would impact operating proﬁt and the balance sheet position 
by approximately £3m and £32m respectively. A 0.1% movement in the inﬂation rate would impact operating proﬁt and the balance sheet position 
by approximately £3m and £24m respectively. The net pension deﬁcit as at the balance sheet date was £239.4m (2014: £260.7m; 2013: £247.8m) 
as set out in note 34.
Self-insurance and legal provisions 
Provision is made for all known incidents for which there is self-insurance or a legal liability using management’s best estimate of the likely 
settlement of these incidents or claims, where in the case of legal claims the amount can be reliably measured. The estimated settlement is 
reviewed on a regular basis with independent actuarial advice or internal legal counsel with external counsel sought as required. The Group’s 
total self-insurance provisions, including those classiﬁed within accruals, as at the balance sheet date were £316.2m (2014: £294.8m; 2013: 
£332.6m) as set out in Note 25. The Group’s total legal provisions, including those classiﬁed within accruals, as at the balance sheet date were 
£38.5m (2014: £26.0m; 2013: £31.6m) as set out in Note 25.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 118 4 Reconciliation to non-GAAP measures and performance
In measuring the Group adjusted performance, additional ﬁnancial measures derived from the reported results have been used in order to 
eliminate factors which distort year on year comparisons. The Group’s adjusted performance is used to explain year on year changes when 
the effect of certain items are signiﬁcant, including amortisation, business disposals, aged legal claims and revisions to onerous contracts, as 
the Directors consider that this basis more appropriately reﬂects operating performance and a better understanding of the key performance 
indicators of the business.

The principal reconciling items are as follows:
Amortisation charges
The charge for the year was £54.3m (2014: £53.4m).
Gain on disposal of property
A gain on disposal of £25.3m (2014: £nil) was realised on the sale of a Greyhound garage in Miami. The proceeds of this disposal of £31.6m were 
received during the year. 
Legal claims
Two separate legal claims that pre-date the Laidlaw acquisition and were acquired with the former Laidlaw entities had adverse developments 
during the year and we now estimate that it will cost signiﬁcantly more to settle these cases. As a result there was a charge of £12.2m (2014: £nil). 
IT licences 
A number of Group IT licences have been written off as the projects to which they relate will now be achieved in an alternative, less costly and 
more appropriate way. The charge for these licences was £8.7m (2014: £nil).
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 119
Financial statements 4 Reconciliation to non-GAAP measures and performance continued
UK Bus depot sales and closures
There was a charge of £7.5m (2014: £13.0m credit) in the year relating to operating losses and ﬁxed asset impairments. The credit in 2014 largely 
represents the gain on disposal of London operations. 
UK Rail First Great Western contract provision
There was a charge of £nil (2014: £4.6m credit) in the year. The credit in 2014 reﬂected the fact that losses in the ﬁnal seven periods of the old 
franchise were not as high as initially projected partly due to contractual changes agreed with the DfT. 
Ineffectiveness on ﬁnancial derivatives
There was a £0.3m (2014: £17.6m) non-cash charge during the year due to ineffectiveness on ﬁnancial derivatives. The principal component of 
the charge in 2014 related to certain US Dollar swaps which were no longer required as the underlying borrowings were repaid from proceeds 
of the rights issue. 
5 Business segments and geographical information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into ﬁve operating divisions – First Student, First Transit, Greyhound, UK Bus and UK Rail. 
These divisions are managed separately in line with the differing services that they provide and the geographical markets which they operate in. 
The principal activities of these divisions are described in the Strategic report.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGUs that are expected to beneﬁt from that business 
combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:

1,659.2 1,509.5 1,665.8
Impairment testing
At the year end, the carrying value of net assets, including goodwill, was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of 
Assets. For the purposes of this impairment review goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of discounted future cash ﬂows arising 
in each relevant CGU. 
The Group prepares cash ﬂow forecasts derived from the most recent budget for 2015/16 and Five Year Plan projections up to 2019/20 which 
take account of both past performance and expectations for future market developments. The projections for First Student assume the 
incremental beneﬁts of the existing recovery plan, the programme to address contract portfolio pricing together with an economic recovery. 
Cash ﬂows in 2019/20 are extrapolated using estimated long term growth rates of 2.5% (2014: 2.5%) for the United Kingdom and 3.0% (2014: 
3.0%) for North America which do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the market. A risk adjustment is then made using a pre-tax 
discount rate of 9.0% (2014: 9.0%) for the United Kingdom CGUs and 10.0% (2014: 10.0%) for the North American CGUs to arrive at the value in 
use. The pre-tax discount rates applied are derived from a market participant’s weighted average cost of capital. The assumptions used in the 
calculation of the Group’s weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
The Directors consider the assumptions to be reasonable based on the historic performance of each CGU and to be realistic in light of economic 
and industry forecasts. 
The calculation of value in use for each CGU is most sensitive to the principal assumptions of discount rate, long term growth rates and margins 
achievable. Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the calculations and conﬁrms that no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions 
would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount in respect of the First Transit, Greyhound, UK Bus and 
UK Rail divisions.
The value in use of the First Student division exceeds its carrying amount by £300.9m (2014: £127.4m). The sensitivity analysis indicates that the 
First Student margin or long term growth rates would need to fall in excess of 132 or 114 basis points respectively compared to future projections 
for there to be an impairment to the carrying value of net assets in this business. An increase in the discount rate in excess of 93 basis points 
would lead to the value in use of the division being less than its carrying amount.
Following their review of goodwill the Directors have concluded that there is no further impairment to any of the CGUs.

Intangible assets include customer contracts and the Greyhound brand and trade name which were acquired through the purchases of 
businesses and subsidiary undertakings. These are being amortised over their useful economic lives as shown in note 2 to the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements.
The rail franchise agreements’ intangible asset represents the part of the economic beneﬁt that is realised as a result of recognising our share of 
the rail pension deﬁcit on the date of commencement of each respective franchise and is amortised on a straight-line basis over the initial term of 
each respective franchise. The addition in the prior year relates to the new First Great Western franchise and the disposals relate to the ending of 
the old First Great Western and First Capital Connect contracts. The largest element of the franchise intangible relates to the First Great Western 
franchise £3.2m (2014: £10.4m).

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that ﬁnancial loss arises from failure by a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract.
Credit risk exists in relation to the Group’s ﬁnancial assets, which comprise trade and other receivables of £716.6m (2014: £663.6m; 2013: 
£641.0m), cash and cash equivalents of £420.5m (2014: £553.9m; 2013: £682.1m) and derivative ﬁnancial instruments of £60.8m (2014: £51.9m; 
2013: £86.6m).
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for all ﬁnancial assets at the balance sheet date was £1,197.9m (2014: £1,269.4m; 2013: £1,409.7m). 
The exposure is spread over a large number of unconnected counterparties and the maximum single concentration with any one counterparty 
was £60.0m (2014: £70.0m; 2013: £51.3m) at the balance sheet date.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for 
doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic 
environment. The provision for doubtful receivables at the balance sheet date was £2.3m (2014: £2.9m; 2013: £3.2m).
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 130 16 Trade and other receivables continued
Most trade receivables are with public or quasi public bodies, principally the DfT, Network Rail, Transport for London, Transport Scotland and 
city councils in the UK and school bus boards and city municipal authorities in North America. The Group does not consider any of these 
counterparties to be a signiﬁcant risk. Each division within the Group has a policy governing credit risk management on trade receivables.
The counterparties for bank balances and derivative ﬁnancial instruments are mainly represented by large banks with a minimum of ‘A’ credit 
ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. These counterparties are subject to approval by the Board. Group treasury policy limits 
the maximum deposit with any one counterparty to £75m, and limits the maximum term to three months.

There are also First Student yellow school buses which are surplus to requirements and are being actively marketed on the Internet. Gains or 
losses arising on the disposal of such assets are included in arriving at operating proﬁt in the income statement. The Group expects to sell such 
yellow school buses within 12 months of them going onto the ‘for sale’ list. The value at each balance sheet date represents management’s best 
estimate of their resale value. There are no liabilities associated with these held for sale assets.
The 2013 balance comprises mainly the ﬁxed assets of the eight London depots which were disposed of on 22 June 2013.

for trade purchases is 30 days (2014: 35 days; 2013: 36 days). The Group has controls in place to ensure that all payments are paid within the 
appropriate credit timeframe.

(2014: £361.6m; 2013: £288.2m). The most signiﬁcant ring-fenced cash balances are held by the Group’s UK Rail subsidiaries. Under the terms 
of the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by these subsidiaries up to the lower of the amount of their retained proﬁts or the 
amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios. The ring-fenced cash represents cash which is not available for distribution and any additional 
amounts required to satisfy the liquidity ratios at the balance sheet date. Ring-fenced cash balances of £0.7m (2014: £0.7m; 2013: £14.4m) are 
held outside the UK Rail subsidiaries.

Borrowing facilities
The Group had £800.0m (2014: £796.2m; 2013: £821.6m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities as at 31 March 2015. Total bank borrowing 
facilities at 31 March 2015 stood at £815.4m (2014: £856.1m; 2013: £1,302.9m) of which £800.0m (2014: £826.3m; 2013: £1,259.4m) was 
committed and £15.4m (2014: £29.8m; 2013: £43.5m) was uncommitted.
Capital management
Overall the Group’s objective is to achieve a post-tax return on capital employed (ROCE) in the range of 10% to 12% in the medium term. We also 
aim to maintain an investment grade credit rating and appropriate balance sheet liquidity headroom. The Group has net debt:EBITDA of 2.25 
times as at March 2015 (2014: 2.25 times) and is targeting net debt:EBITDA of 2.0 times in the medium term. 
ROCE is calculated by dividing adjusted operating proﬁt after tax by net assets, excluding debt items.
Liquidity within the Group has remained strong. At 31 March 2015 there was £1,023.8m (2014: £988.5m) of committed headroom and free cash. 
Largely due to seasonality in the North American school bus business, committed headroom typically reduces during the ﬁnancial year up to 
October and increases thereafter. The Group’s Treasury policy requires a minimum of £250m of committed headroom at all times.
The Group’s net debt, excluding accrued bond interest at 31 March 2015, was £1,407.3m (2014: £1,303.8m) as set out on page 54 of the 
Operating and ﬁnancial review.

The Group considers there to be no material difference between the fair values of the Sterling and Canadian Dollar ﬁnance leases and the 
carrying amount in the balance sheet. The US Dollar ﬁnance leases have a fair value of £255.6m (2014: £277.7m; 2013: £304.1m). The fair value is 
calculated by discounting future cash ﬂows that will arise under the lease agreements.

The loan notes have been classiﬁed by reference to the earliest date on which the loan note holder can request redemption. Loan notes of 
£8.7m (2014: £8.7m; 2013: £8.7m) are supported by unsecured bank guarantees.
The loan notes have an average effective borrowing rate of 10.1% (2014: 10.1%; 2013: 10.1%) and an average remaining term of 5 years 
(2014: 6 years; 2013: 7 years) assuming that the holders do not request redemption. The fair value of the loan notes has been determined 
to be £13.4m (2014: £13.6m; 2013: £15.0m). This has been calculated by discounting future cash ﬂows that will arise under the loan notes.

Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to ﬁnancial risks including liquidity risk, credit risk and certain market-based risks principally being the effects of changes in 
foreign exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices. The Group manages these risks within the context of a set of formal policies established by 
the Board. Certain risk management responsibilities are formally delegated by the Board, principally to a sub-committee of the Board and to the 
Group Finance Director.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may encounter difﬁculty in meeting obligations associated with ﬁnancial liabilities. The objective of the 
Group’s liquidity risk management is to ensure sufﬁcient committed liquidity resources exist. The Group has a diversiﬁed debt structure largely 
represented by medium term unsecured syndicated committed bank facilities, medium to long term unsecured bond debt and ﬁnance leases. 
It is a policy requirement that debt obligations must be addressed well in advance of their due dates.
Group treasury policy requires a minimum of £250m of committed liquidity headroom at all times within medium term bank facilities and such 
facilities must be renewed or replaced well before their expiry dates. At 31 March 2015, the total amount of these facilities stood at £800.0m 
(2014: £826.3m; 2013: £1,259.4m), and committed headroom was £800.0m (2014: £796.2m; 2013: £821.6m), in addition to free cash balances 
of £223.8m (2014: £192.3m; 2013: £393.9m). The next material contractual expiry of revolver bank facilities is in June 2019. Largely due to the 
seasonality of the First Student school bus business, headroom tends to reduce from March to October and increases again by the 
following March.
The average duration of net debt (excluding ring-fenced cash) at 31 March 2015 was 5.2 years (2014: 6.1 years; 2013: 5.4 years).
The following tables detail the Group’s expected maturity of payables/(receivables) for its derivative ﬁnancial instruments. The amounts in these 
tables are different to the balance sheet as the table is prepared on an undiscounted cash ﬂow basis.

currency swaps.
No derivative ﬁnancial instruments had collateral requirements or were due on demand in any of the years.
Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss to foreign currency net assets, earnings and cash ﬂows reported in pounds Sterling due to movements 
in exchange rates.
The Group’s principal operations outside the UK are in the US and Canada, with the US being the most signiﬁcant. Consequently the principal 
currency risk relates to movements in the US Dollar to pounds Sterling. 
Group treasury policy aims to protect EPS from currency movements. US Dollar earnings arising in the US are mitigated by US Dollar 
denominated costs incurred in the UK, principally UK fuel costs, US Dollar interest costs and US Dollar tax costs. Cash ﬂow exposures are  
not material.
IFRS 7 requires the Group to show the impact on proﬁt after tax and hedging reserve on ﬁnancial instruments from a movement in exchange 
rates. The following analysis details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% strengthening in Sterling against the US Dollar. The analysis has been 
prepared based on the change taking place at the beginning of the ﬁnancial year and being held constant throughout the reporting period. 
A positive number indicates an increase in earnings or equity where Sterling strengthens against the US Dollar.

Interest rate risk
The Group has variable rate debt and cash and therefore net income is exposed to the effects of changes to interest rates. The Group treasury 
policy objective is to maintain ﬁxed interest rates at a minimum average of 75% of on-balance sheet net debt over the medium term, so that 
volatility is substantially reduced year on year to EPS. The policy objective is primarily achieved through ﬁxed rate debt. The main ﬂoating rate 
benchmarks on variable rate debt are US Dollar LIBOR and pounds Sterling LIBOR.
At 31 March 2015, 85% (2014: 100%; 2013: 100%) of net debt was ﬁxed. This ﬁxed rate protection had an average duration of 5.3 years 
(2014: 6.3 years; 2013: 5.5 years). 
Interest rate risk within operating leases is hedged 100% by agreeing ﬁxed rentals with the lessors prior to inception of the lease contracts.
Fair value changes in the £250.0m 2019 and the £350.0m 2021 Sterling bonds relating to the LIBOR element are hedged with coupon swaps. 
These swaps offset the fair value movements in the bond in the income statement and have the same term as the bonds.
The following sensitivity analysis details the Group’s sensitivity to a 100 basis points (1%) increase in interest rates throughout the reporting period 
with all other variables held constant.

Interest rate hedges 
The following table details the notional amounts of interest rate swap contracts designated as a cash ﬂow or fair value hedge which were 
outstanding at the reporting date, the average ﬁxed rate payable or receivable under these swaps and their fair value. The average interest rate is 
based on the outstanding balances at the reporting date. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash ﬂows.
The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis. The differences between the ﬁxed and ﬂoating rates are settled on a 
net basis.

Fuel price risk
The Group purchases diesel fuel on a ﬂoating price basis in its UK Bus, UK Rail, US and Canadian bus operations and therefore is exposed to 
changes in diesel prices, of which the most signiﬁcant element is crude oil price risk. The Group’s policy objective is to maintain a signiﬁcant 
degree of ﬁxed price protection in the short term with lower levels of protection over the medium term, so that the businesses affected are 
protected from any sudden and signiﬁcant increases and have time to prepare for potentially higher costs, whilst retaining some access for 
potentially lower costs over the medium term. The Group primarily uses ﬁxed rate swap instruments to achieve signiﬁcant ﬁxed price certainty. 
During the year to 31 March 2015, the Group was hedged 88% on fuel price risk.
The Group has also entered into swaps for periods from April 2015 to March 2017 with the majority of these swaps relating to the year to 
31 March 2016. The swaps give rise to monthly cash ﬂow exchanges with counterparties to offset the underlying settlement of ﬂoating price 
costs, except where they have a deferred start date. Gains or losses on fuel derivatives are recycled from equity to the income statement on 
qualifying hedges to achieve ﬁxed rate fuel costs within operating results.
The following analysis details the Group’s sensitivity on proﬁt after tax and equity if the price of crude oil had been $10 per barrel higher at the

The current liabilities above are included within accruals in note 18.
The insurance claims provision arises from estimated exposures for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date. It is anticipated that the 
majority of such claims will be settled within the next six years although certain liabilities in respect of lifetime obligations of £19.0m (2014: £17.7m; 
2013: £20.0m) can extend for up to 30 years. The utilisation of £163.7m (2014: £176.1m; 2013: £173.1m) represents payments made largely 
against the current liability of the preceding year. 
Legal and other provisions relate to estimated exposures for cases ﬁled or thought highly likely to be ﬁled for incidents that occurred prior to the 
balance sheet date. It is anticipated that most of these items will be settled within 10 years. Also included are provisions in respect of costs 
anticipated on the exit of surplus properties which are expected to be settled over the remaining terms of the respective leases.
The pension’s provision relates to unfunded obligations that arose on the acquisition of certain UK Bus companies. It is anticipated that this will 
be utilised over ﬁve to 10 years.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 142 27 Reserves
The hedging reserve records the movement on designated hedging items.
The share premium account represents the premium on shares issued since 1999 and arose principally on the rights issue on the Ryder 
acquisition in 1999 and the share placings in 2007 and 2008. The reserve is non-distributable.
The own shares reserve represents the cost of shares in FirstGroup plc purchased in the market and either held as treasury shares or held 
in trust to satisfy the exercise of share options.

On 25 August 2014, the Group completed the acquisition of a 51% share in Miles Square Transportation, Inc, a school bus transportation 
company based in New York. The £12.2m consideration represents £11.0m cash paid in the year and £1.2m of deferred consideration. 
Included within the purchase agreement is a put option for the Group to purchase the remaining 49% from the non-controlling interest party for 
a ﬁxed price of US$19.1m. As the put option is a contract to purchase the Group’s own equity instruments it gives rise to a ﬁnancial liability for 
the ﬁxed price amount in accordance with paragraph 23 in IAS 32. We have recognised the ﬁnancial liability in the balance sheet and the initial 
recognition is treated as reclassiﬁed from equity.
The business acquired during the year contributed £6.4m (2014: £nil; 2013: £nil) to the Group’s net operating cash ﬂows and utilised £11.0m 
(2014: £nil; 2013: £nil) for capital expenditure. 
The business acquired during the year contributed £12.1m (2014: £nil; 2013: £nil) to Group revenue and £3.5m (2014: £nil; 2013: £nil) to Group 
operating proﬁt from date of acquisition to 31 March 2015.
If the acquisition of the business acquired during the year had been completed on the ﬁrst day of the ﬁnancial year, Group revenue from this 
acquisition for the period would have been £16.6m (2014: £nil; 2013: £nil) and the Group operating proﬁt from this acquisition attributable to equity 
holders of the parent would have been £3.8m (2014 £nil; 2013: £nil).

On 22 June 2013, the Group completed the disposal of eight London bus depots. The £79.1m consideration represents £76.3m cash received in 
the year to 31 March 2014 and £2.8m of deferred consideration. 
On 8 March 2013, the Group disposed of the First Shared Services business, which provides military base operations support and facility 
management services for sale proceeds of US$10.2m. In addition, during the year to 31 March 2013 the Group disposed of Bus depots in Wigan,

To support subsidiary undertakings in their normal course of business, the Company and certain subsidiaries have indemniﬁed certain banks and 
insurance companies who have issued performance bonds for £489.2m (2014: £504.8m; 2013: £566.2m) and letters of credit for £304.4m (2014: 
£303.3m; 2013: £321.7m). The performance bonds relate to the North American businesses of £421.1m (2014: £337.8m; 2013: £354.7m) and the 
UK Rail franchise operations of £68.1m (2014: £167.0m; 2013: £211.5m). The letters of credit relate substantially to insurance arrangements in the 
UK and North America.
The Company is party to certain unsecured guarantees granted to banks for overdraft and cash management facilities provided to itself and 
subsidiary undertakings. The Company has given certain unsecured guarantees for the liabilities of its subsidiary undertakings arising under 
certain loan notes, HP contracts, ﬁnance leases, operating leases and certain pension scheme arrangements. It also provides unsecured cross 
guarantees to certain subsidiary undertakings as required by VAT legislation. UK Bus subsidiaries have provided unsecured guarantees on a joint 
and several basis to the Trustees of the UK Bus Pension Scheme.
Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have issued unsecured guarantees to the Company’s Sterling bondholders, certain bilateral bank facilities 
for £nil (2014: £75.0m; 2013: £436.9m) and to senior unsecured loan notes for £100.6m (2014: £89.9m; 2013: £98.3m). In previous years 
unsecured guarantees were also provided to lenders participating in the Group’s syndicated unsecured bank facilities. 
The Group has issued guarantees of £4.0m (2014: £4.0m; 2013: £7.0m) to the Danish and Swedish authorities in respect of DSBFirst. 
These guarantees relate to the operational performance of the Danish rail activities and certain train maintenance activities in Sweden.
The Group is party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business, including but not limited to employment and 
safety claims. The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and counterclaims. No provision is made where due to 
inherent uncertainties, no accurate quantiﬁcation of any cost, or timing of such cost, which may arise from any of the legal proceedings can 
be determined.
In its normal course of business UK Rail has ongoing contractual negotiations with government and other organisations.

(d) Buy As You Earn (BAYE)
BAYE enables eligible employees to purchase shares from their gross income. The Company provides two matching shares for every three 
shares bought by employees, subject to a maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of £20 per employee per month. If the shares 
are held in trust for ﬁve years or more, no income tax and national insurance will be payable. The matching shares will be forfeited if the 
corresponding partnership shares are removed from trust within three years of award.
At 31 March 2015 there were 7,338 (2014: 7,903; 2013: 8,306) participants in the BAYE scheme who have cumulatively purchased 11,916,378 
(2014: 9,201,084; 2013: 6,159,479) shares with the Company contributing 3,931,908 (2014: 2,998,927; 2013: 1,936,789) matching shares on a 
cumulative basis. 
(e) Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Awards under the LTIP scheme vest over the three year periods to 31 March from year of award with 50% of the award being dependent upon 
adjusted EPS performance over the vesting period and the other 50% being dependent upon total shareholder return over the same period 
compared to a comparator group.

These options vested on 1 November 2013. There were no performance conditions attaching to these options.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous ﬁve years. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and 
behavioural considerations.
Allowances have been made for the SAYE schemes for the fact that, amongst a group of recipients some are expected to leave before an 
entitlement vests. The accounting charge is then adjusted over the vesting period to take account of actual forfeitures, so although the total 
charge is unaffected by the pre-vesting forfeiture assumption, the timing of the recognition of the expense will be sensitive to it. Fair values for the

34 Retirement beneﬁt schemes
Deﬁned contribution plans
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. There is no legal or constructive 
obligation to pay additional contributions into a deﬁned contribution scheme if the fund has insufﬁcient assets to pay all employees’ beneﬁts 
relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
UK
The Group operates deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt plans for all Group and UK Bus division employees who have joined a pension 
arrangement from January 2011 and April 2013, respectively. They will receive a Company match to their contributions, which varies by 
salary level.
North America
Employees in the US have been able to join a deﬁned contribution arrangement for many years. They will receive a Company match to their 
contributions, which varies by employment status. The Company match is 50% of member contributions, to a Company maximum of 3% for 
full-time employees and $250 per annum for part-time employees. 
All new employees in Canada join a deﬁned contribution arrangement. Union employees join the Eastern or Western plan, dependent upon their 
geographical location, whilst managers and supervisors join the Supervisory plan, for non-union employees. Members of the Western and 
Supervisory plans can contribute 2%, 3%, 4% or 5%, and receive a 50% Company match. Members of the Eastern plan may contribute 2%, 
3% or 4%, and receive a 100% Company match.
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement of £23.0m (2014: £19.6m) represents contributions payable to these plans by 
the Group at rates speciﬁed in the rules of the plans.
Deﬁned beneﬁt plans
The Group sponsors 16 funded deﬁned beneﬁt plans across its operations, covering approximately 70,000 former and current employees.
UK
The majority of deﬁned beneﬁt provision is through Trust-based schemes. With the exception of the Railways Pension Schemes (RPS), these 
arrangements are now closed to new entrants. In these arrangements the assets of the schemes are invested separately from those of the Group, 
and the schemes are run by independent Trustee boards. The Trustee board of the pension schemes is required by law, or by their Articles of 
Association, to act in the best interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme, i.e. active employees, inactive employees, 
retirees, beneﬁciaries and employers. There is a requirement for the Trustee board to have some member representation with the other Trustees 
being company appointed.
The Trustee board is responsible for the investment policy in respect of the assets of the fund, although the Company must be consulted on this, 
and typically has some input into the investment decisions.
Schemes are valued at least triennially, when the cost of future service is calculated and the funding position established. The Company and 
Trustee board are required to agree on assumptions for the valuation and to agree the contributions that result from this. The contributions may 
need to incorporate deﬁcit recovery contributions in addition to future service contributions, if a deﬁcit position is determined through the 
valuation. If a surplus is shown at the valuation, this may be used to reduce future service contributions. In agreeing contribution rates, reference 
must be made to the affordability of contributions by the employer.
In most arrangements, any surplus after beneﬁts have been paid/secured, can be repaid to the employer.

The First UK Bus Pension Scheme
This predominantly provides pension beneﬁts to employees in the UK Bus division. Historically the scheme provided ﬁnal salary beneﬁts and 
career average beneﬁts. However, with effect from April 2012, the scheme only provides career average beneﬁts with a retirement age linked to 
State Pension age and a cap on the pensionable pay on which deﬁned beneﬁts can be built. 
Following negotiations with recognised Trades Unions, changes were made to the beneﬁt provisions from April 2015, which included:
 Reducing the cap on defined benefit pensionable pay to £21,580 (2014-2015: £30,660) and removing indexation on the cap.
 Revising the split of the cost of future service so that the employer meets 50% of the cost and the employees 50%. Caps and collars on the level of 
employee contributions that previously existed have been removed to achieve this.
 Introducing an annual test, commencing April 2017 , such that if agreed funding levels are not achieved, the scheme will close to defined benefit 
accrual 12 months later.
In addition there is a smaller Group scheme which provided deﬁned beneﬁt pensions to Group employees and executives. This closed to new 
entrants in 2011.
The Railways Pension Scheme
The Group currently sponsors four sections of the RPS, relating to its franchising obligations for its TOCs, and for Hull Trains, its Open 
Access operator. 
Under this scheme members build a 1/60th pension and 1/40th lump sum based upon their pensionable pay. Some members of the RPS are 
subject to Protected Persons legislation, which requires individual consent to changes to beneﬁts, and certain rights upon transfer between 
sections of the scheme.
The RPS is a shared cost arrangement. All costs, and any deﬁcit or surplus is shared 60% by the employer and 40% by the members. 
Furthermore, under the franchising obligations, the responsibility of the employer is to pay the contributions requested of the Trustee whilst 
it operates the franchise. There is no residual liability or asset for any deﬁcit, or surplus, which remains at the end of the franchise period. 
In calculating the Group’s pension obligations in respect of the RPS the Group has calculated the total pension deﬁcits in each of the RPS 
sections in accordance with IAS 19. These deﬁcits are reduced by a ‘franchise adjustment’ which is that portion of the deﬁcit which is projected 
to exist at the end of the franchise and for which the Group will not be required to fund. The franchise adjustment, which has been calculated by 
the Group’s actuaries, is offset against the present value of the RPS liabilities so as to fairly present the ﬁnancial performance, position and cash 
ﬂows of the Group’s obligations. Allowance is also made in the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements for the cost sharing nature of the beneﬁt 
and in particular, only 60% of the total proﬁt and loss charge and balance sheet position are attributed to the Group and recognised in the 
accounts. Hull Trains is not subject to franchising obligations, and as such it is accounted for under IAS 19 as a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme, although 
subject to the same cost sharing obligations as for the franchised sections.
During the year, the Group’s participation in the Capital Connect section of the RPS ceased. The assets and liabilities of £277.4m and £390.8m 
respectively were transferred to the new franchise operator on 13 September 2014. The assets and liabilities in respect of the Scotrail franchise 
are included within the pension disclosures at the Balance Sheet date and amount to £525.1m and £724.2m respectively. These passed across 
to the new franchise operator on 1 April 2015. 
Local Government Pension Schemes
The Group participates in ﬁve Local Government Pension Schemes (LGPS), three in England and two in Scotland. These differ from Trust-based 
schemes in that their beneﬁts are prescribed by legislation, and they are administered by local authorities, and pension committees consisting of 
local councillors. Typically the Group has less control over the investment strategy adopted by the LGPS compared to the UK Trust-based schemes.
Historically beneﬁt accrual in these schemes has been based on ﬁnal salary. The beneﬁt structure changed to a 1/47th career average beneﬁt in 
England in April 2014 and in Scotland in April 2015. Normal pension age will be aligned with State Pension Age from that time. Some members 
have a right to receive some of their beneﬁts on an unreduced basis, conditional on age and service. 
As with the Trust-based schemes, valuations take place at least triennially. Generally contribution rates are agreed for the three year period 
until the next valuation. Whilst these are balance of cost schemes, at termination there is no right for the Company to receive any surplus in the 
schemes, although there is an obligation on the Company to fully fund the beneﬁts. To reﬂect this, the Group only recognise existing surpluses 
relating to the LGPS when determining the balance sheet position, to the extent that these surpluses could be recouped by the reduction of future 
company contributions.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 150 34 Retirement beneﬁt schemes continued
North America
US
The Group operates two deﬁned beneﬁt arrangements in the US. These are legacy arrangements with beneﬁt accrual having ceased some 
years ago. The schemes are valued annually, when the funding position and minimum and maximum contributions are established. 
Changes in funding position create new surplus or deﬁcit each year, which is normally spread over seven years, as required by legislation. 
However, funding relief passed by Congress in 2010, 2012 and again in 2014, has allowed greater ﬂexibility following the global ﬁnancial crisis. 
The most recent funding relief, passed in 2012 and extended in 2014, has the effect of increasing the funding discount rate, which acts to lower 
liabilities, deﬁcits and contributions. This effect will reduce over time.
Greyhound Canada
There are three plans, relating to Eastern, Western and Supervisory employees. All these plans are now closed to new members, although 
beneﬁt accrual continues for existing members. Very small executive arrangements also exist.
The plans are valued annually, where the cost of future service and the funding position are identiﬁed. Future service costs are shared in 
proportion between the members and the Company, although there are caps on the member rates. Deﬁcit contributions are met entirely by the 
Company. Cash contributions are required to fund the plans on a ‘going concern’ basis, whilst the (usually higher) ‘solvency’ deﬁcit can be made 
good through a Letter of Credit. There is a cap on the value of the Letter of Credit, which cannot exceed 15% of the value of the assets held in 
the plan.
At their last triennial valuations, the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes had funding levels between 74.1% and 105.1% (2014: 70.5% and 101.9%; 
2013: 61.0% and 101.9%). The market value of the assets at 31 March 2015 for all deﬁned beneﬁt schemes totalled £4,146m (2014: £3,902m; 
2013: £3,777m). 
The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes have been made uniform to Group standards, as appropriate, when each scheme is 
actuarially valued.

Cash contributions
As at 31 March 2015 the Group is committed to make deﬁcit recovery payments with a net present value of £130m (2014: £124m), over the period 
to 5 April 2029, in respect of the First UK Bus Pension Scheme. The net present value reﬂects the current value of deﬁcit recovery payments that 
would be required to meet the actuarial deﬁcit in full, discounted at 9.0% per annum. The IAS 19 deﬁcit of the scheme at 31 March 2015 is 
£55.4m (2014: £92.7m). Management consider that, were a pension asset to arise in respect of this scheme, this would be fully recoverable 
through actions within the Group’s control, in line with the rules of the scheme.
The estimated amounts of employer contributions expected to be paid to the deﬁned beneﬁt schemes during the ﬁnancial year to 31 March 2016 
is £88.3m. 
Risks associated with deﬁned beneﬁt plans:
Generally the number of employees in deﬁned beneﬁt plans is reducing rapidly, as these plans are largely closed to new entrants, and in many 
cases to future accrual. Consequently, the number of deﬁned contribution members is increasing. 
Furthermore, changes have been implemented to the First UK Bus Pension Scheme with effect from April 2015 which allow for the closure of the 
scheme if the funding level is not in line with the target level. This change will serve to limit the risks associated with deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
provision by the Group.
Despite remaining open to new entrants and future accrual, the risks posed by the RPS are limited, as under the franchise arrangements, the UK 
Rail TOCs are not responsible for any residual deﬁcit at the end of a franchise. As such, there is only short term cash ﬂow risk within this business. 
The key risks relating to the deﬁned beneﬁt pension arrangements and the steps taken by the Group to mitigate them are as follows:
Risk Description Mitigation
Asset volatility The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with 
reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this 
yield, this will create a deﬁcit. Most of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
arrangements hold a signiﬁcant proportion of return-seeking 
assets (equities, diversiﬁed growth funds and global absolute 
return funds) which, though expected to outperform corporate 
bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term.
Asset liability modelling has been undertaken recently in all 
signiﬁcant plans to ensure that any risks taken are expected 
to be rewarded.
Inﬂation risk A signiﬁcant proportion of the UK beneﬁt obligations are linked 
to inﬂation, and higher inﬂation will lead to higher liabilities.
The business has certain inﬂation linking in its revenue 
streams, which helps to offset this risk. In addition, the 
investment strategy reviews have led to increased inﬂation 
hedging, mainly through swaps or holding Index Linked 
Gilts in the UK schemes. 
Uncertainty over 
level of future 
contributions
Contributions to deﬁned beneﬁt schemes can be unpredictable 
and volatile as a result of changes in the funding level revealed 
at each valuation. 
The Group engages with the Trustees and Administering 
Authorities to consider how contribution requirements can 
be made more stable. The level of volatility and the Group’s 
ability to control contribution levels varies between 
arrangements. 
Life expectancy The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide beneﬁts 
for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will 
result in an increase in the liabilities.
Linking retirement age to State Pension Age (as in the UK 
Bus Pension Scheme and LGPS) has mitigated this risk to 
some extent.
Trapped surplus At termination of LGPS arrangements there is no right for the 
company to receive any surplus that exists within the scheme. 
Therefore there is a risk of overfunding the schemes. 
This issue is discussed with the Administering Authorities 
when contribution schedules are set, and the Group 
receives professional advice on potential ways of mitigating 
some of this risk. 
Legislative risk Future legislative changes are uncertain. In the past these have 
led to increases in obligations, through introducing pension 
increases, and vesting of deferred pensions, or reduced 
investment return through the ability to reclaim Advance 
Corporation Tax. 
We are aware that the UK Government has already legislated 
to end contracting out in 2016 and that there is an intention to 
implement legislation which could result in an increase in the 
value of Guaranteed Minimum Pension. If this legislation is 
implemented, this would increase the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation 
of the UK arrangements. 
The UK Bus Pension Scheme and the FirstGroup Pension 
Scheme are contracted into the State Second Pension, 
reducing the impact of the cessation of contracting out on 
the Group.
The Group receives professional advice on the impact of 
legislative changes.

Financial statements Opinion on ﬁnancial statements of FirstGroup plc
In our opinion:
 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2015 and of the 
Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union;
 the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The ﬁnancial statements comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
balance sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash ﬂow statement, and the related notes 1 to 35, the 
parent company balance sheet, and the related notes to the parent company balance sheet 1 to 11. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has 
been applied in the preparation of the Group ﬁnancial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The ﬁnancial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company ﬁnancial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement contained within Other statutory information on page 103 that the 
Group is a going concern. We conﬁrm that:
 we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate; and
 we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
Independent auditor’s report to the members of FirstGroup plc
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 160 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
The assessment of the carrying value of First Student 
goodwill (£1,073.5m) in the consolidated balance sheet 
The assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and 
intangibles, as described in Note 2, involves judgement in 
relation to forecasting future cash ﬂows and is sensitive to 
growth rates and the discount rate applied to the future 
cash ﬂows. The Cash Generating Unit (CGU) most sensitive 
to variation in these assumptions is the First Student CGU, 
as disclosed in Note 11 to the ﬁnancial statements, as it 
continues to implement its returns based strategy.
We challenged management’s assumptions used in their impairment model for 
goodwill, speciﬁcally including the cash ﬂow projections, discount rates and growth 
rates applied. Our procedures included: 
 considering the identification of appropriate cash generating units;
 assessing cash flow forecast projections with reference to historical trading 
performance and cash flow forecasting accuracy;
 comparing the discount rate applied against a broad comparator group as well as 
involving our internal valuation specialists to review underlying calculations and 
assess the key components of the discount rate calculation;
 considering the reasonableness of, and recalculating, the sensitivity assessment 
applied by management; and
 performing further independent sensitivity analysis on the impairment model.
The assessment of the valuation and completeness of third 
party claims and associated provisions (£365.6m) in the 
consolidated balance sheet
The valuation and completeness of both legal and 
self-insurance provisions are a source of estimation 
uncertainty, as described in Note 2 and Note 25, which 
require management’s best estimate in assessing the 
likeliness and valuation of settlement and, where applicable, 
the discount rate applied to the external settlement values.
The audit procedures we performed in respect of this risk included: 
 working with our own actuarial specialists to test a range of estimates determined by 
management and their external actuary considering the methodologies employed 
and comparing assumptions used to the Group’s historical experience;
 independently developing an actuarial calculation and comparing the provision 
recorded to the actuarial range calculated by the external actuary;
 testing a sample of underlying data used to develop the provision for completeness 
and accuracy and challenging the appropriateness of the discount rate used through 
comparison to prior years and those used by similar entities; and
 obtaining confirmations from internal and independent external legal counsel. 
Valuation of pension scheme liabilities (£4.9bn) in the 
consolidated balance sheet
The Group operates in a labour intensive industry with large 
membership to a number of deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
schemes. The gross pension liabilities, as disclosed in Note 
34, are materially sensitive to changes in the underlying 
assumptions adopted. Management exercise signiﬁcant 
judgement when determining those assumptions, 
particularly in respect of the discount rate, inﬂation and 
mortality rates, as described in Note 2.
The audit procedures we performed in respect of this risk included: 
 working with our own actuarial specialists to test the assumptions used by 
management in valuing the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme liabilities such 
as the discount rate, inflation and mortality rate; and 
 performing sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions and comparing them to 
industry benchmarks and the prior years’ rates adopted.
Revenue recognition including contract accounting (Note 2)
The Group operates a number of long term contracts 
including UK rail franchises and certain North American 
passenger and service contracts. Management exercise 
judgement in determining the appropriate timing and 
valuation of revenue recognised, valuation of deferred and 
accrued income and the evaluation of the overall 
proﬁtability of these contracts.
To test the risk of material misstatement in respect of revenue recognition, our 
procedures included: 
 assessing and challenging the judgements taken by management by reference to 
the underlying contract terms and applicable accounting standards; and 
 challenging profit forecasts prepared by management by reference to historical 
trading performance and forecasting accuracy. 
The description of the above risks should be read in conjunction with the signiﬁcant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed on 
page 73 of the Directors’ and corporate governance report.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and not to 
express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements is not modiﬁed with respect to any risks 
described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters. 
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 161
Financial statements Our application of materiality
We deﬁne materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or inﬂuenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £7.9m (2014: £5.6m), which is 4.8% of adjusted pre-tax proﬁt (as deﬁned on page 119), and below 
1% of equity. The adjusted pre-tax proﬁt measure has been used to exclude the volatility of non-recurring items. In addition, the exclusion of 
amortisation and the income statement effect of ineffective and unhedged ﬁnancial derivative valuation is consistent with the key measure used 
by the Group for internal and external reporting requirements. This measure has been used to facilitate a better understanding of the trading 
performance of the Group. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £158,000 (2014: £100,000) as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on 
disclosure matters that we identiﬁed when assessing the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing the 
risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the four UK Bus 
operating regions, three signiﬁcant UK Train Operating Companies, the operations in North America and the Group, Rail division and Bus division 
corporate head ofﬁce functions as well as the UK Shared Service Centre. These locations were subject to full audit procedures and represent the 
principal business units and account for 89% of the Group’s net assets, 99% of the Group’s revenue and 100% of the Group’s proﬁt before tax. 
They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identiﬁed above. 
Our audit work at locations subject to full audit procedures was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual location which was 
lower than Group materiality.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to conﬁrm our conclusion that there were 
no signiﬁcant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated ﬁnancial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of 
speciﬁed account balances.
We include all component audit teams in our team brieﬁng, discuss their risk assessment and a senior member of the Group audit team has 
visited all locations to review documentation of the ﬁndings from their work.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
 the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made 
or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to 
report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance 
with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Independent auditor’s report to the members of FirstGroup plc
continued
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 162 Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our  
audit; or
 otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identiﬁed any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and 
the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We conﬁrm that we have 
not identiﬁed any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements 
and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit 
methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that 
the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

Financial statements 1 Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain ﬁnancial instruments and on a going 
concern basis as described in the going concern statement in the Directors’ report on pages 103 to 104. 
The following accounting policies have been used consistently throughout the year and the preceding year in accordance with UK GAAP. 
Cash ﬂow statement
The Company has taken the advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 (revised) not to disclose a cash ﬂow statement.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment. For investments in subsidiaries acquired 
for consideration, including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured by reference to the nominal value only of the shares 
issued. Any premium is ignored.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds Sterling are recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet 
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the relevant balance 
sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of non-monetary items at each balance 
sheet date are included in the proﬁt or loss for the accounting period.
Tax
The charge for tax is based on the proﬁt or loss for the year and takes into account tax deferred because of timing differences between the 
treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. Provision is made for deferred tax on all timing differences except those arising from 
the revaluation of ﬁxed assets for which there is no binding agreement to sell on property gains if it is anticipated that rollover relief will be available 
and on the undistributed proﬁts of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. Deferred tax is calculated at the rates at which it is 
estimated the tax will arise. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. 
The deferred tax provision is not discounted to net present value.
Financial instruments
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recorded at fair value and then for reporting purposes are re-measured to fair value at each 
subsequent balance sheet date.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks. Use of such ﬁnancial 
instruments is governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board. The Company does not use derivative ﬁnancial instruments 
for speculative purposes. In relation to fuel price risks, the Company’s proﬁt and loss account is affected by transactions with afﬁliated companies 
that give rise to cash ﬂow volatility associated with fuel price risk.
The main derivative ﬁnancial instruments used by the Company are interest rate swaps and collars, fuel swaps and collars, and cross currency 
interest rate swaps. Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet 
date. The fair values are calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by 
counterparty conﬁrmations.
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash ﬂow hedges or foreign currency 
hedges of a foreign net investment are recognised in the proﬁt and loss account as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁes for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to 
the proﬁt and loss account for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses 
reported in the income statement.
Related party transactions
As permitted under FRS 8, Related Party Transactions, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption not to disclose transactions between 
Group companies.
Debt
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after the deduction of issue costs. The carrying amount is increased by the amortisation 
of debt issuance fees in respect of the accounting period and reduced by repayments made in the period.
Notes to the Company ﬁnancial statements
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2015 166 1 Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s ﬁnancial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.
2 Proﬁt/(loss) for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own proﬁt and loss account for the year. 
FirstGroup plc reported a proﬁt for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 March 2015 of £162.0m (2014: loss £140.2m).
Proposed ﬁnal dividend per share for the year ended 31 March 2015 of nil p (2014: nil p).
Fees payable to the Company’s auditors for the audit of the Company’s annual ﬁnancial statements are disclosed in note 6 on page 123. 
The Company had no employees in the current or preceding ﬁnancial year.

Unsolicited telephone calls and correspondence
Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to 
buy shares at a discount, or offers of free reports about the Company. 
These are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target US or UK 
shareholders, offering to sell them what often turns out to be worthless or 
high risk shares. These operations are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’ 
and the ‘brokers’ can be very persistent and extremely persuasive.

authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). You can check a 
ﬁrm is properly authorised by the FCA before getting involved by visiting 
www.fca.org.uk/register. If you do deal with an unauthorised ﬁrm, you 
will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme if anything goes wrong. For more detailed

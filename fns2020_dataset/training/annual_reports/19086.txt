 • Investor	 relations
 • Careers	with	us I wrote a year ago that our market remains 
challenging and competitive; this has 
continued with new supply coming into the 
market and consumer expectations evermore 
demanding. We are also expecting further 
cost inflation as a result of the introduction  
of the living wage from April 2016. These 
challenges mean we need to remain on top of 
our game, and continue to make the most of 
the outstanding assets we have in our estate.
Against this backdrop, I’m delighted that we 
are able to report adjusted EPS growth of  
9.5% in the year. We’ve achieved this while 
making good progress operationally, with  
the integration of Orchid continuing, the 
completion of the pub systems project, further 
single site acquisitions in the UK and Germany, 
and growing further our like-for-like estate.
The resumption of a dividend is a further 
acknowledgement of the improvement in  
the Company’s financial position over recent 
years as well as the Board’s confidence in  
the future prospects for the business. This, 
together with the agreement reached with the 
pension trustees as a part of the 2013 triennial 
settlement, means that the Directors are 
recommending the payment of a dividend of  
5p per share, with a progressive policy going 
forward based on the performance of  
the business.
The market in which 
we operate remains 
challenging and 
competitive.

Operational highlights
I was delighted to end the year with the 
announcement of Phil Urban’s appointment  
as our new Chief Executive. Phil brings a 
wealth of experience from the wider leisure 
sector, has a strong track record of delivery 
and has had a significant impact on the 
business since joining as Chief Operating 
Officer in January. We welcome Phil to the 
Board and look forward to working with  
him to take the business forward.
I would also like to thank Alistair Darby for  
his significant contribution to the business in 
his three years as Chief Executive. We wish 
him all the best for the future.
Also on the Board, we appointed Stewart 
Gilliland as Senior Independent Director in 
February 2015, continuing the strong progress 
we have shown in this area in recent years. 
Since the year end Piedmont Inc. has nominated 
Josh Levy as one of its two non-independent 
representative Board Directors, replacing 
Douglas McMahon. Josh was therefore 
appointed to the Board on 13 November,  
and will stand for reappointment at the  
Annual General Meeting in January. I would 
like to welcome Josh to the Board and thank 
Douglas for his contribution. I remain very 
pleased with the makeup of the Board and 
how we continue to work together to drive  
the business forward.
As ever in this industry, our business is  
driven by the hard work and commitment  
of our employees, and I would like to thank 
them all on behalf of the Board for their 
continued efforts. It is our team of dedicated 
and passionate people who work hard to 
delight our guests and ultimately enable  
us to grow shareholder value.
We look forward to delivering further  
progress in the year ahead.

job is to ensure that 
we get our brands 
right, and free up 
the leaders of our 
teams to delight  
our guests again  
and again.
Over the coming pages I will share my views  
on the business, our strategy and KPIs, and  
our key risks and uncertainties. But I thought  
I would begin by taking a few moments to 
introduce myself as the new Chief Executive  
of your Company and to share with you some  
of my priorities going forward.
I joined M&B in January 2015 having gained 
over 25 years of experience in the UK 
hospitality sector, working for companies like, 
Scottish & Newcastle, Whitbread and Rank.  
In that time I have learnt that this sector is 
essentially all about people, and always will 
be. While it is important to have great sites, 
with strong brands, in good locations with 
relevant appealing offers, the differentiator  
is having a team of talented people who are 
passionate about giving their guests a great 
experience, each and every time they visit.  
My most important job as Chief Executive 
therefore is to ensure that we get our brands 
right, and then free up the leaders of our 
teams to do what they do best, which is to 
delight our guests again and again!

Chief Executive’s statement
Phil Urban
Chief	 Executive If we are to achieve this aim we have a lot  
of work to do. We have to create the right 
balance of insight-driven brands, ensuring that 
we have the right offer in each location. We 
need to simplify the way we work, removing 
the bureaucracy in the business and freeing up  
our team to spend more time in the business 
serving our guests. We also need to instil a 
stronger commercial edge to the way we do 
business, driving profitable sales and value 
creation. Whilst doing all of this, we also  
need to continue identifying, developing  
and nurturing our ‘stars’, to secure the 
long-term future of our Company. 
This is against the market backdrop of 
increasing competition with a consumer who 
is becoming ever more demanding and a major 
cost headwind on the horizon in the form  
of the National Living Wage. However, such 
challenges are not new to the industry, to  
our Company or to me as an individual – and I 
believe that M&B has the scale and experience 
to carry on winning in this environment.

Our vision
What we want to be famous for
Guests love to eat and drink with us.
Our mission
What we set out to achieve
Consistently deliver great service to our guests to drive repeat visits  
and recommendation, while delivering great financial results and  
shareholder returns.
Values
How the business behaves
 • Passion
 • Respect
 • Innovation
 • Drive
 • Engagement
Our market  Page 8
Where we operate 
We recognise that we operate in a dynamic 
market with ever-changing circumstances. 
Our market is, in aggregate, a mature one 
with growth expected broadly to track GDP 
and consumer expenditure. However, there 
are dynamics within this market on which  
we can capitalise, namely the: 
 • growth in branded outlets
 • continued growth in eating-out
 • consumers’ continued focus on value
 • consumers’ demand for eating-out at  
any time of day
Business model  Page 14
How the business delivers value 
Our business model is designed to maximise 
revenue and profit from our operations. We 
believe that by adopting industry-leading 
practices; recruiting, training and retaining
the best people, and by focusing on 
excellent customer service we will  
deliver long-term growth in profits  
and shareholder value.
Our strategy  Page 16
How we will achieve our mission 
Our strategic priorities remain unchanged to:
 • focus the business on the most  
attractive market spaces within eating 
and drinking-out
 • develop superior brand propositions 
with high levels of consumer relevance
 • recruit, retain and develop engaged 
people who deliver excellent service  
for our guests
 • generate high returns on investment 
through scale advantage
 • maintain a sound financial base
Risks  Page 18
How we manage our markets and  
operating environment 
This section highlights the principal risks that 
affect the Company, together with the key 
mitigating activities in place to manage those 
risks. Key risks identified are reviewed and
assessed by the Risk Committee in terms of 
their likelihood and impact, in conjunction 
with associated risk mitigation plans.
KPIs  Page 22
How we monitor our success 
We measure our performance and  
progress against our strategy through five 
key performance indicators including two 
non-financial KPIs, relating to our ability  
to retain our employees and to the extent
that our guests would recommend our 
businesses to their friends and family.  
These KPIs are reviewed at every Executive 
Committee meeting and are central to  
our understanding of our performance.

our customers.
The environment in which we 
operate remains competitive  
and dynamic. 
The external landscape
The environment in which we operate remains 
competitive and dynamic. New supply into the 
market has been widely reported, consumer 
trends are evolving and becoming ever more 
demanding, and we are facing a dramatically 
changing cost landscape with the introduction 
of the National Living Wage next year. 
However, such challenges are not new to the 
industry or the Group, and we will respond 
with energy and urgency to each. 
Market supply
In recent years the UK eating and drinking-out 
market has changed significantly. We have 
seen the number of restaurants increase, with 
net new openings of around 1,700 in the year 
to June, and close to 5,000 from 2012 to 2015. 
Over that period there have been more than 
3,500 restaurant closures, and many pub 
closures, highlighting the ongoing structural 
change in the market and the competitive 
environment in which we are all operating.
The composition of the market has changed: 
independent restaurants and tenanted pubs 
have reduced, with growth coming from the 
branded sector and casual dining. Much of the 
new competition in the sector is ‘fast-casual’, 
with operators often single-brand focused, 
with a relatively small number of outlets and 
flexibility to keep offers fresh and up-to-date.
In several of our outlets we have seen the 
direct impact of competition opening in close 
proximity. More than half of our Harvester and 
Toby Carvery sites have been impacted by 
direct competitors opening in their immediate 
catchment, with several of those seeing 
multiple new openings nearby. 
This clearly has an impact on short-term 
trading, and presents a challenge for us to 
meet. However, we recognise the strength  
of our brands and that these new entrants 
have the effect of growing the market over 
time, and present an opportunity for the 
strongest and best executed offers to grow.
Consumers
The changing competitive landscape is  
a direct response to a more demanding 
consumer. Expectations are rising on quality, 
environment, value and the range of offers 
available. Value continues to be important, 
although crucially this does not just equal low 
price. Consumers are now increasingly looking 
to explore and broaden their horizons for 
eating and drinking-out. There is also a greater 
demand for personalisation – the mindset of 
having ‘what I want and when I want it’ 
continues to strengthen. 
Consumers’ lifestyles are also changing. Alcohol 
consumption is reducing, and there is a broad 
trend towards health consciousness, although 
very much still retaining a willingness for the 
occasional indulgence in ‘guilty pleasures’. 
Finally, the impact of technology is ubiquitous. 
Consumers are increasingly digitally connected 
in all aspects of life, with implications for how 
we communicate with and serve them. 
National Living Wage
The introduction of the National Living Wage 
is highly significant for our industry due to  
the relatively high proportion of employees 
paid at or close to the minimum wage, with 
earnings supported by gratuities. As a large 
employer, with more than 44,000 employees, 
we need to respond to what will be an 
impactful cost headwind. With consumers as 
focused as ever on value and service, we do 
not believe it will be possible for companies in 
our sector to simply ‘control’ their way out of 
the National Living Wage.
Our approach must therefore be rounded  
and must consider the long-term horizon: we 
recognise that it is a cost headwind but also that it 
potentially presents some consumers with higher 
incomes. We continue to consider productivity 
and efficiency opportunities, including 
technology and reviewing brand service models. 
We will also continue to look at opportunities to 
increase guest spend per head. This may mean 
tactical price opportunities to the extent we feel 
it is appropriate for certain brands, but also 
offering our guests the opportunity to trade-up 
the menu. Finally, we must respond to changes in 
consumer demand that arise, and therefore must 
continue to monitor the relevance of our offers. 
These processes will remain iterative throughout 
the coming years.

Our business model
 1 	 Our	 people
 Recruit
Recruit the right people at all levels  
of the organisation. 
 Induct and train
Induct and train our new people to see 
them through what can be a steep and 
pressurised learning curve. 
 Retain
Retain our people by helping them build 
a career that works for them.
We employ more than 44,000 people  
who are vital to the successful running of our 
business. In a highly competitive market serving 
guests with increasingly high standards and 
expectations, our people are the key 
differentiating factor in giving them a great 
experience, each and every time they visit and 
in helping us to gain a competitive advantage. 
Our approach to people is therefore to:
 • Recruit the right people at all levels of  
the organisation. We recruit our people  
to be great at hospitality, with a focus on 
personality rather than experience.  
We look to recruit people who share our 
values of Passion, Respect, Innovation,  
Drive and Engagement, and who wish to 
progress within the organisation;
 • Induct and train our new people to support 
them through what can be a steep and 
pressurised learning curve. This involves 
strict compliance training to ensure our  
high standards are maintained, but also 
welcoming them into a supportive 
environment so that they feel prepared  
when serving guests for the first time.  
Where possible we look to promote to  
house manager and beyond from within  
the organisation, offering a compelling 
reason to join our fantastic business; and
 • Focus on team engagement, helping to  
retain our people by helping them build a 
career that works for them. We can use our 
scale to offer flexibility in the workplace as 
well as a fantastic and varied career path.  
We encourage our people to make the  
most of working for our brands, but also to 
develop and build a career with us. We offer 
nationwide opportunities across a range of 
formats and functions including front of 
house, back of house and in our Retail 
Support Centre.
 3 	 Our	 guests
Our aim is to delight our guests through each 
and every one of the 140 million meals and 
430 million drinks we serve each year . This is the 
output of having the right people in place and by 
adopting the right practices, and ensures that 
we are able to welcome guests into a clean,  
safe and friendly environment. 
Beyond this, we need to offer brand 
propositions that meet our guests’ wide-ranging 
and evolving needs. These offerings vary 
across our range of brands. For example,  
we have an outstanding range of cask ales  
in Nicholson’s and Ember Inns, live sport with 
high-value food and drink in our Heartland 
estate, family roast dinners at the likes of  
Toby Carvery and Country Pubs, and special 
occasion dining in Miller & Carter and Browns. 
This takes place at some of the most outstanding 
locations across the country. 
We have dedicated teams of employees focused 
on making all of these propositions available at 
great value for our guests. Through this focus 
we aim for our guests to leave us having had a 
pleasurable and memorable experience, and 
one that they will highly recommend to friends 
and family to broaden our guest base further. 
 2 	 Our	 practices
 Safety
Our approach to  safety is our first  
and most important priority  in operating 
our businesses. 
 Suppliers
We work with our suppliers to deliver   
the best products  at the best value  to  
our guests. 
 Technology
Our practices rely  on us staying relevant 
 in our approach to technology. 
Our practices refer to the way in which we 
approach all of our key activities, including 
compliance with legislation; how we conduct 
ourselves in interacting with our various 
stakeholders; and how we utilise equipment 
and technology. Consistent and faultless 
adoption of these practices gives us the 
foundation to be able to operate outstanding 
pubs and restaurants for our guests to enjoy.
Our first and most important priority in  
carrying out these practices is safety. We  
set ourselves the highest standards to ensure 
that our businesses are safe for our people  
to work in and our guests to eat and drink in. 
These principles are paramount in everything 
we do, and are reflected in performance 
measures at all levels of the organisation.
We work with our suppliers seeking to deliver 
the best value to our guests. Our approach to 
supply chain management is to utilise our scale 
through volume suppliers where appropriate, 
but to also work in partnership with smaller 
specialist suppliers such as local farmers,  
when it benefits the product and gives the  
best quality and value to our guests. Outside  
of products we also work closely with building 
and maintenance contractors and technology 
suppliers to deliver value and standards 
throughout the wider business.
Our approach to systems and technology  
is increasingly important to the way in which  
we do business. This includes appropriate 
technology in our pubs and restaurants, both 
front and back of house, as well as the wider 
support to the business in terms of management 
information and use of data for decision-making. 
In the year we completed our investment in new 
EPOS systems to enable greater efficiency within 
our operations by speeding up order taking and 
bill payment, improving business controls, and 
allowing our retail teams to spend more time 
with our guests. We also fully recognise the 
importance of enhancing our investment in our 
digital capability to understand, communicate 
and interact with our guests.  Our business model focuses on  
the principle that by operating  
with the best people and with the 
best practices, we will deliver 
outstanding experiences to our 
guests and generate sustained 
value to our various stakeholders. 
Through delivery of these 
priorities, we can deliver our 
strategic goals and deliver further 
value to our stakeholders.

E How we guarantee a great 
customer experience.
This section highlights the top ten 
principal risks and uncertainties 
that affect the Company, together 
with the key mitigating activities  
in place to manage those risks. 
This does not represent a 
comprehensive list of all of the 
risks that the Company faces,  
but focuses on those that are 
currently considered to be most 
relevant at the current time.
Risk management is critical to our corporate 
responsibilities and to the delivery of shareholder 
value. Risk is at the heart of everything we do  
as an organisation. Therefore the process for 
identifying and assessing risks and opportunities 
is an integral and inseparable part of the 
management skills and processes which  
are the core of our business. 
There is an established Risk Committee in 
place, which met on four occasions in FY 2015 
and continues to meet on a quarterly basis to 
review the key risks facing the business. Key 
risks identified are reviewed and assessed by 
the Risk Committee in terms of their likelihood 
and impact, within the Group’s ‘Key Risk  
Heat Map’, in conjunction with associated risk 
mitigation plans. The processes that are used 
to identify and manage risks are described in 
the Internal Control and Risk Management 
statement on pages 47 and 48.
Management support, involvement and 
enforcement is fundamental to the success  
of our risk management framework and each 
member of the Executive Committee takes 
responsibility for the management of the 
specific risks associated with their department. 
Our Group risk register clearly outlines the 
alignment of each key risk to an Executive 
Committee member and an ‘action owner’, to 
ensure responsibilities are formally aligned. 
Therefore, there is a robust and transparent 
process in place to provide an appropriate level 
of direction and support in the identification, 
assessment and management of those aspects 
of the business which have the potential to 
damage seriously our financial position, our 
responsibilities to our staff and customers,  
our reputation and our relationship with  
key stakeholders.

Consumer taste and 
brand management
Social and demographic changes 
are driving the long-term growth 
in eating-out while at the same 
time leading to a steady decline  
in the sales of on-trade drinks 
without food. These changes, 
together with other developments 
in consumer taste, may reduce  
the appeal of Mitchells & Butlers’ 
brands to its guests, especially  
if the Company fails to anticipate 
and identify these changes and 
respond to them adequately  
and promptly.
In FY 2013, the Company conducted a major piece of 
consumer research, interviewing 8,000 consumers about 
14,000 leisure occasions. This research examined macro 
economic trends, consumer dynamics, competitor and 
internal brand positioning and the Company’s strengths 
and weaknesses. The business continues to implement 
the outputs from this project to refine further its brand 
positioning and ensure the portfolio’s continued relevance 
for guests. This is discussed in detail in the Business 
Review on pages 24 and 25.
The Company uses an online guest satisfaction survey to 
collect guest feedback. This feedback together with the 
results of research studies is monitored and evaluated by a 
dedicated guest insight team to ensure that the relevance 
to guests of the Company’s brands is maintained.
Net promoter score, as defined on page 116, is the key 
measure of success in this area, and this has improved 
from 63% in FY 2014 to 65% in FY 2015.

Pricing and market 
changes
External influences, such as 
changes in the general economic 
climate or competitor activity, 
could have a detrimental effect 
on consumers’ spending patterns 
and therefore the Company’s 
revenue, profitability and 
consequently the value of  
its assets.
Mitchells & Butlers is focused on the long-term potential of the 
eating-out market. The Company owns sites across the UK 
with a wide spectrum of offers targeted at different consumer 
groups and leisure occasions. This range allows the 
Company to respond to changes in consumer expenditure 
either by flexing our offerings or by substituting a different 
brand at a particular location. This activity is supported by 
dedicated Sales and Margin Managers and Asset Planning 
teams which analyse and evaluate a range of information 
including that in respect of competitors.

Operational risks
Cost of goods  
price increases  
(including energy 
price increases)
Increases in the price of goods 
for resale and utilities costs as  
a result of increases in global 
demand and uncertainty of 
supply in producing nations  
can have a significant impact  
on the cost base, consequently 
impacting margins.
Mitchells & Butlers leverages its scale to drive competitive 
cost advantage and collaborates with suppliers to increase 
efficiencies in the supply chain. The fragmented nature of 
the food supply industry on the world commodity markets 
gives the Company the opportunity to source products from 
a number of alternative suppliers in order to drive down cost. 
The Company continually evolves the composition of menus 
and retail prices in order to optimise value to the guest as well 
as profits for the Company.
The energy procurement strategy seeks to reduce the risk of 
cost increases and uncertainty over energy prices by a rolling 
programme of short and medium-term purchases against 
forecast requirements. A dedicated energy management 
team is responsible for optimising energy usage across the 
organisation by promoting energy efficient working practices 
via training and educational programmes and by the 
installation of energy efficient equipment.

People planning  
and development
Mitchells & Butlers has a strong 
guest focus, and as such it is 
important that it is able to attract, 
retain, develop and motivate  
the best people with the right 
capabilities throughout the 
organisation. There is a risk  
that without the right people  
our customer service levels 
would be affected.
The Company makes significant investment in training  
to ensure that its people have the right skills to perform 
their jobs successfully. Furthermore, an employee survey 
is conducted annually to establish employee satisfaction 
and engagement and this is compared with other 
companies, as well as previous surveys. Where 
appropriate, changes in working practices are made  
in response to the findings of these surveys. 
Remuneration packages are benchmarked to ensure that 
they remain competitive and a talent review process is 
used to provide structured succession planning. 
Staff turnover is the key measure of success in this area 
and the Company has maintained the low rate of 76%.

Business continuity 
and crisis 
management
Mitchells & Butlers relies on its 
food and drink supply chain and 
the key IT systems underlying  
the business to serve its guests 
efficiently and effectively. Supply 
chain interruption, IT system 
failure or crises such as terrorist 
activity or the threat of disease 
pandemic might restrict sales or 
reduce operational effectiveness.
The Company has in place crisis and continuity plans  
that are tested and refreshed regularly.
In September 2014, the Company’s third-party  
back-up facility, for retail support centre employees,  
was successfully tested to ensure critical business 
systems are able to function in the event of a disaster.  
In addition, during FY 2015, departmental Business 
Continuity Plans have been developed and reviewed  
by the Risk Committee.

Disaster Recovery 
and IT Resilience
There is a risk that inadequate 
disaster recovery plans and 
processes are in place to mitigate 
against a system outage, or 
failure to ensure appropriate 
back-up facilities covering key 
business systems and the 
recovery of critical data.
In FY 2015 a detailed review of Disaster Recovery  
and IT Resilience was performed in order to highlight  
and address any challenges that had been presented in 
exploring the viability of a Disaster Recovery test for our 
business critical applications. Mitigating solutions have 
been critically assessed during the year.

Report:

National Living Wage There is a risk that increased 
costs associated with the 
introduction of the National 
Living Wage may adversely 
impact upon overall  
operational costs. 
The National Living Wage will be introduced in April 2016  
at £7 .20 per hour, rising to at least £9.00 per hour in  
April 2020. A detailed review of the risks associated  
with successfully implementing the National Living Wage 
has therefore been completed. This review has been 
undertaken at a strategic level and seeks to ensure that 
appropriate mitigating actions are in place, some of  
which are in relation to how the Group carefully  
manages productivity and efficiency across the estate. 
Implementation of the National Living Wage will  
continue to remain an area of focus as we enter FY 2016.

Finance risks
Borrowing covenants There are risks that borrowing 
covenants are breached because 
of circumstances such as:
i.  A change in the economic 
climate leading to reduced 
cash inflows; or
ii.  A material change in the 
valuation of the property 
portfolio. 
The Company maintains headroom against these risks. 
The finance team conducts daily cash forecasting with 
periodic reviews at the Treasury Committee, the roles  
of which include ensuring that the Board Treasury Policy  
is adhered to, monitoring its operation and agreeing 
appropriate strategies for recommendation to the Board. 
In addition, regular forecasting and testing of covenant 
compliance is performed and frequent communication 
is maintained with the Securitisation Trustee.

Pension fund deficit The material value of the pension 
fund deficit remains a risk.
The Company has made significant additional contributions 
to reduce the funding deficit. In May 2014, the Company 
reached agreement on the triennial valuation of the  
Group pension schemes as at 31 March 2013, at an 
increased funding shortfall of £572m (March 2010 
valuation £400m). The value of total liability at the  
end of FY 2015, following the revised contributions,  
is £350m (FY 2014 £425m).

Failure to operate 
safely and legally 
A major health and safety  
failure could lead to illness,  
injury or loss of life or significant 
damage to the Company’s or  
a brand’s reputation.
Mitchells & Butlers maintains a robust programme of 
health and safety checks both within its restaurants and 
pubs and throughout the supply chain. The dedicated 
Safety Assurance team uses a number of technical 
partners including food technologists, microbiologists  
and allergen specialists to ensure that our food procedures 
are safe. Regular independent audits of trading sites are 
performed to ensure that procedures are followed and 
that appropriate standards are maintained. Food suppliers 
are required to meet the British Retail Consortium Global 
Standard for Food Safety and are subject to regular safety 
and quality audits. Comprehensive health and safety 
training programmes are in place.

Mitchells & Butlers is a leading UK operator  
of managed restaurants and pubs, with a  
high quality freehold estate and a portfolio  
of strong brands. Our strategy is to focus on 
the long-term growth of food and drink within  
the £80bn eating and drinking-out market, 
with around three-quarters of our turnover 
coming from guests eating in our pubs  
and restaurants.
In FY 2015 we have achieved strong earnings 
growth. Against this backdrop, and reflecting 
confidence in future prospects for the business, 
we are recommending the payment of a final 
dividend of 5p per share. Going forward we 
expect the final dividend to represent two 
thirds of the full year payout.
Like-for-like sales started the year well but 
softened over the last quarter. The weather  
in the summer was generally poor, such that 
beer gardens did not see the benefit of any 
sustained period of sunshine. The market is 
becoming increasingly competitive, and we 
have seen this sales weakness persist into  
the early weeks of the current financial year. 
These are challenges which we are addressing. 
Against this modest sales growth we have 
continued to generate value for our shareholders 
through our focus on costs and trading margins.

We continue to operate 
and measure our business 
performance across 
three priority areas.
Business review
Phil Urban
Chief	 Executive We have delivered 9.5% growth in adjusted  
EPS, whilst continuing to de-lever the 
business, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA 
falling to 4.3 times.
FY 2015 also saw the completion of the  
EPOS systems projects, with new payment 
systems, tills, handheld devices and kitchen 
management equipment now rolled out across 
the estate. We have also continued the 
integration of the Orchid business, completing 
the closure of the head office and executing  
the conversion programme with encouraging 
results. Unconverted sites have now been 
integrated into our business within Heartland 
and are operating very much as business  
as usual. 
Our priorities
We are addressing our challenges by 
continuing to work towards our strategic  
goals. In order to generate consistent  
and sustained shareholder value we have 
identified three priorities, focused on:  
building a more balanced business, instilling  
a more commercial culture, and increasing  
the pace of execution and innovation.
Build a more balanced business
Our well established brand portfolio is an  
area of great strength for the business, with 
national presence and enduring guest appeal. 
This is evident from high levels of sales and  
the strong returns on investment we have 
generated from converting Orchid sites to  
our brands. We need to continue to ensure 
that all of our brands have a clear and targeted 
proposition, and that they remain relevant  
to our guests in a dynamic market. 
We must also ensure that we have the 
appropriate balance of brands, and number  
of sites within each brand, according to 
demographics and changing consumer  
needs. For example, we have Miller & Carter:  
a successful premium brand with only 36 sites 
but the potential for many more. We also  
have Harvester: a mid-market brand with 
more than 200 sites. The Harvester brand 
remains powerful, as evidenced by the  
strong sales seen in our Orchid conversions. 
However, it is susceptible to new competitors 
due to its size and positioning. Therefore  
we need to invest in protecting our more 
mature established brands and accelerating  
the expansion of our most successful  
smaller brands, with a view to having a  
better balanced business in the longer term  
to deliver more predictable and sustainable 
shareholder returns.
Instil a more commercial culture
We will instil a truly commercial edge to our 
business, with a focus on driving profitable 
sales day in and day out. We are not looking to 
generate higher like-for-like sales at the expense 
of profitability, and therefore our approach  
to driving sales must vary according to our 
different brands and their various life-cycle 
stages, finding the right balance in each case.
We have also worked hard on getting  
back to basics with management targets and 
performance data, ensuring that our balanced 
scorecard approach is focused on managing 
our P&L, and continuing to convert sales  
to profit.
We have installed a sales function to  
apply a structured approach to maximising 
opportunities from some of the under-utilised 
space we have at our disposal. 
We recognise the need to increase the pace  
at which we operate and the speed with which  
we react in a dynamic marketplace. Simplicity 
throughout our business is vital. We see the 
house manager role as critical in our organisation: 
they need to be leaders, taking ownership  
for every aspect of their business and every 
aspect of the customer journey. Our area 
managers are the front line support to the 
house managers, and as a wider business we 
need to be set up to focus fully on supporting 
these key roles. We are therefore simplifying 
the business and focusing on clear metrics, to 
allow our area managers the time to be in their 
businesses, focusing on the standards of the 
operation and on truly delighting our guests.
We also recognise the need to capitalise on 
our team of outstanding people, by ensuring 
we are a company that the best people want  
to work for. We need to identify those with the 
most talent and highest potential, and ensure 
they are offered the right career plans and 
development paths to remain with the 
business and take it forward in the long term.
We see applying these basic principles as  
the key to unlocking the potential of the 
high-quality team we have at our disposal,  
and to creating a results-orientated culture 
throughout the business. 
Increase the pace of execution  
and innovation
We need to approach innovation with  
urgency and from all angles: new product 
development, the use of technology to 
improve efficiency, and digital innovation to 
drive the best engagement with our guests. 
Given the competitive environment, we  
will increase the level of trial activity that  
we undertake, and accelerate the rollout  
of those which are successful. This will  
help us to improve the return from our  
existing assets and to exploit further  
market opportunities through new product 
development. In the last year we have 
invested in our Heartland estate with two  
new concepts: Sizzling Pizza & Carvery 
provides an innovative solution to move  
our Crown Carveries business forward;  
and Sizzling Pub & Grill is an extension  
of the existing Sizzling Pubs offer. A small 
number of these formats have been trialled, 
with results exceeding expectations so  
far, and we are planning to accelerate the 
roll-out.
Our guests are increasingly digitally  
connected in all aspects of their life. This 
provides a significant opportunity for us,  
to communicate with and reach our guests  
in a variety of new ways, to engage with  
them with new offers, and to get a deeper 
understanding of consumer preferences to 
further drive insight. Our focus on innovation 
is critical for us to maintain our competitive 
position in a rapidly evolving market.
Outlook
Sales in the first eight weeks of the year 
have been soft, with total sales down by  
1.3% and like-for-like sales down by 1.6%, 
reflecting an increasingly competitive market. 
As we face these challenges we have a  
clear set of priorities going forward. We  
are continuing with our strategy whilst 
retaining a flexible approach across our 
extensive portfolio of pubs and restaurants, 
seeking sustained and balanced profit  
growth rather than purely the pursuit  
of sales. Through this we are confident  
we can deliver strong shareholder returns.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Our guests trust us to 
serve good food that 
represents good value for 
money, which is safely 
prepared and cooked.
Corporate social responsibility At Mitchells & Butlers we are committed to 
earning the trust and respect of our customers, 
employees and neighbours. Whether that’s 
through supporting people in the communities 
around our pubs, ensuring our team members 
have a great career path, or working closely 
with food and drink suppliers on nutrition  
and waste, we are committed to improving  
the way we do business year on year.
Food sourcing
We work closely with a network of trusted 
suppliers to source the best quality ingredients 
for our menus. When buying our food we 
ensure our high food safety standards are met, 
we are sourcing quality products, and we are 
taking into account provenance and price. 
All our food suppliers are required to comply 
with the British Retail Consortium’s technical 
standard which requires their staff to be 
properly trained and supervised and for the 
supplier to meet high standards of food safety.
We are proactively working with our suppliers 
to improve the quality and range of products 
available within the Mitchells & Butlers’ supply 
chain. We continue to strengthen our 
relationships with UK growers, working direct 
where possible to remove the wholesaler’s 
margin and delivering fresh seasonal products 
to our kitchens. For example, we use British  strawberries when in season and all our fresh 
potatoes in Toby and Crown Carveries are 
British. We have also begun a trial to grow  
our own potato crop through a direct supply 
contract at Brechin in Scotland. 
Our Cattle Scheme continues to develop and 
we are now working with 21 farmers, rearing 
around 2,000 calves under our direct contract 
agreements. Since Spring 2015 the scheme 
has supplied Miller & Carter with beef steaks 
from around 20 animals every week, all 
traceable from farm to fork. 
We take responsible sourcing extremely 
seriously and recognise concerns about the 
sustainable sourcing of fish. We are committed 
to working with our supplier base to ensure 
well managed and sustainable fishing practices 
are in place. For example, we source line 
caught cod for our menus in a number of  
our brands. 
We have an annual spend (cost value) of over 
£19m on beef and poultry products that are 
covered by Red Tractor accreditation, the  
UK’s largest food assurance scheme. These 
products are endorsed on our menus using 
the Red Tractor logo. For example, we use 
British chicken in Harvester; all our beef in 
Toby Carvery and Harvester is of British and 
Irish origin; and we use 100% British beef  
in Miller & Carter. In addition, we buy more 
than 32 million free range eggs a year.
Good food
Our guests trust us to serve good food that 
represents good value for money, which is 
safely prepared and cooked. They also trust  
us to source food that is both sustainable and 
ethical, with due regard for high standards  
of both workers’ and animal welfare. This is  
an integral part of our strategy of developing 
superior brand propositions as detailed on 
page 16.
Nutrition
We continue to look for the most effective way 
to present nutritional information to our guests 
across our portfolio of brands. By using our 
guest insight to understand better our guests’ 
preferences and priorities, we can develop  
our nutritional messaging to ensure it remains 
effective. We believe our focus should be on 
communicating ingredients, healthy cooking 
techniques, the freshness of our food and 
providing healthier options to enable our 
guests to make an informed choice when 
eating with us.
We publish the nutritional information for  
our menus on our websites for Harvester,  
Toby Carvery, Crown Carveries, Ember Inns, 
Sizzling Pubs, O’Neill’s, Oak Tree Pubs, Vintage 
Inns and All Bar One.
Nutritional information is provided as a guide 
and values are calculated using detailed 
recipes that include weights and measures, 
manufacturers’ nutrition data and lab data 
where required. We have invested 
significantly in technical processes and 
systems to incorporate the requirements  
of Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 on the 
provision of food information to consumers 
(EU FIC). We follow both regulatory and best 
practice advice, to ensure the information is  
as accurate as possible and helps our guests 
make the most informed choice to suit their 
dietary needs and preferences.
It is now a mandatory requirement for all 
suppliers to Mitchells & Butlers to provide  
us with nutrition information for every food 
product, and to follow Company policy on  
the provision of accurate nutrition data. This 
enables our chefs to have the detail required 
to design and improve dishes that meet the 
specific nutritional requirements of our guests.
Allergens
We are compliant with the new EU legislation, 
which came into effect in December 2014, 
concerning the availability of information 
about 14 common food allergens. 
Salt
In the Autumn of 2015 all our brands replaced 
standard salt used in salt shakers on the tables 
and to season food back of house, with a 
mineral salt containing 15% less sodium than 
standard salt and which is high in magnesium, 
thereby delivering on our commitment to the 
Government Responsibility Deal pledge to 
support and enable consumers to reduce  
their dietary salt intake.
This will remove over 16.8 tons of salt from  
our guests’ diet.
Magnesium has no less than 10 authorised 
health claims including contributing to the 
maintenance of normal teeth and bones.
Signposting of healthier options
In April 2015, in partnership with Campden BRI 
we developed a guide to help position our brands 
as leaders in the industry for healthier options 
and enable guest communication that is on trend, 
truthful, substantiated and legally compliant.

In 2015 Miller & Carter were awarded the title of serving ‘England’s Best Sirloin Steak’ 
within the Foodservice sector, the result of an independent assessment by the English 
Beef and Lamb Executive.
For the third year running we won the award for ‘Food Service Operator of the Year’  
at the 2015 British Turkey Awards, demonstrating our commitment and support for 
British farming and support for the British turkey industry. This best practice guide translates the 
regulations and relevant codes of practice  
into user-friendly language to support the 
development and communication of 
commercially viable healthier options that 
comply with all relevant regulations and  
do not mislead the guest.
The guide also includes practical advice for 
suppliers and our development chefs to help 
reduce calories, sugars, fat and saturated fats, 
with the focus on adopting healthier cooking 
methods, selecting alternative ingredients  
and technical solutions for designing healthier 
options that deliver on taste and quality.
Several of our brands have increased their 
range of healthier options, and supported 
these with nutrition and health claims to make 
them easily identifiable to the health conscious 
guest. Examples include: Toby Carvery’s 
signposting of a range of menu options which 
are low in saturated fat and 500 calories or 
less; Sizzling Pubs’ guilt-free curries and 
burgers containing at least 30% less fat and 
saturated fat per 100g compared to the classic 
curries and burgers; Harvester restaurants 
which all contain menu options between 250 
and 500 calories; and All Bar One’s range of 
calorie controlled options, with the energy 
published on the menu copy, and dishes high 
in protein, omega-3, antioxidants and ‘lighter’ 
options are also signposted.
Responsibility Deal partnership 
We are committed partners of the 
Government’s Responsibility Deal, and have 
signed up to delivering pledges relating to 
artificial trans fats and salt reduction.
In addition, this year we have signed up to 
pledges, and submitted delivery plans to the 
Department of Health, in respect of fruit and 
vegetables (Crown Carveries, Toby Carvery, 
Harvester) and calorie reduction (Harvester). 
We will support and enable our customers to 
eat and drink fewer calories through product 
and menu reformulation, reviewing portion 
sizes, education and information.
Children’s Menus
In response to the growing concern over 
childhood obesity, we have developed  
our own Children’s Food Standards that  
will be implemented across all brands  
from Spring 2016. 
The standards incorporate best practice  
and recommendations from leading health 
charities such as Soil Association and have 
been developed with consultation of the 
School Food Standards, Government  
Buying Standards and established dietary 
recommendations for children.
They have been designed to help all our 
brands improve the nutritional profile of their 
children’s food and drink offering, so that all 
menus provide variety, controlled levels of 
public health sensitive nutrients and make 
healthy eating easier for our guests, whilst  
still maintaining the feel of a treat occasion.
Food safety
One of our Key Performance Indicators 
(detailed on page 22) is our Net Promoter 
Score and as part of this we have made a 
commitment to increase the number of our 
businesses that achieve a 4 or 5 star food 
hygiene rating, taking a zero tolerance 
approach to anything below. We continue  
to strive for a score of 5 in each business and 
conduct independently commissioned audits 
in all of our businesses at least twice per year. 
We have rigorous checks and policies in place 
and we consult regularly with Government 
and local authorities to ensure we maintain  
the highest standards in food safety. We are 
currently investing significantly in upgrading 
our safety training including Food Safety,  
Fire Safety and Health and Safety training.  
In addition, we have increased the internal 
supportive resource available to our 
operations teams. 
Serving alcohol responsibly
Our individual businesses and ultimately  
our business as a whole, rely on our ability to 
operate within the terms of our licences and 
the law and, as a responsible operator, we are 
determined to build, promote and maintain  
a culture of responsible retailing across  
the Company.
Our Alcohol and Social Responsibility policy 
promotes good practice in the responsible 
retailing of alcohol through our employee 
training, safe operational practices and 
responsible pricing and promotions. 
We have produced a Prevention of Underage 
Drinking policy, which includes our use of 
Challenge 21. This forms a fundamental part 
of our employee training programme and 
includes regular refresher training to help 
ensure that our retail teams are fully aware  
of their licensing responsibilities and not 
serving alcohol to anyone underage.
We do not operate any 24 hour licences.

Our Retail team member turnover has reduced 
from 78% in FY 2014 to 76% in FY 2015.
Listening to our people 
Every year we circulate our employee 
engagement survey, ‘Your Say’ to understand 
better what is important to our employees. 
People told us they like the kind of work  
they do and can see where they add value to 
the business. Focus areas for improvement 
include the planning and implementation  
of future initiatives, ensuring appropriate 
resources are allocated and people living the 
PRIDE (Passion, Respect, Innovation, Drive, 
Engagement) values. Feedback showed the 
Orchid Managers responded very positively 
about the integration into Mitchells & Butlers.
Diversity 
Mitchells & Butlers is committed to providing 
equal opportunities for all of our employees. 
During the year the Board adopted a Diversity 
Policy, details of which are set out on page 46. 
Our employee Diversity Policy ensures that 
every employee, without exception, is treated 
equally and fairly and that all employees  
are aware of their responsibilities. 
The policy confirms that there will be no  
direct or indirect discrimination in respect  
of age, disability, religious belief, gender, 
sexual orientation, race, colour, marital  
status, political belief and nationality, or  
any other category defined by law in all

Attracting the best talent
Last year we created c.1,400 new jobs by 
opening new retail sites across the UK. 
Nurturing and developing our people
This year we have created new and robust  
high potential programmes which are aimed  
at helping develop our house managers  
to area managers, and the latter to retail 
directors which utilises our network of  
internal accredited coaches. Alongside  
this, we have also created an enhanced 
programme for graduates that accelerates 
them to area manager positions.
In 2015 we launched a new three year 
Hospitality Management Development 
programme which targets attracting 18 year 
olds and accelerates these candidates to 
higher level leadership positions. We currently 
have c.100 recruited to these roles, with a 
target for a further 250 young people during 
FY 2016. We also launched our new youth 
attraction strategy which targets young people 
from the age of 16 to gain transferable skills and 
build a sustainable career with us. Additionally, 
we are working in partnership with Believe  
in Young People, offering over 200 work 
experience places for 14 to 18 year olds who 
wish to explore a career in hospitality, with a 
natural lead into our apprenticeship scheme.
We pride ourselves on having accessible 
career pathways and around 1,500 learners 
have completed a vocational or apprenticeship 
programme with us this year. As part of this 
commitment we have enhanced all our 
skills-based apprenticeships, which now 
follow a comprehensive capability framework, 
and cover all levels to Foundation degree. This 
framework focuses on giving 16 to 24 year olds 
on-the-job skills complemented with credible 
transferable commercial skills, which take them 
from the equivalent of a GCSE qualification 
through to a degree level – a true alternative to 
the traditional academic education route.

Pickaperk, our benefits platform, continues  
to be popular with our employees, with a 
spend on discounted goods of £1.3m in the 
last 12 months, a c.50% increase on the 
previous year. 
Many of our employees continue to enjoy the 
‘Dine with Us’ programme, where they can 
access their employee discount digitally and 
receive 20% off when they eat in one of our 
businesses. On two occasions this year the 
discount was raised to 33% as an additional 
‘thank you’ to our employees. 
c.12,800 employees have received an award 
recognising their service to the business. 
Awards are made to employees for achieving 
service milestones between one year and 
45 years.
Our communities
We’re committed to being a good neighbour 
by supporting our communities with both  
our time and expertise. By supporting our 
employees and businesses across a spectrum 
of charitable activity and fundraising, we 
continue to build strong relationships with  
our guests and neighbours and give back  
to the communities in which we trade.
Over the last year through our Good Cause 
Fund, to help our pubs boost their local 
fundraising and our employee donations 
programme, we have raised or donated nearly 
£20,000 to a large number of deserving 
charities and groups. 
During the year our businesses worked 
together to support the Marie Curie Great 
Daffodil Appeal. All of our restaurants and 
pubs sold daffodil pins during March and 
raised almost £19,000 for the charity, which 
will provide one full time nurse for a whole 
year or 940 hours of home nursing care. Since 
fundraising began in 2010 Mitchells & Butlers 
has donated over £157 ,000 to Marie Curie 
Cancer Care.
In FY 2015 our Heartland estate, including 
Sizzling Pubs, Crown Carveries, Oak Tree 
Pubs, and O’Neill’s continued to raise funds  
for Cancer Research UK, and has raised 
£165,000 for the charity this year. As a result 
this brings the Heartland team fundraising 
total to a staggering £235,000 in less than  
two years.
Crown Carveries offer Armed Forces 
personnel – active or veteran, as well as all 
emergency service crews – 10% off their  
food bill all year round at their restaurants 
nationwide. The promotion has been run in 
conjunction with Defences Discount Service 
and Blue Light Cards, Savings for Life Savers.
Our restaurants and pubs once again 
supported the Royal British Legion Poppy 
Appeal, selling thousands of poppies and 
raising around £132,000 to support thousands 
of serving and ex-Service people. 
Harvester restaurants have been fundraising 
for Make-A-Wish UK by participating in  
the Bake-A-Wish initiative. With over 200 
restaurants on board, the brand successfully 
smashed its fundraising target of £20,000  
by donating over £46,000 to the charity – 
making it the largest donation Harvester  
has ever made to Make-A-Wish.
Environmental awareness
We continue to successfully manage our 
energy, waste and water in a manner which  
is not only cost-effective for the business but 
reduces our impact on the environment.
Energy and greenhouse gas emissions
Our proactive management of energy 
consumption, procurement and carbon 
emissions continues to deliver significant 
benefits to our business against a backdrop  
of increasing food sales volume. During  
the 2014/15 tax year our greenhouse gas 
emissions per £m turnover reduced by  
0.26% through a combination of behavioural 
change programmes and investment in  
making our buildings and equipment  
more energy efficient. 
A full disclosure of our greenhouse gas 
emissions can be found on page 41.
Back of house lighting
We have successfully concluded the roll  
out of new energy-efficient fluorescent  
fittings to back of house areas across  
the estate. This has helped us to make 
considerable savings on energy consumption 
as well as improving lighting levels for  
our people.
Smart heating controls
We are in the process of rolling out smart 
heating controls to compatible sites that allow 
for better time and temperature control of our 
businesses. This is helping us to cut down  
on wasteful heating costs whilst ensuring 
customer comfort.
Orchid conversion sites
The installation of a range of energy  
efficiency technologies continues for our 
Orchid conversion sites including energy 
efficient LED lighting in trade areas and 
fluorescent fittings in back of house areas, 
‘intelligent’ timers on the glycol chiller systems, 
free air cellar cooling and automated kitchen 
extraction where appropriate.
Water consumption
We have concluded the roll out of appliances 
to reduce water wastage in our toilets and 
have generated an annual consumption saving 
across the estate of 13.9 million litres.
We will build on the success of our CSR 
activities during 2015 and continue to develop 
our programmes and activities to further 
support our businesses, employees and 
guests in the future.

Financial review
Tim Jones
Finance	 Director
The Group income statement discloses 
adjusted profit and earnings per share 
information that excludes exceptional  
items to allow a better understanding  
of the underlying trading of the Group.  
Adjusted earnings per share increased  
by 9.5% in 2015 to 35.7p.
At the end of the financial year, the total  
estate comprised 1,779 managed businesses 
and 55 franchised businesses, in the UK  
and Germany.
Changes in accounting policies
There have been no changes in accounting 
policies in the period.
Revenue
The Group’s total revenues increased by  
6.6% to £2,101m, as a result of growth in 
like-for-like sales, the full-year contribution  
of the 173 sites acquired from Orchid during 
the prior year, and the contribution from  
other single site acquisitions. Total like-for-like sales increased by 0.8%,  
with higher food sales of 1.9% but lower drink 
sales of -0.4%. Food sales growth was driven 
by increased volumes of 0.8% and average 
spend per head growth of 1.1%. Drink sales, 
by contrast, resulted from average spend  
per head growth of 2.4% offset by volume 
decline of 2.8%.

Operating margins
Adjusted operating margins for the year were 
15.6%, 0.3 ppts below 2014. In the first half 
margins were behind last year by 0.8 ppts, 
with the Orchid head office remaining open 
and food sales across the business being 
driven by volume rather than spend per head. 
Second half margins improved to 0.3 ppts 
higher than last year. A key factor in this  
was the closure of the Orchid head office  
as planned in April 2015, generating annual 
cost savings of £6m. The second half margin 
also benefited from food sales growth being 
driven by increased guest spend per head. 
Adjusted operating profit for the year was 
£328m, 4.8% higher than 2014.
Internal rent
A regime of internal rents is in place to  
enable greater internal transparency around 
the performance of freehold and leasehold 
properties and external transparency 
concerning the performance of the operating 
and property functions. The operating 
performance is monitored on a regular basis 
through a system of profit reviews through  
all levels of the Group. Estate management  
is primarily monitored through the Portfolio 
Development Committee.

Exceptional items
Exceptional items comprise two items: a  
£65m charge relating to the net movement  
in the property portfolio (2014 £37m); and a 
£7m net profit from the disposal of properties, 
including the release of a £5m accrual relating 
to prior period disposals.
Interest
Net finance costs of £144m were £3m higher 
than the prior year. The net pensions finance 
charge of £15m was £5m higher than in 2014, 
offset by a reduction in the annual interest 
charge on the Group’s securitised borrowings.
For FY 2016 we expect the pensions finance 
charge to reduce slightly to £12m.
Taxation
The tax charge of £23m in the year represents 
an effective rate of 18.3% (2014 24.4%). The 
reduction in the effective rate is due to a lower 
standard rate of UK corporation tax plus the 
impact of adjustments from prior periods.
Earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share were 35.7p, 9.5% 
higher than last year. After the exceptional 
items described above, basic earnings per 
share were 25.0p (2014 22.6p).
Cash flow and net debt
The cash flow statement below excludes 
£120m transferred from cash to other cash 
deposits (2014 £25m) and, in the prior year, 
£147m drawn down from a liquidity facility

Financial review
continued The business generated £439m of EBITDA  
in the year. Pension deficit contributions of 
£86m included a one-off contribution of £40m 
agreed as part of the last triennial valuation. 
After maintenance capital, interest and tax, 
£133m of free cash before exceptional items 
was generated by the business.
Net debt was £1,870m, representing 4.3 times 
annualised EBITDA (2014 4.5 times). Net debt 
within the securitisation was £1,895m and net 
cash held outside the securitisation was £25m.
Capital expenditure
Total capital expenditure was £162m, 
comprising £103m (2014 £94m) spent on 
amenity in the Group’s restaurants and pubs, 
£13m on infrastructure projects (2014 £26m), 
and £46m on conversions and new site 
openings (2014 £42m).
The reduction in infrastructure projects was 
driven by IT expenditure, with the completion 
of several key projects in the year, notably the 
roll out of pub EPOS systems.
The blended EBITDA return on expansionary 
capital invested since FY 2012 was 18%  
(2014 16%). Given the varying nature of 
freehold acquisitions, leasehold acquisitions 
and conversions, the business reviews returns

since year end. The Orchid sites which have 
not been converted are now part of our 
Heartland estate. The converted Orchid  
sites continue to trade well. 
Property
A red book valuation of the freehold and  
long leasehold estate has been completed in 
conjunction with the independent property 
valuers, CBRE. In addition, the Group has 
conducted an impairment review on short 
leasehold and unlicensed properties. The 
overall portfolio value has fallen by £40m 
(2014 increase of £26m) reflecting a £65m 
exceptional charge in the income statement 
and a £25m increase in the revaluation reserve. 
Pensions
The Company continues to make pensions 
deficit payments based on the schedule of 
contributions agreed as part of the triennial 
valuations at 31 March 2013, based on an 
assessed funding shortfall at that time of 
£572m (March 2010 valuation £400m).  
The discounted value of the minimum funding 
requirement agreed as part of the revised 
schedule of contributions is recognised in the 
balance sheet at £350m (FY 2014 £425m).
Dividends
With regard to recent performance and 
confidence in future prospects for the 
business, together with the agreement 
reached with the pension trustees as a part  
of the 2013 triennial settlement, the Directors 
recommend the payment of a dividend of  
5p per share to shareholders on the register  
as at 4 December 2015, to be paid on 
9 February 2016.
This payment represents the final element  
only of a total annual payout that is anticipated 
to be split one third at the interim stage and 
two thirds at final. We intend to adopt a 
progressive dividend policy.
Shareholders who do not at present 
participate in the Company’s Dividend 
Reinvestment Plan and wish to receive the 
final dividend in shares rather than cash 
should complete a mandate form for the 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan and return it to 
the registrars no later than 19 January 2016.
Responsibility statement
We confirm to the best of our knowledge:

accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Dear fellow shareholder
It gives me great pleasure to take this opportunity to update you on  
our progress in corporate governance over the past year. 
One of the key roles for the Board of Directors at Mitchells & Butlers  
is to provide leadership for more than 44,000 employees and maintain 
the highest possible standards of corporate governance. The Board 
continues to monitor developments in corporate governance and 
reporting regulations. The Strategic report on pages 2 to 33 includes 
the Group’s strategy, progress and performance for the year. 
We continue to benefit from a stable Board. During the year the 
Non-Executive Directors reviewed the leadership of the Company  
and on 22 September 2015, the Company announced that Phil Urban, 
who joined the Group as Chief Operating Officer in January 2015, 
would assume the role of Chief Executive as Alistair Darby stepped 
down and resigned from the Board and left the Company, after three 
years in the role. Phil Urban is a strong leader with industry experience 
and a proven track record of operational delivery, who the Board are 
confident will build on the progress made over the past few years.  
The Board recognises the significant contribution made by Alistair  
as Chief Executive over the past three years, and is grateful to him  
for bringing the business to a stronger position and wishes him well  
in the future.
I am delighted to welcome Josh Levy to the Board as a nominated 
Director of Piedmont Inc. Josh was appointed to the Board on 
13 November 2015, in place of Douglas McMahon who stepped down 
on the same date. We look forward to working with Josh and our other 
nominated shareholder representatives on matters affecting the Group.
Our Non-Executive Directors continue to bring much experience, 
diversity and challenge to the Board and, in the last year, we have 
appointed Stewart Gilliland to the role of Senior Independent Director. 
My focus continues to be on maintaining a strong team, with a  
broad range of professional backgrounds and skills to drive further 
improvements where possible.
In line with the best practice recommendations of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, last year we committed to carrying out an externally 
facilitated review of the Board’s effectiveness and you can read the 
results of this on page 48. This dealt with focus areas of the 2014 
review, and also looked at Board composition. 
The remainder of this report contains the narrative reporting required 
by the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Listing Rules and the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules. I hope that you find this report  
to be informative and helpful in relation to this important topic. 
We are committed to maintaining an active dialogue with all our 
shareholders, and we continue to offer our institutional investors  
access to key senior management and our Investor Relations team  
via our Investor Roadshow programme. I would like to encourage 
shareholders to attend our Annual General Meeting, details of  
which are set out in the separate Notice of AGM sent out with this 
Annual Report. Following the success of our Retail Support Centre  
in Birmingham as a venue for our 2015 AGM, we intend to use the  
same facility for the 2016 AGM and we look forward to welcoming  
you, where I hope you will take the opportunity of meeting our 
Executive and Non-Executive Board Directors.
I look forward to the year ahead, confident in the knowledge that the 
Company is led by a highly competent, professional and motivated 
team. I also look forward to the support of you, our shareholders,  
as our senior management team continues to focus on driving future 
profit growth and creating additional shareholder value.

2014 411,637 ,885 shares). The rights and obligations attaching to the 
ordinary shares of the Company are contained within the Company’s 
Articles of Association. Of the issued share capital, no shares were held 
in treasury and the Company’s employee share trusts held 1,523,502 
shares. Details of movements in the issued share capital can be found  
in note 4.7 to the financial statements on page 105. Each share carries 
the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. The notice of 
the Annual General Meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting 
rights in relation to the resolutions to be put to the Annual General Meeting. 
All issued shares are fully paid up and carry no additional obligations  
or special rights. There are no restrictions on transfers of shares in the 
Company, or on the exercise of voting rights attached to them, other 
than those which may from time to time be applicable under existing 
laws and regulations and under the Articles of Association. In addition, 
pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, 
The Board’s responsibilities in respect of the  
Company include:
 • Determining the overall business and commercial strategy
 • Identifying the Company’s long-term objectives
 • Reviewing the annual operating budget and financial plans  
and monitoring performance in relation to those plans
 • Determining the basis of the allocation of capital
 • Considering all policy matters relating to the Company’s activities 
including any major change of policy

Directors and certain officers and employees of the Group require  
the prior approval of the Company to deal in the ordinary shares  
of the Company.
Participants in the Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) may complete a Form

the SIP Trustee, as the basis for voting on their behalf.
 
During the year, shares with a nominal value of £75,401 were allotted 
under all-employee schemes as permitted under Section 549 of the 
Companies Act 2006. No securities were issued in connection with  
a rights issue during the year. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that 
restrict the transfer of shares or voting rights attached to the shares.
Interests of the Directors and their immediate families in the issued share 
capital of the Company as at the year end are on page 67 of the Report 
on Directors’ remuneration.
Dividend
No Interim Dividend was paid during the year (2014 nil). The Board 
recommends a final dividend for the year ended 26 September 2015  
of 5p per share to be paid on 9 February 2016 to shareholders on the 
register at close of business on 4 December 2015. This makes a total 
dividend for the year of 5p per share (2014 nil).
Interests in voting rights
As at the date of this report, the Company was aware of the following 
significant holdings of voting rights (3% or more) in its shares:

are shown on pages 36 and 37 . The Directors at 26 September 2015 
and their interests in shares are shown on page 67 . Alistair Darby 
resigned as a Director on 26 September 2015 and Phil Urban was

a nominated Director of Piedmont Inc., stepped down from the Board 
on 13 November 2015 and was replaced on the same date by Josh 
Levy, a new nominated Director of Piedmont Inc. There were no other 
changes to the Board of Directors during the year nor subsequent  
to the year end, up to the date of this report.
The Company is governed by its Articles of Association and  
the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation in relation to the 
appointment and removal of Directors. The powers of the Company’s 
Directors are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association. 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association (which are  
in line with best practice guidance of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code), all the Directors will retire at the AGM. Phil Urban and Josh Levy 
offer themselves for election for the first time and all the other Directors 
offer themselves for re-election.
Under a Deed of Appointment between Piedmont Inc. and the 
Company, Piedmont Inc. has the right to appoint two shareholder 
Directors to the Board whilst it owns 22% or more of the issued share 
capital of the Company, and the right to appoint one shareholder 
Director to the Board whilst it owns more than 16% of the Company  
but less than 22%. In the event that Piedmont Inc. owns less than  
16% of the Company any such shareholder Directors would be  
required to resign immediately.

Mitchells & Butlers plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Directors’ report The Company’s two largest shareholders, Piedmont Inc. and Elpida Group 
Limited, have nominated representatives on the Board. Piedmont’s 
appointment rights are formalised in a Deed of Appointment but there  
is no equivalent agreement in place between the Company and Elpida. 
The Elpida representative was appointed with the approval of the Board 
in March 2012. The Board has carefully considered whether it would be 
appropriate to enter into a formal agreement with Elpida that is similar to 
the existing agreement between the Company and Piedmont. Having 
taken into account the Financial Reporting Council’s report of August 2014 
‘Towards Clear & Concise Reporting’ and the views expressed previously 
by certain of the investor representative bodies, the Board considers that 
such an agreement would be merely one of form rather than substance 
and not in the interests of shareholders generally. As a result, the Board 
does not propose currently that the Company should enter into such  
an agreement with Elpida, and Elpida has not to date sought such an 
agreement. The Board considers that the Company is acting in accordance 
with good governance principles in working with our significant long-term 
shareholders towards our common goals and the achievement of the 
Company’s strategy, with continued stability at Board level.
Directors’ indemnity
As permitted by the Articles of Association, each of the Directors has 
the benefit of an indemnity, which is a qualifying third-party indemnity 
as defined by Section 234 of the Companies Act 2006. The indemnity 
was in force throughout the tenure of each Director during the last 
financial year, and is currently in force. Such an indemnity was put in 
place on the appointment of each of Phil Urban and Josh Levy to the 
Board on 27 September 2015 and 13 November 2015 respectively.  
The Company also purchased and maintained throughout the financial 
year Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and  
its Directors. No indemnity is provided for the Company’s auditor. 
Articles of Association
The Articles of Association may be amended by special resolution  
of the shareholders of the Company.
Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to consider and, if 
it sees fit, authorise situations where a Director has an interest that conflicts, 
or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the Company (‘Situational 
Conflicts’). The Board has a formal system in place for Directors to declare 
Situational Conflicts to be considered for authorisation by those Directors 
who have no interest in the matter being considered. In deciding whether 
to authorise a Situational Conflict, the non-conflicted Directors are required 
to act in the way they consider would be most likely to promote the success 
of the Company for the benefit of all shareholders, and they may impose 
limits or conditions when giving authorisation, or subsequently, if they  
think this is appropriate. The Board believes that the systems it has in  
place for reporting and considering Situational Conflicts continue to 
operate effectively.
Related party transactions
Internal controls are in place to ensure that any related party transactions 
involving Directors or their connected persons are carried out on an 
arm’s-length basis and are properly recorded.
Change of control provisions
There are no significant agreements which contain provisions entitling 
other parties to such agreements to exercise termination or other rights 
in the event of a change of control of the Company. 
There are no provisions in the Directors’ or employees’ service agreements 
providing for compensation for loss of office or employment occurring 
because of a takeover. 
The trustee of the Company’s SIP will invite participants on whose 
behalf it holds shares to direct it how to vote in respect of those shares, 
and, if there is an offer for the shares or other transaction which would 
lead to a change of control of the Company, participants may direct  
it to accept the offer or agree to the transaction. The trustee of the 
Mitchells & Butlers Employee Benefit Trust may, having consulted with 
the Company, vote or abstain from voting in respect of any shares it holds  
or accept or reject an offer relating to shares in any way it sees fit, and it 
may take all or any of the following matters into account: the long-term 
interests of beneficiaries, the non-financial interests of beneficiaries,  
the interests of beneficiaries in their capacity as employees or former 
employees, the interests of future beneficiaries and considerations  
of a local, moral, ethical, environmental or social nature.
The rules of certain of the Company’s share plans include 
provisions which apply in the event of a takeover or reconstruction, 
as set out below.

Employment policies
The Group employed an average of 44,492 people in FY 2015  
(FY 2014 41,514). Through its diversity policy, the Company seeks  
to ensure that every employee, without exception, is treated equally 
and fairly and that all employees are aware of their responsibilities. 
Our policies and procedures fully support our disabled colleagues.  
We take active measures to do so via:
 • a robust reasonable adjustment policy;
 • disability-specific online resources (accessible via the Group’s  
online recruitment system); and
 • processes to ensure colleagues are fully supported.
The Group is responsive to the needs of its employees. As such, should 
any employee of the Group become disabled during their time with us, 
we will actively retrain that employee and make reasonable adjustments 
to their environment where possible, in order to keep the employee 
with the Group.
Employee engagement 
Mitchells & Butlers engages with its employees continuously and in a 
number of ways to suit their different working patterns. This includes:
 • line manager briefings;
 • communications forums and roadshows held by functions  
or brands across the Company;
 • a dedicated intranet for the Retail Support Team;
 • a dedicated portal, ‘OurHub’, for retail employees;
 • email news alerts;
 • focus groups;
 • weekly bulletins – specifically targeted at retail house managers  
and mobile workers;
 • employee social media groups; and
 • a monthly magazine poster, Frontline News, for the retail estate.
Details of the financial and economic factors affecting the performance 
of the Company are shared with all employees at the appropriate time 
using the methods listed above. 
We provide opportunities for employees to give their feedback  
to the Company in a number of ways, from team or shift meetings  
in restaurants and pubs and pulse surveys for all employees to  
the Mitchells & Butlers annual Business Forum. Business Forum 
representatives collect questions from employees across the  
Company and put them to members of the Executive Committee.  
The questions and answers are published in Frontline News and online.

Governance  34–69 Financial statements  70–115 Shareholder  information  116 Strategic report  2–33 What’s the Big Idea? is a Company-wide initiative where employees  
are encouraged to submit their ideas for improving the business, 
environmentally, financially or otherwise, via our dedicated

Our retail teams complete compulsory bespoke induction Food and 
Fire, Heath & Safety training via e-Learning. This is at an equivalent 
level to the NVQ II. The retail management teams complete an 
additional classroom-based NVQ III equivalent course.
Mitchells & Butlers operates the Challenge 21 policy in all our businesses 
across England and Wales. The policy requires that any guest attempting 
to buy alcohol who appears under the age of 21, must provide an 
acceptable form of proof of age ID to confirm that they are over 18, 
before they can be served. This policy forms part of our regular training 
for our employees on their responsibilities for serving alcohol. 
We also have a visual training library, which houses short training 
videos to share best practice tips, health and safety guidance, kitchen 
operational advice and cooking skills.
Mitchells & Butlers is keen to encourage greater employee involvement 
in the Group’s performance through share ownership. It operates four 
HMRC approved all-employee plans, which are the Sharesave Plan, the 
2013 Sharesave Plan, the Share Incentive Plan and the 2013 Share Incentive 
Plan (which include Partnership shares). The Company also operates 
four other plans on a selective basis, which are the Performance 
Restricted Share Plan, the 2013 Performance Restricted Share Plan, the 
Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan and the 2013 Short Term Deferred 
Incentive Plan. All remaining options under the Executive Share Option 
Plan were exercised during FY 2015 and the scheme has now expired, 
both for grant and exercise purposes. Further details on the plans are 
set out in the Report on Directors’ remuneration.
During the year, the Company has remained within its headroom limits 
for the issue of new shares for share plans as set out in the rules of the 
above plans. The Company uses an employee benefit trust to acquire 
shares in the market when appropriate to satisfy share awards in order 
to manage headroom under the plan rules. No shares in the Company 
were purchased by the employee benefit trust during FY 2015.
Political donations
The Company made no political donations during the year and intends 
to maintain its policy of not making such payments. It will, however,  
as a precautionary measure to avoid inadvertent breach of the law,  
seek shareholder authority at its 2016 AGM to make limited donations 
or incur limited political expenditure, although it has no intention of 
using the authority.
Funding and liquidity risk 
In order to ensure that the Group’s long-term funding strategy is  
aligned with its strategic objectives, the Treasury Committee regularly 
assesses the maturity profile of the Group’s debt, alongside the 
prevailing financial projections and three year plan. This enables 
it to ensure that funding levels are appropriate to support the  
Group’s plans.
The current funding arrangements of the Group consist of the 
securitised notes issued by Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc (and 
associated liquidity facility) and £150m of unsecured committed  
bank facilities. Further information regarding these arrangements  
is included in note 4.2 to the financial statements on page 94.  
The terms of the securitisation and the bank facilities contain  
a number of financial and operational covenants. Compliance  
with these covenants is monitored by Group Treasury.
The Group prepares a rolling daily cash forecast covering a six-week 
period and an annual cash forecast by period. These forecasts are 
reviewed on a daily basis and used to manage the investment and 
borrowing requirements of the Group. A combination of cash pooling 
and zero balancing agreements are in place to ensure the optimum 
liquidity position is maintained. Committed facilities outside of  
the securitisation are sized to ensure that the Group can meet its 
medium-term anticipated cash flow requirements.
Going concern 
The financial statements which appear on pages 70 to 115 have  
been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors have reviewed 
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital;  
its financial risk management objectives; its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.  
The Group’s financing is based on securitised debt and unsecured  
bank facilities and, within this context, a robust review has been 
undertaken of projected performance against all financial covenants. 
As a result of this review the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. See section 1 of the financial 
statements on page 79.
Annual General Meeting
The notice convening the Annual General Meeting is contained  
in a circular sent to shareholders with this report and includes full 
details of the resolutions proposed.
Auditor
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office  
as auditor of the Company and its reappointment will be put to 
shareholders at the AGM.
Post-balance sheet events
There are no post-balance sheet events to report.
Disclosure of information to auditor
Having made the requisite enquiries, so far as the Directors are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418(3) of 
the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditor is unaware 
and each Director has taken all steps that ought to have been taken  
to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information. 
Greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions statement 
The Group generates GHG emissions throughout its estate of bars  
and restaurants for heating, cooling, lighting and catering, including  
the refrigeration and preparation of food and drink. 
GHG emissions per £m turnover were reduced by 0.26% during the 
2014/15 tax year in comparison to 2013/14. This has been achieved 
despite an increase in like-for-like food sales volumes and a shift 
towards longer trading hours by carrying out a mix of behavioural 
change programmes, including our first ever ‘Energy Week’, 
supplemented by ongoing investment in increasing the energy 
efficiency of our buildings and equipment.

Consolidation approach Financial control
Boundary summary All bars and restaurants either owned or under operational control during the 2014/15 tax year were included.
Scope General classifications of GHG emissions scopes based on the GHG protocol and ISO14064-1:2006 within  
the context of the Group’s operations are as follows:
Scope 1 – direct GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the Company, eg fuel 
combustion of varying types, occurs during kitchen activity and to generate heating and domestic hot water 
most commonly through natural grid supplied gas, but also some LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) and oil.  
Real fires fuelled by logs or coal are also used to supplement customer comfort and enhance ambience.
Scope 2 – GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity used during kitchen activity and  
for lighting, heating and cooling.
Scope 3 – indirect emissions as a consequence of the activities of the Company, but occurring from sources 
not owned or controlled by the Company.
This assessment focuses on scope 1 and 2 emissions only (scope 3 is optional under the current regulations).
Consistency with the  
financial statements
Scope 1 and 2 emissions are reported for the 2014/15 tax year and the 2013/14 tax year to retain consistency with 
reporting of our carbon emissions under the Carbon Reduction Commitment (‘CRC’) Energy Efficiency Scheme.
Scope 1 and 2 emissions from sites with ‘landlord supplies’ are not included in the CRC submission.
Orchid sites are included as their acquisition was completed during the 2014/15 tax year. These sites were 
omitted from the 2014 GHG emissions statement. 
Franchise sites are excluded as they are responsible for arranging and paying for their own energy.
ALEX sites in Germany are included. Emissions are based on UK average emissions multiplied by the number 
of ALEX sites.
Exclusions Scope 1 – Vehicle fleet emissions are excluded as they have been calculated to account for < 1% total emissions 
which falls below the materiality threshold.
Scope 1 – Fugitive emissions within refrigeration and cooling equipment are not included as detailed records 
are not yet held.
Outside of scope – Logs are ‘outside of scope’ because the scope 1 impact of these fuels has been determined 
to be a net ‘0’. However, the CO
2
e value of logs has been calculated to be < 1% and would be excluded in any 
case as it falls below the materiality threshold.
Emission factor data source Defra conversion factors have been used where appropriate. Carbon emission conversion factors that relate to 
the calendar year within which the greatest portion of the data falls have been applied. As such, 2014 factors 
have been applied for the 2014/15 tax year and 2013 factors have been applied for the 2013/14 tax year.
Assessment methodology Defra Environmental Guidelines 2013.
Materiality threshold All emission types estimated to contribute > 1% of total emissions are included. 
Intensity threshold Emissions are stated in tonnes CO
2
e per £m revenue. This intensity ratio puts emissions into context given  
the scale of the Group’s activities and enables comparison with prior year performance.
Target Emissions during the 2013/14 tax year are provided for comparative purposes.

Governance  34–69 Financial statements  70–115 Shareholder  information  116 Strategic report  2–33 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements  
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company  
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors  
are required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 • make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent;
 • state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
 • prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless  
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue  
in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 • properly select and apply accounting policies;
 • present information, including accounting policies, in a  
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 • provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions  
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 • make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as  
a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of  
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible  
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and  
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation  
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
 • the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
 • the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
 • the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole,  
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.

Mitchells & Butlers plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Directors’ responsibilities statement The Board recognises the importance of good corporate governance  
in creating a sustainable, successful and profitable business and details 
are set out in this statement of the Company’s corporate governance 
procedures and application of the principles of the Code. There are, 
however, a small number of areas where, for reasons specifically related 
to the Company, the detailed provisions of the Code were not fully 
complied with. These areas are kept under regular review. A fundamental 
aspect of the Code is that it contains best practice recommendations in 
relation to corporate governance yet acknowledges that, in individual 
cases, these will not all necessarily be appropriate for particular 
companies. Accordingly, the Code specifically recognises the concept  
of ‘Comply or Explain’ in relation to divergences from the Code. 
Compliance with the Code 
Except for the matters which are explained below (in line with the 
‘Comply or Explain’ concept), the Company complied fully with the 
principles and provisions of the Code throughout the financial year  
in respect of which this statement is prepared (and continues to do  
so as at the date of this statement).
Explanation for non-compliance with parts of the Code
During the year, there were five divergences from full compliance  
with the Code as set out below by reference to specific paragraphs  
in the Code:
A.4.1	Senior	Independent	Director 	
The role of Senior Independent Director remained vacant until the 
appointment of Stewart Gilliland in February 2015. The Company  
is now compliant with this provision. In this role, during the year 
Mr Gilliland conducted, in conjunction with the other two independent 
Non-Executive Directors, an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance 
and reported back on the principal conclusions of that evaluation  
to the Chairman.
B.1	(including	B.1.2	Composition	of	the	Board)	and	B.2.1, 		
C.3.1	and	D.2.1	Constitution	of	Committees
The Board was not constituted in full compliance with the Code,  
as it had three independent Non-Executive Directors, out of a total  
of six Non-Executive Directors (not including the Chairman for  
this purpose), and two Executive Directors. Accordingly, Provision 
B.1.2, which requires that at least half of the Board be made up of 
independent Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman),  
was not complied with. This also had consequential implications  
on the composition of the standing Board Committees. 
While the Board does not comply fully with the requirement for at  
least half of its members to be independent, it recognises and values  
the presence of representatives of its major shareholders on the Board 
and welcomes the interest shown by them in the Company as a whole. 
The Board will continue to work closely with the representatives of its 
major shareholders to further the interests of the Company.
The possibility of appointing a further independent Non-Executive 
Director remains a matter for the Nomination Committee to review  
and is considered regularly. It has also been addressed in the 2015 
externally-facilitated Board Effectiveness Review. Further details  
are given on page 48. Throughout FY 2015, the Company had (and 
continues to have) fully functioning Nomination, Audit and Remuneration 
Committees as required by the Code. The Committees are not fully 
compliant with the relevant provisions of paragraphs B.2. 1, C.3. 1 and 
D.2. 1 of the Code in that they include the presence of representatives  
of major shareholders. Nevertheless, the Board values the contribution  
of those shareholder representatives on those Committees, does not 
consider this to be an impediment to good governance and looks  
forward to continuing to work with them on matters affecting the  
Group and its activities in the future.
The information required by Disclosure and Transparency Rule (‘DTR’) 
7 .1 is set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 49 to 51. The 
information required by DTR 7 .2 is set out in this corporate governance 
statement, other than that required under DTR 7 .2.6 which is set out  
in the Directors’ report on pages 38 to 41. 
Corporate governance statement
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the activities of  
the Mitchells & Butlers Group and its various businesses are 
conducted in compliance with the law, regulatory requirements 
and rules, good practices, ethically and with appropriate and 
proper governance and standards. This includes reviewing 
internal controls, ensuring that there is an appropriate balance  
of skills and experience represented on the Board and compliance 
with the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’), 
which is issued by the Financial Reporting Council and which  
is available at www.frc.org.uk, and maintaining appropriate 
relations with shareholders.
A new edition of the Code was published in September 2014  
and applies to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 October 
2014. As our 2015 reporting period began before this date, we 
are continuing to report against the 2012 edition of the Code, 
although the Board has adopted some of the new provisions  
in the revised code earlier than required. 
  The latest financial information for Mitchells & Butlers and its group of  
companies is included in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts (of which this 
corporate governance statement forms part) and which are available online at: 
www.mbplc.com/investors
This corporate governance statement sets out our  
report to shareholders on the status of our corporate  
governance arrangements.
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance.  
I am delighted to be able to report that the Board considers that the 
Company has complied throughout the year ended 26 September 2015 
with all the provisions and best practice guidance of the Code except 
those in respect of Board composition, constitution of the Board 
Committees and the appointment of a Senior Independent Director, 
although this latter point was addressed in February 2015 when 
Stewart Gilliland was confirmed as Senior Independent Director  
(a position he continues to hold). This appointment removed that  
issue as a matter of non-compliance. This corporate governance 
statement addresses the small number of areas where, for reasons 
specific to Mitchells & Butlers, there are divergences from the  
Code as described below. 
The Audit Committee report and Nomination Committee report  
which are set out on pages 49 to 51 and 45 and 46 respectively of the 
Annual Report also form part of this corporate governance statement 
and they should all be considered together.

Chairman Board composition
Throughout the year, the Board comprised nine Directors. A table listing 
the composition of the Board during the year is set out opposite. 
The Board
The Board is responsible to all stakeholders, including its shareholders, 
for the strategic direction, development and control of the Group.  
It approves strategic plans and annual capital and revenue budgets.  
It reviews significant investment proposals and the performance of  
past investments and maintains an overview and control of the Group’s 
operating and financial performance. It monitors the Group’s overall 
system of internal controls, governance and compliance and ensures  
that the necessary financial, technical and human resources are in place 
for the Company to meet its objectives. 
During FY 2015 there were 11 scheduled Board meetings. There were also 
four meetings of the Audit Committee, four meetings of the Remuneration 
Committee and two meetings of the Nomination Committee. The table 
opposite shows attendance levels at the Board and Committee meetings 
held during the year; the numbers in brackets confirm how many meetings 
each Director was eligible to attend during the year.
Where a Director was unable to attend a meeting (whether of the  
Board or one of its Committees), they were provided with all the papers 
and information relating to that meeting and were able to discuss issues 
arising direct with the Chairman of the Board or Chair of the relevant 
Committee. In addition, the Board members meet more informally 
approximately five times a year and the Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors meet without the Executive Directors twice a year. 
There are 10 Board meetings currently planned for FY 2016. 
The Company Secretary’s responsibilities include ensuring good 
information flows to the Board and between senior management and  
the Non-Executive Directors. The Company Secretary is responsible, 
through the Chairman, for advising the Board on all corporate 
governance matters and for assisting the Directors with their professional 
development. This includes regular corporate governance and business 
issues updates, as well as the use of operational site visits and the 
provision of external courses where required. The Company Secretary 
facilitates a comprehensive induction for newly appointed Directors, 
tailored to individual requirements and including guidance on the 
requirements of, and Directors’ duties in connection with, the Code and 
the Companies Act 2006 as well as other relevant legislation. In FY 2015, 
the Company Secretary also co-ordinated the externally facilitated 
performance evaluation of the Board, details of the output of which are 
set out at page 48. The appointment and removal of the Company 
Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board.

Corporate governance statement
continued or letters of appointment of all the Board are on the Company’s website. 
In addition, they are available for inspection at the registered office of the 
Company during normal business hours and at the place of the Annual 
General Meeting from at least 15 minutes before and until the end of 
the meeting.
All the Company’s Directors are required to stand for annual re-election 
(or, in the case of Philip Urban and Josh Levy, election for the first time 
following their appointment) at the Company’s Annual General Meeting 
in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. Their 
biographical details as at 23 November 2015 are set out on page 37 , 
including their main commitments outside the Company. Further 
information is set out below.
The Executive Directors may be permitted to accept one external 
Non-Executive Director appointment with the Board’s prior approval 
and as long as this is not likely to lead to conflicts of interest.
Division of responsibilities between Chairman and Chief Executive
In accordance with provision A.2.1 of the Code, the roles of Chairman 
and Chief Executive should not be exercised by the same individual. 
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief 
Executive are clearly established and set out in writing and agreed  
by the Board. In particular, it has been agreed in writing that the 
Chairman shall be responsible for running the Board and shall provide 
advice and assistance to the Chief Executive. He also chairs the 
Nomination Committee, is a member of the Remuneration Committee 
and attends, by invitation, meetings of the Audit Committee.
It is also agreed in writing that the Chief Executive has responsibility  
for all aspects of the Group’s overall commercial, operational  
and strategic development. He chairs the Executive Committee  
(details of which appear on page 46) and attends the Nomination, 
Remuneration and Audit Committee by invitation, not necessarily  
for the entirety of such meetings depending upon the subject matter. 
All other Executive Directors (currently just the Finance Director) and all 
other members of the Executive Committee report to the Chief Executive.
Chairman
The Chairman should, on appointment, meet the independence  
criteria set out in provision B.1.1 of the Code. Bob Ivell met these 
independence criteria on appointment.
Bob Ivell was appointed to the role of Executive Chairman on  
26 October 2011 on the departure of the then Chief Executive and 
reverted to the role of Non-Executive Chairman on 12 November 2012. 
The Chairman ensures that appropriate communication is maintained 
with shareholders. He ensures that all Directors are fully informed of 
matters relevant to their roles. 
Chief Executive
Phil Urban was appointed Chief Executive on 27 September 2015 
following the resignation on 26 September 2015 of Alistair Darby who  
had held the position of Chief Executive from 8 October 2012.
As indicated above, the Chief Executive has responsibility for 
implementing the strategy agreed by the Board and for the executive 
management of the Group.
Senior Independent Director
Stewart Gilliland was appointed to the role of Senior Independent 
Director on 2 February 2015.
The Senior Independent Director supports the Chairman in the 
delivery of the Board’s objectives and ensures that the views of all 
major shareholders and stakeholders are conveyed to the Board. 
Stewart Gilliland is available to all shareholders should they have  
any concerns if the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive  
or Finance Director have failed to resolve them, or for which such 
contact is inappropriate. 
The Senior Independent Director also meets with Non-Executive 
Directors, without the Chairman present, at least annually, and 
conducts the annual appraisal of the Chairman’s performance.  
Further details of this review can be found on page 48.
Non-Executive Directors 
The Company has experienced Non-Executive Directors on its Board. 
Bob Ivell was considered to be independent upon his appointment on  
9 May 2011 in that he was free from any business or other relationship 
with the Company which could materially influence his judgement and 
he continues to represent a strong source of advice and independent 
challenge. Since his appointment as Chairman on 14 July 2011 the 
independence test, as set out in the Code, is no longer applicable  
to his current position. 
Ron Robson and Douglas McMahon were appointed to the  
Board as representatives of the Company’s largest shareholder, 
Piedmont Inc., and were therefore not regarded as independent in 
accordance with the Code Their role was examined and commented  
on in the recent external Board evaluation, further details of which  
are given on page 48. Douglas McMahon stepped down from the 
Board on 13 November 2015, and was replaced by Josh Levy, who  
is also a nominated shareholder representative of Piedmont Inc.
Eddie Irwin has been appointed to the Board as a representative of the 
Company’s second largest shareholder, Elpida Group Limited and is 
therefore not regarded as independent in accordance with the Code. 
There are currently three independent Non-Executive Directors on  
the Board: Stewart Gilliland, Colin Rutherford and Imelda Walsh.
Other than their fees, and reimbursement of taxable expenses which 
are disclosed on page 63, the Non-Executive Directors received no 
remuneration from the Company during the year. 
When Non-Executive Directors are considered for appointment, the 
Board takes into account their other responsibilities in assessing whether 
they can commit sufficient time to their prospective directorship.
Board information and training
All Directors are briefed by the use of comprehensive papers circulated  
in advance of Board meetings and by presentations at those meetings, in 
addition to receiving minutes of previous meetings. Their understanding 
of the Group’s business is enhanced by business specific presentations 
and operational visits to the Group’s businesses. Separate strategy 
meetings and meetings with senior Executives are also held throughout 
the year. 
The training needs of Directors are formally considered on an annual 
basis and are also monitored throughout the year with appropriate 
training being provided as required.
Committees
Each Board Committee has written terms of reference approved  
by the Board, which are available on the Company’s website.
Audit Committee
Details of the Audit Committee and its activities during the year are 
included in the Audit Committee report on pages 49 to 51 which  
is incorporated by reference into this statement.
Remuneration Committee
Details of the Remuneration Committee and its activities during  
the year are included in the Report on Directors’ remuneration on 
pages 52 to 69.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is responsible for nominating, for the 
approval of the Board, candidates for appointment to the Board.  
It is also responsible for succession planning and reviewing the  
output of the Board effectiveness review.

During the year, the Company did not comply with provision  
B.2.1 of the Code because, as explained earlier in this statement,  
the Nomination Committee was not comprised of a majority of 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The Committee is not fully 
compliant in that it includes the presence of representatives of  
major shareholders. 
Nevertheless, for the reasons already stated, the Board does not 
consider this to be an impediment to good governance and looks 
forward to continuing to work constructively with the representatives 
nominated by its major shareholders in relation to all the matters and 
issues to be addressed by the Nomination Committee (and the Board) 
in connection with the Company in the future.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Executive, 
consists of the Executive Directors and certain other senior Executives, 
namely Catriona Kempston (Marketing Director), Gary John (Group 
Property Director), Susan Martindale (Group HR Director) and Greg 
McMahon (Company Secretary and General Counsel).
The Executive Committee meets at least every four weeks and has 
day-to-day responsibility for the running of the Group’s business.  
It develops the Group’s strategy and annual revenue and capital 
budgets for Board approval. It reviews and recommends to the Board 
any significant investment proposals. This Committee monitors the 
financial and operational performance of the Group and allocates 
resources within the budgets agreed by the Board. It considers 
employment issues, ensures the Group has an appropriate pool of 
talent and develops senior management manpower planning and 
succession plans. The actions arising from the Executive Committee  
are supplied to the Board for information in order that Board members 
can keep abreast of operational developments.
Phil Urban has ultimate responsibility for employment related issues and 
he also oversees matters relating to human rights including the future 
implementation of the Modern Slavery Act throughout the Group.
General Purposes Committee
The General Purposes Committee comprises any two Executive 
Directors or any one Executive Director together with a senior officer 
from an agreed and restricted list of senior Executives. It is always chaired 
by an Executive Director. It attends to business of a routine nature and  
to the administration of matters, the principles of which have been 
agreed previously by the Board or an appropriate Committee.
Treasury Committee 
The treasury operations of the Mitchells & Butlers Group are operated  
on a centralised basis under the control of the Group Treasury 
department. Although not a formal Board Committee, the Treasury 
Committee, which reports to the Finance Director but is subject to 
oversight from the Audit Committee and, ultimately, the Board, has 
day-to-day responsibility for:
During the year, the Nomination Committee considered the succession to 
the role of Chief Executive which was announced on 22 September 2015 
and took effect on 27 September 2015. The Nomination Committee also 
considered the composition of the Board and, following the year end, has 
assessed the outcome of the external Board’s effectiveness review which 
was carried out during the financial year now reported on. 
The Nomination Committee agrees the importance of having diversity 
on the Board, including female representation and individuals with 
different experiences, skill sets and expertise, so as to maintain an 
appropriate balance within the Company and on the Board.
Board	Diversity	Policy 	
During 2015 the Nomination Committee recommended, and the Board 
approved, a Board Diversity Policy. The key statement and objectives 
of that policy are as follows:
Statement:
The Board recognises the benefits of diversity. Diversity of skills, 
background, knowledge, international and industry experience, and 
gender, amongst many other factors, will be taken into consideration 
when seeking to appoint a new Director to the Board. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, all Board appointments will always be made on merit.
Objectives:
 • The Board should ensure an appropriate mix of skills and  
experience to ensure an optimum Board and efficient stewardship. 
All Board appointments will be made on merit while taking into 
account individual competence, skills and expertise measured 
against identified objective criteria (including consideration  
of diversity).
 • The Board should ensure that it comprises Directors who  
are sufficiently experienced and independent of character  
and judgement.
 • The Nomination Committee will discuss and agree measurable 
objectives for achieving diversity on the Board with due regard 
being given to the recommendations set out in the Davies Report 
and the UK Corporate Governance Code, provision B.2.4. These 
will be reviewed on an annual basis.
Progress against the policy:
The Board continues to monitor progress against this policy. In  
terms of Board diversity, the appointment of Imelda Walsh in 2013 
brought the proportion of women on the Board to 11%. Any future 
appointments will always be made on merit and will continue to take 
into account diversity, not only in terms of gender, but also in terms of 
the appropriate mix of skills and experience. Further details regarding 
future appointments to be made to the Board are detailed in the  
2015 external Board Evaluation Report referred to on page 48.
Details of the Mitchells & Butlers Diversity Policy, which applies to 
diversity in relation to employees of Mitchells & Butlers plc, can be  
found in the corporate social responsibility section on pages 26 to 30.
A detailed description of the duties of the Nomination Committee  
is set out within its terms of reference which can be viewed at

 • investment of surplus cash; 
 • funding, cash and banking arrangements; 
 • interest rate and currency risk management; 
 • guarantees, bonds, indemnities and any financial encumbrances 
including charges on assets; and 
 • relationships with Banks and other market counterparties  
such as credit rating agencies. 
The Treasury Committee also works closely with the financial 
accounting department to review the impact of changes in relevant 
accounting practices and to ensure that treasury activities are  
disclosed appropriately in the Company’s accounts.
The Board delegates the monitoring of treasury activity and  
compliance to the Treasury Committee. It is responsible for monitoring 
the effectiveness of treasury policies and making proposals for any 
changes to policies or in respect of the utilisation of new instruments. 
The approval of the Board, or a designated committee thereof,  
is required for any such proposals.
Independent advice
Members of the Board may take independent professional advice  
in the furtherance of their duties and the Board has agreed a formal 
process for such advice to be made available. Members of the Board 
also have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary 
and General Counsel, the Company’s legal and other professional 
advisers and its external auditor. The terms of engagement of the 
Company’s external advisers and its external auditor are regularly 
reviewed by the Company Secretary and General Counsel.
Code of Ethics 
The Company has implemented business conduct guidelines  
describing the standards of behaviour expected from those working  
for the Company in the form of a code of ethics (the ‘Ethics Code’).  
Its aim is to promote honest and ethical conduct throughout our 
business. The Ethics Code requires:
 • compliance with all applicable rules and regulations that apply  
to the Company and its officers including the Bribery Act 2010;
 • the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest 
between internal and external, personal and professional 
relationships; and
 • that any hospitality from suppliers must be approved in advance  
by appropriate senior management, with a presumption against  
its acceptance.
The Company takes a zero tolerance approach to bribery and has 
developed an extensive Bribery Policy. The Ethics Code requires 
employees to comply with the Bribery Policy.
The Company also offers an independently administered, confidential 
whistleblowing hotline for any employee wishing to report any concern 
that they feel would be inappropriate to raise with their line manager. 
All whistleblowing allegations are reported to and considered by the 
Executive Committee and a summary report (with details of any major 
concerns) is supplied to, and considered by, the Audit Committee at 
each meeting.
The Board takes regular account of social, environmental and ethical 
matters concerning the Company through regular reports to the Board 
and presentations to the Board at its strategy meetings. The Board has 
noted the provisions of the Modern Slavery Act in relation to supply 
chain management and will be taking steps during FY 2016 to comply 
with its disclosure requirements by the end of that financial year.
Directors’ training includes environmental, social and governance 
(‘ESG’) matters and the Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring 
that Directors are made aware of and receive regular training in respect 
of these important areas. The Chief Executive, Phil Urban, is ultimately 
responsible for ESG matters. The Board is responsible for the Company’s 
internal risk management system, in respect of which more details can 
be found in the ‘Risks and uncertainties’ section of this report, and in 
the following section of this statement.
Internal control and risk management 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal 
control and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness.  
In order to discharge that responsibility, the Board has established  
the procedures necessary to apply the Code for the year under review 
and to the date of approval of the Annual Report. Such procedures  
are regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee.
The key features of the Group’s internal control and risk management 
systems include:
 • Processes, including monitoring by the Board, in respect of: 
i.  financial performance within a comprehensive financial planning, 
accounting and reporting framework;
ii.  strategic plan achievement;
iii.  capital investment and asset management performance, with 
detailed appraisal, authorisation and post-investment reviews; and
iv.  consumer insight data and actions to assess the evolution of brands 
and formats to ensure that they continue to be appealing and 
relevant to the Group’s guests.
 • An overall governance framework including:
i.  clearly defined delegations of authority and reporting lines; 
ii.  a comprehensive set of policies and procedures that employees  
are required to follow; and
iii.  the Group’s Ethics Code, in respect of which an annual confirmation 
of compliance is sought from all corporate employees.
 • The Risk Committee, a sub-committee of the Executive Committee, 
which assists the Board, Audit Committee and Executive Committee 
in managing the processes for identifying, evaluating, monitoring 
and mitigating risks. The Risk Committee, which met four times 
during FY 2015, is chaired by the Company Secretary and General 
Counsel and comprises Executive Committee members and other 
members of senior management from a cross-section of functions. 
Its primary responsibilities are to:
i.  advise the Executive Committee on the Company’s overall risk 
appetite and risk strategy, taking account of the current and 
prospective operating, legal, macroeconomic and financial 
environments;
ii.  advise the Executive Committee on the current and emerging risk 
exposures of the Company in the context of the overall risk appetite 
and risk strategy;
iii.  promote the management of risk throughout the organisation;
iv.  review and monitor the Company’s capability and processes to 
identify and manage risks;
v.  consider the identified key risks faced by the Company and  
new and emerging risks and consider the adequacy of mitigation 
plans in respect of such risks; and
vi.  where mitigation plans are inadequate, recommend  
improvement actions.

Director regularly report to the Board the views of larger shareholders 
about the Company, and the other Non-Executive Directors are available 
to meet shareholders on request and are offered the opportunity to 
attend meetings with larger shareholders. During the year the Chairman, 
accompanied by the Head of Investor Relations, held governance 
meetings with two institutional investors and also offered a series  
of telephone discussions relating to Company matters.
The AGM provides a useful interface with shareholders, many of  
whom are also guests in our pubs, bars and restaurants. All proxy  
votes received in respect of each resolution at the AGM are counted 
and the balance for and against, and any votes withheld, are indicated. 
Board effectiveness evaluation and Chairman’s evaluation  
and appraisal
In line with the best practice recommendations of the Code, in FY 2014 
we committed to carrying out an externally facilitated review of the 
Board’s effectiveness. During FY 2015, the Board carried out an 
externally-facilitated self-evaluation review. This was facilitated by  
Mrs Ffion Hague of Independent Board Evaluation. The conclusions of 
that review were reported on to the Board by the facilitator. In addition, 
the Chairman received individual reports from the facilitator as to the 
contribution and effectiveness of each of the Board members, all of 
whom participated in the review. The review also included consultation 
with certain senior managers and external advisers in order to ensure  
a coherent and comprehensive view could be formed.
The Board noted the observations made as a consequence of the 
review. In particular, it was reported that the Board is, overall, working 
effectively and has certainly improved as a functioning Board over 
recent years, particularly as a consequence of the appointment of 
credible, independent Non-Executive Directors and, more recently,  
the identification and nomination of a Senior Independent Director.  
It was also noted that the Board composition, although of an unusual 
structure due to the representation of the two largest shareholders, 
nonetheless works well.
The Board considered carefully the recommendations which arose from 
that review. Those recommendations related to suggested improvements 
to some of the Board meeting processes (which have now been 
implemented), suggested improvements to the Board’s succession  
and strategic planning processes and the recruitment of a further 
independent Non-Executive Director.
As indicated earlier in this statement, the Company appointed Stewart 
Gilliland to the role of Senior Independent Director on 2 February 2015. 
Accordingly, the annual appraisal of the Chairman’s performance was 
conducted by Stewart Gilliland with the independent Non-Executive 
Directors (without the Chairman present) and the conclusions fed back 
to the Chairman. The principal conclusions of that review were that  
Mr Ivell’s performance remains highly constructive and that the level  
of Mr Ivell’s involvement was of benefit to the Company noting that  
the relationship between the Chairman and CEO is critical. Annual 
reviews of the Chairman’s performance will continue to be conducted 
as required by the Code. Further, as indicated above, the Board 
Effectiveness Review included an assessment of the Chairman  
and his fulfilment of his role.
Going concern
The Directors’ statement as to the status of the Company as a going 
concern can be found on page 40.
The Group’s risks identified by the processes that are managed by  
the Risk Committee are described in ‘Risks and uncertainties’ on  
pages 18 to 21.
 • Examination of business processes on a risk basis including reports 
from the internal audit function, known as Group Assurance, which 
reports directly to the Audit Committee.
The Group also has in place systems, including policies and procedures, 
for exercising control and managing risk in respect of financial reporting 
and the preparation of consolidated accounts. These systems, policies 
and procedures:
 • govern the maintenance of accounting records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions;
 • require reported information to be reviewed and reconciled,  
with monitoring by the Audit Committee and Board; and
 • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
or UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, as appropriate.
In accordance with the Code, during the year the Audit Committee 
completed (and reported to the Board its conclusions in respect of)  
its annual review of the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
and internal control systems, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls. The system of internal control is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and, as such, it can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. In that context, in  
the opinion of the Audit Committee, the review did not indicate that  
the system was ineffective or unsatisfactory and to the extent that 
weaknesses in internal controls were identified, the Audit Committee 
confirmed that necessary remedial action plans were in place. The 
Audit Committee is not aware of any change to this status up to the  
date of approval of this Annual Report.
With regard to insurance against risk, it is not practicable to insure  
against every risk to the fullest extent. The Group regularly reviews 
both the type and amount of external insurance that it buys with 
guidance from an external independent broker, bearing in mind the 
availability of such cover, its cost and the likelihood and magnitude  
of the risks involved. During the financial year, the Company carried  
out a full tender process in respect of its insurance brokerage adviser 
and, following the appointment of a new broker, made a full market 
presentation to new and existing insurers. The output of that  
process was the development and implementation of a new  
insurance programme with current market coverage levels  
with high quality insurers.
Shareholder relations
The Board recognises that it is accountable to shareholders for the 
performance and activities of the Company. The Company regularly 
updates the market on its financial performance, at the half year and  
full year results in May and November respectively, and by way of  
other announcements as required. The content of these updates  
is available by webcast on the Company’s website, together with 
general information about the Company so as to be available to all 
shareholders. The Company has a regular programme of meetings  
with its larger shareholders which provides an opportunity to  
discuss, on the basis of publicly available information, the progress  
of the business.

internal control weaknesses;
 • reviewing the effectiveness of the Group Assurance function; and
 • overseeing the relationship with the external and internal auditors. 
At the date of the 2015 Annual Report, the Audit Committee comprises 
three independent Non-Executive Directors: Colin Rutherford (Chair), 
Imelda Walsh and Stewart Gilliland, and two further Non-Executive 
Directors nominated by substantial shareholders, Ron Robson and

with effect from 11 July 2013, and revised terms of reference established, 
in order to comply with Code requirements. The Audit Committee met 
four times during FY 2015. 
When appropriate, the Audit Committee augments the skills and 
experiences of its members with advice from internal and external audit 
professionals, for example, on matters such as developments in financial 
reporting. Audit Committee meetings are also attended, by invitation, 
by members of the Board, the Company Secretary and General 
Counsel, the Group Risk Director and representatives of the external 
auditor, Deloitte LLP . The Audit Committee also meets privately not 
less than twice a year, without any member of management present,  
in relation to audit matters, with the external auditor.
The remuneration of the members of the Audit Committee is set out  
in the Report on Directors’ remuneration on page 63.
Summary terms of reference
A copy of the Audit Committee’s terms of reference is publicly  
available within the Investor section of the Company’s website: 
www.mbplc.com/pdf/audit_committee_terms.pdf
The Audit Committee is authorised by the Board to review any activity 
within the business. It is authorised to seek any information it requires 
from, and require the attendance at any of its meetings of, any Director 
or member of management, and all employees are expected to 
co-operate with any request made by the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee is authorised by the Board to obtain, at the 
Company’s expense, outside legal or other independent professional 
advice and secure the attendance of outsiders with relevant experience

Committee reports to the subsequent Board meeting on the Committee’s 
work and the Board receives a copy of the minutes of each meeting. 
Introduction from the Audit Committee Chairman
I am delighted to present, on behalf of the Board, our Audit 
Committee report for the financial year ended 26 September 2015. 
Since my appointment, I have been committed to gaining a  
broad understanding of our Group, its operations and challenges, 
and of necessity continue to spend valuable time with those key 
individuals throughout the Group who have collectively provided 
an appreciation and rigorous insight into how our Group functions  
and reports. 
The Audit Committee continues to engage formally, regularly  
and at an appropriate level of detail with our external auditor, other 
third party advisers as necessary and our Group assurance and risk 
director. This has enabled us to gain an appropriate understanding 
of how our auditors and third-party advisers interact with our Group 
assurance and risk management function, to give comprehensive 
coverage of both the external and internal audit process, and 
confidence in both their respective and collective fieldwork 
conclusions. It is also important to note our Group provision of 
sufficient resources in ensuring any additional assurance is 
obtained where considered appropriate, in support of this  
overall process. 
The role of the Audit Committee continues to focus on challenging 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls, the robustness of 
our Group assurance and risk management process and in assessing 
the import of and acting as required upon any and all reported 
information received from our auditors, third-party advisers and 
from our rigorous internal audit function.
The Committee is committed to maintaining an open and 
constructive dialogue with our shareholders on Audit matters. 
Therefore, if you have any comments or questions on any  
element of the report, please email me, care of Adrian Brannan, 
Group Risk Director, at adrian.brannan@mbplc.com.

Audit Committee report
Colin Rutherford
Chairman	of	the 	
Audit	Committee The role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to:
 • review the Company’s public statements on internal control,  
risk management and corporate governance compliance;
 • review the Company’s processes for detecting fraud, misconduct 
and control weaknesses and to consider the Company’s response  
to any such occurrence;
 • review management’s evaluation of any change in internal controls 
over financial reporting;
 • review with management and the auditor, Company financial 
statements required under UK legislation before submission to  
the Board;
 • establish, review and maintain the role and effectiveness of the 
internal audit function, known as Group Assurance, whose objective 
is to provide independent assurance over the Group’s significant 
processes and controls, including those in respect of the Group’s 
key risks;
 • assume direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, 
resignation, dismissal and the overseeing of the auditor, including 
review of the external audit, its cost and effectiveness;
 • pre-approve non-audit work to be carried out by the auditor and  
the fees to be paid for that work together with the monitoring of  
the external auditor’s independence;
 • oversee the process for dealing with complaints received by  
the Group regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or 
auditing matters and any confidential, anonymous submission  
by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting,  
or auditing matters; and
 • adopt and oversee a specific Code of Ethics for all corporate 
employees which is consistent with the Company’s overall 
statement of business ethics.
Key activities of the Audit Committee
Audit matters are reviewed at quarterly Audit Committee meetings 
throughout the year at which detailed reports are presented for  
review. The Audit Committee commissions reports from external 
advisers, the Group Risk Director, or Company management, either 
after consideration of the Company’s major risks or in response to 
developing issues. During the year, in order to fulfil the roles and 
responsibilities of the Audit Committee, the following matters  
were considered:
 • the suitability of the Group’s accounting policies and practices; 
 • half year and full year financial results;
 • the scope and cost of the external audit;
 • the auditor’s half year and full year reports; 
 • reappointment and evaluation of the performance of the auditor, 
including recommendations to the Board for approval by 
shareholders, on the reappointment of the Company’s auditor  
and approval of fees and terms of engagement;
 • non-audit work carried out by the auditor and trends in the 
non-audit fees in accordance with the Committee’s policy to  
ensure the safeguard of audit independence;  
 • the co-ordination of the internal and external audit functions;
 • the arrangements in respect of Group Assurance including its 
resourcing, external support, the scope of the annual internal  
audit plan for FY 2015 regarding the level of achievement and  
the scope of the internal audit plan for FY 2016;
 • periodic internal control and assurance reports from  
Group Assurance;
 • the Group’s risk management framework for the identification  
and control of major risks, its risk and assurance mitigation plan  
and the annual assessment of control effectiveness;
 • compliance with the Company’s Code of Ethics;
 • corporate governance developments;
 • the status of material litigation involving the Group; and
 • reports on allegations made via the Group’s whistleblowing 
procedures and the effectiveness of these procedures including  
a summary of reports received during FY 2015.
Disclosure of significant issues considered 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the key judgements applied in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements, which are described 
in the relevant accounting policies and detailed notes to the financial 
statements on pages 74 to 108. The Audit Committee’s review included 
consideration of the following key accounting judgements:
 • Property, Plant and Equipment Valuation – the assumptions used  
by management to value the long leasehold and freehold estate 
including estimated fair maintainable trading levels, brand multiples 
and use of spot valuations to ensure a consistent valuation 
methodology is in place. A number of key judgements are also 
applied in calculating the short leasehold impairment such as  
trading levels and the use of an appropriate discount rate;
 • Orchid acquisition accounting – key assumptions used in finalising 
the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired in the transaction 
including considering the valuation of the property acquired  
(by reference to fair maintainable trade and property multiples)  
and support for the recognition of a deferred tax asset; 
 • Taxation – tax accounting continues to remain an area of focus, in 
particular, accounting for deferred tax on the property estate and 
the level of judgement exercised in valuing tax provisions recorded 
in respect of uncertain tax positions. The recognition of deferred  
tax assets, taking into consideration the timing and level of future 
taxable income, was also assessed; and
 • Pension deficit – the pension liability is sensitive to the actuarial 
assumptions applied in measuring future cash outflows. The use  
of assumptions such as the discount rate and inflation, which have  
an impact on the valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme, 
was assessed by the Audit Committee. 
Effectiveness of internal audit 
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing  
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal audit function. The Audit 
Committee meets regularly with management and with the Group Risk 
Director and the auditor, to review the effectiveness of internal controls 
and risk management and receives reports from the Group Risk Director 
on a quarterly basis. 
The annual internal audit plan is approved by the Audit Committee  
and kept under review on a monthly basis, by the Group Risk Director, 
in order to reflect the changing business needs and to ensure new  
and emerging risks are considered. The Audit Committee is informed  
of any amendments made to the audit plan on a quarterly basis.  
The FY 2015 internal audit plan was developed through a review of 
formal risk assessments (in conjunction with the Risk Committee and 
the Group’s Executive Committee) together with consideration of the 
Group’s key business processes and functions that could be subject to 
audit. A similar approach has been employed in relation to the FY 2016 
internal audit plan.
The principal objectives of the internal audit plan for FY 2015 were,  
and remain for FY 2016:
 • to provide confidence that existing and emerging key risks are  
being managed effectively;
 • to confirm that controls over core business functions and processes 
are operating as intended (‘core assurance’); and
 • to confirm that major projects and significant business change 
programmes are being adequately controlled.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Audit Committee report
continued External auditor’s independence
The external auditors should not provide non-audit services where  
it might impair their independence or objectivity to do so. The Audit 
Committee has established a policy to safeguard the independence 
and objectivity of the Group’s auditor as follows:
 
The following services have been pre-approved by the Audit 
Committee provided that the fee for the individual project is less than 
50% of the audit fee, and in total for the year is less than the audit fee:
 • audit related services, including work related to the annual Group 
financial statements, subsidiary audits and statutory accounts; and
 • certain specified tax services, including tax compliance, tax planning 
and tax advice.
Acquisition and vendor due-diligence may only be provided if it is 
specifically approved by the Committee on a case by case basis in 
advance of the engagement commencing. Any other work for which 
management wishes to utilise the external auditor must be approved  
as follows:
 • services with fees less than £50,000 may be approved by the 
Finance Director; and
 • engagements with fees of over £50,000 may be approved by the 
Audit Committee or its Chair.
The Audit Committee remains confident that the objectivity and 
independence of the auditor are not in any way impaired by reason  
of the non-audit services which they provide to the Group. 
External audit annual assessment 
The Audit Committee assesses annually the qualification, expertise, 
resources and independence of the Group’s auditor and the overall 
effectiveness of the audit process. The Finance Director, Company 
Secretary and General Counsel, Audit Committee Chairman and Group 
Risk Director meet with the auditor to discuss the audit and any key 
issues included on the Audit Committee’s agenda during the year.
Fair, balanced and understandable statement 
One of the key governance requirements of a Group’s financial 
statements is for the report and accounts to be fair, balanced and 
understandable. Therefore, upon review of the financial statements, 
the Audit Committee and the Board are satisfied with the overall 
fairness, balance and clarity of the Annual Report, which is 
underpinned by the following:
 • formal minutes of the year end working group;
 • clear guidance issued to all contributors to ensure a consistent 
approach; and 
 • formal review processes at all levels to ensure the Annual Report 
is factually correct.
Approved by the Board
Colin Rutherford 
Chairman	of	the	Audit	Committee
23 November 2015
During FY 2015, 18 audit reports were issued by the Group Assurance 
function and reviewed by the Board or the Audit Committee. Internal 
audit recommendations are closely monitored through to closure  
via a web-based recommendation tracking system, introduced in  
FY 2013, which has improved the overall monitoring of internal audit 
recommendations to ensure these are successfully implemented in  
a timely manner. A summary of the status of the implementation of 
internal audit recommendations is made monthly to the Executive 
Committee and quarterly to the Audit Committee.
Risk management framework
As disclosed in the ‘Risk and uncertainties’ section on pages 18 to 21  
the Risk Committee continues to meet on a regular basis to review  
the key risks facing the business. The Risk Committee met on four 
occasions in FY 2015. Membership of the Risk Committee, which 
includes representation from each of the key business functions,  
is detailed below:
 • Company Secretary and General Counsel (Chairman)
 • Group Finance Director
 • Chief Executive
 • Group HR Director
 • Director of Business Change & Technology
 • Group Risk Director 
Key risks identified are reviewed and assessed on a quarterly basis in 
terms of their likelihood and impact, within the Group’s ‘Key Risk Heat 
Map’, in conjunction with associated risk mitigation plans. In addition, 
the Risk Committee’s review includes an assessment of the material 
relevance of emerging risks and the continued relevance of previously 
identified risks. Actions arising from Risk Committee meetings are 
followed up by the Group Risk Director. The Audit Committee reviews 
the Risk Committee minutes, in addition to a review of the Group’s  
‘Key Risk Heat Map’ quarterly. 
Confidential reporting 
The Group’s whistleblowing policy enables staff, in confidence, to raise 
concerns about possible improprieties in financial and other matters 
and to do so without fear of reprisal. Details of the policy are set out  
in the Company’s Code of Ethics. The Audit Committee receives 
quarterly reports on whistleblowing incidents and remains satisfied  
that the procedures in place are satisfactory to enable independent 
investigation and follow up action of all matters reported. No major 
issues have been reported in FY 2015 (major issues being defined for 
this purpose as matters having a financial impact greater than £100k). 
External auditor appointment
Deloitte LLP was appointed as the auditor in 2011, following a  
formal tender process. The Audit Committee has considered the  
new guidance in relation to rotation including the proposed transition 
rules which will be considered when recommending the appointment 
of the auditor in future years. The Audit Committee considers that the 
relationship with the auditor is working well and is satisfied with its 
effectiveness and has not considered it necessary to require Deloitte 
LLP to re-tender for the external audit work. There are no contractual 
obligations restricting the Company’s choice of auditor. Following its 
appointment as auditor, Deloitte LLP was replaced in respect of the 
provision of internal audit services by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP .

Governance  34–69 Financial statements  70–115 Shareholder  information  116 Strategic report  2–33 Statement from the Committee Chair
Dear Fellow Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ remuneration report in respect  
of the financial year which ended on 26 September 2015.
Background and business context 
Total sales over the financial year grew by 6.6% with like-for-like  
sales improving by 0.8% over the period. The eating and drinking- 
out market as a whole has been relatively subdued, especially over  
the summer months, contributing to this relatively modest increase  
in like-for-like sales. Profit Before Tax
1
 (‘PBT’)
 
increased by £12m to 
£184m in FY 2015. Consumer expectations continue to increase,  
and stable teams help to deliver a great experience, therefore it  
is encouraging that the level of staff turnover has now fallen to a  
historical low of 76%, a year-on-year reduction of 2ppts. The benefit  
of stable teams has also contributed to improvements in guest  
service, as measured by the Net Promoter Score (‘NPS’), which  
has improved by a further 2% over the year to 65%.
The full integration of the Orchid business acquired in 2014 has  
been completed, on time and on budget. 41 Orchid businesses  
have been converted to our brands, and returns from these  
conversions are strong. 
In the summer, the Chancellor announced the introduction of  
a National Living Wage (‘NLW’) from April 2016. The NLW will  
see a significant increase to the overall wage bill and it will not be  
possible to simply reduce costs as a way of absorbing the increase.  
We will look at efficiency gains through technology, and changes  
to service models, and monitor our brand propositions to ensure  
they remain appropriate to our customers.
1.  Adjusted Profit Before Tax, earnings per share and operating profit included in the report 
on Directors’ remuneration, are quoted before exceptional items as set out in note 2.2.
The eating and drinking-out market continues to evolve. Consumer 
expectations in relation to the quality, value and availability of offers  
will mean that our brands must adapt quickly to these challenges.  
Phil Urban has outlined his priorities: 
 • we must maintain the right balance of brands across the estate 
through expansion and conversion; 
 • continue to deliver against our key metrics, to continuously  
improve standards; and 
 • be prepared to innovate as a way of improving returns and 
enhancing guest experience.
The Board are delighted to be able to recommend the resumption  
of a dividend, recognising our earnings growth in 2015.
Appointment of new Chief Executive and departure of former 
Chief Executive
As reported on 22 September 2015, Phil Urban was appointed to the 
Board as Chief Executive with effect from 27 September 2015. Phil has 
extensive experience and a strong track record in a number of senior 
roles across the hospitality industry. Phil joined Mitchells & Butlers as 
Chief Operating Officer in early 2015 and has already established strong 
relationships with the Board and Management team. Phil has been 
appointed on a salary of £510,000, which is lower than his predecessor’s 
and will next be reviewed in January 2017 . The salary level reflects a first 
appointment to a CEO position and from 2017 , any increase to this salary 
will take into account improvements to business performance and also 
salaries in comparator companies of a similar size and scale. This is in line 
with the approved remuneration policy. Full details of Phil’s remuneration 
were announced at the time of his appointment. 
Details of the termination arrangements that applied to Alistair Darby 
were also fully disclosed at the time his leaving was announced and  
are set out in full in the Annual Remuneration Report.
2015 remuneration 
The 2015 bonus plan had two elements, PBT
1
 and Guest Service.  
Whilst PBT 
1
 has increased by 7% year-on-year and Net Promoter 
Scores are at their highest ever level, the stretching targets set by  
the Committee have not been met and therefore no annual bonus 
awards have been made to Executive Directors. 
The 2013-2015 Performance Restricted Share Plan (‘PRSP’) performance 
condition also had two elements, growth in adjusted earnings per share 
(‘EPS’) and total shareholder return (‘TSR’), each with a 50% weighting. 
Over the performance period EPS
1
 growth has been 9.38% p.a., above  
the 8% p.a. threshold level of performance required for vesting, but  
below the target for full vesting of 16% p.a. resulting in partial vesting.  
TSR performance has been below the median threshold required for 
vesting, and therefore awards under this element of the performance 
condition will lapse. As a result, overall vesting is 19%. The Remuneration 
Committee considers that this level of vesting is representative of the 
Company’s overall performance over the three year period and have  
also taken into account other performance factors and key performance 
indicators as part of this assessment. For example, over the PRSP 
performance period, the business has made good progress in enhancing 
its infrastructure, investment returns have improved and it has completed 
the acquisition and integration of Orchid. In addition, staff turnover  
has reduced and NPS is at its highest ever level.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Report on Directors’ remuneration
Imelda Walsh
Chair	of	the 	
Remuneration	
Committee This section briefly summarises the principles that underpin our 
remuneration policy, its link with our strategic priorities and highlights 
performance and remuneration outcomes for FY 2015. More detail can 
be found in the annual report on remuneration on pages 62 to 69.
Remuneration principles 
Shareholder alignment
A high proportion of reward is delivered in the form of equity, ensuring 
Executives have a strong alignment with shareholders.
Competitive
Providing competitive reward that promotes the long-term success of 
the business whilst enabling the attraction, retention and motivation  
of high calibre senior Executives.
Performance-linked
A significant part of an Executive’s reward is linked to the performance 
of the business with a clear line of sight between business performance 
and delivery of shareholder value.
Straightforward
The remuneration structure is simple to understand for participants and 
shareholders and is aligned to the strategic priorities of the business.
Strategic priorities 
 • Focus the business on the most attractive market spaces within 
eating and drinking-out. 
 • Develop superior brand propositions with high levels of  
consumer relevance.
 • Recruit, retain and develop engaged people who deliver excellent 
service for our guests. 
 • Generate high returns on investment through scale advantage.
 • Maintain a sound financial base.
FY 2015 annual bonus 
The annual bonus was based on two elements; 75% on PBT
1
 and 25%  
on Guest Service as measured by our NPS. Year-on-year improvements 
have been made against both performance measures. PBT
1
 increased 
by 7% to £184m but still falling short of the threshold level of 
performance set by the Committee. 
NPS scores increased by 2% over the year, and scores are now at their 
highest ever level at 65%. However, as the threshold level of financial 
performance has not been achieved, no award under this element  
has been made. 
No bonus awards have been made to Executive Directors in FY 2015.
During the year an award was made under the terms of the PRSP  
in respect of the 2015-2017 performance period and full details  
are set out on page 65.
Approach for 2016
The Committee was pleased with the outcome of the vote on our 
remuneration policy, where there was a 99.3% vote in favour of its 
implementation. No changes to the policy are sought this year,  
but I would like to draw attention to the following points:
 • The bonus for 2016 will continue to be based 75% on profit  
and 25% on Guest Service but for 2016, the financial metric  
will be Operating Profit
1
, replacing PBT
1
. The Committee believes  
that Operating Profit
1
 is a better measure of trading performance  
and is a key headline figure used in the annual and half year reports.  
The Committee will continue to set demanding targets for both 
Operating Profit
1
 and Guest Service. Reflecting that approach and  
in line with typical practice, the Committee will set a Threshold  
at which point 6.25% will be payable, with 42.5% payable at  
Target and full pay-out at Stretch performance. The earnings 
opportunity at on target is slightly lower than in 2015 (50%).  
The Maximum opportunity remains at 100% of base salary. 
 • The Remuneration Committee believes that setting long-term 
incentive plan targets should reflect the Company’s strategy.  
The impact of the NLW, continued evolution of the market  
and the priorities outlined by the new Chief Executive, will  
continue to shape strategy and further work is required to  
ensure that incentive plan targets remain appropriate. With  
this in mind the Committee has agreed to delay the grant of  
PRSP awards covering the 2016-18 performance period to  
allow for this work to be completed. This delay will allow the 
Committee further time to consider the structure of the PRSP 
performance condition, within the constraints of the agreed 
remuneration policy. Irrespective of the outcome of this review  
it is the intention that TSR will remain as a measure, accounting  
for at least 50% of any award and retaining the current comparator 
group. If significant changes to the current performance  
measures or targets are proposed then leading shareholders  
and shareholder representative bodies will be consulted,  
prior to any awards being granted.
 • No salary increases will apply for the Finance Director for 2016.
This Annual Statement and the Annual Report on Remuneration  
will be subject to an advisory vote at the January 2016 AGM.  
The Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the  
last AGM and while not required by the regulations, for ease of 
reference, is set out in full on pages 54 to 61.
The Committee is committed to maintaining an open and constructive 
dialogue with our shareholders on remuneration matters. If you have 
any comments or questions on any element of the report, please  
email me, care of Craig Provett, Director of Compensation & Benefits, 
at Remco@mbplc.com

This section of the report sets out the Company’s remuneration policy 
as approved at the 2015 AGM and the performance scenario charts 
have been updated to reflect changes to remuneration from 2016.
The Committee is constituted in accordance with the recommendations 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’). The full terms  
of reference of the Committee are available on our website:  
www.mbplc.com/investors/businessconduct/boardcommittees  
and on request. The Committee’s responsibilities include:
 • making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s 
remuneration policy for Executive Directors and senior Executives 
giving full consideration to the Code and setting the remuneration 
for Executive Directors and the Chairman, including pension rights 
and compensation payments; 
 • taking account of all factors necessary when determining the  
policy, the objective of which shall be to ensure remuneration policy 
promotes the long-term success of the Company without paying 
more than is necessary; and
 • aligning Executive Directors’ interests with those of shareholders  
by providing the potential to earn significant rewards where 
significant shareholder value has been delivered. 
The Committee is mindful of a broad range of stakeholders in the 
business and accordingly takes account of a range of factors when 
setting remuneration policy including market conditions, pay and 
benefits in relevant comparator organisations, terms and conditions  
of employment across the Group, the Company’s risk appetite and 
shareholder feedback. 
The Committee considers a broad range of internal and external 
information in determining policy; this includes a review of external 
benchmarking information when reviewing Executive Directors’ base  
pay and as required on appointment of a new Executive Director  
or Executive Committee member. While market data is provided  
to the Committee by its independently appointed advisers, such  
data provides the context for setting pay levels and the Committee 
does not consider it in isolation.
 
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors set out over the 
following pages supports the business needs of the Company,  
ensuring it promotes the long-term success of the business whilst 
enabling the Company to attract, retain and motivate senior Executives  
of a high calibre. The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration 
policy supports the Company’s business strategy of growing long-term 
shareholder value and appropriately balances fixed and variable 
remuneration. With a high proportion of reward delivered in the  
form of equity, this ensures that Executives have strong alignment  
with shareholders through the Company’s share price.
For clarity of reporting, references to the Sharesave Plan (‘Sharesave’), 
Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’), Performance Restricted Share Plan  
(‘PRSP’) and Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan (‘STDIP’) refer  
both to share awards under these original schemes and, following  
the expiry of these schemes for grant purposes, subsequent awards 
under their respective replacement schemes on substantially the  
same terms. Both the original schemes and their replacements in  
2013 were approved by shareholders.

Recovery or

Base salary
Provides a sound 
basis on which  
to attract and  
retain Executives  
of appropriate 
calibre to deliver  
the strategic 
objectives of  
the Group.
To reflect the  
market value of  
the role, personal 
contribution, 
experience and 
competence.
Salaries are normally subject to annual review. 
Salary levels may be influenced by:
 • role, experience or performance;
 • Group profitability and prevailing market 
conditions; and
 • periodic external benchmarking of similar 
roles at comparable companies by size  
and sector.
Any increase is normally effective from 
1 January.
Payable in cash, four-weekly throughout the 
year. Pensionable.
Normally set broadly around mid-market 
levels with increases in line with that of 
the Company’s UK workforce.
Percentage increases beyond those 
granted to the wider workforce may be 
awarded in certain circumstances such as 
when there is a change in the individual’s 
role or responsibility or where there has 
been a fundamental change in the scale  
or nature of the Company.
In addition, a higher increase may  
be made where an individual had  
been appointed to a new role at below  
market salary while gaining experience. 
Subsequent demonstration of strong 
performance may result in a salary 
increase that is higher than for the  
wider workforce.
There may also be circumstances  
where the Committee agrees to pay 
above mid-market levels to secure or 
retain an individual who is considered,  
in the judgement of the Committee,  
to possess significant and relevant 
experience which is required to enable 
the delivery of the Company’s strategy.
Executive Directors’ performance is a factor 
considered when determining salaries. 
Performance is reviewed in line with the 
established performance review process  
in place across the Group.
No recovery  
or withholding 
applies.
Annual Performance Bonus (cash and shares)
Provides a direct  
link between the 
achievement of 
annual business 
performance  
targets and reward.
Deferred bonus, 
awarded in shares, 
provides a retention 
element and 
additional alignment 
of interests to 
shareholders.
Bonus payment level is determined by the 
Committee by reference to performance 
against the targets set by the Committee 
prior to the commencement of the 
performance year. The cash element of the 
bonus is normally payable in December 
following the end of the financial year.
Up to half of any bonus award is payable  
in cash. At least half of any bonus award  
is deferred as shares under the terms of  
the STDIP below.
Key terms of the STDIP are:
 • deferred bonus share awards are  
normally released in two equal amounts 
12 and 24 months after deferral; and
 • at the discretion of the Committee 
dividends paid between grant and  
vesting may accrue on vested shares.
Non-pensionable.
Currently, the normal maximum payment 
is 100% of base salary.
At the discretion of the Committee,  
the maximum earnings potential may  
be increased in line with the plan rules  
up to 150% of base salary.
At least 75% of bonus will be based on financial 
measures. This may be a single measure or a mix 
of metrics as determined by the Committee.
No more than 25% will be based on non-financial 
measures or personal business objectives.
Payment of non-financial measures may be 
subject to a financial performance threshold.
Up to 50% of bonus may be earned for achieving 
a demanding target with full payout for 
achieving a second, more demanding target.
The nature of the performance measure(s)  
and the targets are reviewed in advance of  
each new award.
The Committee has the discretion to vary the 
mix of measures or to introduce new measures 
to reflect business need.
As the bonus is subject to performance 
conditions, any deferred bonus is not subject  
to further conditions.
The Committee may alter the bonus outcome  
if it considers that the payout is inconsistent  
with the Company’s overall performance taking 
account of any factors it considers relevant.  
This will help ensure that payouts reflect overall 
Company performance during the period. The 
Committee will consult with leading investors 
before any exercise of its discretion to increase 
the bonus outcome.
Clawback and 
malus will apply  
to the cash bonus 
and deferred 
shares where 
there has been  
a misstatement  
of the accounts, 
or other data,  
or a serious 
misdemeanour  
or serious 
misconduct by 
the participant 
has occurred prior 
to payment or 
vesting or within 
two years of 
payment or 
vesting of shares.
Performance Restricted Share Plan (‘PRSP’)
To incentivise 
delivery of sustained 
growth through 
superior long-term 
performance, 
provide an element 
of retention and 
increase alignment 
with shareholders.
Discretionary annual award of nominal  
cost options. 
Vested options are exercisable immediately 
following confirmation of performance.
At the discretion of the Committee vested 
options attract Dividend Accrued Shares 
between award and vesting.
Under the rules of the PRSP, conditional 
share awards may also be granted  
although there is currently no plan  
to grant such awards.
Non-pensionable.
The normal maximum annual award  
of nominal cost options is 200% of  
base salary.
The maximum award may be increased  
in line with the plan rules to 250% of  
base salary. Any increase to the normal 
maximum award of 200% of base salary, 
other than in exceptional circumstances 
such as recruitment, would also be 
subject to prior consultation with  
leading investors.
Performance condition is measured over  
three financial years.
The current performance condition includes 
EPS growth and total shareholder return  
(TSR) relative to a peer group of comparator 
companies.
For each element, 25% of the award will  
vest for threshold performance. 100% of the 
award will vest for maximum performance. 
Straight-line vesting applies between threshold 
and maximum.
The Committee has the flexibility to vary the 
mix of measures or to introduce new measures. 
The Committee will consult with leading 
investors before implementing any change.
The Committee may alter the vesting outcome  
if it considers that the level of vesting is 
inconsistent with the Company’s overall 
performance taking account of any factors it 
considers relevant. This will help ensure that 
vesting reflects overall Company performance 
during the period. The Committee will consult 
with leading investors before any exercise of  
its discretion to increase the vesting outcome.
Clawback and 
malus applies on 
the same basis as 
the annual bonus.

Element Notes
Annual Performance  
Bonus 
The main emphasis of the annual plan is to reward management for the achievement of financial targets such as profit growth, which is a key indicator of the 
Company’s performance. 
Non-financial measures are intended to measure whether management are delivering against key lead performance indicators.
Targets are determined annually by the Committee.
All salaried employees participate in a bonus scheme. Save for certain operational and operational support roles where some, or all, of the annual bonus relates 
directly to the performance of the business or area for which the participant is responsible, a common annual bonus target applies across all participating employees.
Retail staff do not participate in any bonus scheme.
PRSP Senior employees, including Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, participate in the PRSP . No long-term incentive plans apply for  
any other employees.
Measures for Executive Directors include:
 • EPS
1
 growth which is a measure of overall profitability of the business for investors over the long term and therefore is a fundamental element of aligning 
shareholders’ interests with those of executives.
 • Relative TSR performance which provides a measure of long-term success of the Company relative to an appropriate group of peer comparators.
From 2015 onwards EPS
1
 will be the only measure for participants below Executive Committee level.

appointed on or after 30 September 2012, or to retail staff.
Health check A Company funded health check is available on request to senior and middle management retail support employees. Other salaried employees have access  
to online health and wellbeing support through the Company’s Employee Assistance Programme (’EAP’).

to retail staff.
Pension The Company contribution to the DC Choice pension plan is between 4.5% and 15% of base salary; assistant management and retail staff employees who  
are not eligible for the DC Choice pension plan receive a Company contribution of either 1x the member contribution up to 3% of Qualifying Earnings* 
(assistant management scheme) or the statutory minimum (automatic enrolment scheme).

Relocation Relocation may be made available to Retail Support Centre employees where the Company requires an employee to relocate for business purposes. 
Relocation is not normally provided to retail management or retail staff.

scheme is not considered to be a benefit in kind for tax purposes.
Other benefits Other benefits such as childcare vouchers, bike to work and private dental cover are not listed above as a taxable benefit to the Executive Directors. Where an 
Executive Director participates, he does so at his own cost as the benefit is administered by, but not funded by, the Company. NICwise, a National Insurance 
efficient way for a member to make contributions to the pension plan, is provided at no cost to the employee or Company, The range of benefits offered to 
Executive Directors is offered to all senior management employees of the Group.

For the avoidance of doubt, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors before 
the current legislation on remuneration policies came into force or before an individual became a Director (such as the payment outstanding  
on incentive awards) even where it is not consistent with the policy prevailing at the time such commitment is fulfilled.
Incentive plan discretions
The Committee will operate the incentive plans described in the policy table according to their respective rules, the policy set out above  
and in accordance with the Listing Rules, applicable legislation and HMRC guidance where relevant. The Committee, consistent with market  
practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of these plans. These include (but are not  
limited to) the following:
 • who participates in the plans;
 • the timing of grant of award and/or payment;
 • the size of award and/or payment, subject to policy limits;
 • the choice of (and adjustment of) performance measures and targets for each incentive plan in accordance with the policy set out above  
and the rules of each plan;
 • discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction;
 • determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and  
the appropriate treatment under the plan rules; and
 • adjustments required in certain circumstances (eg rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and special dividends).
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may, as appropriate,  
be the subject of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.

Report on Directors’ remuneration
continued Illustrations of application of remuneration policy
A key principle of the Group’s remuneration policy is that variable short and long-term reward should be linked to the financial performance of the 
Group. The charts below show the composition of the new CEO’s and the Finance Director’s remuneration at minimum, on-target and maximum 
levels of performance in FY 2016.
The performance scenarios demonstrate the proportion of maximum remuneration which would be payable in respect of each remuneration 
element at each of the performance levels. In developing these scenarios the following assumptions have been made:
Minimum
Only the fixed elements of remuneration are payable. The fixed element consists of base salary, benefits and pension. Base salary is the salary 
effective at 1 January 2016. Benefits are based on actual FY 2015 figures and include company car, healthcare and taxable expenses. Pension is  
the cash allowance and/or Company pension contribution payable in respect of base salary from 1 January 2016. 
On-target 
In addition to the minimum, this reflects the amount payable for on-target performance under the short and long-term incentive plans:
 • 42.5% of base salary is payable under the short-term incentive plan; and 
 • 25% of the award (50% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 35% of base salary for the Finance Director) is payable under the long-term 
incentive plan.
Maximum
In addition to the minimum, maximum payment is achieved under both the short and long-term incentive plans such that: 
 • 100% of base salary is payable under the short-term incentive plan; and 
 • 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 140% of base salary for the Finance Director is payable under the long-term incentive plan.
A breakdown of the elements included in the application of remuneration policy to the remuneration charts is shown in the table below:
Fixed (£000) Short-term plan (£000) Long-term plan (£000)
Base Pay Benefits Pension Total Fixed On-target Maximum On-target Maximum
Chief Executive 510 18 90 618 217 510 255 1,020
Finance Director 426.5 17 75 518.5 181.3 426.5 149.3 597. 1
Note: The value received under the short-term plan is the gross value of awards before 50% is deferred into shares. The values received under the short-term plan and long-term 
incentive plan do not take into account dividend accrued shares that are payable on the vesting of awards nor any changes in share price.

Executive Directors’ contracts
The table below summarises key elements of the service contracts applicable to Executive Directors:
Notice period • Executive Directors are employed under service contracts that may be terminated by the Company at any time on one year’s notice.
 • Any payment made in lieu of notice would comprise base salary only
a
 and may be payable in instalments in line with the established salary payment dates until 
the expiry of the notice period or, if earlier, the date on which alternative employment or other engagement is secured with the same or higher base salary. If 
employment is secured at a lower rate of base salary, subsequent instalments of the payment in lieu of notice shall be reduced by the value of alternative income.
 • Service contracts contain a provision enabling the Company to put the Executive Director on garden leave after notice to terminate the service contract has been 
given by either party. During this period, the Executive will be entitled to base salary only.
Termination • If an Executive Director’s employment with the Group ends during the financial year, normally any entitlement to bonus for that year is forfeited. However, if  
the individual leaves by reason of ill-health, injury, disability, retirement, redundancy, death or sale of his employing business or company or if the Committee  
so decides in any other case, at the Committee’s discretion the Executive Director may receive a bonus pro-rated to time employed in the year or to such later 
date as the Committee may decide. The Committee may decide, at its discretion, to pay the bonus all in cash.
 • If an Executive Director ceases employment following the end of the financial year but before payment of the bonus in respect of that year, there is no 
entitlement to a bonus but the Committee may, at its discretion, pay a bonus for that year. Any such bonus, at the Committee’s discretion, may be all in cash.
 • If an Executive Director ceases employment prior to the release of Bonus Award Shares under the STDIP for the same specified good leaver reasons as set out 
above, the Committee, at its discretion, may release the Bonus Award Shares (and associated Dividend Accrued Shares) at the date of termination. Otherwise, 
the shares will be released on the normal release date. If the Director leaves for any other reason, his entitlement to Bonus Award Shares (and associated 
Dividend Accrued Shares) is forfeited, unless the Committee decides otherwise.
 • If an Executive Director dies before an Award under the PRSP has vested, vesting of the award (and associated Dividend Accrued Shares) will occur as soon  
as practicable based on performance and on a time pro-rated basis.
 • If the Executive Director ceases employment for the same defined good leaver reasons as are specified above, the Award (and associated Dividend Accrued 
Shares) will vest following the end of the normal performance period and on a time pro-rated basis. If employment ceases for any other reason, the Award will 
normally lapse, unless the Committee decides otherwise (except that if employment ceases by reason of gross misconduct the Award (and associated Dividend 
Accrued Shares) must lapse).
 • The Committee has no discretion in relation to shares or options held under the all-employee share plans (SIP and Sharesave); on termination these will vest, 
become exercisable or lapse in accordance with the legislation governing tax favoured plans.
a.  This arrangement applied to Alistair Darby and applies to Phil Urban. Any payments in lieu of notice in respect of Tim Jones, whose appointment and service contract pre-dates 
27 June 2012 (the relevant date for the purposes of the regulations) and does not fall within the current policy, will comprise base salary and contractual benefits only.
In the event that the Company terminates an Executive Director’s service contract other than in accordance with the terms of his contract, the 
Committee will act in the best interests of the Company, and ensure there is no reward for failure. When determining what compensation, if any,  
is to be paid to the departing Executive Director, the Committee will give full consideration to the circumstances of the termination, the Executive 
Director’s performance, the terms of the service contract relating to notice and payments in lieu of notice, and the obligation of that Executive 
Director to mitigate any loss which he may suffer as a result. 
Although the Company would seek to minimise termination costs, the Committee may in appropriate circumstances provide other elements in a 
leaving Director’s termination package, including (without limitation): compensation for the waiver of statutory rights in exchange for the Director 
executing a settlement agreement; payment of the leaving Director’s legal fees in connection with his termination arrangements; and payment of 
outplacement fees. In addition, the Committee may determine that the Director should continue to be engaged by the Company on consultancy

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Report on Directors’ remuneration
continued  Executive Directors may accept one external Non-Executive 
appointment with the Company’s prior approval, as long as this is not 
likely to lead to conflicts of interest. Fees received may be retained by 
the Executive Director. On 30 October 2014 Tim Jones was appointed 
as an independent Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the Audit 
and Risk Committee of Poundland Group plc. No other Non-Executive 
appointments applied in the year to 26 September 2015.
Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors, including the Company Chairman, do  
not have service contracts but serve under letters of appointment 
which provide that they are initially appointed until the next AGM  
when they are required to stand for election. In line with the Company’s 
Articles, all Directors, including Non-Executive Directors, will  
stand for re-election at the 2016 AGM. This is also in line with  
the recommendations set out in paragraph B.7 .1 of the Code.  
Non-Executive Directors’ appointments are terminable without  
notice and with no entitlement to compensation. Payment of fees will  
cease immediately on termination. The dates of appointment of the 
Non-Executive Directors to the Committee are set out on page 62.
Douglas McMahon and Ron Robson were appointed to the Board 
pursuant to the terms of the Piedmont Deed of Appointment, 
information on which is set out on pages 38 and 39. On 13 November 
2015 Douglas McMahon stepped down from the Board and Josh Levy  
was appointed as his replacement Piedmont representative.
Copies of both the individual letters of appointment for Non-Executive 
Directors, and the service contracts for Executive Directors are 
available at the Registered Office of the Company during normal 
business hours and on our website. Copies will also be available  
to shareholders to view at the 2016 AGM.
Recruitment of Executive Directors
Where it is necessary to appoint a replacement or additional Executive 
Director, the Committee will set a base salary appropriate to the 
experience and responsibilities of the new appointee and in line  
with our policy set out on page 55.
The maximum level of variable pay is 400% of base salary (150% in 
relation to annual cash bonus/STDIP and 250% in relation to the PRSP). 
Depending on the timing and responsibilities of the appointment  
it may be necessary to set different annual bonus/STDIP performance 
measures and targets as applicable to other Executive Directors.
Benefits (including pension, Company vehicle or cash allowance, 
healthcare, life assurance, health check and, where applicable, 
relocation assistance) would be consistent with the principles of  
the policy as set out on page 56.
For an internal appointment, his or her existing pension arrangements 
may continue to operate (which may include participation as an 
employee deferred member in the defined benefit plan, which is  
closed to future accrual) and any existing awards would continue  
over their original vesting period and remain subject to their terms  
as at the date of grant.
In the event that a buyout award is necessary to secure the services  
of an Executive Director then the structure of the award will mirror, as 
far as is possible, the arrangements in place at the incoming Executive 
Director’s previous employer, and may include cash and/or an award  
of shares. Any share awards made outside of the Company’s existing 
plans may have no or different performance conditions or a shorter 
vesting period compared to the Company’s existing plans. Shareholders 
will be informed of any buyout arrangements at the time of the 
Executive Director’s appointment. 
Recruitment of Non-Executive Directors
Chairman 
The Committee will recommend to the Board a fee appropriate to  
the experience and responsibilities of the new appointee.
Other Non-Executive Directors
The fee will be set in line with the fee structure for Non-Executive 
Directors in place at the date of appointment.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee is regularly updated throughout the year on pay and 
conditions applying to Group employees. Where significant changes 
are proposed to employment conditions elsewhere in the Group these 
are highlighted for the attention of the Committee at an early stage.  
The Committee is informed of the base pay review budget applicable to 
other employees and is cognisant of changes to the National Minimum 
Wage when considering the pay of Executive Directors. Hourly paid 
employees received an average pay increase of 2.5% with effect from 
27 September 2015. During 2015 the Board considered in detail the 
impact of the introduction of the NLW, and in particular how the 
introduction of the NLW will impact on the ability to retain and recruit 
employees of all ages across all retail job roles.
Employees are not specifically consulted on Executive Remuneration. 
All employees are, however, invited to take part in our annual Your Say 
employee engagement survey in which they have an opportunity to 
provide anonymous feedback on a wide range of topics of interest or 
concern to them. The results of the survey are reviewed by the Board; 
any significant concerns over remuneration would be considered 
separately by the Committee and, if appropriate, taken into account 
when determining the remuneration policy.
Consideration of shareholder views
This policy was set following consultation with major shareholders and 
investor groups in 2014. Major shareholders and their representative 
bodies will continue to be consulted where material changes to the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration policy are being considered.

Advice to the Committee 
During the year, the Committee continued to receive advice from

in respect of remuneration advice in the reporting year totalled 
£62,719

. Neither NBS nor Aon Plc provide any other services to  
the Group.
Advice was also received from the Company’s legal advisers, 
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP , on the operation of the Company’s 
employee share schemes and on corporate governance matters. 
Eversheds LLP also provided advice in relation to pension schemes.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received from its advisers 
was objective and independent. 
The Committee determines the policy and individual remuneration 
package for each Executive Director and the Company Chairman.  
In addition, the Committee makes recommendations to the Board on 
any new long-term incentive plans, but such plans are approved by  
the Board as a whole and, where necessary, by shareholders. 
 
Members of management including Susan Martindale, the Group  
HR Director and Craig Provett, the Director of Compensation & 
Benefits, are invited to attend meetings on remuneration matters where 
appropriate. They are not present when matters affecting their own 
remuneration arrangements are decided. The Company Chairman 
does not attend Board or Committee meetings when his remuneration 
is under review. Alistair Darby and Tim Jones were present at meetings 
where the Company’s long and short-term incentive arrangements and 
share schemes were discussed. However, each declared an interest in 
the matters under review.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Governance  34–69 Financial statements  70–115 Shareholder  information  116 Strategic report  2–33 Annual performance bonus and STDIP 
The annual bonus and STDIP operate as set out in the policy section of this report. For FY 2015, 75% was based on PBT
1
 and 25% was based on 
Guest Service (measured by the Company’s NPS). 
The Group delivered PBT
1
 of £184m, a year-on-year increase of £12m, and 94.4% of target performance. As a result no bonus is due in respect  
of the PBT measure. 
NPS scores increased by 2% over the year, and scores are now at their highest ever level at 65%. However, as the threshold level of financial 
performance has not been achieved, no award under this element has been made. 
No bonus awards have been made to Executive Directors in FY 2015.
Long-term incentives vesting during the year
During FY 2013 awards were made to Alistair Darby and Tim Jones under the terms of the PRSP to the value of 200% and 140% of their respective 
base salaries. The performance condition has two independent elements, compound annual adjusted EPS growth and TSR performance against  
a group of peer companies, measured over a three year performance period ending 26 September 2015. 
The table below summarises performance against each element of the performance condition.
2013-2015 PRSP – performance conditions Target Actual % vesting
Total Shareholder Return relative to peer group* Median to median x 1.35 Below median Nil
Compound annual adjusted EPS growth 8%-16% CAGR 9.38% 37.9%
*  Enterprise Inns, Punch Taverns, Fuller Smith & Turner, Greene King, Marston’s, Whitbread, J D Wetherspoon, Spirit Pub Company and The Restaurant Group.
From 2014 the reported adjusted EPS figure was affected by revisions to IAS 19 and as a result the net pensions finance charge is now deducted 
from underlying profit. As this charge is not controllable by management, and can be significantly affected by the bond-market derived discount 
rate and triennial pensions valuation, the Committee has determined that the most appropriate and fair approach is to remove the impact of IAS 19 
from the base and end EPS
1
 year in respect of this and future PRSP cycles to ensure a like-for-like comparison. This approach has not changed  
the performance required to achieve vesting. The table below sets out in detail how this decision has affected the vesting outcome of the 
2013-2015 award:
EPS (p)
Reported 2012 EPS (excludes IAS 19 charge) 29.8
Reported 2015 EPS (includes IAS 19 charge) 35.7
IAS 19 Impact 3.3
Revised 2015 EPS for vesting (excludes IAS 19 charge) 39.0
As a result of adding back the IAS 19 charge to the 2015 EPS
1
 figure, the base and end years have been calculated on a consistent basis. Compound 
annual growth over the period was 9.38% resulting in 37 .9% of this element vesting. Overall 19% of the 2013-2015 PRSP will vest. The Remuneration 
Committee considers that this level of vesting is representative of the Company’s overall performance over the three year period and has also taken 
into account other performance factors and key performance indicators as part of this assessment. For example, over the PRSP performance period 
staff turnover has reduced, NPS is at its highest level and investment returns have improved. In addition, the business has made good progress in 
enhancing its infrastructure and has completed the acquisition and integration of Orchid. 
Alistair Darby will receive 58,216 shares and Tim Jones will receive 32,185 shares on 25 November 2015.
Payment for loss of office
Alistair Darby stepped down as Chief Executive and resigned from the Company on 26 September 2015. The Company was required to give 
Alistair Darby 52 weeks’ notice under the terms of his contract. After careful consideration the Board determined it would not be in the best 
interests of the business for Alistair to work his contractual notice period, and therefore agreed to make a payment in lieu of notice of 52 weeks’ 
basic salary. This will be paid in thirteen instalments, but each instalment will be reduced (potentially to nil) in the event that Alistair commences 
another role before 26 September 2016. 
The Committee has agreed that Alistair should be treated as a good leaver for the purposes of incentive awards in recognition of his contribution 
to the business. However, since the performance targets for the FY 2015 annual bonus were not achieved, no bonus is due to him. The following 
applies for his outstanding share awards:
 • The 2013 Deferred shares will be released in December 2015 in line with the normal cycle.
 • PRSP awards will be pro-rated for service and will vest subject to performance. The 2013 award will vest in November 2015 at the normal time 
at 19%. The Committee anticipates that the 2014 award will see little, if any, vesting, based on projected performance. 
 • The 2014 SAYE and Free Share element of the all employee SIP have lapsed.

Mitchells & Butlers plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Report on Directors’ remuneration
continued The Company will make a contribution towards his legal fees in connection with these arrangements of up to £2,000 plus VAT.
These arrangements are all in accordance with the approved remuneration policy and were fully disclosed at the time Alistair Darby’s leaving  
was announced to the London Stock Exchange. 
Long-term incentive awards made in FY 2015 
An award was made in accordance with the rules of the Performance Restricted Share Plan (‘PRSP’) and as set out in the policy section of this report.
The independent elements of the performance measure for the November 2014 award, each of which accounts for 50% of the award, are 
summarised below:
Threshold vesting target* Maximum vesting target
1.  Compound annual adjusted Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) growth 
(measured before exceptional items and other adjustments,  
including IAS 19).
25% will vest if the compound  
annual EPS
1
 growth is 8%.
100% will vest if compound annual 
EPS
1
 growth is at least 16%.
2.  Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) relative to a peer group of  
comparator companies.**
25% will vest for TSR performance 
equivalent to the median of the 
comparator group.
100% will vest for TSR performance 
equivalent to the upper quartile of 
the comparator group.
The EPS and TSR conditions are measured over three years from the start of the financial year in which they are granted, ie the three financial 
years from 28 September 2014, ending in September 2017 .
The TSR element of the award is also subject to a share price underpin and awards may only be exercised where the Mitchells & Butlers share 
price has equalled or exceeded the share price at the date of award within six months of the vesting date. If this condition is not met, then the 
vested TSR element of the option will lapse.
*  Between threshold and maximum, vesting under each measure is on a straight-line basis. Below threshold the award will lapse.
**  Comprises the constituents of the FTSE All Share Travel & Leisure group as at the date of grant.
Performance measurement under the PRSP , which is not re-tested, is reviewed and certified by the Company’s auditor.

Mitchells & Butlers plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Report on Directors’ remuneration
continued Directors’ interests
Executive Directors are expected to hold Mitchells & Butlers’ shares in line with the shareholding guidelines set out in the Remuneration Policy report.
Based on the valuation methodology as set out in the shareholding policy, Alistair Darby’s shareholding was 75.9% (2014 63.8%) of his basic 
annual salary and Tim Jones’s shareholding was 39.3% (2014 23.4%) of his basic annual salary. 
The shareholding policy requires that Executive Directors accumulate Mitchells & Butlers shares to the value of a minimum of 100% of salary within  
five years of appointment to the Board (150% for the CEO). Tim Jones completed five years as an Executive Director on 18 October 2015. The 
Committee continues to pay close attention to Mr Jones’s shareholding and will take into account the number of shares Mr Jones has purchased,

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Report on Directors’ remuneration
continued The level of bonus paid to salaried employees in 2015 has fallen by 13% in the year, reflecting business performance, and in particular a fall in  
the number of individual businesses that achieved their bonus targets. 
Salaried employees with part-year service in either FY 2014 or FY 2015 have been excluded from the comparison figures. Retail staff employees 
have been excluded from the comparator group as they are hourly paid, largely part time and do not participate in any bonus plans. The CEO 
figures do not include LTIP awards or pension benefits as disclosed in the single figure table.
Figures shown for wages and salaries consist of all earnings, including bonus. In FY 2015 £1.58m (0.29%) was paid to Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors (2014 £1.54m (0.3%)). 
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in Financial Year 2016 
Executive Directors’ Salary Review
 • The Chief Executive’s salary was reviewed upon his appointment to the Board and will be £510,000 for FY 2016. 
 • No salary increases will apply for the Finance Director; salaries are next due to be reviewed in January 2017 .
Annual performance bonus
The Committee has reviewed the performance measures and the following changes will take effect for FY 2016:
 • The bonus for 2016 will continue to be based 75% on profit and 25% on Guest Service but, for 2016, it is proposed that the financial metric  
will be Operating Profit
1
, replacing PBT. The Committee believes that Operating Profit
1
 is a better measure of trading performance and is a  
key headline figure used in the annual and half year reports. 
 • The Committee will continue to set demanding targets for both Operating Profit
1
 and Guest Service. The Committee will set a threshold  
target at which point bonus will begin to accrue, with 42.5% of salary payable at Target and full pay-out at Stretch performance. The earnings 
opportunity at on-target is slightly lower than 2015 (50% of salary). Maximum opportunity remains at 100% of base salary.
 • There will be no payout on the NPS element if profit is below a pre-determined threshold, which for FY 2016 is 98% of target operating profit.  
If this is achieved, the threshold level of payout will be 6.25%.
Operating profit
1
 and NPS targets are considered to be commercially sensitive and will not be disclosed in advance. However, retrospective 
disclosure of targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s Directors’ remuneration report.
Long Term Incentive Plans
 • The Committee has decided to delay the grant of PRSP awards covering the 2016-18 performance period. This delay will allow the  
Committee further time to consider the structure of the PRSP performance condition, within the constraints of the agreed remuneration policy, 
to ensure that the measures and targets remain appropriate. Irrespective of the outcome of this review it is the intention that TSR will remain as 
a measure, accounting for at least 50% of any award and retaining the current comparator group. If significant changes to the current 
performance measures or targets are proposed then leading shareholders and shareholder representative bodies will be consulted  
prior to any awards being granted.
Non-Executive Directors’ fee review
 • The fee applicable to the Chairman will remain at £285,000. Non-Executive Directors’ fees also will remain unchanged.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Valuation of the pub estate
As set out in note 3.1 the value of the pub estate is £4,242m. 
Freehold and long leasehold
The accounting policy adopted and judgements used are described in section 3.1  
to the financial statements.
This is considered to be a significant risk due to the judgements inherent within the 
valuation exercise. The total value of revalued properties as at 26 September 2015 is  
£3,842m. The revaluation exercise performed in the year has resulted in a net decrease  
in book value of £29m which includes an impairment charge of £54m recognised in the 
income statement. The Group’s accounting policy sets out that the market value is 
determined using factors such as estimated fair maintainable trading levels and comparable 
market transactions. An estimated multiple is derived for each of the Group’s trading 
brands, which is then applied to the fair maintainable trade. In specific circumstances 
where this approach does not fairly represent the underlying value of the property,  
a spot valuation is applied. 
Short leasehold
The accounting policy adopted and judgements used are described in section 3.1  
and 3.3 to the financial statements. The total value of short leasehold properties as at 
26 September 2015 is £182m (2014 £174m). Judgements in relation to expected trading 
levels, turnaround period for underperforming sites and discount rates are applied when 
calculating short leasehold property impairments. The Group recorded an impairment 
charge of £11.5m in the year.
We worked with our property valuation specialists and management’s external advisers 
to challenge the methodology and underlying assumptions used in the pub estate 
valuation. This included: 
 • assessing the appropriateness of minor changes to assumptions since the prior year, 
specifically the value assigned to fixtures and fittings;
 • discussing the valuation process with management’s external advisers;
 • obtaining evidence to support inputs to the model, including benchmarking valuations 
to comparable market transactions, in order to confirm whether the multiples being 
proposed were appropriate; 
 • reviewing the future projected income, by comparing both revenues and costs to 
available post conversion results; and 
 • challenging the supporting rationale for a sample of spot valuations and corroborating 
responses provided by management to external evidence where available.
Additionally we: 
 • tested the design and implementation of controls in relation to the  
revaluation exercise;
 • compared the estimated fair maintainable trading levels to historical trading results  
for the last two years and investigated variances to determine if these were indicative  
of expected trading;
 • tested the integrity of the data used in the valuations by agreeing a sample to  
source data; and
 • assessed the competence, independence and integrity of management’s  
external advisers.
We challenged the assumptions used by management within the short leasehold 
impairment review. This included testing the integrity of the information used  
within the model by agreeing inputs back to source data including historical results  
and lease terms, and assessing the appropriateness of the discount rate through 
recalculation and performing sensitivity analysis. 
Opinion on financial statements of Mitchells & Butlers plc
In our opinion:
 • the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 26 September 2015 and of the 
Group’s and the Company’s profit for the 52 week period then ended;
 • the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union;
 • the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and
 • the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise of the Group income statement, the 
Group statement of comprehensive income, the Group and Company 
balance sheets, the Group cash flow statement, the Group statement  
of changes in equity and the related sections 1 to 5 on the Group financial 
statements, and the related notes 1 to 10 on the Company financial 
statements. The financial reporting framework that has been applied  
in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law  
and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Company 
financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ 
statement contained on page 38 that the Group is a going concern.  
We confirm that:
 • we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern 
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements  
is appropriate; and
 • we have not identified any material uncertainties that may  
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a  
going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
Independence
We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we are independent 
of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities  
in accordance with those standards. We also confirm we have not 
provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in  
those standards.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below,  
which are the same risks identified in the prior year, are those  
that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation  
of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the  
engagement team:

Orchid acquisition accounting
The accounting policy adopted and judgements used are described in section 3.5 to the 
financial statements.
The Group acquired 173 pubs from the Orchid Group in July 2014 for consideration of 
£270m. Provisional fair values were reported in the prior year. As permitted by IFRS 3 
management has finalised their acquisition accounting within the measurement period, 
resulting in a £5m reduction in property fair values to £265m and the recognition of a 
deferred tax asset of £12m. The principal assets acquired were freehold properties, a 
number of which had development potential. The acquisition accounting required the 
exercise of judgement to determine the appropriate fair values of the assets and liabilities 
including the assessment of the fair value of properties and the ability to access future  
tax losses. 
We assessed management’s approach in performing a detailed analysis attributing  
values to each site based on an assessment of the future trading format for that site.  
This included challenging management’s assumption in respect of the proposed trading 
formats, multiples and the use of projected cash flows when assessing Orchid sites with 
development potential. 
We also assessed the appropriateness and completeness of other potential fair value 
adjustments including any goodwill and intangible assets recognised and engaged our  
tax specialists to assess the availability of tax losses. 
Tax provisions and recognition of tax losses
The accounting policy adopted and judgements used are described in section 2.4 to the 
financial statements. This section describes the level of judgement exercised in valuing tax 
provisions recorded in respect of a number of uncertain tax positions, including the likely 
outcome of negotiations with and enquiries from tax authorities.
The Group also exercises judgement in determining the level of future taxable income to 
support the recognition of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets for losses of £24m 
(2014 £25m) have been recognised in the year. In reaching the conclusion that these assets 
should be recognised management has assessed the probability that the losses will be 
available and that future taxable profits will be generated to utilise these losses.
We utilised our tax specialists to appraise the likely outcome of technical tax treatments 
and review correspondence with the tax authorities to assess the reasonableness of the 
provisions made.
We have challenged the assumptions made by management in respect of the deferred tax 
asset recognised, including making an assessment of the likely time period over which any 
asset recognised would be recovered. This included a review of whether recognition of 
losses is appropriate and future forecasts of taxable profits are achievable.
Accounting for defined benefit schemes
The accounting policy adopted and judgements used are described in section 4.5 to the 
financial statements. The total pension liability has decreased from £425m at 27 September 
2014 to £350m at 26 September 2015.
The actuarial assumptions used in the measurement of the Group’s net pension liability are 
inherently judgemental, such as the discount rate and inflation. In May 2014 the Company 
entered into a formal recovery plan to increase contributions to the pension scheme for the 
10 year period to 2023. Included within the total pension liability above is a liability of 
£248m (2014 £232m) to reflect the commitment to making these contributions in line  
with the minimum funding requirements. 
We used our actuarial specialists to test the actuarial assumptions used to calculating  
the net pension deficit. This included an assessment of the key assumptions described  
in section 4.5 of the financial statements to comparable market data. We recalculated  
the additional liability recognised in respect of the minimum funding requirement  
by discounting the cash flows which we agreed to the Group’s approved schedule  
of contributions.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the 
significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed on 
page 50.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to 
express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion  
on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the  
risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these 
individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial 
statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. 
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and  
in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £9.4m, which is 
approximately 5% of profit before tax and exceptional items being 
acquisition costs, movements in the valuation of the property portfolio 
and short leasehold impairment (2014 £9m, determined on the same 
basis). These items are excluded due to their volatility and this is 
consistent with the Group’s internal and external reporting to facilitate  
a better understanding of the underlying trading performance.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of £180,000 (2014 £180,000), 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee 
on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based  
on that assessment, we performed a full scope audit in respect of the  
UK retail operating business and UK property business together 
accounting for 100% of the Group’s total assets, 97% revenue and  
98% operating profit in 2015. This audit work was performed directly by 
the Group engagement team. In 2014 we performed a full scope audit  
in respect of the UK retail operating business, UK property business 
and the German business (‘ALEX’) representing 100% coverage of the 
Group’s total assets, revenue and operating profit. No issues were 
identified in the prior year audit in Germany, and no further matters 
were identified during our analytical procedures on ALEX in the current 
year, and therefore given the relative size of ALEX to the Group we 
consider the UK business provide sufficient audit assurance over the 
Group balances. Our audit work of the UK businesses was executed  
at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were 
lower than Group materiality and ranged from £0.4m to £7 .5m 
(2014 £0.4m to £6.5m). At the parent entity level we also tested  
the consolidation process.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Independent auditor’s report to the 
members of Mitchells & Butlers plc
continued Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies  
Act 2006
In our opinion:
 • the part of the Report on Directors’ remuneration to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
 • the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
 • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 • the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in  
our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not 
been made or the part of the Report on Directors’ remuneration to be 
audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of  
the corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance  
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we  
are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the  
Annual Report is:
 • materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
 • apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
 • otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified 
any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the  
audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual  
Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual 
Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated  
to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been 
disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement,  
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland).  
Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality  
control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our  
quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional 
standards review team and independent partner reviews.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them  
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for 
our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to  
the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness  
of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and  
the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in  
the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Mitchells & Butlers plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Group cash flow statement
For the 52 weeks ended 26 September 2015 General information
Mitchells & Butlers plc is a company incorporated in the United 
Kingdom under the Companies Act. 
Mitchells & Butlers plc, along with its subsidiaries (together ‘the Group’), 
is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The Group’s accounting reference date is 30 September. The Group 
draws up its financial statements to the Saturday directly before or 
following the accounting reference date, as permitted by section 390 
(3) of the Companies Act 2006. Both the periods ended 26 September 
2015 and 27 September 2014 include 52 trading weeks.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost 
basis as modified by the revaluation of properties, pension obligations 
and financial instruments.
The Group’s accounting policies have been applied consistently.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial 
statements of Mitchells & Butlers plc (‘the Company’) and entities 
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). The financial statements 
of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same financial reporting period 
as the Company. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies 
into line with those used by the Group. Intercompany transactions, 
balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between 
Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the period are included in 
the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition.
Restatement
On 15 June 2014 the Group acquired all of the issued share capital in 
Orchid Pubs & Dining Limited and Midco 1 Limited. At 27 September 
2014, a provisional fair valuation of the identifiable assets and liabilities 
was recorded. 
In accordance with IFRS 3, measurement period adjustments have  
now been made to provisional values which result in a restatement of 
the deferred tax asset acquired and the value of land and buildings.  
In addition, deferred consideration outstanding at 27 September 2014 
has also been finalised. The result of these changes reduces the 
provisional goodwill from £9m to £nil.
Further details are provided in note 3.5.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to  
affect its future development, performance and position are set out in 
the Strategic report and Business review on pages 2 to 33. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are also described within the Business review.
In addition, note 4.4 to the financial statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial 
risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.  
As highlighted in note 4.2 to the financial statements, the Group’s 
financing is based upon securitised debt. 
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements,  
a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates 
ruling on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional 
currency at the relevant rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the 
income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured at 
cost using the exchange rate on the date of the initial transaction.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds  
sterling (rounded to the nearest million), being the functional currency 
of the primary economic environment in which the parent and most 
subsidiaries operate. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the 
Group’s overseas operations are translated into sterling at the relevant 
rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The results of 
overseas operations are translated into sterling at average rates of 
exchange for the period. Exchange differences arising from the 
translation of the results and the retranslation of opening net assets 
denominated in foreign currencies are taken directly to the Group’s 
translation reserve. When an overseas operation is sold, such exchange 
differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain 
or loss on sale.
The results of overseas operations have been translated into sterling at 
the weighted average euro rate of exchange for the period of £1 = € 1.37 
(2014 £1 = €1.22), where this is a reasonable approximation to the rate  
at the dates of the transactions. Euro and US dollar denominated assets 
and liabilities have been translated at the relevant rate of exchange at  
the balance sheet date of £1 = € 1.36 (2014 £1 = €1.28) and £1 = $1.52  
(2014 £1 = $1.62) respectively.

Notes to the financial statements
Section 1 – Basis of preparation  Recent accounting developments
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) have issued the 
following standards and interpretations which have been adopted by 
the Group in these financial statements for the first time:
Accounting 
standard Requirement
Impact on financial 
statements
IFRS 10 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements
IFRS 10 replaces the parts of IAS 27 
Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements that deal with consolidated 
financial statements. IFRS 10 changes 
the definition of control over an 
investee such that control applies when 
an investor a) has power over the 
investee, b) is exposed, or has rights,  
to variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and c) has the ability 
to use its power to affect its returns.  
All three of these criteria must be met 
for an investor to have control over  
an investee. Previously, control was 
defined as the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an 
entity so as to obtain benefits from  
its activities.
The adoption of this 
standard has not resulted in 
a change in the assessment 
of control over each 
subsidiary in the Group and 
there is no impact on the 
financial statements.
IFRS 12 
Disclosure of 
Interests in 
Other Entities
IFRS 12 is a new disclosure standard 
and is applicable to entities that have 
interests in subsidiaries, joint 
arrangements and/or associates. 
As the Group only has 
interests in subsidiaries and 
there are no non-controlling 
interests there is no 
significant impact on the 
disclosures required.
Amendments  
to IAS 36 
Recoverable 
Amount 
Disclosures for 
Non-Financial 
Assets
The Group has adopted the 
amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable 
Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial 
Assets for the first time in the current 
period. The amendments to IAS 36 
remove the requirement to disclose  
the recoverable amount of a 
cash-generating unit (CGU) to which 
goodwill or other intangible assets  
with indefinite useful lives had been 
allocated when there has been no 
impairment or reversal of impairment  
of the related CGU. Furthermore, the 
amendments introduce additional 
disclosure requirements applicable to 
when the recoverable amount of an 
asset or a CGU is measured at fair  
value less costs of disposal.
These new disclosures 
include the fair value 
hierarchy, key assumptions 
and valuation techniques 
used which are in line  
with the disclosure required 
by IFRS 13 Fair Value 
Measurement. The 
application of these 
amendments has had  
no material impact on  
the disclosures provided  
in note 3.4.
Amendments to 
IAS 39 Novation 
of Derivatives 
and Continuation 
of Hedge 
Accounting
The Group has adopted the 
amendments to IAS 39 Novation of 
Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge 
Accounting for the first time in the 
current period. The amendments to IAS 
39 provide relief from the requirement 
to discontinue hedge accounting when 
a derivative designated as a hedging 
instrument is novated under certain 
circumstances. The amendments also 
clarify that any change to the fair value 
of the derivative designated as a 
hedging instrument arising from the 
novation should be included in the 
assessment and measurement of hedge 
effectiveness.
As the Group does not have 
any derivatives that are 
subject to novation, the 
adoption of these 
amendments has had no 
impact on the disclosures or 
on the amounts recognised 
in the Group’s consolidated 
financial statements.
Amendments to 
IAS 32 Offsetting 
Financial Assets 
and Financial 
Liabilities
The Group has adopted the 
amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
for the first time in the current period. 
The amendments to IAS 32 clarify the 
requirements relating to the offset of 
financial assets and financial liabilities. 
Specifically, the amendments clarify  
the meaning of ‘currently has a legally 
enforceable right of set-off’, and 
‘simultaneous realisation and 
settlement’.
The Group has assessed 
whether certain of its 
financial assets and financial 
liabilities qualify for offset 
based on the criteria set  
out in the amendments  
and concluded that the 
application of the 
amendments has had no 
impact on the amounts 
recognised in the Group’s 
consolidated financial 
statements.
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and 
interpretations which could impact the Group, with an effective date  
for financial periods beginning on or after the dates disclosed below:
Accounting standard Effective date
Amendments to IFRSs  
as part of the Annual 
Improvements to IFRSs 
2010 to 2012 Cycle issued

The Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010 to 2012 have 
made a number of amendments to IFRSs. The amendments 
that may impact on the Group are amendments to IFRS 2 
Share Based Payments, IFRS 3 Business Combinations, 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments, IFRS 13 Fair Value 
Measurement, IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 
24 Related Party Disclosures and IAS 38 Intangible Assets.

*  As the EU has not yet endorsed these standards, they have not been adopted by the 
Group in the current period.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed 
above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods. Beyond this, it is not practicable to provide  
a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in the 
application of accounting policies that affect reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expense.
Estimates and judgements are periodically evaluated and are based on 
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. Details of the Group’s 
critical accounting judgements and estimates are described within  
the accounting policy section in each of the notes to the financial 
statements listed below:
 • note 2.2 Exceptional items 
 • note 2.4 Taxation 
 • note 3.1 Property, plant and equipment
 • note 3.4 Goodwill 
 • note 3.5 Acquisitions
 • note 4.5 Pensions

Notes to the financial statements
Section 1 – Basis of preparation continued 2.1 Segmental analysis
Accounting policies
Revenue	recognition
Revenue is the fair value of goods and services sold to third parties as part of the Group’s trading activities, after deducting sales-based 
taxes, coupons and staff discounts.
The majority of revenue comprises food and beverages sold in the Group’s businesses. This revenue is recognised at the point of sale to  
the customer. Revenue arising from the sale of development property is recognised on legal completion of the sale. 
Operating	segments
IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be based on the Group’s internal reporting to its Chief Operating Decision 
Maker (CODM). The CODM is regarded as the Chief Executive together with other Board members. The CODM uses EBITDA and profit 
before interest and exceptional items (operating profit pre-exceptionals) as the key measures of the segment results. Group assets are 
reviewed as part of this process but are not presented on a segment basis.
The retail operating business operates all of the Group’s retail operating units and generates all of its external revenue. The property 
business holds the Group’s freehold and long leasehold property portfolio and derives all of its income from the internal rent levied against 
the Group’s retail operating units. The internal rent charge is eliminated at the total Group level.

Section 2 – Results for the year 2.2 Exceptional items 
Accounting policy
In addition to presenting information on an IFRS basis, the Group also presents adjusted profit and earnings per share information that 
excludes exceptional items, including the impact of related tax. This adjusted information is disclosed to allow a better understanding  
of the underlying trading performance of the Group and is consistent with the Group’s internal management reporting. 
Exceptional items are those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or incidence and include movements in the valuation  
of the property portfolio as a result of the annual revaluation exercise, impairment review of short leasehold and unlicensed properties  
and restructuring costs. 
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
Judgement is used to determine those items which should be separately disclosed to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading 
performance of the Group. This judgement includes assessment of whether an item is of sufficient size or of a nature that is not consistent 
with normal trading activities.
The items identified in the current period are as follows:

2.3 Operating costs
Accounting policies
Operating	profit
Operating profit is stated after charging operating exceptional costs but before investment income and finance costs.
Supplier	incentives
Supplier incentives and rebates are recognised within operating costs as they are earned. The accrued value at the reporting date is included 
in other receivables.
Operating	leases
Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments 
made under operating leases and sub-leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.  
Lease incentives are recognised as a liability and a subsequent reduction in the rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Premiums paid on acquiring a new lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Such premiums are classified in the balance 
sheet as current or non-current prepayments, with the current portion being the element which relates to the following period.
The Group’s policy is to account for land held under both long and short leasehold contracts as operating leases, since it has no expectation 
that title will pass on expiry of the lease contracts.

Lease commitments
The vast majority of the Group’s leases are industry standard UK pub or commercial property leases which provide for periodic rent reviews to 
open market value and enjoy statutory rights to renewal on expiry. Generally they do not contain conditions relating to rent escalation, rights to 
purchase, concessions, residual values or other material provisions of an unusual nature.

2.4 Taxation
Accounting policy
The income tax expense represents both the income tax payable, based on profits for the period, and deferred tax and is calculated  
using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense which are not taxable. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except 
when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the income tax is also charged or credited to equity.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amount of their tax bases. Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments 
in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation  
or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities. 
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment 
cannot be finally determined until a resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority. The Group therefore recognises estimated 
liabilities for actual and anticipated enquiries from tax authorities. Amounts are accrued based on management’s interpretation of specific 
tax law and the likelihood of settlement, which requires a degree of judgement.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. Recognition of deferred tax assets, therefore, includes judgements regarding the timing and level of future taxable income.

Unrecognised tax losses and tax allowances
At the balance sheet date the Group had unused tax allowances of £52m (2014 £47m) and unused losses of £nil (2014 £13m) available for offset 
against future profits. 
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on tax allowances with a value of £10m (2014 £9m) and tax losses with a value of £nil (2014 £4m) 
because it is not certain that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise these benefits. These tax credits can be 
carried forward indefinitely.
Factors which may affect future tax charges
It was announced in the 2015 Summer Budget that the main rate of corporation tax would be reduced by 1% to 19% on 1 April 2017 and by a 
further 1% to 18% on 1 April 2020. Neither of these changes had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore the effects 
are not included in these financial statements.
The reduction in the main rate of corporation tax is likely to result in a reduction in future years in the net deferred tax liability provided at the 
balance sheet date. The full impact of these changes has not yet been quantified.
2.5 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) has been calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the period by the weighted average number of ordinary  
shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held by employee share trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential  
ordinary shares.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share amounts are presented before exceptional items (see note 2.2) in order to allow a better understanding  
of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

Notes to the financial statements 
Section 2 – Results for the year continued 3.1 Property, plant and equipment 
Accounting policies
Property,	plant	and	equipment
The majority of the Group’s freehold and long leasehold licensed properties are re-valued annually and are therefore held at fair value  
less depreciation. Short leasehold properties, unlicensed properties and fixtures, fittings and equipment are held at cost less depreciation 
and impairment. 
Non-current assets held for sale are held at their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell where this is lower. 
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis to write off the cost less residual value over the estimated useful  
lives of items of property, plant and equipment and is commenced when an asset is ready for its intended use. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. 
Freehold and long leasehold properties are depreciated so that the difference between their carrying value and estimated residual value  
is written off over 50 years from the date of acquisition. The residual value of freehold and long leasehold properties is reviewed annually. 
Leasehold properties are depreciated over the unexpired term of the lease where this is less than 50 years. 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment have the following estimated useful lives:
Information technology equipment: 3 to 7 years
Fixtures and fittings:  3 to 20 years
Expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed each year and adjusted if appropriate.
Disposals
Profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal. 
Revaluation
The revaluation utilises valuation multiples, which are determined via third-party inspection of 20% of the sites such that all sites are 
individually valued approximately every five years; and estimates of fair maintainable trade. Surpluses which arise from the revaluation 
exercise are included within other comprehensive income (in the revaluation reserve) unless they are reversing a revaluation adjustment 
which has been recognised in the income statement previously; in which case an amount equal to a maximum of that recognised in the 
income statement previously is recognised in income. Where the revaluation exercise gives rise to a deficit, this is reflected directly within 
the income statement, unless it is reversing a previous revaluation surplus against the same asset; in which case an amount equal to the 
maximum of the revaluation surplus is recognised within other comprehensive income (in the revaluation reserve). 
Impairment
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment which are not re-valued to fair market value are reviewed on an outlet basis for impairment  
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the 
carrying amount of an outlet exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an outlet’s fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, 
but only so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss 
been recognised for the asset in prior periods. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. An impairment reversal is  
only recognised where there is a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amounts, not where it results from the passage of time.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The revaluation includes a significant judgement in respect of valuation multiples, which are determined via third-party inspections.  
An estimate of fair maintainable trade and the resale value of tenant’s fixtures and fittings is also required in determining final site valuations. 
Determining fair maintainable trade requires judgements to be made in respect of future projected income levels.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment which are not re-valued to fair market value are reviewed for impairment if events  
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recovered. When a review for impairment is conducted, the 
recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations require management judgement around the 
selection of a suitable discount rate. Value in use calculations also require management to estimate both future cash flows, via the  
application of growth assumptions, and future maintenance capital expenditure.
Depreciation and amortisation is provided so as to write down the assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives. The selection 
of these residual values and estimated lives requires the exercise of management judgement.

a.  Includes assets which are fully depreciated and have been removed from the fixed asset register.
b.  The impact of the property revaluation is a net book value decrease of £29m (2014 increase of £37m) comprising an impairment of £54m (2014 £25m) net of a revaluation reserve 
credit of £25m (2014 £62m) shown in the Group statement of comprehensive income. In addition, a review of the short leasehold and unlicensed property estate has resulted in  
an impairment of £11m (2014 £11m) (see note 2.2).
Certain assets with a net book value of £40m (2014 £39m) owned by the Group are subject to a fixed charge in respect of liabilities held by the 
Mitchells & Butlers Executive Top-Up Scheme (MABETUS).
Cost at 26 September 2015 includes £9m (2014 £4m) of assets in the course of construction.
 
Revaluation/impairment
The freehold and long leasehold properties have been valued at market value, as at 26 September 2015 using information provided by CBRE, 
independent chartered surveyors. The valuation was carried out in accordance with the provisions of RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards 
(‘The Red Book’) assuming each asset is sold as part of the continuing enterprise in occupation individually as a fully operational trading entity. 
The market value has been determined having regard to factors such as current and future projected income levels, taking account of location, 
quality of the pub restaurant and recent market transactions in the sector. Changes in these assumptions such as the valuation basis applied in 
comparable market transactions, or the income level generated by a pub could materially impact the valuation of the freehold and long leasehold 
properties. It is estimated that a £1 change in the EBITDA of the freehold and long leasehold properties would generate approximately an £8 
movement in their valuation.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment which are not re-valued to fair market value have been reviewed for impairment using 
forecast cash flows, discounted by applying a pre-tax discount rate of 7% (2014 8%).

a.  In a small number of instances the value of property derived purely from an income approach misrepresents the underlying property value. In these cases a spot value has been 
applied to the property rather than a value derived from a multiple applied to the EBITDA.
b.  The carrying value of freehold and long leasehold properties based on their historical cost (or deemed cost at transition to IFRS) is £2,710m and £200m respectively (2014 £2,716m 
and £213m).
c.  Unallocated assets primarily includes unlicensed properties and freehold properties excluded from revaluation as a result of investment plans.
d.  A separate valuation exercise was undertaken for the acquired Orchid sites as part of the fair value accounting exercise (see note 3.5).
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets with a net book value of £3,588m (2014 £3,597m), which are pledged as security for the 
securitisation debt and over which there are certain restrictions on title.
In addition to the above, premiums paid on acquiring a new lease are classified separately in the balance sheet. At 26 September 2015 an amount 
of £2m (2014 £1m) was included in the balance sheet.

Section 3 – Operating assets and liabilities continued 3.3 Provisions 
Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is more likely than not 
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured 
using the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present 
value where the effect is material.
Onerous property provisions represent the expected unavoidable losses on onerous and vacant property leases and comprise the lower  
of the net rent payable or the operating loss after rental costs. The provision is calculated on a site by site basis, with an estimated period  
of future losses ranging from three to five years. Other contractual dilapidations costs are also recorded as provisions as appropriate, over  
a period of five years prior to lease expiry.

3.4 Goodwill and other intangible assets
Accounting policies
Business	combinations	and	goodwill
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured 
at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. 
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
 • deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance 
with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits (revised) respectively; and
 • assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the 
acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree,  
and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed at the acquisition date. If, after reassessment, the net of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date 
exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s 
previously held interest in the acquiree, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement as a bargain purchase.
When the consideration transferred by the Group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition date fair value and included as part of the contingent 
consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement 
period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are 
adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the 
acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments 
depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured at subsequent 
reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability  
is re-measured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39 or IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, 
as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in the income statement.
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity is re-measured to its acquisition 
date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the income statement. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to 
the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment 
would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.

Governance  34–69 Financial statements  70–115 Shareholder  information  116 Strategic report  2–33 3.4 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances  
that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date. 
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The impairment review requires management to consider the recoverable value 
of the business to which the goodwill relates, based on either the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. Value in use calculations 
require management to consider the net present value of future cash flows generated by the business to which the goodwill relates. Fair 
value less costs to sell is based on management’s estimate of the net proceeds which could be generated through disposing of that business. 
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying 
amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Computer	software
Computer software and associated development costs, which are not an integral part of a related item of hardware, are capitalised as an 
intangible asset and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life. The period of amortisation ranges between three and seven  
years with the majority being five years.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The Group is required to test annually or as triggering events occur, whether the value of goodwill has suffered any impairment. The recoverable 
amount is determined based on value in use calculations, which requires management to estimate future cash flows. The use of this method 
requires judgement around whether an impairment review is triggered and in the selection of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the 
present value of future cash flows.

Notes to the financial statements 
Section 3 – Operating assets and liabilities continued There are no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. All amortisation charges have been expensed through operating costs.
Goodwill has been tested for impairment on a site-by-site basis using forecast cash flows, discounted by applying a pre-tax discount rate of  
7% (2014 8%). For the purposes of the calculation of the recoverable amount, the cash flow projections beyond the two year period include  
2% (2014 2%) growth per annum.
3.5. Acquisitions
On 15 June 2014 the Group acquired all of the issued share capital in Orchid Pubs & Dining Limited and Midco 1 Limited. 
In accordance with IFRS 3, measurement period adjustments have now been made to provisional values which result in a restatement of the 
deferred tax asset acquired and the value of land and buildings. 
In addition, deferred consideration outstanding at 27 September 2014 has also been finalised. The result of these changes reduces the provisional 
goodwill from £9m to £nil.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
Management used judgement to determine the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. Key estimates related to the value 
assigned to the property and the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Property valuation was determined  
by considering the estimated projected level of trading which was used to determine the fair maintainable trade. A key judgement was also 
made in relation to the property multiplier applied including the use of the buildings and consideration of the value a market participant 
would assign to the assets at the date of the acquisition. Judgements were made in relation to the recoverability of other balance sheet  
assets including the likelihood of future taxable income which would allow recognition of a deferred tax asset.

4.2 Borrowings
Accounting policy
Borrowings, which include the Group’s secured loan notes, are stated initially at fair value (normally the amount of the proceeds) net of issue 
costs. Thereafter they are stated at amortised cost using an effective interest basis. Finance costs, which are the difference between the net 
proceeds and the total amount of payments to be made in respect of the instruments, are allocated over the term of the debt using the 
effective interest method.

Securitised debt
On 13 November 2003, the Group refinanced its debt by raising £1,900m through a securitisation of the majority of its UK pubs and restaurants 
owned by Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited (‘MAB Retail’). On 15 September 2006 the Group completed a further debt (‘tap’) issue to borrow  
an additional £655m and refinance £450m of existing debt at lower cost.

The overall cash interest rate payable on the loan notes is 6.1% (2014 6.1%) after taking account of interest rate hedging and the cost of the 
provision of a financial guarantee provided by Ambac in respect of the Class A and AB notes.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited, 
the Group’s main operating subsidiary. These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions 
on its ability to move cash, by way of dividends for example, to other Group companies. At 26 September 2015, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited 
had cash and cash equivalents of £108m (2014 £78m) which were governed by the covenants associated with the securitisation. Of this amount 
£36m (2014 £36m), representing disposal proceeds, was held on deposit in an account over which there are a number of restrictions. The use  
of this cash requires the approval of the securitisation trustee and may only be used for certain specified purposes such as capital enhancement 
expenditure and business acquisitions.

Liquidity facility
Under the terms of the securitisation, the Group holds a liquidity facility of £295m provided by two counterparties. As a result of the decrease  
in credit rating of one of the counterparties, the Group was obliged to draw that counterparty’s portion of the facility during the prior period.  
The amount drawn at 26 September 2015 is £147m (27 September 2014 £147m). These funds are charged under the terms of the securitisation 
and are not available for use in the wider Group.
The facility, which is not available for any other purpose, is sized to cover 18 months debt service.
Unsecured revolving credit facilities
During the prior period, the Group entered into two revolving credit facilities of £75m each, available for general corporate purposes. The amount 
drawn at 26 September 2015 is £nil (2014 £nil). Both facilities expire on 31 December 2017 .

4.4 Financial instruments
Accounting policies
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial	assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract  
whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured  
at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially 
measured at fair value. 
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL);  
derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships; ‘held-to-maturity’ investments; ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial 
assets; and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at  
the time of initial recognition.
Impairment	of	financial	assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are 
impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial 
asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. 
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost  
is considered to be objective evidence of impairment. 
96
Mitchells & Butlers plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Notes to the financial statements 
Section 4 – Capital structure and financing costs continued For all other financial assets, including redeemable notes classified as AFS and finance lease receivables, objective evidence of impairment 
could include:
 • significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
 • default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
 • it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in addition, 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the agreed credit period, as well as 
observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
When an AFS financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
are reclassified to profit or loss in the period.
With the exception of AFS equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease  
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed 
through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what 
the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised. 
In respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss.  
Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Derecognition	of	financial	assets	and	liabilities
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the 
financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest 
in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the 
proceeds received.
Effective	interest	method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid 
or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected 
life of the debt instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. Income is recognised on 
an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets classified as at FVTPL. 
Derivative	financial	instruments	and	hedge	accounting
The Group uses interest rate and currency swap contracts to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates and exchange rates. These 
contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and hedge accounting is applied where the necessary criteria under IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are met. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are re-measured to fair value at subsequent 
reporting dates. Fair value is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of highly probable future cash flows are 
recognised in equity. The cumulative gain or loss is transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as  
the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Movements in the fair value of derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income  
statement immediately.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
At that point, the cumulative gain or loss in equity remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the 
transaction affects profit or loss. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity  
is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Equity	instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Financial risk management
Financial risk is managed by the Group’s Treasury function. The Group’s Treasury function is governed by a Board Treasury Policy Statement 
which details the key objectives and policies for the Group’s treasury management. The Treasury Committee ensures that the Treasury Policy is 
adhered to, monitors its operation and agrees appropriate strategies for recommendation to the Board. The Treasury Policy Statement is reviewed 
annually, with recommendations for change made to the Board, as appropriate. The Group Treasury function is operated as a cost centre and is 
the only area of the business permitted to transact treasury deals. It must also be consulted on other related matters such as the provision of 
guarantees or the financial implications of contract terms.
An explanation of the Group’s financial instrument risk management objectives and strategies is set out below.
The main financial risks which impact the Group result from funding and liquidity risk, credit risk, capital risk and market risk, principally as a result 
of changes in interest and currency rates. Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate and foreign currency swaps, are used to manage 
market risk. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
Funding and liquidity risk
In order to ensure that the Group’s long-term funding strategy is aligned with its strategic objectives, the Treasury Committee regularly assesses 
the maturity profile of the Group’s debt, alongside the prevailing financial projections. This enables it to ensure that funding levels are appropriate 
to support the Group’s plans.
The current funding arrangements of the Group consist of the securitised notes issued by Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc (and associated liquidity 
facility) along with two unsecured revolving credit facilities of £75m each. The terms of the securitisation and the revolving credit facilities contain 
various financial covenants. Compliance with these covenants is monitored by Group Treasury.
The Group prepares a rolling daily cash forecast covering a six week period and an annual cash forecast by period. These forecasts are reviewed 
on a daily basis and are used to manage the investment and borrowing requirements of the Group. A combination of cash pooling and zero 
balancing agreements are in place to ensure the optimum liquidity position is maintained. The Group maintains sufficient cash balances or 
committed facilities outside the securitisation to ensure that it can meet its medium-term anticipated cash flow requirements.
The maturity table below details the contractual undiscounted cash flows (both principal and interest) for the Group’s financial liabilities, after 
taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps. Trade and other payables (note 3.2) are short-term and excluded from the table.

Credit risk
The Group Treasury function enters into contracts with third parties in respect of derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes 
and the investment of surplus funds. These activities expose the Group to credit risk against the counterparties. To mitigate this exposure, Group 
Treasury operates policies that restrict the investment of surplus funds and the entering into of derivative transactions to counterparties that have  
a minimum credit rating of ‘A’ (long-term) and ‘A1’/‘P1’/‘F1’ (short-term). Counterparties may also be required to post collateral with the Group, 
where their credit rating falls below a predetermined level. An amount of £18m (2014 £9m) of collateral was posted by a swap counterparty within 
the securitisation as at 26 September 2015. The amount that can be invested or transacted at various ratings levels is restricted under the policy. 
To minimise credit risk exposure against individual counterparties, investments and derivative transactions are entered into with a range of 
counterparties. The Group Treasury function reviews credit ratings, as published by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, current 
exposure levels and the maximum permitted exposure at given credit ratings, for each counterparty on a daily basis. Any exceptions are  
required to be formally reported to the Treasury Committee on a four-weekly basis.
Included in other receivables are amounts due from certain Group suppliers. Included in trade and other payables at the period end are amounts 
due to some of these suppliers. This reduces the Group’s credit exposure.

Capital management
The Group’s capital base is comprised of its net debt (analysed in note 4.1) plus total equity (disclosed on the face of the Group balance sheet).  
The objective is to maintain a capital base which is sufficiently strong to support the ongoing development of the business as a going concern, 
including the amenity and cash flow generation of the pub estate. By keeping debt (see also ‘Funding and liquidity risk’ above) and headroom 
against its debt facilities at an appropriate level, the Group ensures that it maintains a strong credit position, whilst maximising value for 
shareholders and adhering to its covenants and other restrictions associated with its debt (see note 4.2). In managing its capital structure, from 
time to time the Group may realise value from non-core assets, buy back or issue new shares, initiate and vary its dividend payments and seek to 
vary or accelerate debt repayments. The Group’s policy is to ensure that the maturity of its debt profile supports its strategic objectives. The Board 
considers the latest covenant compliance, headroom projections and projected balance sheet positions periodically throughout the year, based  
on the advice of the Treasury Committee which meets on a four-weekly basis. The Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Treasurer and 
monitors Treasury performance and compliance with Board-approved policies. The Group Finance Director is also a member of the Committee.
Total capital at the balance sheet date is as follows:

Market risk
The Group is exposed to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of its financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Market risk comprises foreign currency and interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk
The Group faces currency risk in two main areas:
At issuance of the Class A3N floating rate notes, the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to manage the foreign currency 
exposure resulting from both the US$ principal and initial interest elements of the notes. The A3N notes form part of the securitised debt  
(see note 4.2).
Further to the step-up on the A3N notes on 15 December 2010, the Group has additional foreign currency exposure as a result of the increase  
in US$ finance costs. A movement of 10% in the US$ exchange rate would have £nil (2014 £nil) impact on the reported Group profit and £22m 
(2014 £5m) impact on the reported Group net assets.
The Group has no significant profit and loss exposure as a result of retranslating monetary assets and liabilities at different exchange rates.  
As the Group is predominantly UK based and acquires the majority of its supplies in sterling, it has no significant direct currency exposure from  
its operations.
Interest rate risk
The Group has a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt instruments and manages the variability in cash flows resulting from changes  
in interest rates by using derivative financial instruments. Where the necessary criteria are met, the Group minimises the volatility in its financial 
statements through the adoption of the hedge accounting provisions permitted under IAS 39. The interest rate exposure resulting from the 
Group’s £2.0bn securitisation is largely fixed, either as a result of the notes themselves being issued at fixed interest rates, or through a 
combination of floating rate notes against which effective interest rate swaps are held, which are eligible for hedge accounting.

Cash	flow	hedges
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve in equity to the extent that the hedges are effective. The cash flow 
hedges detailed below have been assessed as being highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over the 
remaining contract lives.
During the period a loss of £86m (2014 loss of £59m) on cash flow hedges was recognised in equity. A loss of £31m (2014 loss of £48m) was recycled 
from equity and included in the Group income statement for the period.
Cash	flow	hedges	–	securitised	borrowings
At 26 September 2015, the Group held 10 (2014 10) interest rate swap contracts with a nominal value of £1,017m (2014 £1,037m), designated as a 
hedge of the cash flow interest rate risk of £1,017m (2014 £1,037m) of the Group’s floating rate borrowings, comprising the A1N, A3N, A4, AB, C2 
and D1 loan notes.
The cash flows on these contracts occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a fixed rate of 4.8689 %  
(2014 4.8749%). The contract maturity dates match those of the hedged item. The 10 interest rate swaps are held on the balance sheet at fair 
market value, which is a liability of £296m (2014 £241m).
At 26 September 2015 the Group held one (2014 one) cross currency interest rate swap contract, with a nominal value of £201m (2014 £212m), 
designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate and currency risk of the Group’s A3N floating rate $337m (2014 $355m) borrowings. The cross 
currency interest rate swap is held on the balance sheet at a fair value asset of £19m (2014 £5m).
The cash flows on this contract occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on US$ LIBOR and paying a floating rate of interest at 
LIBOR in sterling.
The cash flows arising from interest rate swap positions on the same counterparty may be settled as a net position. The cross currency interest rate 
swap is held under a separate agreement and cash movements for this instrument are settled individually.
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments were measured at 26 September 2015 and may be subject to material movements in the 
period subsequent to the balance sheet date. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are reflected on the balance sheet as follows:

The various tranches of the securitised debt have been valued using period end quoted offer prices. As the securitised debt is traded on an active 
market, the market value represents the fair value of this debt. The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is the estimated amount which 
the Group could expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements. These amounts are based on quotations from counterparties which 
approximate to their fair market value and take into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Other financial 
assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or their book values approximate to fair values.

Notes to the financial statements 
Section 4 – Capital structure and financing costs continued Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of the Group’s derivative financial instruments is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows of each instrument at an 
appropriate discount rate to a ‘mark to market’ position and then adjusting this to reflect any non-performance risk associated with the counterparties 
to the instrument.
IFRS 13 Financial Instruments requires the Group’s derivative financial instruments to be disclosed at fair value and categorised in three levels 
according to the inputs used in the calculation of their fair value:
 
 • Level 1 instruments use quoted prices as the input to fair value calculations;
 • Level 2 instruments use inputs, other than quoted prices, that are observable either directly or indirectly;
 • Level 3 instruments use inputs that are unobservable.

4.5 Pensions
Accounting policy
Retirement and death benefits are provided for eligible employees in the United Kingdom principally by the Mitchells & Butlers Pension Plan 
(MABPP) and the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan (MABEPP). These plans are funded, HMRC approved, occupational pension 
schemes with defined contribution and defined benefit sections. The defined benefit section of the plans is now closed to future service 
accrual. The defined benefit liability relates to these funded plans, together with an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement (the 
Executive Top-Up Scheme, or MABETUS) in respect of certain MABEPP members. The assets of the plans are held in self-administered  
trust funds separate from the Company’s assets.
In addition, Mitchells & Butlers plc also provides a workplace pension plan in line with the Workplace Pensions Reform Regulations.  
This automatically enrols all eligible workers into a Qualifying Workplace Pension Plan.
The total pension liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Group’s defined benefit arrangements is the greater of the 
minimum funding requirements, calculated as the present value of the agreed schedule of contributions, and the actuarial calculated liability. 
The actuarial liability is the present value of the defined benefit obligation, less the fair value of the scheme assets. The cost of providing 
benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified actuaries. This is based on a number  
of financial assumptions and estimates, the determination of which may be significant to the balance sheet valuation in the event that  
this reflects a greater deficit than that suggested by the schedule of minimum contributions. 
There is no current service cost as all defined benefit schemes are closed to future accrual. The net pension finance charge, calculated  
by applying the discount rate to the pension deficit or surplus at the beginning of the period, is shown within finance income or expense. 
The administration costs of the scheme are recognised within operating costs in the income statement.
Re-measurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of minimum funding requirements, and the return on scheme assets  
are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which 
they occur. 
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Group’s defined benefit plan are recognised in the income statement in the period in which  
the curtailment or settlement occurs.
For the defined contribution arrangements, the charge against profit is equal to the amount of contributions payable for that period.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The determination of the actuarial defined benefit obligation of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes requires judgement around the 
selection of certain assumptions which include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth and longevity of current and future pensioners. 
The determination of the actuarial defined benefit asset requires judgement in determining investment returns and long-term interest rates.
The determination of defined benefit liability based on minimum funding arrangements requires management judgement in the selection  
of an appropriate discount rate.

Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities
Actuarial	valuation
The actuarial valuations used for IAS 19 (revised) purposes are based on the results of the latest full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2013 
and updated by the schemes’ independent qualified actuaries to 26 September 2015. Scheme assets are stated at market value at 26 September 2015 
and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method. IAS 19 (revised) requires that the scheme 
liabilities are discounted using market yields at the end of the period on high quality corporate bonds.
The principal financial assumptions used at the balance sheet date have been updated to reflect changes in market conditions in the period and are as follows:
2015 2014
Pensions increases 3.0% 3.1%
Discount rate 3.6% 3.8%
Inflation rate 3.1% 3.2%
The mortality assumptions were reviewed following the 2013 actuarial valuation as agreed on 21 May 2014. A summary of the average life expectancies 
assumed is as follows:
2015 2014
Main plan
years

Male member aged 65 (current life expectancy) 21.7 25.9 21.7 25.9

Female member aged 65 (current life expectancy) 24.1 27.1 24.1 27. 1
Female member aged 45 (life expectancy at 65) 26.9 29.1 26.9 29.1
Minimum	funding	requirements
The results of the 2013 actuarial valuation showed a funding deficit of £572m, using a more prudent basis to discount the scheme liabilities than is 
required by IAS 19 (revised) and on 21 May 2014 the Company formally agreed a new 10 year recovery plan with the Trustees to close the funding 
deficit in respect of its pension scheme liabilities. The Group has agreed to increase contributions from £40m to £45m per annum, for three years 
effective from 1 April 2013. From 1 April 2016 contributions then increase each year by the rate of RPI (subject to a minimum increase of 0% and  
a maximum increase of 5%) for the following seven years. As part of the recovery plan, the Group has also made a further payment of £40m in 
September 2015 on terms agreed with the Trustees. Under IFRIC 14, an additional liability is recognised, such that the overall pension liability at 
the period end reflects the schedule of contributions in relation to a minimum funding requirement, should this be higher than the actuarial deficit.
Sensitivity	to	changes	in	discount	rate
The discount rate applied to the pension schemes’ liabilities is a significant driver of the net balance sheet valuation of the schemes and is subject 
to a high degree of judgement and complexity. It is estimated that a 0.1% increase or decrease in the discount rate used would, in isolation, reduce 
or increase the actuarial deficit by approximately £39m (2014 £39m). A similar increase or decrease in the discount rate used would, in isolation, 
reduce or increase the total pension liability by approximately £2m (2014 £2m), with no material impact on the income statement charge.

Accounting policy
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, whereby, subject to meeting any relevant conditions, 
employees are awarded shares or rights over shares. The cost of such awards is measured at fair value, excluding the effect of non market-
based vesting conditions, on the date of grant. The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and is adjusted 
for the estimated effect of non market-based vesting conditions and forfeitures, on the number of shares that will eventually vest due  
to employees leaving the employment of the Group. Fair values are calculated using either the Black-Scholes, Binomial or Monte Carlo 
simulation models depending on the conditions attached to the particular share scheme.
SAYE share options granted to employees are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme. This results in an 
accelerated recognition of the expense that would have arisen over the remainder of the original vesting period.
Schemes in operation 
The net charge recognised for share-based payments in the period was £2m (2014 £2m).
The Group had four equity-settled share schemes (2014 five) in operation during the period; the Performance Restricted Share Plan (PRSP); 
Sharesave Plan; Share Incentive Plan and Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan. 
The vesting of all awards or options is generally dependent upon participants remaining in the employment of a participating company during  
the vesting period. Further details on each scheme are provided in the Report on Directors’ remuneration on pages 52 to 69.

a.  The exercise price for the Performance Restricted Share Plan is £1 per participating employee.
b.  The expected dividend yield for the Sharesave Plan has used historical dividend information. For details on the Group’s current dividend policy refer to the Financial review on  
page 31. The expected dividend yield for the Performance Restricted Share Plan options is zero as participants are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares to the value of ordinary 
dividends paid or payable during the vesting period.
c.  The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price commensurate with the expected term of the options and share awards.
d.  The expected life of the options represents the average length of time between grant date and exercise date.
The fair value of awards under the Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan and the Share Incentive Plan are equal to the share price on the date of 
award as there is no price to be paid and employees are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares to the value of ordinary dividends paid or payable 
during the vesting period. The assumptions set out above are therefore not relevant to these schemes.

or disposed. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is also included in shareholders’ equity.
Dividends
Dividends proposed by the Board but unpaid at the period end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved 
by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when paid.

Share premium account
The share premium account represents amounts received in excess of the nominal value of shares on issue of new shares. Share premium of  
£2m has been recognised on shares issued in the period (2014 £1m).
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve movement arose on the repurchase and cancellation by the Company of ordinary shares during prior periods.
Revaluation reserve
The revaluation reserve represents the unrealised gain generated on revaluation of the property estate with effect from 29 September 2007 .  
It comprises the excess of the fair value of the estate over deemed cost, net of related deferred taxation.
Own shares held
Own shares held by the Group represent the shares in the Company held by the employee share trusts.
During the period, the employee share trusts acquired nil (2014 500,000) and subscribed for 151,461 (2014 189,859) shares at a cost of £nil (2014 
£2m) and released 733,646 (2014 698,269) shares to employees on the exercise of options and other share awards for a total consideration of £1m 
(2014 £1m). The 1,523,502 shares held by the trusts at 26 September 2015 had a market value of £5m (27 September 2014 2,105,687 shares held 
had a market value of £8m). 
The Company has established two employee share trusts:
Share	Incentive	Plan	(SIP)	Trust
The SIP Trust was established in 2003 to purchase shares on behalf of employees participating in the Company’s Share Incentive Plan. Under this 
scheme, eligible employees are awarded free shares which are normally held in trust for a holding period of at least three years. After five years 
the shares may be transferred to or sold by the employee free of income tax and national insurance contributions. The SIP Trust buys the shares in 
the market or subscribes for newly issued shares with funds provided by the Company. During the holding period, dividends are paid directly to 
the participating employees. At 26 September 2015, the trustees, Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited, held 1,479,636 (2014 1,571,331) shares in 
the Company. Of these shares, 453,527 (2014 441,070) shares are unconditionally available to employees, 393,491 (2014 340,256) shares have 
been conditionally awarded to employees, 608,554 (2014 771,894) shares have been awarded to employees but are still required to be held  
within the SIP Trust and the remaining 24,064 (2014 18,111) shares are unallocated.
Employee	Benefit	Trust	(EBT)
The EBT was established in 2003 in order to satisfy the exercise or vesting of existing and future share options and awards under the Executive 
Share Option Plan, Performance Restricted Share Plan, Short Term Deferred Incentive Plan and the Sharesave Plan. The EBT purchases shares  
in the market or subscribes for newly issued shares, using funds provided by the Company, based on expectations of future requirements. 
Dividends are waived by the EBT. At 26 September 2015, the trustees, Sanne Fiduciary Services Limited, were holding 43,866 (2014 534,356) 
shares in the Company.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to 
hedged future cash flows.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
Retained earnings
The Group’s main operating subsidiary, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited, had retained earnings under UK GAAP of £304m at 26 September 2015 
(2014 £234m). Its ability to distribute these reserves by way of dividends is restricted by the securitisation covenants (see note 4.2).

Mitchells & Butlers plc Company financial statements 1. Basis of preparation
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The financial statements comply with applicable accounting 
standards in the United Kingdom.
The Company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
No statement of recognised gains and losses is provided as the only additional loss is the actuarial movement which is disclosed in note 10.
The Company’s accounting policies have been applied on a consistent basis with no changes to policies during the period.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates ruling on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the relevant rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
In accordance with FRS 26, the Company applies fair value accounting in order to hedge part of its euro loan with Mitchells & Butlers Germany 
GmbH against part of its investment in Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation on both of these 
items using the period end rate are taken to the profit and loss account. The remainder of the investment in Mitchells & Butlers Germany GmbH  
is held at cost as described above.
Cash flow statement
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements and not produced a cash flow statement.
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures and not disclosed details of transactions with wholly 
owned subsidiaries.
2. Profit and loss account
The Company recorded a profit after tax of £68m (2014 £94m), less dividends of £nil (2014 £nil).
Auditors’ remuneration for audit services to the Company was £22,000 (2014 £22,000). This is borne by another Group company, as are any other 
costs relating to non-audit services (see note 2.3 to the consolidated financial statements).

Employees of Mitchells & Butlers plc consist of Executive Directors.
 
4. Pensions
Accounting policy
The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements.
The Company accounts for pensions under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits. Prior to the introduction of IAS 19 (revised), disclosure requirements 
under FRS 17 were equivalent to those under IAS 19 Employee Benefits. However, following Group adoption of IAS 19 (revised) on  
29 September 2013, differences in the accounting and disclosure requirements between FRS 17 and IAS 19 (revised) now arise. 
The actuarial liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Company’s defined benefit arrangements is the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the scheme assets, shown net of deferred tax. The cost of providing benefits is determined 
using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified independent actuaries. 
Following guidance from the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the total liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Company’s 
defined benefit arrangements is the greater of the minimum funding requirements, calculated as the present value of the agreed schedule  
of contributions, and the actuarial calculated liability.
There is no current service cost as all defined benefit schemes are closed to future accrual. The interest cost and the expected return on assets 
are shown as a net amount within finance income or expense. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in equity. Curtailments  
and settlements relating to the Company’s defined benefit plan are recognised in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.
For the Company’s defined contribution arrangements, the charge against profit is equal to the amount of contributions payable.
110
Mitchells & Butlers plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Notes to the Mitchells & Butlers plc Company financial statements Pension liability
The net pension liability of £280m (2014 £340m) is shown net of a deferred tax asset of £70m (2014 £85m). 
The Company is the sponsoring employer of the Group’s pension plans. Information concerning the pension scheme arrangements operated by the 
Company and associated current and future contributions is contained within note 4.5 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 101 to 103.
Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities 
Minimum	funding	requirements
The results of the 2013 actuarial valuation showed a funding deficit of £572m, using a more prudent basis to discount the scheme liabilities than is 
required by FRS 17 and on 21 May 2014 the Company formally agreed a new 10 year recovery plan with the Trustees to close the funding deficit in 
respect of its pension scheme liabilities. The Group has agreed to increase contributions from £40m to £45m per annum, for three years effective 
from 1 April 2013. From 1 April 2016 contributions then increase each year by the rate of RPI (capped between 0% to 5%) for the following seven 
years. As part of the recovery plan, the Group has also made a further payment of £40m in September 2015 on terms agreed with the Trustees. 
An additional liability is recognised, such that the overall pension liability at the period end reflects the schedule of contributions in relation to a 
minimum funding requirement, should this be higher than the actuarial deficit.
Actuarial	valuation
The actuarial valuations used for IAS 19 (revised) purposes are based on the results of the latest full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2013 
and updated by the schemes’ independent qualified actuaries to 26 September 2015. Scheme assets are stated at market value at 26 September 2015 
and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method. FRS 17 requires that the scheme liabilities 
are discounted using market yields at the end of the period on high quality corporate bonds.
The principal financial assumptions used at the balance sheet date have been updated to reflect changes in market conditions in the period and 
mortality assumptions are in line with those used in the 2013 actuarial valuation as agreed on 21 May 2014. These assumptions and a sensitivity 
analysis are disclosed in note 4.5 to the Group consolidated financial statements on page 102.
The long-term rates of return on assets at 26 September 2015 shown below form the basis of the calculation of the expected return on pension 
scheme assets for the 2016 financial year. The 2014 rates shown are used in calculating the 2015 expected return.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free 
investments (primarily Government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is 
invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the asset allocation,  
to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio, resulting in a weighted average assumption of 4.2%  
(2014 4.7%). The actual investment return achieved on the scheme assets over the period was 7 .4% (2014 9.5%), which represented a gain  
of £131m (2014 £154m).
The combined assets of the MABPP and MABEPP and the value of the pension scheme assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date can be

5. Share-based payments
Accounting policy
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans, whereby, subject to meeting any relevant conditions, 
employees are awarded shares or rights over shares. The cost of such awards is measured at fair value, excluding the effect of non market-
based vesting conditions, on the date of grant. The expense is generally recognised over the vesting period and is adjusted for the estimated 
effect, on the number of shares that will eventually vest, of non market-based vesting conditions and forfeitures due to employees leaving 
the employment of the Company. Fair values are calculated using either the Black-Scholes, Binomial or Monte Carlo simulation models 
depending on the conditions attached to the particular share scheme.
Schemes in operation
The charge recognised for share-based payments in the period is £nil (2014 £nil) which comprises share option schemes and share awards to the 
employees of the Company.
Details of employee share schemes and options granted over the shares of the Company are included under note 4.6 of the consolidated  
financial statements.

9. Taxation
Accounting policies
Current	taxation
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the profit and loss 
account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that  
are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred	taxation
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised, subject to certain exceptions, in respect of all material timing differences between the

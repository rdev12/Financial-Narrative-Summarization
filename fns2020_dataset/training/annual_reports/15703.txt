1 Overview:
Our Strategy, Structure and Markets
Our objective is to be the pre-eminent 
alternative telecommunication provider  
for business customers in the UK.
Our market
Market structure
Twenty-five years after liberalisation, the fixed  
line business market in the UK remains dominated 
by the incumbent provider, BT. 
Although many infrastructure-based market 
entrants have emerged, none has yet developed 
sufficiently to deliver sustained growth and 
meaningful returns. In particular, an over-investment 
in legacy networks has resulted in an over-supply 
of legacy services and inhibited competitors from 
developing sufficient scale to thrive. 
The transition to next-generation services has put 
additional pressure on established revenue and 
margin from legacy services for all operators. 
Most suppliers now face significant network 
investment to enable them to offer next-generation 
services. THUS made this investment when it put 
in place a next-generation network as part of  
its national network rollout in the early part of  
the decade.
THUS continues to invest judiciously to increase 
its capabilities further, maximise the leverage 
of its assets, and deliver future growth and 
operating efficiencies. THUS is therefore well 
positioned to benefit as demand consolidates 
around market participants with next-generation 
capability over the longer term.
Our principal strategies to achieve this objective have 
focused around:
> Deployment of an advanced national, next-generation 
telecommunications network. This allows us to improve 
our control over the quality of our service delivery, 
lower our ongoing traffic delivery costs and control 
the rate of service evolution.
> Development and sale of a comprehensive service 
portfolio capable of supporting business customers 
through the transition from legacy to IP-based and 
converged telecommunications.
> Attainment of consistently high levels of quality in our  
service delivery.
> Achievement of scale and operating leverage across 
our network and supporting systems.
Focused
Organisation structure
THUS is structured along functional lines to support the business segments with staff organised into 
sales, product, operations and support services. In addition, THUS maintains a central capability  
for management of finance, human resources and government and regulatory affairs.

THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008 Regulation
In 2005, communications regulator 
Ofcom completed its Strategic Review of 
Telecommunications, culminating in a new 
regulatory settlement for the industry. The new 
settlement continues to support infrastructure-
based competition but seeks to promote  
equality of access to those parts of the BT 
network where investment in competing 
infrastructure is not sustainable.
A new BT division called Openreach was 
created to provide access to these regulated 
services. Although BT’s customers suffered 
significant disruption following the creation  
of Openreach, Ofcom is now taking action  
to impose a service level guarantee regime  
on Openreach which should lead to improved 
service performance.
THUS remains optimistic that the regulatory 
settlement will eventually enhance competition, 
but continued vigilance will be required to  
ensure BT does not foreclose competition as  
it implements its next-generation network.
Financial targets
Following heavy up-front investment in network 
rollout, our financial plan is focused on delivering
a return on capital employed greater than our 
weighted average cost of capital. Key long-term 
financial targets for the Group include:
The Group has achieved three important financial 
milestones, moving EBITDA

 positive in 2001/02, 
free cash flow
5
 positive in 2004/05 and 
delivering our first operating profit in 2007 /08.

Market size and service transition

estimated at £12.3b

 or excluding business 
spending on mobile services is estimated 
at £6.5b

 down from £6.8b

 the previous 
year. The fixed line segment is experiencing 
a transition in demand patterns. In particular, 
demand is moving away from traditional or 
legacy telecommunication services, including 
fixed switched voice, frame relay and ATM 
data, as well as narrow-band Internet access 
towards next-generation, IP-based services such 
as broadband, Ethernet, MPLS IP Virtual Private 
Networks and Voice over IP.
Market share
THUS must continue to build market share 
successfully in order to meet our longer-term 
objectives. Based on continuing operations

revenue growth, THUS improved its estimated 
market share to 8.7% during the year, reflecting 
our success in winning new business and 
extending relationships with existing customers.

3 Overview:
THUS at a Glance
Managed 
solutions
Data and 
telecoms
Internet
Mobile
THUS is focused on the provision of  
fixed line telecommunication services 
to large business customers and public 
sector organisations, while tailoring 
services to suit small and mid-sized 
businesses under the Demon brand.
Business model
THUS’ business model is focused on the  
provision of primarily infrastructure-based  
services to business customers and public  
sector organisations in the UK. 
Our addressable market is not focused on  
the highly competitive consumer market in the  
UK nor very large multinational corporations. 
Demon’s service offerings are targeted at small 
and mid-sized businesses and complement 
THUS’ capabilities for larger organisations. 
Continuing operations
THUS has four established business segments 
comprising Managed solutions, Data and 
telecoms, Internet and Mobile.
Managed solutions are run as a separate unit 
within THUS. They comprise large corporate 
accounts with complex service needs, typically 
combining delivery of several different standard 
services, an element of outsource to THUS  
and longer than average contract duration. 
In contrast, the Data and telecoms, Internet and 
Mobile segments record revenue and results 
for more standard product sales to a wider 
customer base including corporate, small and 
mid-sized customers, channel resellers and other 
telecommunication companies.
Within each segment, the principal costs 
comprise payments to other telecommunication
companies for interconnect and use of their 
network to collect and deliver services to THUS 
customers, other directly variable costs, directly 
attributable selling, distribution and administrative 
costs and depreciation on assets directly 
attributable to that segment.
However, as the majority of services are sold, 
provisioned and run from a unified infrastructure, 
THUS maintains a large pool of central costs.  
In 2008, these costs reduced by 7% to £108.7m
1
 
(2007: £1 17 .2m
1
) and comprised £41.2m  
of depreciation, impairment and amortisation 
(2007: £43.4m), £29.4m of network operations 
and maintenance costs (2007: £27 .3m) and 
£38.1m of corporate overheads (2007: £46.5m).
1  Excludes £1.6m of restructuring costs in 2007 .

to individual segments.

Strategic Progress and Success:
What Makes THUS Different
Capability
Our unique capability comes from an extensive 
knowledge of the telecommunications industry 
and many years of experience working with  
our customers to ensure that we provide the  
right solutions.
Our state-of-the-art next-generation network 
(NGN), coupled with our technical capability,  
is crucial in delivering innovative, compelling  
and flexible communication solutions to a  
broad range of customers.
Our network is one of the most technically 
advanced in the UK, and allows us to harness 
new opportunities for our customers. It provides  
a single platform for the deployment of advanced 
business applications, allowing both voice and 
data to exist on the same advanced network. 
The result is a simplified communications 
infrastructure that delivers both performance gains 
and cost savings for our customers. Our NGN is 
configured to ensure maximum performance and 
reliability at all times.
The world-class THUS backbone network uses 
MPLS technology to deliver the highest possible 
performance. MPLS is the ideal platform to  
carry IP voice, video and data traffic across  
a converged network, as well as giving added 
flexibility and functionality. 
Consultation
At THUS, we add value to our customers’ 
operations through our consultative approach. 
Our goal is to drive success through in-depth 
customer and market knowledge. This has 
resulted in notable success and is recognised  
by our customers as a key differentiator. We lead 
on thorough consultative engagement, supported 
by our extensive sector knowledge and an 
in-depth understanding of both our customers’ 
requirements and their key drivers.
We have extensive experience across multiple 
sectors nationwide. New business won this 
year is testament to this approach and included 
contract wins in the fields of education, utilities, 
retail, media and the public sector.
THUS believes in strong client engagement, 
which succeeds in building relationships with  
our customers based on trust and understanding, 
and allows us to identify their real requirements 
and challenges. Through this process, we are 
able to demonstrate a thorough understanding  
of the customers’ situation, enabling us to tailor 
and deliver the right solution for them that will 
meet their needs today and in the future.

6 With a broad range of 
capabilities, a reputation for  
top-quality service, extensive 
sectoral coverage and a strong 
consultative approach, THUS 
is truly a distinctive leader in 
communications provision.
Quality
Providing the highest level of quality is essential  
to our business. We constantly strive to improve 
on our already high standards of service, 
and quality underpins everything we do as a 
company. It is only through delivering quality 
solutions to customers that we are able to drive 
the execution and growth of our business and 
build strong and committed relationships with  
our customers.
We fervently believe in delivering the highest 
levels of quality of service to our customers. 
We utilise external measurement to support  
and ensure that we deliver consistent quality 
across all our products and solutions. Our quality 
control can be measured by the fact that we  
have achieved full ISO 9001:2000 quality 
certification for all of our internal processes  
and certification for the International Information 
Security Standard, ISO/IEC 27001:2005 for  
our MPLS network. This certification (formerly 
known as BS 7799) is regarded as the 
benchmark for information security management.
Service and quality are the cornerstones of  
our business and the differentiators by which  
we are judged. We do not limit our continual 
focus on quality to products and services, as  
we believe that improvement in business strategy, 
business results and customer, employee and 
supplier relationships should also be subject  
to continual improvement. Our commitment to  
our employees is endorsed by our Investors in 
People accreditation.
In essence, we strive to continuously improve all 
aspects of our Company performance to ensure 
we exceed the expectations of our customers.

Our Journey to Profit
Vision
Presence
Profit
Vision
Our vision for the future provision of 
telecommunication solutions led to the 
construction of our next-generation network  
at the beginning of the decade. This has enabled 
us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 
and ensures we are strongly positioned within  
the marketplace.
The current marketplace transition away from 
legacy services towards next-generation 
telecommunication services continues to 
accelerate as our customers realise the benefits  
of adopting these advanced solutions compared 
to the more commoditised legacy services. 
Presence
We have successfully grown our business every 
year since our flotation in 1999. This organic 
growth strategy was complemented by our first 
acquisitions in 2006 – Your Communications  
and Legend Communications. 
The acquisitions accelerated our achievement 
of increased scale whilst also improving our 
geographical reach in the North of England  
by complementing THUS’ existing market 
presence. As a result, THUS has achieved  
a truly nationwide presence in the UK.
As we successfully grow our enlarged business 
organically we continue to take market share
2
 
and estimate that it is now 8.7%, up from 7 .6% 
last year. We must continue to successfully build 
our market share in order to achieve our long-
term financial objectives. 
Over 70% of our new business won
1
 this year 
was for next-generation services. As a result, 
THUS has now passed the inflexion point with 
over 60% of our variable gross margin now 
derived from these next-generation services. 
THUS is committed to delivering visionary, 
innovative solutions that allow our customers to 
achieve their aspirations and provide them with  
a competitive edge. We continue to look beyond 
today’s needs to the next-generation of advanced 
telecommunication solutions that will best serve 
the needs of our customers.

Next-generation THUS’ visionary solutions for 
customers ensure we are strongly 
positioned in the marketplace, where 
we have achieved a truly nationwide 
presence, and momentum within our 
business enabled us to deliver our  
first full year of operating profit.
Profit
The strong growth of our higher margin next-
generation services, together with the benefits 
from our increased scale and the successful 
delivery of the planned savings from the 
integration of Your Communications and Legend 
Communications, enabled us to achieve our first 
full year of operating profit this year.
Momentum within our business is evidenced  
by winning new business nationwide across 
multiple sectors, and financial performance for 
the second half of the year accelerated with 
revenue up 5% and EBITDA
3
 up 15% compared 
to the first half of the year.
The achievement of our first operating profit is 
another important milestone for THUS. Our next 
financial goal is to deliver, for our stakeholders, 
a return on capital employed greater than our 
weighted average cost of capital.
To achieve this goal we must continue to  
win business from new customers and extend 
relationships with existing customers whilst 
maintaining our disciplines of operational 
productivity, sound cash management and  
a capital investment programme focused  
on driving future growth.

11 I am pleased to report that this has been 
another year of strong growth and achievement 
for your Company, with revenue up by 8% to 
£576.2 million, and the achievement of our 
first operating profit of £4.0 million compared 
with an operating loss
1
 of £9.5 million last year. 
It has been a busy year with major project 
implementations, growth in new services and 
the refinancing of our balance sheet, providing 
greater borrowing facilities on better terms  
than previously. 
I take great pride in your Company’s ability to 
win and successfully implement large Managed 
solutions contracts for our customers, and to 
continue to grow our next-generation services. 
Against the backdrop of a tough and challenging 
UK business services market, THUS has improved 
its competitive position and, once again, 
increased its market share. 
In addition to achieving the important milestone  
of operating profit we returned to positive free 
cash flow
2
 in the second half of the year,  
after the heavy investment in integration costs  
and the capital investment in the three major 
customer projects we announced last year. 
Indeed, 83% of capital investment this year was 
focused on customer related activity, up from the 
77% I announced last year. All of this bodes well 
for the future.
In July 2007 we refinanced our balance sheet 
with a new £1 10 million, five year facility on 
favourable terms. Our balance sheet strength, 
with net gearing at only 6.9%, gives our 
customers confidence and we maintain a  
healthy cash balance.
In June 2007 our largest shareholder, United 
Utilities, successfully disposed of its shareholding 
in your Company. As a consequence Martin 
Beesley, the Non-executive Director representing 
United Utilities, resigned from your Board. 
In December 2007 , Jo Connell resigned from  
your Board after seven years of service. Jo was 
an active and lively member of your Board  
who took a keen interest in many facets of  
your Company. Her insights and experience  
in technology and customer service were  
greatly valued.
We offer both Jo and Martin our thanks and best 
wishes for the future.
In November 2007 , we were pleased to welcome 
Alison Wood to your Board. Alison brings a 
wealth of experience in corporate strategy, 
government relations and mergers and acquisition 
activity, and will significantly reinforce our 
knowledge and expertise in these areas.
It is the energy and initiative of our staff in THUS 
that provides the fuel for our growth and many 
achievements. We recognise the challenge in 
our market and the uncertainty about the UK 
economy, but we are proud to have committed 
staff full of enterprise who share our optimism for 
the future. I offer them all my sincere thanks and 
congratulations for another successful year.

THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008 I was particularly pleased to announce our 
maiden operating profit for the year at our 
Preliminary results in May. Our growth in profits 
has been achieved from our increased market 
share and improved productivity, validating our 
strategy to focus on next-generation services  
in the UK business services market.
The transition from legacy to next-generation 
services continues and has improved our  
overall revenue mix. Over 70% of all new major 
corporate and public sector contracts
1
 this year 
were for next-generation services. These services 
offer our customers greater efficiency, features 
and functionality within their businesses. 
Managed solutions revenue increased by 17% 
and data services revenue increased by 1 1%. 
Although revenue from voice services grew by 
1 1%, we do not expect continued growth in 
Carrier Pre-Select (CPS) services, since these 
services will lose traction in the market as 
customers increasingly embrace Internet  
Protocol (IP) services and converged solutions. 
THUS is strongly positioned. Our consultative 
engagement with our customers, our understanding 
of their business and telecommunication needs, 
and our innovative approach to convergence  
and service evolution allows us to sustain a 
competitive edge. THUS has a strong track 
record of service innovation, and this year has 
been no exception with fifteen new service 
enhancements launched to benefit our customers 
and improve our competitive position.
Our capital investment continues at almost 10%  
of revenue, with 83% focused directly on customer 
related activity. This is a higher percentage than 
last year, reflecting our success in winning larger 
and more complex Managed solutions customers. 
Nevertheless, we do not neglect our back office 
or core network and we have improved the 
availability on our core MPLS network, and the 
consistently high levels of service quality we offer. 
In addition, we have received ISO/IEC 
27001:2005 accreditation for the Information 
Security Management System supporting our 
MPLS network. This complements our longer 
standing ISO 9001:2000 accreditation.  
These standards give confidence to our customers 
about the quality standards in our business, and 
allow us to compete in new business areas.
As we have grown our business, our increased 
scale has offered new opportunities to improve 
our operating efficiency and productivity. 
Revenue grew by 8% this year but our 
operating costs
2
 reduced by 8%. At 14.4% of 
revenue, our operating costs
2
 are now below 
the level achieved before we made our two 
acquisitions in 2006, reinforcing the successful 
integration of Your Communications and Legend 
Communications into THUS. All of this improves 
our competitiveness and our ability to further 
scale our business from new revenue growth.
Our business strategy is sound. We have the 
scale and capability to compete and successfully 
implement large and complex bespoke customer 
applications. We are strongly positioned to 
benefit as our customers and our industry makes 
the transition to next-generation services.  
We have a talented and committed workforce, 
with an enviable track record on service 
innovation and enterprise. Although there is 
uncertainty about the UK economy, the outlook 
for this financial year is in line with the Board’s 
expectations.

13 Results 
The focus of our performance review is on our 
continuing operations
1
 which are based solely  
in the UK. Unless otherwise stated, comparatives 
are against the prior year.
Continuing operations
 1
Revenue increased by 8% to £576.2m  
(2007: £532.7m). Demand for next-generation 
services accelerated with revenue for these 
services increasing by 1 1% whilst revenue from 
our legacy services increased by 6%.
Gross profit increased 6% to £95.6m  
(2007: £89.7m) and gross profit margins were 
16.6% (2007: 16.8%). Over 60% of variable 
gross margin is now derived from next-generation 
services, up 7% on the prior year.
EBITDA
2
 increased by 33% to £57 .0m  
(2007: £42.9m), representing the third 
consecutive year of expansion, and EBITDA
2
 
margins improved to 9.9% (2007: 8.0%). 
Growth in next-generation services variable gross 
margin contributed £18.8m of the improvement 
in EBITDA
2
 and combined with cost savings (net 
of other operating income) of £4.3m more than 
compensated for the decline in legacy variable 
gross margin of £9.0m. 
After depreciation and amortisation charges  
of £53.0m (2007: £52.4m) the Group  
delivered its first operating profit of £4.0m for 
the full year. This compared to an operating loss, 
before restructuring costs, of £9.5m last year. 
Net financing expenses increased by £2.8m  
to £6.8m (2007: £4.0m).
A tax charge of £3.4m was reported for the 
year. Last year a tax credit of £69.6m arose  
due to recognition of the deferred tax asset. As a 
result, the loss for the year was £6.2m compared 
to a profit of £54.5m last year.
The deferred tax asset at 31 March 2008  
was £56.4m (31 March 2007: £60.6m).  
The reduction of £4.2m was primarily due to the 
change in corporation tax rate from 30% to 28%.
Update on integration plan
The integration of Your Communications and 
Legend Communications has been substantially 
completed. The remaining activities continue to 
proceed ahead of original expectations and the 
company achieved, as previously advised, 90% 
of the £30m forecast annual synergy savings 
exiting this year on a run rate basis.
Financial position and capital structure
THUS is funded by equity, together with an 
element of bank debt and a small amount of 
finance leases.
Cash flows
EBITDA
2
 less capital expenditure was £0.5m  
(2007: negative £(16.4)m). 
Working capital outflows were £3.6m (2007: 
outflows £5.8m) and together with £4.3m  
of net interest payments and other movements of 
£1.4m resulted in a free cash outflow
3
 of £6.0m 
(2007: outflow £25.7m). Free cash flow
3
 for the 
second half of the year improved significantly 
resulting in an inflow of £6.9m compared to an 
outflow of £12.9m for the first half. 
Other movements in net debt totalled £(0.1)m. 
As a result, net debt increased by £6.1m from 
£25.8m at 1 April 2007 to £31.9m at 31 March 
2008 with net gearing of 6.9% compared to 
5.5% at 31 March 2007 .

Directors’ Report:
Financial Review
Basic loss per share for continuing operations
1
 
was 3.40p compared to basic earnings per 
share of 30.29p last year.
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations represent the results  
of Demon Netherlands in the current year and 
prior year. 
This year discontinued operations reported a 
profit of £2.0m principally due to the receipt  
of a tax refund from the Dutch tax authorities.
Last year discontinued operations’ revenue was 
£3.2m and operating profit was £0.4m reflecting 
the sale of Demon Netherlands in June 2006. 
The consideration received for the sale of Demon 
Netherlands gave rise to a post-tax gain on sale 
of £29.0m and resulted in a profit for the year  
of £29.4m.
Basic earnings per share for discontinued 
operations was 1.09p down from 16.34p  
last year. 
Dividend
The Company has not declared or paid a 
dividend on its share capital (2007: £Nil). 
Given the Company’s stage of development 
and the accumulated losses from the network 
deployment, the Board is not yet able to declare 
a dividend.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure (including expenditure  
on intangible assets) for continuing operations
1
 
was £56.5m compared with £59.3m last year. 
This is equivalent to 10% of revenue compared 
with 1 1% last year and is in-line with our stated 
long-term financial target of approximately 10% 
of revenue.
Growth related expenditure increased to 83% 
or £47 .0m of the total with £37 .5m spent on 
connecting customers to our network principally 
to receive next-generation services and a further 
£4.7m spent to enhance the capacity of our 
network. Other expenditure was £9.5m and 
included £4.9m related to the integration of Your 
Communications and Legend Communications.

THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008 Equity
THUS had approximately 183.03m ordinary 
shares in issue at 31 March 2008 (31 March 
2007: 183.03m) and a market capitalisation  
of £218m (31 March 2007: £337m).
In June 2007 , United Utilities sold its entire 
22.63% holding in THUS. 
At 31 December 2007 , the contingent 
consideration that was potentially payable 
to United Utilities for the purchase of Your 
Communications in February 2006 expired. 
This was payable in shares, dependant on the 
level of the THUS share price. No additional 
contingent consideration became payable 
between 1 April 2007 and 31 December 2007 
and consequently the value of goodwill recorded 
on the balance sheet was reduced by £7 .3 million 
to reflect the lower than estimated overall cost of 
the acquisition, with a corresponding adjustment  
to balance sheet reserves.
The Employee Share Trust purchased £1.2m of 
THUS shares during the year. The number of own 
shares held by the Trust at 31 March 2008 was 
1.6m (2007: 0.9m). 
Further details on the issued share capital and 
shares held by the Trust is included in Notes 27 
and 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cash balance 
The cash balance at the end of the year was 
£71.6m. The balance is more than adequate  
to meet working capital needs for the 
foreseeable future.
Bank debt 
Following an extensive evaluation of financing 
options the Group refinanced its existing bank 
facility in July 2007 with a new five year 
facility. The renegotiation of the facility on more 
favourable terms than the existing arrangements 
demonstrated the increased strength and 
capability of our business.
As at 31 March 2008, THUS had total 
indebtedness of £103.5m (31 March 2007: 
£57 .1m), comprising £100.0m of bank debt  
and £3.5m of finance leases.
THUS’ main bank debt is governed by standard 
banking covenants relating to the ratio of total net 
debt to EBITDA and interest cover, with interest 
charged in a range from LIBOR plus 0.75% to 
1.75%, depending on the ratio of total debt  
to EBITDA. The bank debt is repayable in full  
in 2012. Further detail is included in Note 23  
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Working capital
THUS has a strong track record in management 
of working capital, and successfully integrating 
the two acquisitions presented further 
opportunities to reduce debtor days of 44 at  
31 March 2007 to 40 at 31 March 2008.
John Maguire, Chief Financial Officer 
With the capital structure representing the financial 
foundations of the business, THUS has taken a 
conservative stance to funding. Net gearing at the year  
end was below 7%.
1 Continuing operations exclude the results of Demon 
Netherlands, Contact Centre and Interactive for all years.
2 Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation (including 
impairment) and amortisation (EBITDA) is stated before 
restructuring costs of £1.6m in 2007 and £8.8m in 2006. 
3 Operating cash after interest, taxation and capital 
expenditure.
4  Interest excludes loan costs written off, loan amortisation costs 
and net interest associated with the THUS pension scheme.
Financial data for the charts on page 14 is prepared under IFRS 
for 2005–2008 and UK GAAP for 2004.
Summary
Demand for our next-generation services 
accelerated this year and resulted in an  
improved revenue mix, our third consecutive year 
of EBITDA
2
 expansion and our first full year of 
operating profit. We retain a strong balance 
sheet, with low levels of net gearing, and 
returned to positive free cash flow
 3
 in the second 
half of the year. The outlook for this financial year 
is in line with the Board’s expectations.

THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008 1 Operating costs exclude depreciation and amortisation 
(including impairment), restructuring costs and other  
operating income.
Growth
THUS must continue to build market share 
successfully in order to meet our longer-term 
objectives. Based on continuing operations
1
 
revenue growth, THUS improved its estimated 
market share from approximately 7 .6% to 
approximately 8.7% during the year, reflecting  
our success in winning new business. This resulted 
in an increase in the ratio of continuing operations
1
 
revenue to assets
2
 from 1.19 to 1.29 times, 
compared with our long-term target of 1.5 to  
2.0 times.
Cost of sales
Although network reach is extensive, it is not 
economically feasible to carry all customers’ 
traffic end-to-end and payments to other 
operators, for customer connection and service 
interconnect are the largest component of our 
cost of sales.
Since flotation, THUS has made successive 
improvements to contain the increase in payments 
by increasing interconnect points with other 
operators, improving traffic routing across the 
network and participating in a wholesale market 
for the provision of last mile access. 
The integration of the THUS network with those 
of the companies acquired in 2006, particularly 
that of Your Communications, has delivered 
further network efficiencies.
Scale efficiencies
This year in continuing operations
1
, EBITDA: 
Revenue improved to 10% (2007: 8%), reflecting 
the benefits achieved from our increased scale 
and the successful delivery of the planned 
savings from the integration activities surrounding 
the acquisition of Your Communications and 
Legend Communications. The successful 
integration has also resulted in an improvement in 
our operating costs
3
, expressed as a percentage 
of revenue, which fell to 14% of revenue.
Investment 
Capital investment was 10% of continuing 
operations
1
 revenue (2007: 1 1%), broadly  
in line with our long-term target of approximately 
10% of revenue. 
In the year under review, growth-related 
expenditure was £47 .0m or 83% of the total and 
was primarily focused on customer connections 
and further capacity enhancements to our 
network. Other expenditure was £9.5m and 
included £4.9m related to the integration of Your 
Communications and Legend Communications.

Quality
During the year, we received the ISO/IEC 
27001:2005 certification for our Information 
Security Management System supporting our 
MPLS network. Achievement of this accreditation 
demonstrates that robust and adequate 
controls to address confidentiality, integrity 
and availability of information are in place 
to safeguard the information of customers, 
stakeholders and trading counterparties. 
In 2003, THUS also achieved ISO 9001:2000 
accreditation which certifies our processes to 
international quality standards and is subject to 
independent audit twice a year. 
Customer satisfaction 
Our existing customer satisfaction programme 
has continued to be extended over the past year 
and now covers all of our products and services. 
Our ongoing roll-out of surveys will enable us 
to give all of our customers the opportunity to 
provide feedback on the products and services 
we provide.
Network performance
Availability on the core Multi-Protocol Label 
Switching (MPLS) network was consistently above 
our 99.95% target throughout the year, enabling 
THUS to manage sharply increasing volumes  
of MPLS traffic securely for our customers.

17 Directors’ Report:
Other Financial Issues
Accounting estimates and judgements 
Critical accounting judgements in applying the 
Group’s accounting policies and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, 
requires the use of accounting estimates and 
assumptions. It also requires the Directors to 
exercise their judgement in the process of 
applying the Group’s accounting policies. 
Estimates, assumptions and judgements are 
evaluated based on available information and 
experience. As the use of estimates is inherent in 
financial reporting, actual results could differ from 
these estimates. The areas involving a higher 
degree of judgement or complexity which have  
a significant risk of causing material adjustments  
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
are described below.
Revenue
The Group earns revenue from a number of 
different products and services, some of which 
are delivered under bespoke contracts.  
In applying the Group’s accounting policies 
in respect of revenue recognition, a significant 
degree of judgement and estimation may be 
required in interpreting contracts and estimating 
values to be used in calculating revenue and 
associated costs in each accounting period.
Interconnect income and payments to other 
telecommunications operators
In certain instances THUS relies on other 
operators to measure the traffic flows 
interconnecting with our networks. Estimates  
are used in these cases to determine the amount 
of income receivable from, or payments we  
need to make to, these other operators. The 
prices at which these services are charged are 
often regulated and are subject to retrospective 
adjustment and estimates are used in assessing 
the likely effect of these adjustments.
Property arrangements 
Our property rationalisation programme has 
continued to mitigate surplus property liabilities 
over the last 12 months with some notable 
successes. The programme is ongoing.  
However, in the current economic environment 
it is recognised that it will take further time to 
mitigate the surplus liabilities. In addition, vacant 
property Empty Rates relief in England and 
Wales will also be more limited from April 2008 
onwards. Estimates have been made as to the 
cost of vacant properties and any shortfalls 
arising from the sublease rental income being 
lower than the principal lease liability borne by 
THUS. Any such costs or shortfalls have been 
recognised as a balance sheet provision.
Deferred tax
Management judgement is required when 
assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets 
should be recognised, with consideration given 
to the timing and level of future taxable income. 
The recognition of the deferred tax asset on the 
balance sheet in 2007 reflected the increased 
momentum in the operating performance of the 
business and the delivery of the majority of the 
integration programme relating to the acquisitions 
in 2006. Further details are contained within 
Notes 13 and 26 to the Consolidated  
Financial Statements.
Post-retirement benefits
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme 
is assessed annually in accordance with IAS 
19. An independent actuarial valuation of the 
defined benefit pension scheme funding was 
completed in the previous financial year.  
The size of any surplus or deficit is sensitive to  
the market value of the assets held by the scheme 
and to actuarial assumptions, which include 
price inflation, pension and salary increases, 
the discount rate used in assessing actuarial 
liabilities, mortality and other demographic 
assumptions and the levels of contributions.  
With reference to the discount rate used, IFRS,  
as adopted by the EU, requires this to relate  
to high-quality bond yields.
Providing for doubtful debts
THUS provides services to substantially all 
customers on credit terms. Certain debts will not 
be paid through the default of a small number 
of customers. Estimates, based on our historical 
experience, are used in determining the level of 
debts that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, 
be collected. These estimates include such factors 
as the current state of the UK economy and 
particular industry issues.
Useful lives for property, plant and equipment
The plant and equipment in THUS’ networks are 
long-lived with cables and switching equipment 
operating for over ten years, and underground 
ducts being used for decades. The annual 
depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated 
service lives allocated to each type of asset. 
Asset lives are assessed annually and changed 
when necessary to reflect current thinking on their 
remaining lives in light of technological change, 
prospective economic utilisation and physical 
condition of the assets concerned. 
Asset impairment
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.  
In addition, impairment tests are performed  
on an annual basis where there is an indication 
that impairment may exist. In performing these 
impairment tests management’s judgement is 
required in preparing future cash flow projections, 
and then assessing an appropriate discount rate 
to be applied to these cash flows.
The cost of capital used to discount pre-tax  
cash flows can have a significant effect on  
the calculation of the recoverable amount. 
The cost of capital which is expressed as a 
percentage is derived from the Group’s post-tax 
weighted average cost of capital.
Future cash flows are based on cash flow 
projections for ten years with cash flows in the 
first five years based on approved forecasts 
which are then extrapolated in perpetuity using 
a nominal long-term growth rate. As future 
cash flows may deviate to some degree from 
forecasts, the results of the impairment review 
are sensitive to such changes. Further details are 
contained within Note 3 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements – ‘Impairment’.
The preparation of the Group’s financial 
statements requires the Directors to exercise  
their judgement. Accounting estimates, 
assumptions and judgements are evaluated  
to ensure they remain appropriate.

Treasury policies and objectives
THUS’ treasury policy aims to minimise the use  
of complex financial instruments and manage 
cash to meet the needs of a tightly managed 
trading company and conservative balance 
sheet. Within this framework, specific 
consideration is given to managing financial  
risks arising from limited foreign currency exposure 
with supplier payments in US Dollars and Euros 
and exposure to changes in interest rates on 
our bank loans. With respect to the bank loans 
further detail is contained within Note 24 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements – ‘Interest  
rate risk’.
Tight control exists over treasury activities,  
with any non-standard instruments requiring 
approval from the Chief Financial Officer or 
Board, depending on their nature. THUS has  
no off-balance sheet financing or special purpose 
vehicles, and treasury activities are not run as  
a profit centre. 
Creditor payment policy and practice
The Group’s current policy concerning the 
payment of the majority of its trade creditors  
is to follow the Better Payment Practice Code. 
Copies are available upon request from the 
Company Secretary. For other suppliers, the 
Group’s policy and practice is to settle terms  
of payment when agreeing the terms of the 
transaction, to include the terms in contracts,  
and to pay in accordance with its contractual 
and legal obligations. The Group’s ‘creditor  
days’ at 31 March 2008 were 44 days.  
The Company did not have any trade  
creditors at 31 March 2008.
Repurchase of shares
Resolution 9 to be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting seeks authority for the 
Company to repurchase its own shares.  
Any such repurchase will have to be financed  
out of distributable reserves.
Currently the Company has a deficit on its 
distributable reserves. The Company is in the 
course of examining whether or not, through 
an internal re-organisation, the deficit can be 
eliminated. 
Any such re-organisation will require the consent 
or approval of certain third parties, including the 
Court and the Company’s banks. Currently,  
it is not possible to state with complete certainty 
whether or not the proposed internal  
re-organisation will be completed.

19 Directors’ Report:
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Directors’ policies for  
managing principal risks
There is a process for identifying, evaluating  
and managing significant risks faced by 
the business. Through ‘Acertus Governance’ 
software, risk reviews are undertaken regularly  
by the respective business areas throughout the 
year to identify and assess key risks associated 
with the achievement of our business objective. 
This software requires risk owners to regularly 
monitor and review risks and associated controls 
and action plans, to evidence the management 
of principal risks within the Group. 
Quarterly reviews have been carried out by  
the Risk Management Group to ensure this is  
a continuous process which is embedded in  
our business culture. All aspects of business 
risk, such as strategic, operational, commercial, 
financial, compliance and business continuity risk 
are covered by the risk assessments. The Internal 
Audit function provides independent assurance  
to the Directors on the controls applied to 
mitigate key business risks. The quarterly  
reviews are reported to the Audit Committee  
and consequently to the Board. 
The risks identified and discussed within this 
section are not an exhaustive list of the risks 
faced by the business, but are considered by 
management to be some of the principal risks. 
Our aim is to manage and control identified  
risk through our established processes but risk 
cannot be eliminated completely. 
BT’s next-generation network
BT is consulting on access and interconnect 
arrangements between itself and other operators 
in relation to its ‘21st Century Network’ 
programme (the migration of existing, multiple 
service-specific networks to a single converged 
next-generation network). As BT is by far the 
largest fixed line operator in the UK, this move 
impacts all other operators and brings potential 
operational and commercial risks. We are 
actively involved in various working groups on 
this topic such as the Consult21 Steering Board 
and the Ofcom body, NGNuk. We anticipate 
that in respect of many of the new interconnection 
products, BT will be designated by Ofcom as 
having ‘significant market power’ and therefore  
be subject to regulation. The programme, 
however, continues to experience delays. 
Notably, we already have our own next-
generation network in place, having invested  
in network and service capability to evolve  
our services, and so maximise the opportunities 
from this development. 
 
BT 
We continue to monitor the performance  
of BT as our main supplier, and in particular,  
BT Openreach. There is a potential risk that 
service delivery to our customers is impacted  
by poor supplier performance. Control measures 
include continual supplier engagement and 
active lobbying of the regulator in order to 
mitigate this risk. 
The main identified  
strategic risks are:
Market structure, industry economics  
and investor confidence
The UK fixed line telecommunication market 
is characterised by over-investment in 
infrastructure and networks to supply traditional 
telecommunication services. This has created 
a challenging and competitive landscape in 
which price competition for traditional fixed 
line telecommunication services has been 
intense, making it difficult for any individual 
provider to gain scale and deliver meaningful 
returns. More generally, unfavourable economic 
conditions in 2007 /08 have also impacted 
telecommunications, along with other sectors. 
Several risks can arise as a consequence, 
including possible reductions in share price. 
THUS has a limited ability to control these risks 
directly; however, we have an active programme 
of engaging with key stakeholders and the City.  
Our focus on creating value for customers through 
early investment in a next-generation network  
and our product and service portfolio, has 
positioned us to deliver growth in a challenging 
market and economy. 
Regulation
The Group operates in a highly regulated 
environment, although the focus of much of  
the regulation is on companies with ‘significant 
market power’, such as BT. Ofcom holds powers 
to set and amend regulations for the industry and 
to impose sanctions, including financial penalties. 
Ofcom has laid down a number of ‘General 
Conditions of Entitlement’ which apply to all 
companies providing publicly available electronic 
communications services in the UK. Our business 
operates within this regulatory environment and 
we actively work with the regulator, contributing 
to various industry and government forums and 
debates in order to influence regulatory outcomes. 
Quarterly reviews have been carried  
out by the Risk Management Group to 
ensure this is a continuous process which 
is embedded in our business culture. 
>
20
THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008 The main identified  
commercial risk is:
Delivering growth
There is always an element of risk associated 
with growing a business within a market 
undergoing profound change. Sales management 
monitors the effectiveness of leads into our sales 
pipeline and corresponding conversion rates.  
The forecast level of sales and other factors 
required to achieve targets are also examined 
regularly. Regular reporting within the Group 
identifies levels of margin at risk in order that 
appropriate action can be taken. 
The main identified  
operational risks are:
Maintaining access to the network
We are reliant on our IT systems and maintenance 
of network integrity, quality and availability is a 
significant operational risk due to the impact on 
our customer delivery. For this reason, business 
continuity is of major importance to THUS and 
our customers. Our platform availability is closely 
monitored on an ongoing basis.
Meeting customer expectations
The business strives to continually meet and 
exceed agreed levels of service. Failure to do 
so could impact customer satisfaction levels 
affecting future sales, financial performance and 
possibly brand reputation. Customer satisfaction 
levels are regularly measured and reported on 
by our Customer Services function. Moreover, 
in demonstrating our commitment to quality, the 
business has been certified for a number of years 
to the ISO 9001:2000 standard. In 2007 /08, 
the business has increased its portfolio of 
recognised accreditations with the addition of  
the International Information Security Standard 
ISO/IEC 27001:2005, for its MPLS network. 
The main identified  
people risk is:
Recruiting, retaining and training employees
Recruiting and retaining appropriate employees 
can also impact business performance.  
The Human Resources department implements 
policy and procedures in this respect, including 
family-friendly policies, employee benefit 
initiatives and salary benchmarking. Our 2007 
Employee Survey results were very encouraging, 
particularly in the areas of employee retention 
and satisfaction. 
We must also ensure that our employees  
receive appropriate training to safeguard 
excellent service and delivery to our customers. 
Training requirements are identified through 
regular appraisals carried out by line managers 
and our training processes are assessed as  
part of our Investors in People accreditation.
The main identified  
financial risks are:
Bank covenants
THUS has a £1 10m bank facility. The loan is 
used for general corporate purposes including 
working capital requirements. Our bank debt 
is subject to two standard EBITDA-related 
covenants. While headroom in reporting 
against these covenants is considered more than 
adequate, the risk and corresponding cash levels 
are closely monitored and reported on to ensure 
that any risk of covenant breach is mitigated.
Billing
The risk of inaccurate billing is heightened in 
the telecommunications industry due to complex 
pricing structures. THUS management has 
implemented several controls to minimise this 
risk. Our commitment to accurate billing can 
be demonstrated via our Ofcom Metering and 
Billing Scheme Approval for our THUS branded 
switched telephony products. 
Pensions
Current legislation requires pension shortfalls  
in respect of final salary pensions to be funded 
fully in cash. There is a risk that due to economic 
and social factors (which are largely outside 
the control of the Company) pension liabilities 
increase. Asset and liability levels are therefore 
closely monitored by both the Company and 
pension Trustees to ensure proactive decision 
making is implemented as required.

21 Directors’ Report:
Employees
Talent management
In 2007 , we launched our ‘Talent Spotting’ 
programme which involved a rigorous 
application process, internal and third-party 
recommendations and a series of assessment 
exercises. The programme successfully  
identified high potential employees who  
have now embarked on personalised 
development programmes. 
Our Talent Spotting programme is designed  
to help high calibre employees make a valued 
and lasting contribution to the Company’s 
success, whilst enhancing their personal  
and leadership skills.
Investors in People
Our commitment to our employees is endorsed 
by our Investors in People accreditation.
We value this accreditation as it is a highly 
effective tool which focuses on training and 
developing our employees to achieve our 
business objectives.
Reward
The performance of managers and senior 
professional staff is linked to the Group’s financial 
results by way of a bonus scheme which has 
targets linked to revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. 
Reward has an important role to play with regard 
to employee retention and we continue to carry 
out annual benchmarking comparing employee 
salaries against the market. To allow flexibility 
and the ability to react to changing market 
conditions, salaries are reviewed quarterly to 
ensure remuneration is appropriate to retain  
high-quality employees. 
For sales staff, commission schemes are based 
on billed revenue, with a weighting to increase 
reward for the sale of services with higher  
profit margins and next-generation services.  
This commission scheme is designed to focus 
sales staff on value creation for our customers 
and shareholders.
Our culture
We place a strong emphasis on creating a 
positive working culture, encouraging a clear 
understanding of our objectives and key business 
imperatives. Our talented and skilled employees 
underpin our ability to deliver innovative 
telecommunication services that bring value  
to our customers’ business operations. 
The enthusiasm, flexibility and continued 
development of our employees remain vital 
to achieving our overall objectives and we 
continue to invest in training and development to 
enhance their skillbase. Providing our employees 
with the resources they require to maximise 
their performance and drive business growth 
remains a priority. Our objective is to ensure 
measures are in place to retain and develop our 
employees while, at the same time, attracting 
talented individuals to join our organisation.
Maximising our people performance
At THUS, we encourage, value and reward 
superior performance. The performance of 
employees is measured against clear, business-
focused objectives and through our ‘Windmills’ 
performance appraisal process. This is supported 
by an on-going programme of two-way 
communication, including a quarterly one-to-one 
process which ensures that qualitative discussions 
are taking place with employees at regular 
intervals throughout the year. 
Developing our people
We are focused on developing employee skill 
levels and a strong corporate culture, which best 
facilitate growth, superb customer service and 
cost competitiveness, all aimed at enhancing 
sustainable growth in shareholder value.  
The capability, performance and commitment  
of our employees remain key factors in our ability 
to grow our business in the competitive market in 
which we operate. We have a highly qualified 
workforce, with our recent employee survey 
indicating that over 60% of our employees have 
degrees, and/or professional qualifications. 
Investment in training and development of our 
employees continues and our open learning 
facility, which is available to both employees  
and their families, continues to be well used.
At THUS, we are keen to develop the careers  
of our employees. During the past financial year, 
35% of new positions within the Company have 
been filled by internal applicants, giving many 
employees the opportunity to broaden their  
skills and further develop their careers within  
our Company.
Growing our talent
We place a strong emphasis on continuous 
professional development. We believe that this  
is vital to attracting and retaining the highest 
calibre people. We have a number of ways  
of doing this:
Graduate & apprenticeship programme
We have an established Graduate programme 
which provides participants with experience, 
exposure and education through a series of 
placements, work experience rotations and 
further education. This programme is aimed  
at continually growing our talent pool.
During 2008, we are launching a new initiative 
to introduce apprentices to our Company. 
The successful candidates will be given the 
opportunity to learn ‘on the job’ across a number 
of business areas and will be mentored by our 
own employees.
Undergraduate sponsorships
This year, in addition to recruiting graduate 
trainees into our business, we are also sponsoring 
ten undergraduate students from The University 
of Greenwich. This sponsorship allows these 
students to undertake their chosen studies without 
the financial pressures which might impede their 
effective learning.
In addition, we also have a number of other 
educational programmes in place, including 
sponsoring university placement students for 
CISCO course graduates to undertake six week 
placements within our organisation, helping the 
students to develop their skills and our Company 
to develop potential talent. We are delighted that 
several of these students have subsequently been 
employed by the Company.

THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008 The Group has offered all employees access to 
an annual Sharesave scheme during 2007 /08 
which allows them to save and buy shares 
in the Company at a discounted rate thereby 
sharing in any increase in the share price over 
the savings period. The Group Personal Pension 
(GPP) plan matches employee contributions up to 
6% affording employees the opportunity to build 
meaningful pension provisions for the future while 
strengthening our ability to attract and retain 
quality employees.
During 2007 /08, we launched U@THUS 
reward, an on-line benefits programme for all 
THUS employees. This programme affords 
employees the opportunity to purchase additional 
benefits to suit their lifestyle, wherever possible, 
taking advantage of the Inland Revenue 
approved ‘salary sacrifice’ scheme which results 
in tax and national insurance savings for both 
employees and the Group. Examples of benefits 
on offer under the scheme include childcare 
vouchers, health screening and tax free bicycles. 
Communication and consultation
At THUS, we encourage communication and 
employee involvement through our elected 
employee forum, Xchange. This forum allows 
THUS to share business information with 
employees, encouraging an awareness of 
the financial and economic factors affecting 
the Group and, importantly, takes account of 
employee views and feedback when planning 
change. This employee forum, which meets every 
two months, is integral to facilitating the smooth 
path of business development and evolution.
Equal opportunities
THUS is committed to promoting equal 
opportunities for all of our employees. Our policy 
in respect of employment of disabled persons is 
the same as that relating to all other employees 
in matters of training and career development. 
Where employees become disabled during 
the course of their employment, we make every 
effort to make reasonable adjustments to their 
working environment to enable their continued 
employment. 
Talented
Our talented and skilled employees 
underpin our ability to deliver 
innovative telecommunication services 
that bring value to our customers’  
business operations.

23 Directors’ Report:
Environment and Community
We have also committed to achieving the 
International Organisation for Standardisation 
(ISO) 14001:2004 accreditation for our 
Environmental Management System.  
The implementation of the two standards  
will enable THUS to control its Occupational  
Health, Safety and Environmental risks and 
improve on our performance.
Community relations
Across the Group, we place strong emphasis  
on our charitable and community activities.  
We are keen to play an active role in the 
communities in which we are based and we 
actively encourage employees to participate  
in community relations activities. 
Charitable and political donations 
Following the share consolidation in March 
2006, the fractional share entitlements were 
sold, raising net proceeds of approximately 
£274,000. The Directors’ aim was to apply 
these proceeds for gifts or donations to a range 
of worthy causes and a number of initiatives 
are underway throughout the UK. During the 
year, the Group made the following charitable 
donations: £2,500 to the Victim Support Sunrise 
Appeal; £3,000 to the Scottish Outward Bound 
Association; £4,400 to Manchester Children’s 
Hospital and £30,000 to the University of 
Greenwich. The Group made no donations  
for political purposes. 
Outward Bound Trust
The Outward Bound Trust is an educational 
charity which inspires young people from all 
walks of life to fulfil their potential through 
challenging outdoor experiences, raising  
self-esteem and preparing them to face the 
future with confidence. THUS provides financial 
assistance in the form of bursaries for young 
people from disadvantaged backgrounds who 
would not normally have access to, or be able  
to afford, an outward bound course. During 
2007 /08, we helped over 150 children from 
schools across Scotland, Manchester and London.
During this year, our employees also took part in 
the Scottish Outward Bound Association (SOBA) 
challenge. SOBA is an educational charity 
offering professional team-building courses  
which also helps to further fund the Outward 
Bound Trust courses for disadvantaged young  
people, while developing the team-building 
and leadership skills of our employees.
Corporate Social Responsibility
At THUS, we are committed to Corporate  
Social Responsibility (CSR) and we have policies 
in place to ensure that we operate in a safe, 
ethical and responsible manner which protects 
the environment as well as safeguarding the 
health and safety of our employees, customers 
and the communities in which we operate.
 
Our CSR steering group manages our activities 
and is drawn from several disciplines across 
the Group. The committee meets regularly and 
reports to the Management Board on progress.
We are a member of Scottish Business  
in the Community and benchmark ourselves 
against other companies.
Safety, health and environment 
The commitment and participation of all 
employees is vital to the efficient and effective 
implementation and control of our safety,  
health and environmental management systems. 
In order to meet our responsibility to protect  
the environment, employees and the business,  
THUS continues to focus on enhancing our 
existing safe working practices and the 
production of a robust risk management  
strategy that will eliminate operational hazards  
or minimise the risks incurred. Our performance 
reflects the success of this approach. The total 
number of internally recorded accidents remains 
very low, with a monthly average of 1.1.  
One accident has been reported to the  
enforcing authority as a ’3 day accident’. 
Improvements have been introduced to report 
key health and safety performance indicators 
to the Board with both reactive and proactive 
information being provided. This ensures 
the timely identification and prioritisation of 
performance trends. 
Significant elements of our safety, health 
and environmental management systems’ 
documentation have been revised to ensure  
that a single set of policies and procedures  
is adopted. A range of supporting documents 
and templates has been produced to assist 
managers with assessment, planning and 
monitoring activities.
The communication of safety, health and 
environment information to managers and 
employees continues to improve, with the 
addition of a designated Environmental  
Forum that complements the existing Safety  
and Health forums. This provides a basis  
upon which to develop our high standards. 
Environmental management 
To enhance our environmental management 
systems, a set of standards has been produced. 
We continue to work on ways to reduce our 
impact on the environment, the main focus being 
on energy conservation and the use of renewable 
resources, the reuse and recycling of waste 
electrical equipment, a reduction in general 
waste going to landfill, and the effects on the 
environment from travel. This year we generated 
60,008kg of waste electrical equipment,  
98% of which was reused or recycled.
Energy
With a commitment to reducing our impact on 
the environment, 98% of the electricity supply 
points were provided with a source of renewable 
energy this year. 
Achievements
In recognition of our commitment to the 
management of Safety and Health we have 
been awarded The Royal Society for the 
Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) Bronze Award. 
This is the first phase of a 5 year plan to obtain  
a RoSPA Gold Award. This achievement forms an 
integral part of a phased approach to gaining 
the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment 
Series (OHSAS) 18001:2007 accreditation.

THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008 Respect
THUS is committed to ensuring we  
are a ‘good neighbour’ and making a 
genuine contribution to the communities 
we serve.
The Emmaus Foundation
THUS has a long-established relationship with 
Emmaus, which is a self-help and self-supporting 
enterprise offering unemployed and homeless 
people opportunities for work, companionship 
and the chance to regain self-respect through 
their own efforts. The charity enables people  
to move on from their homelessness, providing 
work and a home in a supportive, family 
environment. Companions, as residents are 
known, work full-time collecting, renovating and 
reselling donated furniture. This work supports  
the community financially and enables residents 
to develop skills and rebuild their self-respect.  
All Companions share a commitment to 
rebuilding their lives and participating in the  
life and work of the communities around them.
Other charities
During the year, THUS continued to support  
a number of other charitable and educational 
causes, including The United Kingdom 
Telecommunications Academy (UKTA),  
a charity which helps to support and  
educate students from the developing world  
on how to create and regulate successful 
telecommunications. We also give financial 
assistance in the form of providing free  
telephone lines in support of Women’s Aid  
and their Domestic Abuse Campaigns.
 
The Company also operates a charity matching 
scheme for employees’ personal charitable and 
community relations activities. This included 
donations to Cancer Research, MacMillan 
Cancer Support and Marie Curie Cancer Care 
of £250 each.

judgement is given in his favour.
In addition, the Company may purchase and maintain for any Director

28 Corporate Governance:
Corporate Governance Report
The Board sets the policy to be followed by the Group and continues to be committed 
to high standards of corporate governance. The Group has complied with the 
requirements of the Combined Code in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 
2008 except that the Senior Independent Non-executive Director has not during the 
year attended, in accordance with the Combined Code (provision D.1.1), meetings 
with a range of major shareholders of the Group as explained in the section headed 
‘Relations with shareholders’ on page 30.
Board of Directors
The separation of the roles of the Non-executive Chairman and the Chief Executive 
ensures that there is a well established division of authority and responsibility at the 
most senior level within the Group. The Chairman leads the Board in the determination 
of its strategy and achievement of its objectives. The Chief Executive has direct charge 
of the Group on a day-to-day basis and is accountable to the Board for the financial 
and operational performance of the Group. The division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and Chief Executive is set out in writing and has been agreed by the Board. 
During the year, the Board comprised a Non-executive Chairman, three Executive 
Directors and four Non-executive Directors until the resignation, with effect from 25 June 
2007 , of Martin Beesley as a non-independent Non-executive Director in accordance 
with the terms of the Relationship agreement between the Company and United Utilities 
plc following the disposal by United Utilities of its shareholding in the Company.  
The Board then comprised three Non-executive Directors (all of whom were considered 
to be independent by the Board) in addition to the Chairman and the three Executive 
Directors. Alison Wood was then appointed to the Board as an independent  
Non-executive Director with effect from 1 November 2007 and Jo Connell retired  
from the Board as an independent Non-executive Director, her resignation from the 
Board being effective from 31 December 2007 .
The Non-executive Directors are from varied business and other backgrounds. 
Biographies of all the Directors are set out on pages 26 and 27 , including details of 
professional and business commitments of a significant nature. Induction is provided 
for all new Directors which is tailored to their specific requirements and includes 
meetings with senior management, site visits to business locations and provision of 
key documentation and information. Continuing development is provided through 
presentations and briefing materials in relation to the Group in the course of regular 
Board and Committee meetings and also by external sources such as attendance by 
Directors at seminars conducted by the Company’s professional advisors and other 
recognised bodies.
The Non-executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent and free 
from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise 
of their independent judgement.
All of the Non-executive Directors have held office throughout the year, with the 
exception of Martin Beesley who resigned from the Board on 25 June 2007 ,  
Jo Connell who resigned from the Board on 31 December 2007 and Alison Wood 
who was appointed to the Board on 1 November 2007 . Executive Directors normally 
retire at age 63 in terms of their service contracts. Non-executive Directors are 
appointed for a specified term of three years which may be renewed. The Group 
maintains liability insurance for its Directors and officers.
Ian Chippendale has been identified as the Senior Independent Non-executive 
Director who is available to shareholders for concerns not resolved through the existing 
mechanisms for investor communication.
Directors must stand for election by the shareholders at the first AGM following their 
appointment. All Directors also retire by rotation such that approximately one-third of 
the Board retires and seeks re-election each year. Each Director must retire and seek 
re-election at least every three years. At the forthcoming AGM to be held on 31 July 
2008, Alison Wood offers herself for election and Philip Rogerson and John Maguire 
will retire as Directors and offer themselves for re-election to the Board. Following 
evaluation of the performance of each of those Directors, it is confirmed that each 
individual performs effectively in the role and demonstrates commitment to the role. 
Their continued appointment as Board members is therefore recommended by  
the Board. 
Details of Directors’ remuneration together with the Group’s remuneration policy and  
the principles under which these have been formulated and applied are described in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report as set out on pages 32 to 36.
Control of the Group is through the Board of Directors. The Board’s main roles are to 
promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members, create shareholder 
value, provide leadership of the Group, approve the Group’s strategic objectives and 
promote the highest standards of ethics and integrity in all of the Group’s business 
activities.
The Board met ten times during the year and has a schedule of matters concerning 
key aspects of the Group’s activities which are specifically referred to it for its collective 
decision. The matters reserved to the Board for decision include the approval of the 
Annual Report and any other Financial Statements, the long-term objectives of the 
Group and the strategy necessary to achieve these objectives, the Group’s budgets 
and plans, significant capital expenditure and allocation of resources, significant 
investments and disposals, the arrangements for ensuring the Group manages risks 
effectively, any significant change in accounting policies and the appointment of the 
Company’s main professional advisors.
The types of decision delegated to the Chief Executive relate principally to 
implementation of the business plan and annual budget, competitive positioning  
and relationships with employees, customers and suppliers.
The Board evaluates its performance and that of its Committees and individual 
Directors. The process adopted in respect of the Board is by means of a Board review 
of responses to a questionnaire, completed by each Director, which encourages the 
Directors to draw on their experience to endeavour to ensure that the Group follows 
best practice and to suggest how the Group’s procedures may be improved.  
The Committees also assess their respective terms of reference and effectiveness and 
report the conclusions to the Board, with recommendations for change if necessary. 
The Chairman has a private discussion at least once a year with each Director on a 
range of issues affecting the Group, including an evaluation of the performance of  
the Director and any matters which the Director wishes, individually, to raise.
The Remuneration Committee also reviews the performance of the Chief Executive  
and the other Executive Directors when considering their remuneration arrangements. 
The Chairman’s performance is evaluated by the Non-executive Directors at an annual 
meeting, led by the Senior Independent Non-executive Director, taking account of the 
views of the Executive Directors.

during the year, and the attendance of individual Directors.

on 31 December 2007 .
3 Resigned from the Board on 25 June 2007 .
The Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief 
Operating Officer attended certain meetings of the Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee during the year at the invitation of the Chairman of those Committees.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is 
responsible for ensuring that all Board procedures are observed. Any Director wishing 
to do so, in furtherance of his duties, may take independent professional advice at the 
Group’s expense.
Board Committees
The Board has three principal standing committees: the Audit Committee, Nomination 
Committee and Remuneration Committee. The composition, purpose and function of 
each of these committees are described below. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprised three independent Non-executive Directors except 
during the brief period between the appointment to the Committee on 16 November 
2007 of Alison Wood and the resignation of Jo Connell from the Committee on  
31 December 2007 when it comprised four independent Non-executive Directors.  
The Committee is chaired by Rick Medlock and has written terms of reference.  
It met five times in the year to review the annual and interim accounts, review the 
appropriateness of accounting policies, review internal controls and financial reporting, 
and made recommendations to the Board. It also considers the appointment and fees 
of the external auditors, the appointment of the director of Risk Management (as Head 
of Internal Audit) and reviews the risk management framework, the internal audit plan 
and resulting reports and the Group’s whistle-blowing policy. The Audit Committee 
discusses the action taken on specific areas identified by Board members or in the 
internal and external audit reports. The Committee reviews its terms of reference 
and effectiveness annually and reports its conclusions to the Board, including any 
recommendations for change.
The Committee has also established a policy on the provision of non-audit services by 
the external auditors which requires the Committee to approve in advance the provision 
of certain kinds of those services within defined parameters. The key principles which 
underpin the policy and which are designed to minimise the risk of conflict of interest 
<
29
THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008 arising are that the auditors should not audit their own firm’s work, make management 
decisions for the Group, have a mutuality of financial interest with the Group, or be 
put in the role of advocate for the Group. Prior approval of the Audit Committee is 
also required for any services provided by the external auditors where the cumulative 
annual fees in any year are likely to be in excess of the audit fee for that year. In 
any case activities that may be perceived to be in conflict with the independence 
of the external auditors must be submitted to the Committee for approval prior to 
engagement, regardless of the amounts involved. Details of the non-audit services 
performed during the year and the fees for those services are contained in Note 6 to 
the Financial Statements on page 47 . The Committee, in respect of the year, assessed 
the effectiveness of the external audit service and independence of the external 
auditors. The Committee’s conclusion was that the service continued to be effective and 
that the auditors remained independent, demonstrating effectiveness and commitment 
in the role. A resolution to reappoint the external auditors and to authorise the Directors 
to fix their remuneration will be proposed at the AGM on 31 July 2008.
In respect of the year, the Committee also had a meeting with the external auditors 
without executives present and a meeting with the director of Risk Management  
(in his capacity as Head of Internal Audit) alone.
The Committee has established a policy in relation to the arrangements whereby 
employees of the Group may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters. It reviews the terms  
of the policy and its operation annually.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee reports the outcome of the Audit Committee 
meetings to the Board which receives the minutes of Audit Committee meetings.
The Board considers that the membership of the Audit Committee as a whole has 
sufficient and relevant experience to discharge its functions and that, in particular,  
Rick Medlock has recent and relevant financial experience. The Committee’s terms  
of reference are displayed on the Company’s website at www.thus.net.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by the Group’s Non-executive Chairman and 
comprises the Chief Executive, the Senior Independent Non-executive Director and 
two other independent Non-executive Directors except for the brief period between 
the appointment to the Committee of Alison Wood on 16 November 2007 and the 
resignation from the Committee of Jo Connell on 31 December 2007 during which 
it included three other independent Non-executive Directors. It has written terms of 
reference and its remit is to consider and make recommendations to the Board on 
the appointment and re-election of Directors, having regard to the overall balance 
and composition of the Board, and to review and advise the Board upon issues of 
succession planning. The Chairman of the Nomination Committee reports the outcome 
of the Committee meetings to the Board which receives the minutes of Nomination 
Committee meetings.
In relation to Board appointments, the Committee, in liaison with the Board, prepares 
a profile of the requirements of the role in order to brief external search consultants to 
provide a list of suitable candidates, both external and where appropriate internal for 
the Committee to interview, leading then to a shortlist and ultimate selection of the most 
suitable candidate for recommendation to the Board for appointment. The proposed 
candidate is provided with the opportunity to meet Board members and the senior 
management team prior to acceptance of the appointment. The Committee reviews 
annually its terms of reference and effectiveness, and reports its conclusions to the 
Board, including recommendations for any change. The Committee’s terms of reference 
are displayed on the Company’s website at www.thus.net.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprised exclusively three independent Non-executive 
Directors except during the brief period between the appointment to the Committee 
on 16 November 2007 of Alison Wood and the resignation of Jo Connell from the 
Committee on 31 December 2007 when the Committee comprised four independent 
Non-executive Directors. The Committee meets regularly and is chaired by Ian 
Chippendale. Its remit is to make recommendations to the Board on the Group’s 
framework for the remuneration of the Group’s executives and its cost and, on behalf  
of the Board, to determine and review specified remuneration packages for the  
Non-executive Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary.  
The Committee seeks to design policies which will attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors and senior managers of the required calibre. The Committee also 
has responsibility for reviewing the operation of the Group’s bonus and incentive 
schemes. The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee reports the outcome of the 
Committee meetings to the Board and the Board receives the minutes of Remuneration 
Committee meetings. The Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year is set out on 
pages 32 to 36.
The Committee reviews its terms of reference and effectiveness annually and reports 
its conclusions to the Board, including any recommendations for change. The terms 
of reference, and those of the Committee’s remuneration consultants, who are 
independent of the Group, are displayed on the Company’s website at www.thus.net.
Relations with shareholders
As at 31 March 2008, the Company had 183.03 million shares in issue, 
approximately 90% of which were held by institutions and corporate shareholders  
with the remainder being held by private individuals. The Company had been notified 
of the following interests, representing 3% or more of the issued share capital and 
voting rights of the Company, as at 20 May 2008.
  Number Percentage of issued share
  of shares capital and voting rights
Amber Capital L.P.  20,063,1 19  10.96
Columbia Ventures Corporation  16,000,000  8.74
Aviva plc and Delta Lloyd N.V.  15,644,21 1  8.55
Investec Asset Management Limited  9,345,795  5.1 1
Legal & General Group plc  7 ,410,249  4.05
Deutsche Bank AG  7 ,021,224  3.84
There is a regular dialogue with shareholders through the Annual and Interim Reports 
and through a supplementary investor relations programme focused around the Group’s 
preliminary and interim results announcements and periodic trading updates. The 
Executive Directors’ presentation of results is broadcast through webcast. Following 
results, the Executive Directors undertake a series of formal presentations to existing and 
potential investors in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow and also in mainland Europe and 
the USA. In November 2007 the Executive Directors and members of the management 
team also held an Investor day for analysts and investors.
To develop an understanding of the views of major shareholders, the Board receives 
regularly an investor relations report, compiled with input from the Group’s brokers, 
setting out key features and trends in relation to trading in the Group’s shares and 
share price movements. Analysts’ reports on the Group, its competitors and the 
telecommunications sector are circulated to Board members on a regular basis. 
Feedback from investors after the Group’s results announcements and presentations are 
regularly reported to the Board. The Non-executive Directors are also invited to attend 
presentations of the Group’s results. 
The senior independent Non-executive Director has not, during the year, undertaken 
in accordance with the Combined Code a programme of meetings with a range of 
major shareholders of the Group as this has not been considered necessary by the 
Board. It is believed that the approach described in this section provides an efficient 
method of maintaining contact with shareholders, and to date the Group has seen no 
evidence of demand from shareholders for such meetings. The situation will be kept 
under review in the year ahead.
The AGM, which is normally attended by all Directors, gives those institutional  
and private shareholders attending the opportunity for communication with the  
Board. Shareholders present are encouraged to ask questions both during and after 
the meeting. 
Internal control
The Board has maintained the approach adopted in previous years, in establishing 
and monitoring the Group’s internal control procedures and policies. In following the 
requirements of the Combined Code, a review on an annual basis of the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control is carried out by the Board. This review includes 
material financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management.  
The Turnbull Report (Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined 
Code), published in October 2005, provides guidance to the Directors in respect  
of this requirement.
Overall responsibility for the system of internal control and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of the system rests with the Directors of THUS Group plc. The Internal 
Audit function of the Group supports the Directors in assessing the operation of key 
internal controls through a structured review programme. The purpose, authority and 
responsibility of the Group’s Internal Audit function is contained within a formal Risk 
Management Charter.
The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives. Internal control, therefore, can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
During the course of the year, the risk management and internal control systems have 
continued to be developed across the Group. The risk management framework is 
designed to ensure that the key controls are, and have been, embedded into business 
processes. This has enabled the Directors to be satisfied that the Group was fully 
compliant with the revised Combined Code provisions, including those of the Turnbull 
Report, on internal control in the course of the financial year ended 31 March 2008. 
Control environment
The Group is committed to ensuring that a suitable control environment exists, which 
will not hinder its aim to be the pre-eminent alternative telecommunication provider for 
business customers in the UK.
The Group has a defined organisational structure and any changes are communicated 
throughout the business. Individual objectives and authority levels are identified and 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Accountability and key responsibilities are documented 
in role profiles and reporting models are utilised to ensure that issues are escalated 
appropriately. Codes of Conduct are also published within the business to ensure that 
employees are educated in expected standards of behaviour. These include probity, 
whistle-blowing and disciplinary policies. 
Corporate Governance:
Corporate Governance Report – continued
THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008
>
30 Each of the Executive Directors has responsibility for specific aspects of the Group’s 
business. The Management Board is chaired by the Chief Executive and is the 
principal forum at senior management level in the Group which supports decision-
making by the Chief Executive and the Executive Directors within the authorities 
delegated to them by the Board of THUS Group plc. The Management Board focuses 
on business plan implementation, competitive positioning and customer requirements, 
and meets on a monthly basis in advance of the THUS Group plc main Board. 
The Management Board receives reports on corporate performance from various 
management groups, which meet regularly. The implementation of the year’s annual 
budget remains its focus.
The Earnings Update Committee meets regularly and reviews detailed revenue and 
margin data from Group level down to individual product lines. The Committee consists 
of various operational and financial business representatives, including product, sales 
and finance. During Committee meetings, a number of presentations are given by 
product managers to the business directors on actual and forecasted revenue and 
margins. In addition, a detailed operating cost forecast is also produced allowing 
subsequent production of an updated Group EBITDA forecast. The Committee meetings 
end with a review by the Executive Directors of the aggregated Group position. The 
Chief Financial Officer also carries out a detailed monthly review of the financial results.
The Chief Operating Officer chairs Business Operations, which manages the day-to-
day operation of the business, ensuring cohesion in marketing, sales, provisioning and 
through to operational delivery.
Capital investment, major bids, facilities and major project implementation within 
the Group are tracked by Capital Planning and Programme Management, which is 
chaired by the Support Services director.
Identification and assessment of business risk and evaluation  
of controls
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the business. This process has been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report. The process is regularly reviewed 
by the Board, via the Audit Committee, and is guided by the content of the Turnbull 
Report. 
Risk Assessments are completed on key processes and quarterly reviews have been 
carried out by the Risk Management Group to ensure this is a continuous process 
which is embedded into the business. All aspects of business risk such as financial, 
operational, strategic, compliance and business continuity risk are covered by the  
Risk Assessments. 
Risk reviews are also undertaken regularly by the respective business areas throughout 
the year, to identify and assess the key business risks associated with the achievement 
of strategic objectives. The reviews are supported by governance software which 
enables and requires risk owners to regularly monitor and review risks within the 
Group. The reviews include consideration of the nature and extent of risks facing the 
Group, the likelihood of risks materialising and review of controls and action plans 
associated with the risks. 
As a result of our Risk Management process and monitoring thereof, we have been 
successful in securing a reduction for the past two years in our corporate insurance 
premiums. 
Revenue assurance software continues to be employed by the Group and is designed 
to assure revenue streams and reduce the potential for fraud against the Company. 
During the year, the software has been further integrated into risk management 
processes with activity expanding to cover additional revenue streams.
Monitoring
The Group’s Risk Management functions consist of Internal Audit, Quality Management, 
Revenue Assurance, Business Continuity, Corporate Security and Health & Safety 
professionals. Their activities include verification of core processes, significant risks and 
reviewing compliance with Company policies and business accreditations.
The Internal Audit function continues to independently assess and audit the 
effectiveness of internal control. Similarly, the Revenue Assurance function carries out a 
programme of review and assurance of the Group’s revenue streams.
The Group Safety, Health and Environment team manages, develops and assesses 
compliance against the Group’s Health, Safety and Environmental management 
systems. The Company applies the standards set out in HS(G)65 ‘Successful 
Health and Safety Management’. In addition THUS has committed to achieving 
OHSAS18001. This will allow the Company to consistently identify and control its 
health and safety risks, reduce the potential for accidents, aid legislative compliance 
and improve overall performance.
The Business Continuity unit ensures that all business continuity plans and disaster 
recovery processes are maintained, audited and regularly tested in accordance with 
Company policy.
Corporate Security is responsible for Company security policies and management 
of the Information Security Management System which maintains our compliance to 
the International Information Security Standard ISO/IEC 27001:2005. THUS was 
awarded certification to the exacting standard for our MPLS network during the year 
under review.
An assessment of residual risk and of significant risks across the business, resulting 
from the reviews of the risks of the Group, is presented to the Audit Committee on a 
quarterly basis. Control failings or weaknesses assessed as significant are included 
within these quarterly reviews by the Audit Committee, including discussion on actions 
taken by the business to address them. This ensures that necessary actions have been 
or are being taken to remedy any significant control failings or weaknesses.
Finally, an additional annual review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control 
and risk management processes is carried out by the Board. 
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that THUS Group 
plc has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, it continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Financial Statements on pages 38 to 67 .
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and 
Parent company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required to prepare the 
Group Financial Statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company Financial Statements 
on the same basis.
The Group and Parent Company Financial Statements are required by law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position of the Group and the 
Parent Company and the performance for that period; the Companies Act 1985 
provides in relation to such Financial Statements that references in the relevant part 
of that Act to Financial Statements giving a true and fair view are references to their 
achieving a fair presentation.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements,  
the Directors are required to:
Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; >
Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; >
State whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted   >
by the EU; and
Prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is  >
inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue  
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and 
the Group and enable them to ensure that its Financial Statements comply with the 
Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing 
a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Report 
that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
The Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of  >
accounting standards and set out on pages 38 to 67 , give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
The Directors’ Report, set out on pages 12 to 28, includes a fair review of the  >
development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008 Corporate Governance:
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Remuneration Committee
Constitution, membership and advisors
At the date of this report the Remuneration Committee comprises the following 
independent Non-executive Directors: Ian Chippendale (Chairman) and Rick 
Medlock (both of whom served throughout the year), and Alison Wood (appointed 
16 November 2007). During the year, Jo Connell served on the Committee until her 
retirement on 31 December 2007 . During the course of the year, the Board accepted 
the recommendations made by the Committee without substantial amendment.
During the year, the Committee received advice and input from the Chairman,  
the Chief Executive and the director of Human Resources who are from time to time 
invited to attend Committee meetings. No individuals are involved in the determination 
of their own remuneration.
Towers Perrin have been the Committee’s independent remuneration advisors since 
October 2003. From March 2008, Hewitt New Bridge Street (HNBS) were 
appointed to be the Committee’s independent advisors, following a competitive tender 
process. HNBS provide no other services to the Company. HNBS report directly to the 
Committee and have not undertaken any significant work for the Company outside the 
area of executive remuneration. Any such additional work would need to be approved 
by the Chairman of the Committee. The terms of engagement of the remuneration 
advisors are available at www.thus.net and form part of the Committee’s terms of 
reference.
The Committee’s overall objectives and remit
The Committee’s terms of reference are also available at www.thus.net. The Committee 
is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s executive 
remuneration policy and for determining each Executive Director’s remuneration 
package. In deciding the Company’s broad policy for executive remuneration,  
the Committee aims to provide remuneration which is both competitive and 
appropriate. The Committee has always sought to pay no more than is necessary to 
motivate and retain highly skilled executives, and seeks to ensure that its decisions take 
into account pay and conditions elsewhere in the Company.
Remuneration policy
During the year the Committee has continued its decision making on the basis of  
a number of underlying principles which can be summarised as follows: 
Executive Directors and other senior executives should be paid market competitive  >
levels of remuneration and receive significant incentives for performance which 
significantly exceeds challenging and objective targets.
In setting base salary levels, the Committee has regard to both individual  >
performance and external market information prepared by its advisors from a 
number of comparable companies both within and outside the telecommunications 
sector. The aim is to set salaries which are generally around the mid-market 
level. Salaries will be above mid-market where both individual experience and 
performance, and market comparables, justify it.
The Committee remains strongly committed to ensuring there is an appropriate  >
balance between fixed and performance pay. It also seeks to ensure alignment with 
shareholders’ interests. A significant proportion of Executive Directors’ remuneration 
is performance-related through annual bonus and long-term incentives as set out 
below.
The Committee’s primary goal is to ensure that executive remuneration continues to  >
be sufficiently attractive to retain Executive Directors in a highly competitive market 
and to motivate them to deliver results and to enhance shareholder value.
The arrangements described below are likely to continue to apply in future years unless 
there are specific reasons for change. The Committee will continue to regularly review 
arrangements to ensure that they remain effective and appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances and prospects, and to monitor the level of potential awards.
The remuneration package
Basic salary
Following an increase of 3.6%, the base salary levels for Executive Directors in 
2007 /08 were as follows: William Allan, £435,120; John Maguire, £310,800; 
Philip Male, £310,800. The Committee has considered salaries in relation to market 
data, performance and pay settlements elsewhere in the business, and has agreed an 
increase of 3.9% to base salaries with effect from 1 April 2008.
Annual bonus
Executive Directors and senior executives participate in the Company’s annual 
Corporate Bonus Plan.
The Committee remains committed to ensuring that bonus targets are challenging and 
only reward demonstrably superior performance.
The annual bonus plan for Executive Directors is based on a mix of financial and 
non-financial performance conditions on an 80:20 ratio and provides a maximum total 
payment of up to 100% of salary. Following a review of remuneration for the Executive 
Directors, the Committee has agreed to raise the maximum bonus potential for the 
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer from 85% to 100% of salary with 
effect from 1 April 2008, further strengthening the performance related element of their 
remuneration package.
The achievement of pre-determined targets determines the levels of payout under the 
plan. For the year ended 31 March 2008, there were three distinct financial measures 
which were weighted as follows:
25% was determined by reference to cash flow after interest and capital expenditure. >
50% was determined by reference to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax,  >
depreciation and amortisation) performance.
25% was determined by reference to revenue. >
Based on the Company’s performance for 2007 /08 the plan made a payment of 
48.05% of maximum entitlement. 
In respect of 80% of the bonus potential the same financial measures will be used for 
2008/09 weighted as follows:
30% determined by reference to cash flow after interest and capital expenditure. >
50% determined by reference to EBITDA. >
20% determined by reference to revenue. >
Long-term incentives
Performance shares
The Company operates the THUS Group Performance Share Plan under which an 
award of shares can be granted at the discretion of the Committee to Executive 
Directors and selected senior executives. Grants made during a year will only become 
exercisable after three years if demanding performance targets set by the Committee 
are met. 
The two performance criteria which apply to the vesting of performance share awards 
are Group EBITDA in respect of 50% of an award and Group EBIT return on capital 
employed with respect to the remaining 50%. Performance is measured against targets 
set with reference to internal forecasts and the extent to which they are satisfied is 
confirmed by the Committee. 
Calculations are made internally on the same basis as reported in the Financial 
Statements and are verified by the auditors.
The two performance criteria are recognised both internally and by analysts as key 
measures of the success of the fixed line telecommunications business model and the 
drivers of shareholder value and, as such, are recognised by the participants and, 
we believe (following the support of shareholders in 2006) by shareholders, as being 
directly linked to the success of the business. 
It is currently anticipated that awards to Executive Directors in 2008/09 will be made 
over shares worth 100% of salary.
The performance conditions will require annual compound growth in EBITDA of 
between 12% to 25% over three years and EBIT return on capital for the final year in 
the performance period to be between 5% and 10%. 30% of the respective part of the 
award will vest for threshold performance. These performance ranges are considered 
to be appropriately stretching taking into account the outlook for the business. For the 
EBITDA condition, it is recognised that the numbers are lower than for prior years’ 
ranges. However, as they are referenced off higher base figures, they represent a clear 
progression on the ranges set in previous years. Furthermore they remain relatively high 
by market standards. Conversely, the EBIT return on capital range is higher than prior 
years’ awards. Overall, the ranges are considered to be equally challenging to those 
set in prior years.
Matching shares
Under the Co-Investment Plan, Executive Directors are allowed to invest up to a 
maximum of 25% of their base salary in Company shares. The offer is typically made 
to them each year shortly after bonuses are declared. This means that Executive 
Directors can use their net bonus to acquire shares at market price (although there is 
no direct link to the bonus paid). Provided that the Executive Director continues to hold 
these shares for three years, the Company makes an award of matching shares. The 
minimum level of match is one share for every two the individual acquires. The level of 
match can increase up to a maximum of four shares for every two shares the individual 
acquires, dependent on performance against the same performance targets that apply 
for awards under the Performance Share Plan. Participation in the plan has been 
extended to selected senior executives below Board level.
The rules of the various long-term incentive plans provide that the aggregate of all 
share-based awards does not exceed the guidelines laid down by the Association 
of British Insurers that recommend (i) that the number of awards granted over new 
issue shares in respect of all share-based schemes should not exceed 10% of the 
current issued share capital in any rolling ten-year period; and (ii) that the number of 
awards granted over new issue shares in respect of discretionary schemes should not 
exceed 5% of the current issued share capital in the same period. As at 31 March, 
the percentage of share capital used in relation to these two limits was nil. All awards 
granted to date have utilised shares held within the Employee Share Trust.
THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008

32 Pension and other benefits
Pension benefits are provided under the THUS Group plc Pension Scheme. This scheme 
is a contributory defined-benefit scheme that provides 1/60th of final pensionable 
salary from age 60 for each year of pensionable service up to 31 March 2007 and 
1/75th of final pensionable salary from age 65 for each year of pensionable service 
after 31 March 2007 . Final pensionable salary is defined as the highest pensionable 
salary averaged over any 12-month period in the last five years of membership, or the 
highest three-year average in the last 10 years if higher. Pensionable salary is defined 
as basic salary only.
In line with market practice a cash supplement is provided for Executive Directors who 
continue to participate in THUS’ pension arrangements to provide a market competitive 
level of pension benefit overall.
Executive Directors are eligible for a range of benefits, the value of which is contained 
within the Directors’ emoluments table on page 34. These include the provision of 
a company car or car allowance, fuel, private medical, life, permanent health and 
critical illness insurances.
Service contracts
Reflecting current market practice, the Executive Directors have service contracts that 
are terminable on one year’s notice by either the individual or the Company. It is not 
the Committee’s intention to appoint any new Executive Directors with contracts that 
provide for a longer notice period.
The Committee endorses the principle of mitigation of loss on early termination of a 
service contract and generally seeks to achieve that objective, where possible and 
appropriate. 
In the event that THUS wished to terminate an Executive Director’s contract other than in 
circumstances where the Company is entitled to summarily dismiss an Executive Director, 
it would need to either give 12 months’ notice or make a payment in lieu of twelve 
months’ worth of salary and benefits (including pension).
There are no special provisions which apply in the event of a change of control.
The dates, terms and notice periods of the service contracts for Executive Directors  
are as follows:
  Date of initial
 Commencement appointment  Normal
 date of current with THUS plc  retirement
 term of office (if applicable) Notice period date
William Allan 01/04/04 22/10/99 12 months 29/04/16
John Maguire 01/04/04 18/12/00 12 months 07 /07 /28
Philip Male 01/04/04 22/10/99 12 months 13/09/29
Share ownership guidelines
Formal guidelines provide that Executive Directors should retain at least 25% of the 
after-tax gain arising from any awards vesting pursuant to the Company’s share 
incentive plans until such time as a shareholding equivalent in value to one times basic 
salary has been achieved. The Committee reviews the guidelines not less than every 
two years, including updating to reflect any changes in share price and salary.
Policy on outside directorships
Currently no Executive Director holds any outside directorship. The Nomination 
Committee will consider the appropriate policy at such time as a request is made  
by an Executive Director.
Chairman and Non-executive Directors
The appointment of the Chairman and Non-executive Directors is subject to the 
Articles of Association of the Company, in particular the usual provisions relating to 
re-election by shareholders. The Chairman and Non-executive Directors have letters 
of appointment which are available at www.thus.net. They were all appointed for an 
initial term of three years terminable at the request of the Board which may be renewed 
for a further period subject to approval by the Board. Current terms of office began on 
the following dates: 
   Date of initial
  Commencement   appointment

The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee.  
The fees of the Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board. Full details of the 
remuneration of the Directors are contained in the Directors’ emoluments table on page 
34. With effect from 1 April 2008, the Chairman’s fees were increased to £100,000 
per annum and the fees of the Non-executive Directors were increased to £35,000 
per annum, with an additional fee of £5,500 per annum payable to the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee, an additional fee of £2,750 per annum payable to the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and an additional fee of £2,750 per annum 
payable to the Senior Independent Non-executive Director. The Chairman and Non-
executive Directors are not entitled to compensation on early termination of their term  
of office. No individuals are involved in the determination of their own remuneration.
Performance graph
Legislation introduced by the government requires this Report to contain a graph 
showing the performance of the Company compared with a ‘broad equity market 
index’ over a five-year period. The Committee has chosen the FTSE All-Share 
Telecommunications Index, of which THUS is a constituent. This Index was chosen 
because it shows the performance of the Company relative to its industry peer group 
and is therefore particularly relevant to shareholders.

The exercise prices above (except the nominal exercise prices applicable to grants 
under the THUS Group Performance Share Plan) have been appropriately adjusted 
following the 10 to 1 consolidation of ordinary shares. The number of shares and 
share options has also been adjusted accordingly.
The aggregate of the gains made by the Executive Directors on the exercise of share 
options during the year was £nil (2007: £80,796).
1.  Exercise of options is subject to a total shareholder return (TSR) performance 
condition, measuring the Company’s TSR against two comparator groups. For 
two thirds of the award the comparator group is the companies comprising the 
FTSE Telecoms sector. For the remaining one third of the award the comparator 
group is the companies comprising the FTSE 250 Index (excluding telecoms 
companies and investment trusts). In both cases 50% of options are exercisable 
for median TSR performance rising on a straight-line basis so that 100% of 
options are exercisable for upper quartile performance. If performance conditions 
have not been met in full after three years, there are two opportunities to re-test 
performance (from the same base measurement point) after four and five years.
2.  Awards granted under the Performance Share Plan for the year ended 31 March 
2008 are subject to the following performance conditions measured over a fixed 
period of three financial years beginning in the financial year in which an award 
is made:
  50% of an award is subject to EBITDA growth of 15% to 35% per annum 
compound. The remaining 50% is subject to EBIT return on capital of 4% to 8% 
for the final year of the performance period. In both cases 30% of that part of the 
award vests at the threshold, increasing on a straight-line basis so that there is full 
vesting at the maximum threshold.
3.  For awards made under the Co-Investment Plan the minimum level of match is one 
share for every two purchased, irrespective of performance. Additional matching 
shares vest from the one for two level, up to a maximum of three for two, subject 
to a range of EBITDA and EBIT return on capital targets.
  Awards granted for the year ended 31 March 2008 are subject to the same 
performance criteria as apply to the awards of performance shares (set out in 
footnote 2). For awards granted for the year ended 31 March 2007 the EBITDA 
growth range is 20% to 35%. The EBIT return on capital range is the same as set 
out in footnote 2.
4.  As required by the relevant legislation, no performance conditions apply to 
options under the Sharesave Scheme.
The market price of a share at 31 March 2008 was 1 19p and the range during the 
year ended 31 March 2008 was 107p to 200p. The figures relating to events prior to 
10 March 2006 have been restated to reflect the consolidation of the ordinary shares 
of 2.5p each into 25p shares that took place on that date.
No terms of any awards were varied during this year.

36 Financial Statements:
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of THUS Group plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements (the 
’Financial Statements’) of THUS Group Plc for the year ended 31 March 2008, 
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of 
Recognised Income and Expense, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, 
the Consolidated and Parent Company Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes. 
These Financial Statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out 
therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with 
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state 
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU are set 
out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 31.
Our responsibility is to audit the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Financial Statements give a true 
and fair view and whether the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance  
with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information 
given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Financial Statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper 
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined Code specified for our 
review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does 
not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control 
cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s 
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider  
whether it is consistent with the audited Financial Statements. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or 
material inconsistencies with the Financial Statements. Our responsibilities do not 
extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing  
(UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Financial 
Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also 
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the 
Directors in the preparation of the Financial Statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and 
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient 
evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also 
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Financial 
Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the Group Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs  >
as adopted by the EU, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2008 and 
of its loss for the year then ended; 
the Parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in accordance  >
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 1985, of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at  
31 March 2008;
the Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to  >
be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985 and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the Financial  >
Statements.

THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008 Financial Statements:
Notes to the Consolidated and Parent Company Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 March 2008
1 Reporting entity 
THUS Group plc is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the 
Company’s registered office is 1-2 Berkeley Square, 99 Berkeley Street, Glasgow, 
G3 7HR. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 
31 March 2008 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as 
the ’Group’). The Parent Company Financial Statements present information about 
the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group. The Group is primarily 
involved in the provision of telecommunication services.
2 Basis of preparation
(a) Statement of compliance 
Both the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial 
Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union 
(EU) (’adopted IFRSs’).
On publishing the Parent Company Financial Statements here together with the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, the Parent Company is taking advantage of the 
exemption in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its individual 
income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved Financial 
Statements. 
The Financial Statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 20 May 2008.
(b) Basis of measurement
The financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU (’adopted IFRSs’).
The financial information is prepared on the historical cost basis.
(c) Functional and presentation currency
These Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds Sterling, which is the 
Group and Company’s functional currency. The financial information is presented in 
pounds Sterling rounded to the nearest thousand.
(d) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial information in conformity with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income 
and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about 
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions 
to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if 
the revision only affects that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRSs that have a significant effect 
on the Financial Statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the 
next year are disclosed in Note 36 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
3 Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial 
Statements.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Financial Statements of the 
Company and the entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Company 
has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of 
an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting 
rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The Financial 
Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from 
the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on 
consolidation.
Prior year adjustment
The Company has adopted the requirements of IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’ and 
IFRIC 1 1 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions‘ for the first time in these 
Financial Statements. This change in accounting policy has had no impact on the 
Income Statement and Balance Sheet of the Company for the reasons set out in  
Notes 17 and 28(b) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revenue 
Revenue represents the value of goods and services supplied to customers during the 
year (net of Value Added Tax). The Group’s revenue comprises revenue from voice 
telephony services, data services, Internet services, mobile services and Managed 
solutions of a variety of telecommunication services. Revenue recognition occurs when 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed 
and determinable, and collectability is probable.
Voice telephony services
Revenue from voice telephony services comprises call charges and associated line 
rentals to customers connected directly to the THUS network, indirectly connected 
customers, customers utilising ’Carrier Pre-Select’ services, Voice over Internet Protocol 
(VoIP) and wholesale customers. Call charges comprise charges for Geographical and 
non-Geographical numbers. Revenue for call charges is recognised when the service 
is provided, rental charges are recognised on a straight-line basis over the length of the 
supply contract.
Data services
Data services comprise installation and provision of ongoing data supply products, 
including leased lines, Virtual Private Networks, Ethernet services, and provision of 
open fibre services. Installation charges are recognised where there is a contractually 
identified installation charge, reflecting the arm’s length value of the cost of the 
installation and the fair value of the work done. In limited cases, installation work 
straddles an accounting period end. Whilst such contracts do not meet the definition 
of construction contracts under IAS 1 1 ’Construction Contracts’ (IAS 1 1), where the 
outcome of the contract and stage of completion can be assessed reliably, sales and 
cost of sales are recognised using the percentage completion method in accordance 
with IAS 18 ’Revenue’ (IAS 18). Completion is generally measured by reference to 
costs incurred to date as a percentage of estimated total installation costs. Connection 
fees are recognised on commencement of a customer contract only where incremental 
costs are incurred in connection. All other connection fees are recognised over the life 
of the customer contract. Rental charges are recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
length of the supply contract. 
Internet services
Revenue from Internet services comprises monthly access fees for business access 
services (including the provision of leased lines and e-commerce services), revenue 
from wholesale Internet services provided to Virtual Internet Service Providers, 
access fees paid by Internet subscribers, and ingress receipts. Installation revenue 
is recognised for the design and building of bespoke solutions, reflecting the arm’s 
length value of the goods supplied. In limited cases, installation work straddles an 
accounting period end. Whilst such contracts do not meet the definition of construction 
contracts under IAS 1 1, where the outcome of the contract and stage of completion 
can be assessed reliably, sales and cost of sales are recognised using the percentage 
completion method in accordance with IAS 18. Completion is generally measured by 
reference to costs incurred to date as a percentage of estimated total installation costs. 
Connection fees are recognised on commencement of a customer contract only where 
incremental costs are incurred in connection. All other connection fees are recognised 
over the life of the customer contract. Rental revenue is recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the contract term.
Mobile services
Mobile revenue comprises revenue from the provision of the supply of airtime for 
mobile communications equipment and the provision of such equipment. Revenue for 
airtime is recognised when the service is provided.
Managed solutions
Managed solutions revenue comprises revenue from the provision of voice telephony, 
data and internet services as part of bespoke contractual arrangements. Installation 
revenue is recognised for the design and building of bespoke solutions, reflecting the 
arm’s length value of the goods supplied. In limited cases, installation work straddles an 
accounting period end. Whilst such contracts do not meet the definition of construction 
contracts under IAS 1 1, where the outcome of the contract and stage of completion 
can be assessed reliably, sales and cost of sales are recognised using the percentage 
completion method in accordance with IAS 18. Completion is generally measured by 
reference to costs incurred to date as a percentage of estimated total installation costs. 
Connection fees are recognised on commencement of a customer contract only where 
incremental costs are incurred in connection. All other connection fees are recognised 
over the life of the customer contract. Rental revenue is recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the contract term.
Indefeasible rights of use (’IRU’) sales
As part of its service offering, the Group and Company periodically sell dark fibre to 
other network operators seeking to extend their own networks under IRU agreements. 
These agreements extend for all of the assets’ expected useful lives and transfer 
substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership to the buyer. In a number of 
cases, the Group and Company have acquired dark fibre under IRU agreements from 
the same counterparties in order to complete its own network.
The profit on IRU sales is shown in the Financial Statements as a gain on the disposal 
of fixed assets.   
Other operating income
Rents received from the sublet of properties unoccupied by the Group, but for which 
a commitment remains, are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a 
straight-line basis over the sublease term.
Cost definitions
The Group and Company’s costs comprise of cost of sales, selling and distribution and 
administrative expenses. 
THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008
>
42 3 Significant accounting policies – continued
Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of costs directly attributable to each type of revenue stream and 
includes interconnect costs for telephony charges, rental of data capacity and costs of 
equipment installed for customers. Other costs comprise expenditure on fixed network 
infrastructure, operational properties and network depreciation together with the 
salaries and associated costs of the network maintenance function. 
Selling, distribution and administrative expenses
Selling and distribution expenses comprise expenditure on marketing, advertising 
and promotions, together with the salaries and associated costs of the sales and 
marketing function. Administrative expenses comprise expenditure on customer services, 
human resources, information technology, legal and regulatory compliance, finance 
department costs and non-operational property together with depreciation of non-
network assets.
Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in 
providing products or services (business segment), or in providing products or services 
within a particular economic environment (geographical segment), which is subject to 
risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as 
well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise 
mainly network assets and depreciation that relate to services provided by different 
business segments, interest-bearing loans, borrowings and corporate expenses.
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits include entitlement to corporate bonus, provision of 
company car and private medical insurance. Liabilities for company cars and private 
medical insurance are expensed as incurred. Provision for bonus awards is recognised 
for amounts expected to be paid where the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this as a result of past service provided by the employee and the 
amounts concerned can be reliably estimated.
Financial income and expenses
Financial income comprises of interest income on funds invested and assumed returns 
on pension assets on long-term actuarial assumptions.
Financial expenses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement using the 
effective interest method. Interest on finance leases is recognised on a straight-line 
method over the life of the lease.
Financial expenses also include costs relating to the secured bank loans comprising 
commitment fees, legal fees connected to loan documentation and other related 
expenses. The costs are released to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the loan. In the event of the loan being repaid earlier, or replaced, 
the remaining costs are immediately charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Changes in the fair value of the derivatives used for hedging purposes are also 
recognised as either financial income or financial expenses.
Taxation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised 
directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment 
to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for 
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The 
amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised 
only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is 
no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
Earnings per share
The Group discloses basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share (EPS) figures for its 
ordinary shares and also discloses EPS for continuing and discontinued operations. 
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to the 
equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in 
issue during the financial year after taking account of the shares held by the Employee 
Share Trust. The shares held by the Trust are calculated on a weighted average basis. 
Diluted EPS is calculated on the same basis as the basic EPS with an adjustment being 
made to the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the impact of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares arising from share options granted to employees.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Subject to the transitional relief in IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards’ (IFRS 1), all business combinations are accounted for by applying 
the purchase method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition  
of subsidiaries. For those business combinations occurring prior to 1 April 2004,  
no goodwill is recognised as these business combinations were accounted for using 
merger accounting principles. The Group has elected to take the exemption allowed 
under IFRS 1 not to restate these business combinations. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is 
allocated to cash generating units and tested annually for impairment.
Licence fees
Licence fees, including those for computer software, are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and provision for any impairment in value, and amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the remaining licence period, of between five and ten years, once the 
relevant asset to which a licence relates becomes operational and the service is utilised 
or available for use.
Other intangibles
Other intangible assets, including customer lists and trade names, acquired by the 
Group and Company are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses and are amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Customer lists: 1–15 years >
Trade names: 5 years >
Development 
Development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset only when the following 
conditions are met – the technical feasibility of completing the asset; that the Group 
intends to complete the development and use or sell the asset; future economic benefits 
are probable; and that the costs of development can be reliably measured. The 
expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and overhead costs 
that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use. The intangible 
asset is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
An asset is classified as held for sale when it has been identified that the asset 
in question is no longer required for continuing use and is therefore available for 
immediate sale, and that the sale is highly probable. Immediately before classification 
as held for sale, the measurement of the assets (and all assets and liabilities in a 
disposal group) is brought up to date in accordance with applicable IFRSs. Then, 
on initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are 
recognised at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale are included in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. The same applies to gains and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a 
separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary 
acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation 
meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost, less accumulated depreciation 
and provision for impairments in value. The cost of self-constructed assets includes 
the cost of materials, direct labour and other costs which are directly attributable to 
the construction of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation is charged to the 
Consolidated Income Statement using the straight-line basis over estimated useful 
lives. Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful 
lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. 
Depreciation rates, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at each reporting 
date. The estimated useful lives are as set out below:
    Years
Land and leasehold buildings  
Alterations to leasehold premises   Over lease period or useful life if shorter
Plant and equipment 
Underground network     40
Fibre optic cable and transmission equipment    5 to 20
Electronics, switching equipment and base stations    5 to 15
Customer connections    5 
Tools     4 
Other assets
Fixtures and fittings     10
Vehicles     4
Personal computers     3 
Freehold land is not depreciated. 
Maintenance, repairs and renewals are generally charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement during the year in which they are incurred. Major refurbishments and 
renovations are capitalised and included in the carrying amount of the related asset 
when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the originally assessed 
standard of performance of the existing asset will flow to the Group and Company. 
Major refurbishments and renovations are depreciated over the remaining life of the 
asset.
Borrowing costs are not capitalised.

THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008 3 Significant accounting policies – continued
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined 
on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis. Net realisable value is the amount that can be realised 
from the sale of the inventory in the normal course of business after allowing for the 
costs of realisation.
An allowance is recorded for inventory obsolescence.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised 
cost less an estimate made for impaired trade receivables, based upon the periodic 
review of all outstanding amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group and Company manage their short-term liquidity through holdings of cash 
and highly liquid interest-bearing deposits. For the purpose of the cash flow statement 
only deposits with a maturity period of three months from the date of acquisition or 
less are shown as cash and cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts that are repayable 
on demand and that form an integral part of the Group and Company’s cash 
management are also included as a component of cash and cash equivalents  
for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently 
stated at amortised cost.
Impairment
Financial assets
All financial assets are assessed at each reporting date to ascertain if there is any 
evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if evidence 
exists indicating that one or more events has had an adverse effect on the estimated 
future cash flows of that asset.
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. 
The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar 
credit risks.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amount of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed as appropriate at 
each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such 
an indication exists then the assets’ recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and 
intangible assets that have indefinite lives the recoverable amount is estimated at each 
reporting date.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash 
generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. A cash generating unit is the smallest 
identifiable asset group that generates cash inflows that are largely independent from 
other assets and groups. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit  
is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value  
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a  
pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset. Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets,  
an impairment loss recognised in prior periods is reversed if there has been a change 
in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount.
Finance and operating leases
Leases in terms of which the Group and Company assume substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Assets held under finance 
leases are depreciated in line with the Group and Company’s depreciation policy or, 
where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. The interest element of the finance 
lease repayments is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in proportion to the 
balance of the capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Rent-free periods received by the Group and Company, at the inception of new 
operating leases for properties, are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, 
over the period of the lease. 
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currency 
at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any gain or loss arising on the restatement 
of such balances is taken to the Consolidated Income Statement.
The assets and liabilities of the overseas entity are translated at the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date. The expenses of the overseas entity are translated 
at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the 
transactions. Exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement. 
Pensions
The Group and Company participate in Group pension arrangements, consisting of 
both defined contribution and defined benefit plans. 
Defined contribution plans
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the Consolidated 
Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
These contributions are determined as a fixed percentage of the individual employees’ 
relevant salary and the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
amounts. All contributions are paid across to an independent provider.
For a small number of employees, the Group and Company pay varying levels 
of contributions to personal pension schemes. These costs are charged to the 
Consolidated Income Statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans
For defined benefit pension plans, pension costs are calculated using the projected 
unit credit method. The calculation is performed annually by an independent qualifed 
actuary. The pension obligation is measured as the present value of the estimated future 
cash outflows using interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds, where the terms to 
maturity are comparable with the terms of the related liabilities. Actuarial gains and 
losses are recognised as incurred on an annual basis outside the Consolidated Income 
Statement and presented in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense in 
accordance with IAS 19 ’Employee Benefits’ (IAS 19). 
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs. In subsequent 
periods they are stated at amortised cost and any difference between net proceeds and 
redemption amounts are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the life 
of the borrowings.
Share-based payments 
Group 
The share option programme allows Group and Company employees to acquire 
shares of the ultimate Parent Company, THUS Group plc, and these awards are 
granted by THUS Group plc. The fair value of the options granted after 7 November 
2002 and those not yet vested before the date of transition to International Financial 
Reporting Standards is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The fair value is measured at the grant date and spread over the 
period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. 
The fair value of the options granted is measured, using a variety of different models 
including the Black-Scholes model and a binomial lattice model, taking into account 
the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised 
as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that expect 
to and do vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the 
threshold for vesting.
The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 ’Share based payments’ (IFRS 2) only to the 
relevant awards that were granted after 7 November 2002. The Group has not 
accounted for share-based payments granted prior to that date.
Company
Share-based payment awards are granted by the Company to employees of the 
Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, THUS plc. The fair value of these awards  
is calculated in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2, as detailed above.  
On grant this is treated as an increase in the investment in the subsidiary company  
and recognised over the relevant vesting period. In accordance with IFRS 2, there is  
a corresponding increase in equity.
Share-based payment awards are satisfied through shares held in the Employee 
Share Trust which is sponsored by the subsidiary THUS plc, being transferred to THUS 
Group plc. This arrangement is considered an equity settled share-based payment and 
accounted for as a reduction of the cost of investment and a reduction from own equity 
as own shares are received. 
Provisions
Provision is made where the Group and Company have a present legal or constructive 
obligation that can be estimated reliably as a result of past events and it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation. A provision 
for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the 
Group and Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting 
their obligations under the contract.
Share capital
Ordinary shares
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of 
ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity against an appropriate 
reserve account.
Treasury shares
Own shares purchased by the Group are held by an Employee Share Trust which is 
sponsored by THUS plc. These shares are treated as treasury shares, with the total 
cost, including transactions costs, being recognised as a deduction from equity against 
the cumulative loss reserve account. When these treasury shares are subsequently 
transferred, by way of settling outstanding share options, the amount received is 
recognised as an increase in equity.

Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any impairment losses.
Financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity, trade and other 
receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables, and loans and 
other borrowings.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group and Company use derivative financial instruments to hedge their exposure 
to interest rate risks arising from financing activities. In accordance with its treasury 
policy, the Group and Company do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. The gain or loss 
on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income 
Statement. The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group 
and Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, 
taking into account market conditions.
Adopted IFRSs not yet applied
A number of new standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations are 
not yet effective for the year ended 31 March 2008 and have not been applied in 
preparing these Financial Statements.
The following standards have been endorsed by the EU and will require to be applied 
in subsequent periods:
IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19: The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements 
and their Interaction’
IFRIC 14 clarifies the requirements of IAS 19 paragraph 58, which limits the 
measurement of a defined benefit asset to the ‘present value of any economic benefits 
available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the 
plan’ plus unrecognised net actuarial losses and past service cost; this is known as the 
‘asset ceiling’.
The IFRIC addresses when refunds or reductions in future contributions should be 
regarded as available; how a minimum funding requirement might affect the availability 
of reductions in future contributions; and when a minimum funding requirement might 
give rise to an additional liability.
IFRS 8 ’Operating segments’ 
This introduces the management approach to segment reporting. IFRS 8 becomes 
mandatory for the Group’s 2009 Financial Statements but is not expected to have any 
significant impact.
IFRIC 13 ’Customer loyalty programmes’ 
This IFRIC will only apply where customer loyalty programmes operate and so will 
have no impact on the Group.
The following standards and interpretations have not yet been endorsed by the EU but 
may apply in subsequent periods if endorsed:
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: A revised presentation 
This standard will require the Group and Company to present a statement of 
comprehensive income and may require additional disclosures around changes in 
equity.
Revised IAS 23: Borrowing costs 
This removes the option to expense borrowing costs and requires that an entity 
capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the production of a qualifying asset as 
part of the cost of that asset. The revised IAS 23 will become mandatory for the Group 
and Company’s 2009 Financial Statements but will have no impact as the Group and 
Company currently do not have any qualifying assets.
Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation 
The amendments provide exemptions from the requirement to classify as a liability 
financial instruments under which an entity has an unavoidable obligation to deliver 
cash. The exemptions apply to two categories only of instruments issued by an entity. 
They are:
a puttable financial instrument; or >
an instrument, or components of instruments, that impose on the entity an obligation  >
to deliver to another party a pro rata share of the net assets of the entity only on 
liquidation.
The amendments set out detailed definitions and circumstances that must be met before 
these exemptions are available. 
The amendments to IAS 32 lead to consequential amendments to IAS 1, IFRS 7  
and IFRIC 2.
Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and 
IFRS 3 (revised) Business combinations – These amendments make some changes 
to accounting for business combinations. The standard will affect the Group and 
Company only if they are involved in business combinations in future financial periods.
Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-based payment – Vesting Conditions and Cancellations
The definition of vesting conditions in IFRS 2 has been amended to clarify that vesting 
conditions are limited to service conditions and performance conditions. Conditions 
other than service or performance conditions are considered non-vesting conditions.
Under the amendment, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in measuring 
the grant date fair value of the share-based payment and there is no true-up of 
equity-settled arrangements for differences between expected and actual outcomes. 
Therefore, if all vesting conditions are met, then the entity will recognise the grant date 
fair value of the equity-settled share-based payment as compensation cost even if the 
counterparty does not become entitled to the share-based payment due to a failure to 
meet a non-vesting condition. 
4 Segmental reporting   
Segment information is presented in the Financial Statements in respect of the Group’s 
business and geographical segments. The primary format, business segments, reflects 
the Group’s management and internal reporting structure.  
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment 
as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Segment results include 
depreciation charges on assets directly attributable to a segment. Unallocated 
expenses comprise overheads that cannot be directly allocated to individual segments, 
depreciation and amortisation charges on assets not directly attributable to business 
segments, and restructuring costs. Unallocated assets include network and other 
fixed assets which are used across all business segments and other corporate assets. 
Unallocated liabilities include interest-bearing loans and other corporate liabilities.
Business segments  
The Group’s main business segments are:
Managed solutions –  the provision of voice, telephony, data and internet services  
as part of a bespoke contractual arrangement.
Data and telecoms –  the provision of voice telephony services and data supply 
products.
Internet –  the provision of services using internet-based products.
Mobile – the provision of mobile services.
Geographical segments
The Internet segment operated in two principal geographical areas, United Kingdom 
and Europe. In Europe, the Group had, until June 2006, operations in the Netherlands 
that had operational, sales, marketing and corporate functions. 
In presenting information on the basis of geographical segments, segment revenue is 
based on the geographical location of customers. Segment assets are based on the 
geographical location of the assets.

5 Discontinued operations 
On 15 June 2006, the Group completed the disposal of its operations based  
in the Netherlands, following the announcement made on 1 February 2006.  
The Dutch operations represented a separate geographical business area of the  
Group and therefore were classified as a discontinued operation for the year ended 
31 March 2007 , and were formerly included as part of the Internet segment. 
The results, for the year ended 31 March 2008, represent the finalisation of the tax 
position regarding the prior year disposal. 
In the prior year, the gross proceeds from the sale of the Demon Netherlands 
operations to the Dutch telecommunications company, Royal KPN NV, amounted to 
£47 million, with selling costs of £3.5 million and £1.2 million representing the net 
assets disposed of.

The basic (loss)/earnings and diluted (loss)/earnings per ordinary share have been 
calculated in accordance with IAS 33 ’Earnings per Share’ (IAS 33) for both years.  
The (loss)/profit for the financial year, divided by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the financial year, has been used to calculate both the 
(loss)/earnings and diluted (loss)/earnings per ordinary share. The detailed calculations 
are as follows:

(2007: 866,376) ordinary shares held by the Group under Trust in connection  
with the Employee Share Schemes. 
The average market value of the Company’s shares for the purposes of calculating the 
dilutive effect of share options was based on quoted market prices for the period that 
the options were outstanding.
(b) (Loss)/earnings per share for continuing and discontinued 
operations
For the years ended 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007 , the (loss)/earnings per 
share for continuing and discontinued operations has been calculated using the same 
figures as the overall (loss)/earnings per share, except that the loss for the year used in 
the calculation for the continuing operations (loss)/earnings per share is £6,190,000 
(2007: profit £54,514,000), and for discontinued operations, the profit is £1,986,000 
(2007: profit £29,414,000).
(c) Potentially dilutive instruments
Due to their anti-dilutive nature for the year ended 31 March 2008, 1,878,785 share 
options have been excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation.

Impairment tests for cash generating units containing goodwill
Goodwill arose on the acquisitions made in the year ended 31 March 2006. In the 
year of acquisition, this goodwill was allocated to the Your Communications, Legend 
Communications plc and Intercell businesses which, at that time, were identified as 
separate cash generating units (CGUs). Following the integration of these entities within 
the existing operations during the year ended 31 March 2007 , the number of CGUs 
was redefined. Goodwill, arising on acquisition, has been amended in the current 
year to reflect the deferred consideration revision and has been allocated to  
the following CGUs:
    2008   2007 
    £’000   £’000 
Managed solutions   1,959  2,333 
Data and telecoms   23,432 27 ,898 
Internet   13,853 14,214 
Mobile   11 ,014 13,1 13 
   50,258  57 ,558 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment. The impairment test involves 
determining the recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. 
The recoverable amount is based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
(value in use). As the nature of the Group’s business results in a significant amount of 
unallocated assets and costs, the value in use of all assets has also been considered.
The key assumptions underlying the cash flow projections are revenue growth, 
margins, the level of operating expenditure, the amount of capital expenditure and 
the terminal value of the CGU. The cash flow projections are based on formally 
approved management cash flow projections for a ten-year period which, for the first 
five years, are based on past experience and future expectations and, for the next five 
years, are based on growth rates consistent with UK growth forecasts. These are then 
extrapolated into perpetuity using a nominal long-term growth rate based on United 
Kingdom GDP of 3.1% (2007: 3.0%). A pre-tax discount rate in the range of 9.2% to 
10.8% (2007: 9.8% to 1 1%) has been used. The cost of capital assigned to CGUs 
can have a significant effect on the valuation. The cost of capital reflects a number of 
financial and economic variables including the risk free interest rate and a premium 
to reflect the inherent risks. These variables are established based on management 
judgement.
Having reviewed the key assumptions used, the Directors do not believe that there is 
a reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions that would require further 
disclosure.

The investment in subsidiary undertakings represents an investment in shares of £56,963,000 (2007: £56,963,000). 
During the year the Company implemented the requirements of IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’ and IFRIC 1 1 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions’ and as a result, the 
value of the investments increased by £739,000 (2007: £1,164,000), representing the fair value of share-based payments granted by the Company to the employees of the 
Company's wholly owned subsidiary THUS plc.
The shares used to satisfy the obligation arising from these options are held by the Employee Share Trust, which is sponsored by the subsidiary THUS plc. The increase in the cost 
of investment is matched by a reduction in the value of investments of £739,000 (2007: £1,164,000) arising from the recharge arrangement with THUS plc, through which shares 
are given to the Company to allow it to satisfy its obligation arising from the share-based payment arrangements. Accordingly, no movement is disclosed above in investments in 
subsidiaries.
Details of the Company’s significant subsidiary undertakings, all of which are included in the consolidation, at 31 March 2008, are as follows:

THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008 23 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings – continued
(a) Secured bank loans   
The secured bank loans are stated net of unamortised issue costs of £1,377 ,000 (2007: £739,000). The secured bank loans are secured by a bond and floating charge over the 
undertaking and all property and assets, present and future, of the Group, and by a fixed and floating charge over the properties, plant and machinery, securities, debts, bank 
accounts, goodwill and uncalled capital and intellectual property rights of the Group.  
On 30 June 2007 , the Group repaid £2,000,000 of the final facility of the secured bank loans in line with the bi-annual loan repayment schedule. On 12 July 2007 , the Group 
replaced this £15,000,000 revolving credit facility and £36,000,000 facility, with a £60,000,000 revolving credit facility and a £50,000,000 term loan facility.  
The repayment of both facilities falls due for full and final settlement on 12 July 2012.
The purpose of the replacement bank facility is for general corporate purposes including working capital requirements. The bank facilities incurred commitment fees of 
£1,045,000 being 0.95% of the facilities obtained.
The Group has £10,000,000 of committed but undrawn facilities at 31 March 2008 (2007: £Nil). 
The interest rate applied to the loan facilities is calculated as being the aggregate of an applicable margin, LIBOR and a mandatory cost, if any. The mandatory cost is defined as 
an addition to the interest rate to compensate the lenders for certain compliance costs.     
The average interest rate charged during the year was 7 .43% (2007: 7 .22%).
(b) Other loans  
The other loans were secured by a debenture giving a fixed and floating charge over all assets of the Group.

Financial risk management 
Overview 
The Group has exposure to the following risks from the use of financial instruments: 
liquidity risk  >
credit risk  >
market risk  >
interest rate risk  >
currency risk  >
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the business including those specifically listed above. The Board of Directors, 
via the Audit Committee, regularly review this process.
Risk assessments are carried out on key processes and quarterly reviews are carried out by the Risk Management Group. These assessments cover all aspects of business risk such 
as financial, operational, strategic, compliance and business continuity. In addition to this, risk reviews are also carried out to identify and assess the key business risks associated 
with the achievement of strategic objectives. The reviews are assigned to risk owners, who have a responsibility to regularly monitor and review risks within the Group. A review 
includes consideration of the nature and extent of the risks facing the Group, the likelihood of the risks materialising, and a review of the controls and action plans associated with 
the risk. 
A quarterly presentation is made to the Audit Committee on the assessment of the risk assessments and risk reviews by the Internal Audit function. This will include control failings 
and/or weaknesses assessed as significant and discussions on the actions taken by the business to address them.
(a) Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have 
sufficient liquid funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due. 
The Group's banking facilities include a £60,000,000 revolving credit facility and a £50,000,000 term loan facility with the Royal Bank of Scotland, Rabobank International 
London, Allied Irish Bank, Halifax Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB Bank and National Australia Bank. All loans are subject to various financial covenants.
Liquidity is managed by the use of annual cash flow budgets and cash flow forecasts, and monitoring of actual cash flow performance against budgets and forecasts. Identified 
surplus cash is either placed on deposit, or used to repay existing facilities.
The table below details the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments.

(b) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group and Company if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises from the Group and Company's 
trade receivables. 
The Group and Company monitor the exposures and the credit rating of their counterparties regularly, and carry out appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales 
commence, to mitigate the credit risk that the Group and Company may have with any one counterparty. It is not anticipated that any existing counterparties will fail to meet their 
current obligations. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
Trade and other receivables
The Group and Company operate ‘debt paths’ to manage credit risk for counterparties that do not honour agreed credit terms. The debt paths include escalation, suspension of 
services, offset of amounts payable, and recourse to court action to recover monies outstanding. Provision is made for doubtful receivables upon age of debt and experience of 
collecting overdue debts. The Group will obtain security from customers by way of a deposit to mitigate credit risk.
Guarantees 
THUS Group plc and THUS plc have provided cross guarantees in respect of THUS plc's secured borrowing arrangements. 
(i) Group
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:

Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables due up to 30 days. Allowances are made for 
receivables beyond that date on a specific base, where debt recovery is deemed unlikely.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with banks which are not expected to fail.

The trade receivables balance in the Company balance sheet represents an intercompany loan between THUS Group plc and THUS plc. Although this loan is payable on 
demand, the Directors believe that the amounts are unlikely to be realised in the 12 months from the balance sheet date. 
(c) Market risk
This is defined as the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices will affect the Group and Company income or the value 
of their holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk within acceptable parameters.
Unless approved by the Board, promissory notes, off balance sheet financing and letters of credit are not permitted. Financial instruments require the approval of the Chief 
Financial Officer and the Group Financial Controller. An instrument involving a commitment in excess of £1,000,000 is subject to the approval of the Chief Executive under the 
existing approval framework for general transactions and will be subject to a separate report to the Audit Committee.
(i)  Interest rate risk 
 The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates on borrowings and it is the Group's policy to have a floating rate interest profile, with the exception of finance leases. The 
Group's borrowing facilities and investments are all at a Sterling LIBOR floating rate of interest. Only the interest flows connected to the secured bank loans are hedged and this 
policy has been applied throughout the year. To comply with the Group's secured bank loan facilities, an interest rate hedge with a notional amount equal to a proportion of 
drawn amounts must be in place. The Group has a £25,000,000 interest rate collar in place, which caps LIBOR at 6.00% with a floor of 4.62%. In addition, the Group has a 
£20,000,000 interest rate swap that fixes LIBOR at 5.25%, and a £5,000,000 interest rate swap that fixes LIBOR at 5.29%. 
At the balance sheet date, the interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments was:

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments 
The Group accounts for its interest rate hedging instruments at fair value through the Consolidated Income Statement.  
A change of 100 basis points increasing interest rates at the reporting date, after taking into account hedging instruments, would have decreased equity and increased the loss for 
the year by £600,000 (2007: £530,000).

56 24 Financial instruments – continued
(c) Market risk – continued
(ii) Currency risk 
Group
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than Sterling. Wherever practical, the Group makes sales 
and purchases in its functional currency to minimise currency risk.
THUS faces currency exposure in US Dollars (USD) from operating activities in the United States and has fixed asset expenditure in USD. The Group is also subject to interconnect 
charges in foreign currencies, and was also subject to currency exposure in Euros, and incurred fixed asset expenditure in Euros, from its operating activities in the Netherlands until 
the sale of this operation during the prior year. In addition, on consolidation, THUS is exposed to risk from the translation of net assets and profits earned in its US subsidiary.
THUS does not hedge either the currency exposure on the operating activities to date, which are not considered to be material, or the translation exposure on consolidation as this 
is considered to be an accounting, rather than cash, exposure.
The Group's policy is to engage in exchange rate hedging on a case by case basis for specific material transactions that occur at known intervals.
The Group's exposure to currency risk is deemed to be immaterial.
Company 
All transactions entered into by the Company are denominated in Sterling. The Company therefore has no exposure to currency risk. 
(d) Capital management 
The Board's policy for managing capital is to use banking facilities for trading purposes and consider appropriate capital structures for non-trading requirements.
From time to time, the Group purchases its own shares in the market through an Employee Share Trust. The decision to purchase or sell own shares is made by the Trustees of the 
Employee Share Trust. The Group and Company do not currently have a share buyback plan. Any future share buyback would require the approval of the Board after shareholder 
consent is obtained. 
There were no changes to the Group and Company's approach to capital management during the year.
No Group companies were subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
(e) Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through Consolidated Income Statement
The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments. All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage business risks. The Group has a 
£25,000,000 interest rate collar in place which caps LIBOR at 6.00% with a floor of 4.62%. In addition, the Group has a £20,000,000 interest rate swap that fixes LIBOR at 
5.25% and a £5,000,000 interest rate swap that fixes LIBOR at 5.29%.
The fair value is based on the value at which one party assumes the rights and duties of another party.
The hedging instruments were entered into during the current year, and the movement in fair value is given in the table below:

(ii)  Estimation of fair values 
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values shown above. 
Trade and other receivables/payables – the fair value of receivables and payables with a remaining life of less than one year is deemed to be the same as the book value.
Cash and cash equivalents – the fair value is deemed to be the same as the carrying amount due to the short maturity of these instruments.
Derivatives used for hedging – the fair value is based on quotes provided by the issuers of those instruments.
Secured bank loans and other loans – the fair value is considered to be the same as the book value as the loans are charged at floating rates of interest.
Finance lease liabilities – the fair value is based on the discounted future cash flows expected to be paid out by the Group. The fair values are based on cash flows discounted 
using a rate based on borrowings of 7 .00% (2007: 7 .68%).

The Directors have prepared long-term financial projections, which highlight that the Group should become tax paying in the future. Consequently, the Directors are of the view 
that recognition of the deferred tax assets is appropriate.
Tax losses are carried forward indefinitely. The deductible temporary differences do not expire under the current tax legislation.

(a) Issue of shares 
On 1 February 2007 , 2,274,701 ordinary shares of 25p each with a total nominal value of £569,000 were issued and allotted to United Utilities PLC as an additional 
consideration for the acquisition of Your Communications. This consideration was valued at £3,526,000 using the share price at the date of acquisition of 15.5p (prior to the 10 
to 1 share consolidation) and £2,957 ,000 was transferred to the Share Premium Account.
(b) Shares to be issued 
Under the terms of the acquisition of Your Communications, United Utilities PLC was potentially entitled to a further allotment of consideration shares. This entitlement was dependent 
upon the THUS Group plc share price reaching, or exceeding, certain strike prices from the date of completion, 26 February 2006, up to and including, 31 December 2007 . The 
maximum number of shares that could have potentially been allotted under the terms of the acquisition were 12,001,006 ordinary shares of 25p each. This would have represented 
a total nominal value of £3,000,000. If the maximum number of shares had been allotted, under the terms of the agreement, United Utilities PLC would have had a potential 
shareholding of 26.5% in the Company. At 31 December 2007 , the share price had not reached the requisite strike prices therefore, under the terms of the agreement, no further 
allotment of consideration shares is due for the year ended 31 March 2008.
(c) Rights attaching to ordinary shares
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to:
(i)  Dividends – the holders of ordinary shares are entitled to dividends as declared from time to time by the Company.
(ii)  Voting rights – every member is entitled to one vote per share at general meetings of the Company, but only if the shares held by the member are fully paid.
(iii)  Distribution of assets on liquidation – in the event of a winding-up of the Company, the whole or any part of the assets of the Company may be divided amongst the 
members in specie. The liquidator is also entitled to value the assets and determine how the division is to be carried out as between the members, or different classes of 
members, or vest the whole or any part of the assets in trust for the benefit of the members and determine the scope and terms of those trusts.

The Cumulative loss reserve closing balance is offset by £20,886,000 (2007: £21,232,000) in respect of own shares held. 
(i)  The shares issued in the prior year, were valued at a consideration of £3,526,000 with £2,957 ,000 being transferred to the Share premium account. Other costs totalling 
£47 ,000 were also incurred during the year ended 31 March 2007 relating to the issue of shares in the previous year.
(ii)  The shares to be issued in respect of the acquisition of Your Communications were satisfied in ordinary shares (see Note 27(a)). 
(iii)  The reduction in the Shares to be issued reserve for the current year reflects the lapsing of the deferred consideration following the Company's share price not reaching the 
required strike prices. In the prior year, the reduction reflected an update of the valuation of the remaining 9,726,305 shares potentially due to United Utilities PLC at that time 
using a ‘Monte Carlo’ simulation methodology and a share price volatility of 28% (see Note 27 (b)).
(iv)  This represented net foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the Financial Statements of foreign operations which were released back to the Consolidated 
Income Statement following the disposal of the Netherlands operations.
(v)  T h e THUS plc Employee Share Trust was established at the time of THUS plc’s flotation in November 1999. THUS plc provided the Trust with a £24 million non-interest-
bearing loan to purchase shares in THUS plc to satisfy the various share option schemes in existence at the time. When the new holding company, THUS Group plc, was 
established and the THUS plc shares were delisted, all THUS plc shares were converted to THUS Group plc shares. These shares have been classified as Treasury shares. 
Shares held by the Trust are transferred to employees on payment of the option price.
  The number of own shares, held by the Employee Share Trust and over which the Group has de facto control, as at 31 March 2008 was 1,629,985 (2007: 866,376).  
At 31 March 2008, 6,160 (2007: 5,570) shares were under option to employees.
  The market value as at 31 March 2008 of the shares held under trust and which have not yet vested unconditionally with employees is £1,939,682 (2007: £1,596,298). 
  The nominal value of the own shares held under trust as at 31 March 2008 was £407 ,496 (2007: £216,594).
(vi)  The Merger reserve balance consists of two elements. On 12 March 2002, the Company issued shares for a consideration, less expenses, of £566,560,000. At this  
time the Group demerged from its former parent, and this restructuring was accounted for using merger accounting principles under the then UK GAAP. During the year  
ended 31 March 2006, £19,996,000 was added to this reserve representing the element of the share issue and related costs that were assigned to the purchase of  
Your Communications Group Limited and Intercell Limited, in accordance with Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985. 
(vii)  The Capital redemption reserve was created when 25,000,000 deferred non-voting shares of 92 
343/346
p each were cancelled pursuant to a Special Resolution of the 
Company passed on 19 March 2002.

As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has not presented its own Income Statement. The Company’s Income Statement was approved by the 
Board on 20 May 2008. The Company made a loss of £594,000 for the year ended 31 March 2008 (2007: profit £141,000).
During the year, the Company implemented the requirements of IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’ and IFRIC 1 1 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions’ and as a result an 
amount of £739,000 (2007: £1,164,000), was recognised in reserves, representing the fair value of share-based payments granted by the Company to the employees of the 
Company's wholly owned subsidiary, THUS plc. As the shares used to satisfy these options are held by the Employee Share Trust, which is sponsored by THUS plc, this was 
matched by an equal and opposite amount for the recharge from the subsidiary for shares given to the Company to satisfy share-based payments. Accordingly, no movement is 
disclosed above in reserves.

The Group expects to contribute approximately £3,200,000 to its defined benefit plan 
in the next financial year.     
Defined contribution plans     
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans and has also 
made payments to other schemes during the year. 
The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was £1,009,000  
(2007: £909,000).

Other operating leases 
Expiring in over five years    1,954 2,124 
   1,954 2,124 
The Group leases a number of offices, network sites and other assets under operating 
leases. The leases have various terms and renewal options. The Group also leases 
towers under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.  
Properties utilised by the Group are deemed to be operating leases because the terms 
of the leases are considerably shorter than the anticipated useful life of the property 
and all leases are subject to periodic rent reviews where rental charges are updated to 
reflect prevailing market conditions. 
Thirty-two of the leased properties have been sublet by the Group with a further four 
subject to agency arrangements. These leases and subleases expire between six 
months and 19 years and the total future minimum sublease payments expected to 
be received at 31 March 2008 are £12,869,000 (2007: £14,495,000). Sublet 
payments of £1,614,000 (2007: £1,525,000) are expected to be received in the 
following financial year. The Group has recognised a provision of £101,000 in respect 
of two of these properties where the income received does not cover the rent paid out 
by the Group. 
A further £770,000 (2007: £1,710,000) has been provided for 10 properties 
identified for closure following a rationalisation of the combined property portfolio 
subsequent to the acquisition of Your Communications.

33 Employee share schemes  
The Company operates the THUS Group Restricted Scheme, the THUS Group Bonus 
Plan, the THUS Group Performance Share Plan, the THUS Group plc Discretionary 
Share Option Scheme and the THUS Group plc 2006 Co-Investment Plan, details of 
which are explained below. In addition, the Company also recognises the importance 
of encouraging share ownership amongst all employees and to that extent, the 
Company operates the THUS Group plc Sharesave Scheme which provides the 
opportunity for employees to exercise options at the end of a savings contract.
THUS Group Restricted Scheme  
Under this scheme, awards were granted to senior employees of the Group.  
No performance conditions apply. One-third of the award may be exercised after  
one year, two-thirds after two years and the full award after three years. If the holder  
of the award leaves the employment of the Group, the award will lapse. 
THUS Group Bonus Plan 
The shares awarded to the Executives under this plan are of an equivalent value to 
the annual bonus payment. The awards, which are not subject to any performance 
conditions, vest after three years, but will be forfeited if the Executive leaves the 
employment of the Company before the end of the vesting period. The Company has 
the right to settle the awards in cash rather than shares. 
THUS Group Performance Share Plan 
Awards are made under this plan to Executive Directors and selected employees, and 
grants will only become exercisable after three years if demanding performance targets 
are met. Two performance criteria currently apply to the vesting of performance share 
awards. For half of an award of performance shares to vest, THUS' Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) compared to that of the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Telecoms Sector, 
as at the date of the grant, is measured over a three-year period. No shares vest where 
the Company’s TSR is below the median. The minimum proportion of shares that vest at 
the median is 30%. All shares vest when the Company’s TSR is at the upper decile. 
Performance is measured over three years with no retesting opportunities. The 
Remuneration Committee must also be satisfied at the time the performance condition 
is met that this is consistent with the achievement of commensurate underlying financial 
performance of the Company. 
For the remaining half of the performance share awards to vest, normalised Earnings 
Per Share (EPS) performance of the Company is measured over a three-year period. 
The EPS test is set with reference to broker forecasts covering the relevant three-year 
period. The extent to which EPS targets are satisfied after three years will be confirmed 
by the Remuneration Committee.
Awards made under the Performance Share Plan during the year ended 31 March 
2008, are subject to the following performance conditions measured over a three year 
period beginning the financial year in which the award is made:
50% of an award is subject to annual compound growth in EBITDA of 15% to 35% >
50% is subject to an EBIT return on capital of 4% to 8% for the final year of the  >
performance period.
In both cases 30% of that part of the award vests at the threshold, increasing on a 
straight-line basis so that there is full vesting at the maximum threshold.
THUS Group plc Discretionary Share Option Scheme 
Under this scheme, market value options can be granted to Executive Directors and 
selected employees. The performance criterion that currently applies to the vesting of 
options is relative TSR measured against the FTSE Telecommunications sector and the 
FTSE Mid-250 (excluding telecommunication companies). Two-thirds of the options vest 
depending on the Company’s TSR compared against the telecommunications index, 
and one-third depending on the Company’s TSR compared against the FTSE Mid-250. 
Half the options become exercisable when the Company’s TSR is at the median. 
All the options are exercisable when the Company’s TSR is at the upper quartile. 
The Remuneration Committee must also be satisfied that the underlying financial 
performance of the Company has improved during the vesting period.

33 Employee share schemes – continued 
THUS Group plc 2006 Co-Investment Plan 
This plan is a co-investment arrangement under which eligible employees, who are 
selected to participate, are invited to contribute shares in the Company which they 
currently own, or shares for which arrangements have been made to acquire with 
funds provided by the employees, to the Plan (’Deposited Shares’). An award will then 
be granted, ’Matching Award’, to allow the participants to acquire further shares. The 
Matching Award will consist of one or both of ’Core Shares’ and ’Performance Shares’. 
The number of Core Shares subject to a Matching Award cannot exceed one half 
of the number of Deposited Shares. A participant is entitled to the Core Shares if the 
related Deposited Shares are left in the Plan until the end of a predetermined holding 
period. The number of Performance Shares subject to a Matching Award cannot 
exceed the number of Deposited Shares contributed. A participant will be entitled to 
some or all of the Performance Shares if the related Deposited Shares are left in the 
Plan until the end of the holding period and the performance conditions are satisfied.
The maximum value of Deposited Shares that a participant can contribute to the Plan 
in any one year will be 25% of their gross annual basic salary. The performance 
conditions for the Performance Shares are that half of each award is subject to the 
performance of Group EBITDA, and the other half is based on Group EBIT return on 
capital. 
For the Group EBITDA-related performance condition, the annual compound growth 
rate in EBITDA must exceed 20% for 15% of the Performance Shares to vest and rises 
on a straight-line basis to 50% vesting for an EBITDA growth rate of 35% a year  
or above. 
For awards granted during the year ended 31 March 2008 the annual compound 
growth rate for the EBITDA – related performance condition is a range of 15% to 35%. 
For the other half of the Performance Shares to vest, the Group’s annual compound 
growth in EBIT return on capital requires to exceed certain percentages. For 15% of the 
Performance Shares to vest, the annual compound growth must exceed 4% and rises 
on a straight-line basis to 50% vesting for an EBIT return on capital of 8% or above  
a year.
THUS Group plc Sharesave Scheme 
Under this scheme, in normal circumstances, share options are exercisable on 
completion of a three- or five-year save-as-you-earn contract, as appropriate.
Closed Schemes  
Prior to the establishment of THUS Group plc on the demerger from its former parent 
company, THUS plc operated a number of share incentive plans pursuant to which 
awards over shares in THUS Group plc continue to subsist. No further awards will be 
made under any of these schemes. As the awards were granted before 7 November 
2002, the recognition and measurement principles of IFRS 2 ’Share-Based Payments’ 
have not been applied to these schemes.
The terms and conditions of the grants are as follows:

The options outstanding at 31 March 2008 have an exercise price in the range of £Nil and £1.00 in total and £1.05 to £2.58 per share, and a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of 1.8 years. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise, during the year ended 31 March 2008, was £1.84 (2007: £1.42).
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted. The estimate of the fair value of services 
received is measured using the Black-Scholes model for the Bonus Plan, Restricted Scheme and various Sharesave schemes. The remaining schemes have been valued using a 
combination of Black-Scholes and the binomial lattice models.

(a)  The expected volatility has been based on the daily share price movements over 
the three years preceding the granting of an award, rounded to the nearest 10%.
(b)  No dividends have been payable by the Company since flotation and it has 
been assumed that this will continue, therefore a zero dividend yield has  
been used.
(c)  The risk-free interest rate is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds on 
terms consistent with the option life.   
(d)  The fair values for the Restricted Scheme have been calculated to be equal to 
the face value, therefore no expected volatilty or risk-free interest rate has been 
quoted in the table above.  
(e)  The performance conditions of the Co-Investment Plans and Performance Share 
Plan depend upon the performance of the Group and are therefore considered 
to be non-market-based tests, which are excluded from the fair value calculations. 
The fair value of these plans has been calculated to be 100% of the face value 
and, as a result, no values for expected volatility or risk-free interest rate are 
quoted in the table above.

35 Related party transactions
(a) Group
The Group has a related party relationship with its Directors and Executive Officers 
and major shareholders. All transactions with subsidiaries are eliminated on 
consolidation in these Financial Statements therefore no disclosure is made concerning 
these items.
(b) Company
The Company has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries, its Directors and 
Executive Officers and major shareholders.
(c) Transactions with key management personnel 
The key management personnel compensation is disclosed in Note 10 above.
(d) Transactions with subsidiaries 
During the year ended 31 March 2008, the Company transferred the release 
of the deferred consideration of £7 ,300,000 relating to the acquisition of Your 
Communications to THUS plc following the previous transfer of the cost of the Your 
Communications investment to the subsidiary. This transfer, along with other transactions 
between THUS Group plc and THUS plc, results in a total loan outstanding at  
31 March 2008 of £70,188,000.
The intercompany loan of £70,188,000 (2007: £78,095,000) due from THUS plc is 
repayable on demand and is interest free. However, this loan is unlikely to be repaid 
by THUS plc within the next 12 months. 
(e) Other related party transactions
Following the acquistion of Your Communications in February 2006, United Utilities 
PLC held 21.7% of the Company’s issued share capital, and was therefore considered 
to be a related party from this date. Following the additional share issue in February 
2007 , United Utilities PLC had a 22.63% shareholding in THUS Group plc at  
31 March 2007 .
On 20 June 2007 , United Utilities PLC placed its entire shareholding in THUS and from 
this date is no longer considered to be a related party of the Group.

66 36 Accounting estimates and judgements
Critical accounting judgements in applying the Group and Company 
accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. It also requires the Directors 
to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Group and Company 
accounting policies. Estimates, assumptions and judgements are continually evaluated 
based on available information and experience. As the use of estimates is inherent  
in financial reporting, actual results could differ from these estimates. The areas 
involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity which have a significant risk 
of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are 
described below. 
Revenue 
The Group earns revenue from a number of different products and services, some of 
which are delivered under bespoke contracts. In applying the Group’s accounting 
policies in respect of revenue recognition, a significant degree of judgement and 
estimation may be required in interpreting contracts and estimating values to be used  
in calculating revenue and associated costs in each accounting period.
Interconnect income and payments to other telecommunications 
operators 
In certain instances THUS relies on other operators to measure the traffic flows 
interconnecting with the Group’s networks. Estimates are used in these cases to 
determine the amount of income receivable from, or payments that the Group need 
to make to, these other operators. The prices at which these services are charged are 
often regulated and are subject to retrospective adjustment, and estimates are used in 
assessing the likely effect of these adjustments.
Providing for doubtful debts
THUS provides services to substantially all customers, on credit terms. Certain debts 
will not be paid through the default of a small number of customers. Estimates, based 
on the Group’s historical experience, are used in determining the level of debts that will 
not, in the opinion of the Directors, be collected. These estimates include such factors 
as the current state of the UK economy and particular industry issues.
Fair values
Estimating the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired on acquisition requires 
judgement. Such fair values have been computed as follows: 
Tangible fixed assets have been valued at their direct replacement cost, less an 
economic obsolescence factor. In addition, this valuation has been cross-checked 
against projected cash flows from cash generating units.  
Intangible fixed assets for customer relationships have been valued using a residual 
earnings approach, which involves deducting contributory asset charges from 
discounted cash flow projections, to leave a value attributable to customers.
Cash flow projections are based on assessments of future activities and market 
conditions, and actual activities and market conditions may differ from those forecast, 
resulting in actual cash flows being different from those projected. Tangible and 
intangible asset valuations are subjective to the extent actual cash flows differ from 
projected cash flows. 
The fair value of working capital amounts is based upon estimated anticipated 
recoverable amounts.
Useful lives for property, plant and equipment
The plant and equipment in THUS’ networks is long lived with cables and switching 
equipment operating for over ten years, and underground ducts being used for 
decades. The annual depreciation charge is sensitive to the estimated service lives 
allocated to each type of asset. Asset lives are assessed annually and changed when 
necessary to reflect current thinking on their remaining lives in light of technological 
change, prospective economic utilisation and physical condition of the assets 
concerned. 
Impairment
THUS tests goodwill annually for impairment. In addition, THUS performs impairment 
testing of assets, on an annual basis, where there is an indication that impairment may 
exist. In performing these impairment tests, management’s judgement is required in 
preparing future cash flow projections, and then assessing an appropriate discount  
rate to be applied to these cash flows. 
The cost of capital used to discount future pre-tax cash flows can have a significant 
effect on the calculation of the recoverable amount. The cost of capital which is 
expressed as a percentage is derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average  
cost of capital specific to that cash generating unit. 
Future cash flows are based on formally approved cash flow projections for a  
ten-year period which, for the first five years, are based on past experience and future 
expectations and, for the next five years, are based on growth rates consistent with UK 
growth forecasts. These are then extrapolated in perpetuity using a nominal long-term 
growth rate. As future cash flows may deviate to some degree from forecasts, the 
results of the impairment review are sensitive to any such changes.
Property arrangements 
As part of the property rationalisation programme, a number of surplus properties have 
been identified and, during the year, some of these properties have been successfully 
disposed of. Efforts continue to be made to sublet the remaining sites; it is recognised 
that this may not be possible immediately in the current economic environment. 
Estimates have been made of the cost of vacant possessions and any shortfall arising 
from the sublease rental income being lower than the lease costs being borne by 
THUS. Any such cost or shortfall has been recognised as a provision.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the 
amounts to be recognised. In particular, judgement is used when assessing the extent 
to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, with consideration given to the 
timing and level of future taxable income. As future taxable income is likely to deviate 
to some degree from forecasts, the amount of the deferred tax assets carried needs to 
be reviewed in the light of such variations. 
Post-retirement benefits 
The Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is assessed annually in accordance with 
IAS 19. The accounting valuation, which was based on assumptions determined with 
independent actuarial advice, resulted in a surplus of £3.8 million being recognised 
on the balance sheet at 31 March 2008 (2007: surplus £0.8 million). The size of the 
surplus/deficit is sensitive to the market value of the assets held by the Scheme and to 
actuarial assumptions, which include price inflation, pension and salary increases, the 
discount rate used in assessing actuarial liabilities, mortality and other demographic 
assumptions and the levels of contributions. Further details are included in Note 31 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
37 Subsequent events
On 30 April 2008, the Group completed the disposal of its interest in a number of 
customer contracts for telephony services to Daisy Communications PLC. The proceeds 
for the disposal are expected to be no less than £2,300,000, dependent upon 
customer churn, over the period to 30 June 2008.

(i)  Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, 
members will be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting if they are registered 
on the Company’s register of members by 6.00 pm on 29 July 2008 or by  
6.00 pm. two days prior to the date of any adjournment of the meeting. Changes 
to entries on the Register of Members after that time shall be disregarded in 
determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting. 
(ii)  Any member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to appoint a 
proxy or proxies to attend. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A 
separate Form of Proxy is enclosed. Completing and returning a Form of Proxy will 
not prevent any member from attending the meeting in person and voting should 
that member so wish. If you are not a member of the Company but you have been 
nominated by a member of the Company to enjoy information rights, you do not 
have a right to appoint any proxies under the procedures set out in this paragraph. 
Please read paragraph (vii) below. 
(iii)  Members may register their proxy appointments or voting directions electronically 
via the www.shareview.co.uk website, where full details of the procedure are 
given. Members will need the reference number, card ID and account number set 
out on the enclosed Form of Proxy. If more than one proxy appointment is returned 
relating to any share, either by paper or by electronic communication, the proxy 
received last by the Registrar before the latest time for receipt of proxies will take 
precedence. The Company will not accept any communication that is found to 
contain a computer virus.
(iv)   CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST 
electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the procedures described 
in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored 
members and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service 
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) who  
will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.

THUS Group plc Annual Report 2008   In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service 
to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ’CREST Proxy Instruction’) 
must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland 
Limited’s (’EUI’s’) specifications and must contain the information required for 
such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless 
of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the 
instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be 
transmitted so as to be received by Equiniti (ID 7RA01) by no later than 1 1.00 am 
on 29 July 2008. No such message received through the CREST network after 
this time will be accepted. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be 
the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Applications Host) from which our registrars are able to retrieve the message by 
enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change 
of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the 
appointee through other means.
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service 
provider(s) should note that EUI does not make available special procedures 
in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations 
will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the 
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member 
is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting 
service provider(s) to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider 
take) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted 
by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST 
members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers 
are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST System and timings.
  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances 
set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
(v)  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, 
arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that (a) if a corporate 
shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate 
representative with instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions 
of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, 
then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to 
the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate 
representative in accordance with those directions; and (b) if more than one 
corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting 
but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting 
as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be 
nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on 
a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that 
designated corporate representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to the 
guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on 
proxies and corporate representatives – www.icsa.org.uk – for further details of 
this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of representation letter if the 
Chairman is being appointed as described in (a) above.
(vi)  As at 5.00 pm on 4 June 2008, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 
183,032,367 ordinary shares of 25p each. Each ordinary share carries the right 
to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number 
of voting rights in the Company as at 5.00 pm on 4 June 2008 is 183,032,367 .
(vii)  If you are a person who has been nominated under Section 146 of the 
Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights (Nominated Person):
you may have a right under an agreement between you and the member of  >
the Company who has nominated you to have information rights (Relevant 
Member) to be appointed or to have someone else appointed as a proxy for 
the meeting;
if you either do not have such a right or if you have such a right but do not  >
wish to exercise it, you may have a right under an agreement between you 
and the Relevant Member to give instructions to the Relevant Member as to 
the exercise of voting rights;
your main point of contact in terms of your investment in the Company  >
remains the Relevant Member (or, perhaps, your custodian or broker) and 
you should continue to contact them (and not the Company) regarding any 
changes or queries relating to your personal details and your interest in the 
Company (including any administrative matters). The only exception to this is 
where the Company expressly requests a response from you.
Notes
Resolution 1
The Directors are required by law to present to the meeting the Financial Statements 
and the Report of the Directors and Auditors for the year ended 31 March 2008.
Resolution 2
The shareholders are being asked to vote on the Remuneration Report relating to the 
Directors and senior executives. The vote is advisory and the Directors’ entitlement to 
remuneration is not conditional on the resolution being passed. 
Resolutions 3–5
The Articles of Association require that Directors stand for election by the shareholders 
at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment and also that one-third 
of the Directors retire at every Annual General Meeting. The Board, following its 
evaluation of the performance of those Directors standing for election and re-election, 
confirms that each of those Directors performs effectively and demonstrates commitment 
to the role. The biographical details of each of the Directors who are offering 
themselves for election or re-election are shown on pages 26 and 27 . The election  
and re-election of those Directors shall, subject to the passing of the relevant 
resolutions, take effect immediately upon the conclusion of the meeting.
Resolution 6
The reappointment of the Auditors is proposed. Following assessment of the audit 
service by the Audit Committee, the Board considers the Auditors to be effective and 
independent in their role.
Resolution 7
Under the Companies Act 1985 (Section 80) the Directors of a company may only 
allot unissued shares if authorised to do so. Passing this Resolution will continue the 
Directors’ flexibility to act in the best interests of shareholders when opportunities arise 
by issuing new shares. 
In Resolution 7 , the Company is seeking authority to allot shares with a nominal value 
of up to £3,61 1,623.75, which represents approximately 14,446,495 ordinary shares 
of 25 pence each or approximately 8% of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital. The Directors intend to use this authority, which will lapse at the conclusion of 
the next Annual General Meeting of the Company (to be held in 2009), or, if earlier, 
30 September 2009, for general corporate purposes. 
Resolution 8
If shares are to be offered for cash, the Companies Act 1985 requires that those 
shares are offered first to the existing shareholders in proportion to the number of shares 
they hold at the time of the offer. However, it may sometimes be in the interests of the 
Company for the Directors to allot shares other than to shareholders in proportion to 
their existing holdings. At last year’s Annual General Meeting shareholders authorised 
the Board, subject to specified limits:
to allot shares in connection with a rights issue, defined in summary as, an offer  >
of equity securities to shareholders which is open for a period decided by the 
Board subject to any limits or restrictions which the Board thinks are necessary or 
appropriate.
to allot shares not in connection with a rights issue up to a specific amount so that  >
the pre-emption requirement does not apply to the allotments of shares for cash up 
to that amount.
This authority requires to be renewed annually. The Directors will be empowered 
by Resolution 8 to allot equity securities (within the meaning of Section 94 of the 
Companies Act 1985) for cash without complying with the statutory pre-emption rights 
of shareholders under Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985, up to a maximum 
nominal amount of approximately £2,287 ,904.50. This disapplication is limited to 
allotments made to ordinary shareholders and holders of any other class of equity 
security in proportion (as nearly as may be) to their holdings and, otherwise, to 
allotments up to a maximum of 9,151,618 ordinary shares (representing approximately 
5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital). 
This means that the interests of existing shareholders are protected. If a share issue is 
not a rights issue the proportionate interest of existing shareholders could not without 
their agreement be reduced by more than 5% of the value of the new shares in cash 
issued to new shareholders by reference to the issued share capital at the date of 
this notice. There are no current plans to allot shares except in connection with the 
employee share schemes.

70 Resolution 9
This resolution which is being proposed as a special resolution will give the Directors 
authority to make market purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares up to a 
maximum aggregate number of 27 ,436,551 ordinary shares (representing 14.99% of 
the share capital of the Company in issue at 4 June 2008). This resolution authorises 
the Company to pay a maximum price per share of an amount equal to the higher 
of (i) 105% of the average closing middle market price for an ordinary share for the 
five dealing days preceding any such purchase and (ii) the price stipulated by Article 
5(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2273/2003 (the Buy-back and Stabilisation 
Regulation), being the higher of the last independent trade for an ordinary share or 
the highest current independent bid for an ordinary share as derived from the trading 
venue where the purchase is carried out. 
Any shares repurchased by the Company under the authority would be cancelled. 
There is currently no intention to hold such shares in treasury. The Company did not 
hold any ordinary shares in the capital of the Company in treasury at 4 June 2008 
(being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice) except for 
1,618,548 market-purchased ordinary shares held in the Employee Share Trust in 
connection with employee share schemes.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising on behalf of the Company the 
authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares. The Directors would only cause 
the Company to purchase shares if, in their opinion, the expected effect would be to 
result in an increase in earnings per share and would benefit shareholders generally. 
The Directors are making no recommendation as to whether shareholders should sell 
their shares in the Company.
At 4 June 2008, being the last practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice, 
there were options outstanding over 4,879,538 ordinary shares in the capital of the 
Company which represent approximately 2.66% of the share capital of the Company 
in issue at that date. If the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares 
was exercised in full, the shares issued pursuant to these options would represent 
approximately 3.13% the Company’s issued share capital.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors in respect of all  
items of business
The Board is of the opinion that all of the proposed resolutions are in the best interests 
of shareholders as a whole and of the Company. Accordingly, the Board recommends 
that you vote in favour of each resolution, as the Directors intend to do in respect of 
their own beneficial shareholdings held at the time of the Annual General Meeting.

1 Overview:
Our Strategy and Markets
Our objective is to be the pre-eminent 
alternative telecommunication provider  
for business customers in the UK.
Our principal strategies to achieve this objective have 
focused around:
> Deployment of an advanced national, next-
generation telecommunications network.  
This allows us to improve our control over the 
quality of our service delivery, lower our ongoing 
traffic delivery costs and control the rate of  
service evolution.
> Development and sale of a comprehensive 
service portfolio capable of supporting business 
customers through the transition from legacy to 
IP-based and converged telecommunications.
> Attainment of consistently high levels of quality  
in our service delivery.
> Achievement of scale and operating leverage 
across our network and supporting systems.
Focused
Our market
Market structure
Twenty-five years after liberalisation, 
the fixed line business market in the UK 
remains dominated by the incumbent 
provider, BT. 
Although many infrastructure-based 
market entrants have emerged, 
none has yet developed sufficiently 
to deliver sustained growth and 
meaningful returns. In particular,  
an over-investment in legacy networks 
has resulted in an over-supply 
of legacy services and inhibited 
competitors from developing sufficient 
scale to thrive. 
The transition to next-generation 
services has put additional pressure  
on established revenue and margin 
from legacy services for all operators. 
Most suppliers now face significant 
network investment to enable them to 
offer next-generation services. THUS 
made this investment when it put in 
place a next-generation network as 
part of its national network rollout in 
the early part of the decade.
THUS continues to invest judiciously 
to increase its capabilities further, 
maximise the leverage of its assets, 
and deliver future growth and 
operating efficiencies. THUS is 
therefore well positioned to benefit as 
demand consolidates around market 
participants with next-generation 
capability over the longer term.

THUS Group plc Summary Annual Report 2008 Regulation
In 2005, communications regulator 
Ofcom completed its Strategic Review 
of Telecommunications, culminating 
in a new regulatory settlement for the 
industry. The new settlement continues 
to support infrastructure-based 
competition but seeks to promote 
equality of access to those parts of 
the BT network where investment 
in competing infrastructure is not 
sustainable.
A new BT division called Openreach 
was created to provide access to 
these regulated services. Although BT’s 
customers suffered significant disruption 
following the creation of Openreach, 
Ofcom is now taking action to impose 
a service level guarantee regime on 
Openreach which should lead to 
improved service performance.
THUS remains optimistic that the 
regulatory settlement will eventually 
enhance competition, but continued 
vigilance will be required to ensure 
BT does not foreclose competition 
as it implements its next-generation 
network.
Financial targets
Following heavy up-front investment 
in network rollout, our financial plan 
is focused on delivering a return on 
capital employed greater than our 
weighted average cost of capital.  
Key long-term financial targets for  
the Group include:
The Group has achieved three 
important financial milestones, moving 
EBITDA
4
 positive in 2001/02, free 
cash flow
5
 positive in 2004/05 and 
delivering our first operating profit in 
2007/08.

 the previous year. The 
fixed line segment is experiencing 
a transition in demand patterns. 
In particular, demand is moving 
away from traditional or legacy 
telecommunication services, including 
fixed switched voice, frame relay and 
ATM data, as well as narrow-band 
Internet access towards next-
generation, IP-based services such as 
broadband, Ethernet, MPLS IP Virtual 
Private Networks and Voice over IP.

THUS must continue to build market 
share successfully in order to meet 
our longer-term objectives. Based 
on continuing operations

Managed solutions
Data and telecoms

Mobile
Summary of Services
Our Managed solutions portfolio gives customers access 
to the knowledge, skills and experience that we offer as 
an operator of a state-of-the-art network, without the need 
for them to maintain these resources in-house. Our experts 
can help customers to plan, deploy, optimise, manage and 
run their network infrastructure, allowing them to focus on 
their core business, improve operational efficiency and 
reduce operating and capital expenditure. 
THUS is focused on the provision 
of fixed line telecommunication 
services to large business customers 
and public sector organisations, 
while tailoring services to suit  
small and mid-sized businesses 
under the Demon brand.
Continuing operations
THUS has four established business segments  
comprising Managed solutions, Data and telecoms, 
Internet and Mobile.
Managed solutions are run as a separate unit within THUS. 
They comprise large corporate accounts with complex 
service needs, typically combining delivery of several 
different standard services, an element of outsource to 
THUS and longer than average contract duration. 
In contrast, the Data and telecoms, Internet and Mobile 
segments record revenue and results for more standard 
product sales to a wider customer base including corporate, 
small and mid-sized customers, channel resellers and other 
telecommunication companies.
Within each segment, the principal costs comprise 
payments to other telecommunication companies for 
interconnect and use of their network to collect and deliver 
services to THUS customers, other directly variable costs, 
directly attributable selling, distribution and administrative 
costs and depreciation on assets directly attributable to  
that segment.
However, as the majority of services are sold, provisioned 
and run from a unified infrastructure, THUS maintains a 
large pool of central costs. In 2008, these costs reduced  
by 7% to £108.7m
1
 (2007: £1 17 .2m
1
) and comprised 
£41.2m of depreciation, impairment and amortisation  
(2007: £43.4m), £29.4m of network operations and 
maintenance costs (2007: £27 .3m) and £38.1m of 
corporate overheads (2007: £46.5m).
1  Excludes £1.6m of restructuring costs in 2007 .
2  Segmental operating profit excludes  
central costs not allocated to individual segments.
Summary of Services
THUS’ comprehensive portfolio of voice and data 
services is backed by our advanced next-generation 
network. These services are often business-critical and, 
as a result, are supported by stringent Service Level 
Agreements. THUS offers a wide range of high quality 
and flexible services designed to meet the needs of our 
diverse customer base. Our portfolio includes switched 
voice, call recording and conferencing, MPLS IP VPN, 
leased lines and City/National Ethernet services. 
Summary of Services
THUS has many years experience in providing quality 
Internet solutions, and provides a comprehensive portfolio 
of services through Demon, one of the UK’s longest-
established and most recognisable Internet brands. 
With our experience and expertise to deliver, manage 
and support these services we are well equipped to 
understand our customers’ needs and offer solutions right 
for them. Our portfolio includes high performance premier 
broadband, hosting, co-location and security services.
Summary of Services
THUS provides standard and bespoke Mobile solutions, 
tailored to our business customers’ requirements, and 
has the capability to supply integrated voice, data and 
messaging solutions. Products and services range from 
mobile phones and Blackberrys

What Makes THUS Different
Capability
Our unique capability comes from 
an extensive knowledge of the 
telecommunications industry and  
many years of experience working 
with our customers to ensure that  
we provide the right solutions.
Our state-of-the-art next-generation 
network (NGN), coupled with our 
technical capability, is crucial in 
delivering innovative, compelling  
and flexible communication solutions  
to a broad range of customers.
Our network is one of the most 
technically advanced in the UK,  
and allows us to harness new 
opportunities for our customers.  
It provides a single platform for the 
deployment of advanced business 
applications, allowing both voice and 
data to exist on the same advanced 
network. The result is a simplified 
communications infrastructure that 
delivers both performance gains  
and cost savings for our customers. 
We have configured our NGN to 
ensure maximum performance and 
reliability at all times.
Consultation
At THUS, we add value to our 
customers’ operations through our 
consultative approach. Our goal 
is to drive success through in-depth 
customer and market knowledge.  
This has resulted in notable success 
and is recognised by our customers 
as a key differentiator. We lead on 
thorough consultative engagement, 
supported by our extensive sector 
knowledge and an in-depth 
understanding of both our customers’ 
requirements and their key drivers.
We have extensive experience  
across multiple sectors nationwide. 
New business won this year  
included contract wins in the fields  
of education, utilities, retail, media  
and the public sector. 
THUS believes in strong client 
engagement, which succeeds 
in building relationships with our 
customers based on trust and 
understanding, and allows us to 
identify their real requirements  
and challenges.

Our Journey to Profit
Vision
Presence
Profit
Vision
Our vision for the future provision of 
telecommunication solutions led to the 
construction of our next-generation 
network at the beginning of the decade. 
This has enabled us to differentiate 
ourselves from our competitors and 
ensures we are strongly positioned 
within the marketplace.
The current marketplace transition away 
from legacy services towards next-
generation telecommunication services 
continues to accelerate as our customers 
realise the benefits of adopting these 
advanced solutions compared to the 
more commoditised legacy services. 
Over 70% of our new business won
1
 
this year was for next-generation services. 
As a result, THUS has now passed the 
inflexion point with over 60% of our 
variable gross margin now derived from 
these next-generation services. 
THUS is committed to delivering 
visionary, innovative solutions that allow 
our customers to achieve their aspirations 
and provide them with a competitive 
edge. We continue to look beyond 
today’s needs to the next-generation of 
advanced telecommunication solutions 
that will best serve the needs of our 
customers.
Presence
We have successfully grown our 
business every year since our flotation in 
1999. This organic growth strategy was 
complemented by our first acquisitions 
in 2006 – Your Communications and 
Legend Communications. 
The acquisitions accelerated our 
achievement of increased scale whilst 
also improving our geographical 
reach in the North of England by 
complementing THUS’ existing market 
presence. As a result, THUS has 
achieved a truly nationwide presence 
in the UK.
1 Represents major corporate and public sector contracts typically covering higher value bespoke sales. 
2 THUS market share is based on continuing operations revenue (excluding mobile) for a financial year. 2007 market share is for the financial  
year ended 31 March 2008. 2002-06 is based upon Ofcom’s ‘The Communications Market 2007’. 2007 is based upon a THUS estimate.

THUS Group plc Summary Annual Report 2008 Strategic Progress and Success:
Our Journey to Profit
THUS’ visionary solutions for 
customers ensure we are strongly 
positioned in the marketplace, where 
we have achieved a truly nationwide 
presence, and momentum within our 
business enabled us to deliver our 
first full year of operating profit.
As we successfully grow our enlarged 
business organically we continue to 
take market share
2
 and estimate that it 
is now 8.7%, up from 7 .6% last year. 
We must continue to successfully build 
our market share in order to achieve our 
long-term financial objectives. 
Profit
The strong growth of our higher margin 
next-generation services, together 
with the benefits from our increased 
scale and the successful delivery of the 
planned savings from the integration 
of Your Communications and Legend 
Communications, enabled us to 
achieve our first full year of operating 
profit this year.
Momentum within our business is 
evidenced by winning new business 
nationwide across multiple sectors,  
and financial performance for the 
second half of the year accelerated with 
revenue up 5% and EBITDA
3
 up 15% 
compared to the first half of the year.
The achievement of our first operating 
profit is another important milestone 
for THUS. Our next financial goal is to 
deliver, for our stakeholders, a return 
on capital employed greater than our 
weighted average cost of capital.
To achieve this goal we must continue 
to win business from new customers 
and extend relationships with existing 
customers whilst maintaining our 
disciplines of operational productivity, 
sound cash management and a capital 
investment programme focused on 
driving future growth.

THUS Group plc Summary Annual Report 2008 I am pleased to report that this  
has been another year of strong 
growth and achievement for your 
Company, with revenue up by  
8% to £576.2 million, and the 
achievement of our first operating 
profit of £4.0 million compared with 
an operating loss
1
 of £9.5 million 
last year. It has been a busy year 
with major project implementations, 
growth in new services and the 
refinancing of our balance sheet, 
providing greater borrowing facilities 
on better terms than previously. 
I take great pride in your Company’s 
ability to win and successfully 
implement large Managed solutions 
contracts for our customers, and to 
continue to grow our next-generation 
services. Against the backdrop of a 
tough and challenging UK business 
services market, THUS has improved its 
competitive position and, once again, 
increased its market share.  
Philip Rogerson, Chairman (left) and 
William Allan, Chief Executive (right).
In addition to achieving the important 
milestone of operating profit we 
returned to positive free cash flow
2
 in 
the second half of the year, after the 
heavy investment in integration costs 
and the capital investment in the three 
major customer projects we announced 
last year. Indeed, 83% of capital 
investment this year was focused on 
customer related activity, up from the 
77% I announced last year. All of this 
bodes well for the future.
In July 2007 we refinanced our 
balance sheet with a new £1 10 million, 
five year facility on favourable terms. 
Our balance sheet strength, with 
net gearing at only 6.9%, gives 
our customers confidence and we 
maintain a healthy cash balance.
In June 2007 our largest shareholder, 
United Utilities, successfully disposed of 
its shareholding in your Company. As a 
consequence Martin Beesley, the Non-
executive Director representing United 
Utilities, resigned from your Board. 
Summary Directors’ Report:
Chairman’s Statement
It is the energy and initiative of our staff in  
THUS that provides the fuel for our growth  
and many achievements.
In December 2007 , Jo Connell 
resigned from your Board after seven 
years of service. Jo was an active 
and lively member of your Board 
who took a keen interest in many 
facets of your Company. Her insights 
and experience in technology and 
customer service were greatly valued.
We offer both Jo and Martin our 
thanks and best wishes for the future.
In November 2007 , we were 
pleased to welcome Alison Wood 
to your Board. Alison brings a wealth 
of experience in corporate strategy, 
government relations and mergers and 
acquisition activity, and will significantly 
reinforce our knowledge and expertise 
in these areas.
It is the energy and initiative of our  
staff in THUS that provides the fuel  
for our growth and many 
achievements. We recognise the 
challenge in our market and the 
uncertainty about the UK economy, 
but we are proud to have committed 
staff full of enterprise who share our 
optimism for the future. I offer them all 
my sincere thanks and congratulations 
for another successful year.

THUS Group plc Summary Annual Report 2008 I was particularly pleased to 
announce our maiden operating 
profit for the year at our Preliminary 
results in May. Our growth in 
profits has been achieved from 
our increased market share and 
improved productivity, validating  
our strategy to focus on next-
generation services in the UK 
business services market.
The transition from legacy to next-
generation services continues and 
has improved our overall revenue mix. 
Over 70% of all new major corporate 
and public sector contracts
1
 this year 
were for next-generation services. 
These services offer our customers 
greater efficiency, features and 
functionality within their businesses. 
Managed solutions revenue increased 
by 17% and data services revenue 
increased by 1 1%. Although revenue 
from voice services grew by 1 1%, 
we do not expect continued growth 
in Carrier Pre-Select (CPS) services, 
since these services will lose 
traction in the market as customers 
increasingly embrace Internet Protocol 
(IP) services and converged solutions. 
THUS is strongly positioned. Our 
consultative engagement with our 
customers, our understanding of their 
business and telecommunication 
needs, and our innovative approach 
to convergence and service evolution 
allows us to sustain a competitive 
edge. THUS has a strong track record 
of service innovation, and this year 
has been no exception with fifteen 
new service enhancements launched 
to benefit our customers and improve 
our competitive position.
Our capital investment continues at 
almost 10% of revenue, with 83% 
focused directly on customer related 
activity. This is a higher percentage 
than last year, reflecting our success 
in winning larger and more complex 
Managed solutions customers. 
Nevertheless, we do not neglect  
our back office or core network and 
we have improved the availability  
on our core MPLS network, and the 
consistently high levels of service 
quality we offer. In addition, we  
have received ISO/IEC 27001:2005 
accreditation for the Information 
Security Management System 
supporting our MPLS network.  
This complements our longer standing 
ISO 9001:2000 accreditation.  
These standards give confidence  
to our customers about the quality 
standards in our business, and allow 
us to compete in new business areas.
As we have grown our business, 
our increased scale has offered 
new opportunities to improve our 
operating efficiency and productivity. 
Revenue grew by 8% this year 
but our operating costs
2
 reduced 
by 8%. At 14.4% of revenue, our 
operating costs
2
 are now below 
the level achieved before we made 
our two acquisitions in 2006, 
reinforcing the successful integration 
of Your Communications and Legend 
Communications into THUS. All of this 
improves our competitiveness and our 
ability to further scale our business 
from new revenue growth.
Our business strategy is sound.  
We have the scale and capability to 
compete and successfully implement 
large and complex bespoke customer 
applications. We are strongly 
positioned to benefit as our customers 
and our industry makes the transition 
to next-generation services. We have 
a talented and committed workforce, 
with an enviable track record on 
service innovation and enterprise. 
Although there is uncertainty about 
the UK economy, the outlook for 
this financial year is in line with the 
Board’s expectations.

13 Results 
The focus of our performance review 
is on our continuing operations
1
 which 
are based solely in the UK. Unless 
otherwise stated, comparatives are 
against the prior year.
Continuing operations
1
Revenue increased by 8% to £576.2m 
(2007: £532.7m). Demand for next-
generation services accelerated with 
revenue for these services increasing 
by 1 1% whilst revenue from our legacy 
services increased by 6%.
Gross profit increased 6% to £95.6m 
(2007: £89.7m) and gross profit 
margins were 16.6% (2007: 16.8%). 
Over 60% of variable gross margin 
is now derived from next-generation 
services, up 7% on the prior year.
EBITDA
2
 increased by 33% to £57 .0m 
(2007: £42.9m), representing the 
third consecutive year of expansion, 
and EBITDA
2
 margins improved 
to 9.9% (2007: 8.0%). Growth in 
next-generation services variable 
gross margin contributed £18.8m 
of the improvement in EBITDA
2
 and 
combined with cost savings (net of 
other operating income) of £4.3m 
more than compensated for the 
decline in legacy variable gross 
margin of £9.0m.
After depreciation and amortisation 
charges of £53.0m (2007: £52.4m) 
the Group delivered its first operating 
profit of £4.0m. This compared to an 
operating loss, before restructuring 
costs, of £9.5m last year.
Dividend
The Company has not declared or 
paid a dividend on its share capital 
(2007: £Nil). Given the Company’s 
stage of development and the 
accumulated losses from the network 
deployment, the Board is not yet able 
to declare a dividend.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure (including 
expenditure on intangible assets) for 
continuing operations
1
 was £56.5m 
compared with £59.3m last year. 
This is equivalent to 10% of revenue 
compared with 1 1% last year and is  
in-line with our stated long-term 
financial target of approximately  
10% of revenue.
Update on integration plan
The integration of Your 
Communications and Legend 
Communications has been 
substantially completed. The remaining 
activities continue to proceed ahead 
of original expectations and the 
Company achieved, as previously 
advised, 90% of the £30m forecast 
annual synergy savings exiting this 
year on a run rate basis.
Summary Directors’ Report:
Financial Review
Net financing expenses increased by 
£2.8m to £6.8m (2007: £4.0m).
A tax charge of £3.4m was reported 
for the year. Last year a tax credit of 
£69.6m arose due to recognition of 
the deferred tax asset. As a result, the 
loss for the year was £6.2m compared 
to a profit of £54.5m last year.
Basic loss per share for continuing 
operations
1
 was 3.40p compared to 
basic earnings per share of 30.29p 
last year.
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations represent the 
results of Demon Netherlands in the 
current year and prior year. 
This year discontinued operations 
reported a profit of £2.0m principally 
due to the receipt of a tax refund from 
the Dutch tax authorities.
Last year discontinued operations’ 
revenue was £3.2m and operating 
profit was £0.4m reflecting the sale 
of Demon Netherlands in June 2006. 
The consideration received for the sale 
of Demon Netherlands gave rise to a 
post-tax gain on sale of £29.0m and 
resulted in a profit for the year  
of £29.4m.
Basic earnings per share for 
discontinued operations was 1.09p 
down from 16.34p last year.

THUS Group plc Summary Annual Report 2008 Financial position  
and capital structure
THUS is funded by equity, together 
with an element of bank debt and  
a small amount of finance leases.
Cash flows
EBITDA
2
 less capital expenditure was 
£0.5m (2007: negative £(16.4)m). 
Working capital outflows were  
£3.6m (2007: outflows £5.8m)  
and together with £4.3m of net interest 
payments and other movements of 
£1.4m resulted in a free cash outflow
3
 
of £6.0m (2007: outflow £25.7m). 
Free cash flow
3
 for the second half of 
the year improved significantly resulting 
in an inflow of £6.9m compared to an 
outflow of £12.9m for the first half. 
Net debt increased by £6.1m from 
£25.8m at 1 April 2007 to £31.9m  
at 31 March 2008. The cash balance 
at the end of the year was £71.6m. 
Credit metrics
With the capital structure representing 
the financial foundations of the business, 
THUS has taken a conservative stance 
to funding. Net gearing was 6.9% at 
31 March 2008 (31 March 2007: 
5.5%). Our financial position remains 
strong with net debt to EBITDA
2
 of 0.6 
times and EBITDA
2
 net interest
 4
 cover 
of 8.3 times for continuing operations.
Equity
THUS had approximately 183.03m 
ordinary shares in issue at 31 March 
2008 (31 March 2007: 183.03m) 
and a market capitalisation of £218m 
(31 March 2007: £337m).
In June 2007 , United Utilities sold its 
entire 22.63% holding in THUS.
At 31 December 2007 , the contingent 
consideration that was potentially 
payable to United Utilities for the 
purchase of Your Communications  
in February 2006 expired.
Bank debt 
Following an extensive evaluation 
of financing options the Group 
refinanced its existing bank facility 
in July 2007 with a new five year 
facility. The renegotiation of the facility 
on more favourable terms than the 
existing arrangements demonstrated 
the increased strength and capability 
of our business.
As at 31 March 2008, THUS had 
total indebtedness of £103.5m  
(31 March 2007: £57 .1m), comprising 
£100.0m of bank debt and £3.5m  
of finance leases.
Working capital
THUS has a strong track record  
in management of working capital, 
and successfully integrating the 
two acquisitions presented further 
opportunities to reduce debtor days  
of 44 at 31 March 2007 to 40 at  
31 March 2008.
Summary
Demand for our next-generation 
services accelerated this year and 
resulted in an improved revenue mix, 
our third consecutive year of EBITDA
2
 
expansion and our first full year of 
operating profit. We retain a strong 
balance sheet, with low levels of net 
gearing, and returned to positive free 
cash flow
3
 in the second half of the 
year. The outlook for this financial year 
is in line with the Board’s expectations. 
With the capital structure representing the financial foundations  
of the business, THUS has taken a conservative stance to funding.  
Net gearing at the year end was below 7%.

of 1.5 to 2.0 times.
Cost of sales
Although network reach is extensive, 
it is not economically feasible to 
carry all customers’ traffic end-to-end 
and payments to other operators, 
for customer connection and service 
interconnect are the largest component 
of our cost of sales.
Since flotation, THUS has made 
successive improvements to contain  
the increase in payments by increasing 
interconnect points with other 
operators, improving traffic routing 
across the network and participating 
in a wholesale market for the provision 
of last mile access. 
The integration of the THUS network 
with those of the companies acquired 
in 2006, particularly that of Your 
Communications, has delivered  
further network efficiencies.
Scale efficiencies
This year in continuing operations

, 
EBITDA: Revenue improved to 10% 
(2007: 8%), reflecting the benefits 
achieved from our increased scale 
and the successful delivery of the 
planned savings from the integration 
activities surrounding the acquisition 
of Your Communications and Legend 
Communications. The successful 
integration has also resulted in an 
improvement in our operating costs

17 Investors in People
Our commitment to our employees 
is endorsed by our Investors in 
People accreditation. We value this 
accreditation as it is a highly effective 
tool which focuses on training and 
developing our employees to achieve 
our business objectives.
Reward
The performance of managers and 
senior professional staff is linked to the 
Group’s financial results by way of a 
bonus scheme which has targets linked 
to revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. 
To allow flexibility and the ability to 
react to changing market conditions, 
salaries are reviewed quarterly to ensure 
remuneration is appropriate to retain 
high-quality employees. 
For sales staff, commission schemes 
are based on billed revenue, with a 
weighting to increase reward for the  
sale of services with higher profit 
margins and next-generation services.
The Group has offered all employees 
access to an annual Sharesave scheme 
during 2007 /08. The Group Personal 
Pension (GPP) plan matches employee 
contributions up to 6%, affording 
employees the opportunity to build 
meaningful pension provisions for the 
future while strengthening our ability  
to attract and retain quality employees.
During 2007 /08, we launched  
U@THUS reward, an on-line benefits 
programme for all THUS employees. 
This programme affords employees 
the opportunity to purchase additional 
benefits to suit their lifestyle, wherever 
possible, taking advantage of the Inland 
Revenue approved ’salary sacrifice’ 
scheme which results in tax and national 
insurance savings for both employees 
and the Group.
Our culture
We place a strong emphasis on 
creating a positive working culture, 
encouraging a clear understanding 
of our objectives and key business 
imperatives. Our talented and skilled 
employees underpin our ability to 
deliver innovative telecommunication 
services that bring value to our 
customers’ business operations. 
The enthusiasm, flexibility and 
continued development of our 
employees remain vital to achieving 
our overall objectives and we continue 
to invest in training and development 
to enhance their skillbase. Providing 
our employees with the resources they 
require to maximise their performance 
and drive business growth remains 
a priority. Our objective is to ensure 
measures are in place to retain and 
develop our employees while, at 
the same time, attracting talented 
individuals to join our organisation.
Maximising our people 
performance
At THUS, we encourage, value 
and reward superior performance. 
The performance of employees is 
measured against clear, business-
focused objectives and through our 
‘Windmills’ performance appraisal 
process. This is supported by an 
on-going programme of two-way 
communication, including a quarterly 
one-to-one process which ensures that 
qualitative discussions are taking place 
with employees at regular intervals 
throughout the year. 
Developing our people
We are focused on developing 
employee skill levels and a strong 
corporate culture which best facilitate 
growth, superb customer service 
and cost competitiveness, all aimed 
at enhancing sustainable growth in 
shareholder value. The capability, 
performance and commitment of  
our employees remain key factors  
in our ability to grow our business in 
the competitive market in which we 
operate. We have a highly qualified 
workforce, with our recent employee 
survey indicating that over 60%  
of our employees have degrees,  
and/or professional qualifications. 
Growing our talent
At THUS, we place a strong 
emphasis on continuous professional 
development. We believe that this is 
vital to attracting and recruiting the 
highest calibre people. We have a 
number of ways of doing this:
Undergraduate sponsorships
and student placements
This year, in addition to recruiting 
graduate trainees into our business,  
we are also sponsoring ten 
undergraduate students from  
The University of Greenwich. This 
sponsorship allows these students  
to undertake their chosen studies 
without the financial pressures which 
might impede their effective learning.
Talent management
In 2007 , we launched our ‘Talent 
Spotting’ programme which involved  
a rigorous application process, internal 
and third-party recommendations  
and a series of assessment exercises. 
The programme successfully identified 
high potential employees who have 
now embarked on personalised 
development programmes.

account of employee views and 
feedback when planning change. 
Equal opportunities
THUS is committed to promoting  
equal opportunities for all of our

of employment of disabled persons  
is the same as that relating to all

19 Summary Directors’ Report:
Environment and Community 
Charitable and political donations 
Following the share consolidation in 
March 2006, the fractional share 
entitlements were sold, raising net 
proceeds of approximately £274,000. 
The Directors’ aim was to apply these 
proceeds for gifts or donations to a 
range of worthy causes and a number 
of initiatives are underway throughout 
the UK. During the year, the Group 
made the following charitable 
donations: £2,500 to the Victim 
Support Sunrise Appeal; £3,000 to 
the Scottish Outward Bound 
Association; £4,400 to Manchester 
Children’s Hospital and £30,000  
to the University of Greenwich.  
The Group made no donations  
for political purposes. 
Outward Bound Trust
The Outward Bound Trust is an 
educational charity which inspires 
young people from all walks of life to 
fulfil their potential through challenging 
outdoor experiences. THUS provides 
financial assistance for young people 
from disadvantaged backgrounds. 
During 2007 /08, we helped over 
150 children from schools across 
Scotland, Manchester and London.
During this year, our employees also 
took part in the Scottish Outward 
Bound Association (SOBA) challenge. 
SOBA is an educational charity 
offering professional team-building 
courses which also helps to further 
fund the Outward Bound Trust courses 
for disadvantaged young people 
while developing the team building 
and leadership skills of our employees.
Corporate Social 
Responsibility
At THUS, we are committed to 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
and we have policies in place to 
ensure that we operate in a safe, 
ethical and responsible manner which 
protects the environment as well as 
safeguarding the health and safety 
of our employees, customers and the 
communities in which we operate.
Our CSR steering group manages 
our activities and is drawn from 
several disciplines across the Group. 
The committee meets regularly and 
reports to the Management Board on 
progress.
We are a member of Scottish Business 
in the Community and benchmark 
ourselves against other companies.
Safety, health and 
environment 
The commitment and participation of 
all employees is vital to the efficient 
and effective implementation and 
control of our safety, health and 
environmental management systems. 
In order to meet our responsibility to 
protect the environment, employees 
and the business, THUS continues to 
focus on enhancing our existing safe 
working practices and the production 
of a robust risk management strategy 
that will eliminate operational hazards 
or minimise the risks incurred.
Environmental management 
To enhance our environmental 
management systems a set of 
standards has been produced.  
We continue to work on ways to 
reduce our impact on the environment, 
the main focus being on energy 
conservation and the use of renewable 
resources, the reuse and recycling 
of waste electrical equipment, a 
reduction in general waste going 
to landfill, and the effects on the 
environment from travel. This year 
we generated 60,008kg of waste 
electrical equipment, 98% of which 
was reused or recycled.
Achievements
In recognition of our commitment to the 
management of Safety and Health we 
have been awarded The Royal Society 
for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) 
Bronze Award. This achievement forms 
an integral part of a phased approach 
to gaining the Occupational Health 
and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 
18001:2007 accreditation. 
We have also committed to achieving 
the International Organisation for 
Standardisation (ISO) 14001:2004 
accreditation for our Environmental 
Management System. The 
implementation of the two standards 
will enable THUS to control its 
Occupational Health, Safety and 
Environmental risks and improve on  
our performance.
Community relations
Across the Group, we place a  
strong emphasis on our charitable and 
community activities. We are keen to 
play an active role in the communities 
in which we are based and we actively 
encourage employees to participate in 
community relations activities.

23 Corporate Governance:
Summary Corporate Governance Report
The Board has maintained the approach adopted in 
previous years, in establishing and monitoring the Group’s 
internal control procedures and policies. In following the 
requirements of the Combined Code, a review on an 
annual basis of the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control is carried out by the Board. This review includes 
material financial, operational and compliance controls 
and risk management. The Turnbull Report (Internal Control: 
Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code), 
published in October 2005, provides guidance to the 
Directors in respect of this requirement.
Overall responsibility for the system of internal control and 
for reviewing the effectiveness of the system rests with the 
Directors of THUS Group plc.
The system of internal control is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives. Internal control, therefore, can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating  
and managing the significant risks faced by the business.  
This process has been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements. The process is regularly reviewed by 
the Board, via the Audit Committee, and is guided by the 
content of the Turnbull Report. 
The Internal Audit function of the Group supports the 
Directors in assessing the operation of key internal  
controls through a structured review programme.  
The purpose, authority and responsibility of the Group’s 
Internal Audit function is contained within a formal Risk 
Management Charter.
Risk Assessments are completed on key processes and 
quarterly reviews have been carried out by the Risk 
Management Group. All aspects of business risk such as 
financial, operational, strategic, compliance and business 
continuity risk are covered by the Risk Assessments. 
Risk reviews are also undertaken regularly by the respective 
business areas throughout the year, to identify and assess 
the key business risks associated with the achievement 
of strategic objectives. The reviews are supported by 
governance software which enables and requires risk 
owners to regularly monitor and review risks within the 
Group. The reviews include consideration of the nature  
and extent of risks facing the Group, the likelihood of  
risks materialising and review of controls and action  
plans associated with the risks.
An assessment of residual risk and of significant risks 
across the business, resulting from the reviews of the risks 
of the Group, is presented to the Audit Committee on a 
quarterly basis. Control failings or weaknesses assessed 
as significant are included within these quarterly reviews 
by the Audit Committee, including discussion on actions 
taken by the business to address them. This ensures that 
necessary actions have been or are being taken to  
remedy any significant control failings or weaknesses.
During the course of the year, the risk management and 
internal control systems have continued to be developed 
across the Group. The risk management framework is 
designed to ensure that the key controls are, and have 
been, embedded into business processes. This has 
enabled the Directors to be satisfied that the Group was 
fully compliant with the revised Combined Code provisions, 
including those of the Turnbull Report, on internal control in 
the course of the financial year ended 31 March 2008.

THUS Group plc Summary Annual Report 2008 Corporate Governance:
Summary Directors’ Remuneration Report
Remuneration policy
During the year, the Committee has continued its decision 
making on the basis of a number of underlying principles 
which can be summarised as follows: 
Executive Directors and other senior executives should  >
be paid market competitive levels of remuneration and 
receive significant incentives for performance which 
significantly exceeds challenging and objective targets.
In setting base salary levels, the Committee has regard  >
to both individual performance and external market 
information prepared by its advisors from a number  
of comparable companies both within and outside the 
telecommunications sector. The aim is to set salaries 
which are generally around the mid-market level. 
Salaries will be above mid-market where both individual 
experience and performance, and market comparables, 
justify it.
The Committee remains strongly committed to ensuring  >
there is an appropriate balance between fixed and 
performance pay. It also seeks to ensure alignment 
with shareholders’ interests. A significant proportion of 
Executive Directors’ remuneration is performance-related 
through annual bonus and long-term incentives as set 
out below.
The Committee’s primary goal is to ensure that executive  >
remuneration continues to be sufficiently attractive to 
retain Executive Directors in a highly competitive market 
and to motivate them to deliver results and to enhance 
shareholder value.
The arrangements described below are likely to continue 
to apply in future years unless there are specific reasons for 
change. The Committee will continue to regularly review 
arrangements to ensure that they remain effective and 
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and prospects, 
and to monitor the level of potential awards.
The remuneration package
Basic salary
Following an increase of 3.6%, the base salary levels for 
Executive Directors in 2007 /08 were as follows: William 
Allan, £435,120; John Maguire, £310,800; Philip Male, 
£310,800. The Committee have considered salaries in 
relation to market data, performance and pay settlements 
elsewhere in the business, and have agreed an increase  
of 3.9% to base salaries with effect from 1 April 2008.
Annual bonus 
Executive Directors and senior executives participate in  
the Company’s annual Corporate Bonus Plan.
The Committee remains committed to ensuring that bonus 
targets are challenging and only reward demonstrably 
superior performance.
The annual bonus plan for Executive Directors is based  
on a mix of financial and non-financial performance 
conditions on an 80:20 ratio and provides a maximum  
total payment of up to 100% of salary. Following a review 
of remuneration for the Executive Directors, the Committee 
has agreed to raise the maximum bonus potential for the 
Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer from 
85% to 100% of salary with effect from 1 April 2008, 
further strengthening the performance related element  
of their remuneration package.
The achievement of pre-determined targets determines  
the levels of payout under the plan. For the year ended  
31 March 2008, there were three distinct financial 
measures which were weighted as follows:
25% was determined by reference to cash flow after  >
interest and capital expenditure.
50% was determined by reference to EBITDA   >
(earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation) performance.
25% was determined by reference to revenue. >
Based on the Company’s performance for 2007 /08 the 
plan made a payment of 48.05% of maximum entitlement.
In respect of 80% of the bonus potential the same financial 
measures will be used for 2008/09 weighted as follows:
30% determined by reference to cash flow after interest  >
and capital expenditure.
50% determined by reference to EBITDA. >
20% determined by reference to revenue. >
Long-term incentives
Performance shares
The Company operates the THUS Group Performance 
Share Plan under which an award of shares can be granted 
at the discretion of the Committee to Executive Directors and 
selected senior executives. Grants made during a year will 
only become exercisable after three years if demanding 
performance targets set by the Committee are met. 
THUS Group plc Summary Annual Report 2008
<
25 The two performance criteria which apply to the vesting  
of performance share awards are Group EBITDA in respect 
of 50% of an award and Group EBIT return on capital 
employed with respect to the remaining 50%. Performance 
is measured against targets set with reference to internal 
forecasts and the extent to which they are satisfied is 
confirmed by the Committee. 
Calculations are made internally on the same basis as 
reported in the annual Financial Statements and are verified 
by the auditors.
The two performance criteria are recognised both internally 
and by analysts as key measures of the success of the fixed 
line telecommunications business model and the drivers 
of shareholder value and, as such, are recognised by the 
participants and, we believe (following the support of 
shareholders in 2006) by shareholders, as being directly 
linked to the success of the business. 
It is currently anticipated that awards to Executive Directors 
in 2008/09 will be made over shares worth 100% of salary. 
The performance conditions will require annual compound 
growth in EBITDA of between 12% to 25% over three 
years and EBIT return on capital for the final year in the 
performance period to be between 5% and 10%. 30% 
of the respective part of the award will vest for threshold 
performance. These performance ranges are considered to 
be appropriately stretching taking into account the outlook 
for the business. For the EBITDA condition, it is recognised 
that the numbers are lower than for prior years’ ranges. 
However, as they are referenced off higher base figures, 
they represent a clear progression on the ranges set in 
previous years. Furthermore they remain relatively high by 
market standards. Conversely, the EBIT return on capital 
range is higher than prior years’ awards. Overall, the 
ranges are considered to be equally challenging to those 
set in prior years.
Matching shares
Under the Co-Investment Plan, Executive Directors are 
allowed to invest up to a maximum of 25% of their base 
salary in Company shares. The offer is typically made  
to them each year shortly after bonuses are declared.  
This means that Executive Directors can use their net bonus 
to acquire shares at market price (although there is no direct 
link to the bonus paid). Provided that the Executive Director 
continues to hold these shares for three years, the Company 
makes an award of matching shares. The minimum level of 
match is one share for every two the individual acquires. 
The level of match can increase up to a maximum of 
four shares for every two shares the individual acquires, 
dependent on performance against the same performance 
targets that apply for awards under the Performance Share 
Plan. Participation in the plan has been extended  
to selected senior executives below Board level.
The rules of the various long-term incentive plans provide 
that the aggregate of all share-based awards does not 
exceed the guidelines laid down by the Association of 
British Insurers that recommend (i) that the number of awards 
granted over new issue shares in respect of all share-based 
schemes should not exceed 10% of the current issued 
share capital in any rolling ten-year period; and (ii) that 
the number of awards granted over new issue shares in 
respect of discretionary schemes should not exceed 5% of 
the current issued share capital in the same period. As at 
31 March, the percentage of share capital used in relation 
to these two limits was nil. All awards granted to date have 
utilised shares held within the Employee Share Trust.
Pension and other benefits
Pension benefits are provided under the THUS Group plc 
Pension Scheme. This scheme is a contributory defined-
benefit scheme that provides 1/60th of final pensionable 
salary from age 60 for each year of pensionable service 
up to 31 March 2007 and 1/75th of final pensionable 
salary from age 65 for each year of pensionable service 
after 31 March 2007 . Final pensionable salary is defined 
as the highest pensionable salary averaged over any  
12-month period in the last five years of membership, or  
the highest three-year average in the last 10 years if higher. 
Pensionable salary is defined as basic salary only.
In line with market practice a cash supplement is provided 
for Executive Directors who continue to participate in THUS’ 
pension arrangements to provide a market competitive level 
of pension benefit overall.
Executive Directors are eligible for a range of benefits.  
These include the provision of a company car or car 
allowance, fuel, private medical, life, permanent health  
and critical illness insurances.
Service contracts
Reflecting current market practice, the Executive Directors 
have service contracts that are terminable on one year’s 
notice by either the individual or the Company. It is not 
the Committee’s intention to appoint any new Executive 
Directors with contracts that provide for a longer  
notice period.
The Committee endorses the principle of mitigation of loss 
on early termination of a service contract and generally 
seeks to achieve that objective, where possible and 
appropriate. 
In the event that THUS wished to terminate an Executive 
Director’s contract other than in circumstances where the 
Company is entitled to summarily dismiss an Executive 
Director, it would need to either give twelve months’ notice 
or make a payment in lieu of twelve months’ worth of salary 
and benefits (including pension).

Summary Directors’ Remuneration Report – continued
>
26
THUS Group plc Summary Annual Report 2008 There are no special provisions which apply in the event  
of a change of control.
Chairman and Non-executive Directors
The appointment of the Chairman and Non-executive 
Directors is subject to the Articles of Association of the 
Company, in particular the usual provisions relating to  
re-election by shareholders. The Chairman and Non-
executive Directors have letters of appointment which  
are available at www.thus.net. They were all appointed  
for an initial term of three years terminable at the request  
of the Board which may be renewed for a further period 
subject to approval by the Board. 
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee. The fees of the Non-executive 
Directors are determined by the Board. Summary details 
of the remuneration of the Directors are contained in the 
Directors’ emoluments table below. With effect from  
1 April 2008, the Chairman’s fees were increased to 
£100,000 per annum and the fees of the Non-executive 
Directors were increased to £35,000 per annum, with 
an additional fee of £5,500 per annum payable to 
the Chairman of the Audit Committee, an additional 
fee of £2,750 per annum payable to the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee and an additional fee of 
£2,750 per annum payable to the Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director. The Chairman and Non-executive 
Directors are not entitled to compensation on early 
termination of their term of office. No individuals are 
involved in the determination of their own remuneration.
Performance graph
Legislation introduced by the government requires this 
Report to contain a graph showing the performance of the 
Company compared with a ‘broad equity market index’ 
over a five-year period. The Committee has chosen the 
FTSE All-Share Telecommunications Index, of which THUS  
is a constituent. This Index was chosen because it shows  
the performance of the Company relative to its industry peer 
group and is therefore particularly relevant to shareholders.

The Summary Financial Statement on pages 29 to 32 is only a summary of information in the Company’s Annual Report 
and Financial Statements. It does not contain sufficient information to allow for as full an understanding of the results of  
the Group and state of affairs of the Parent Company or of the Group, and of their policies and arrangements concerning 
Directors’ remuneration, as would be provided by the full Annual Report and Financial Statements. Members requiring  
more detailed information have the right to obtain, free of charge, a copy of the Company’s full Annual Report and 
Financial Statements.
The statutory Financial Statements have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and the Auditors have reported 
on them; their report was unqualified and did not contain statements under Sections 235 (3), 237 (2) or 237 (3) of the 
Companies Act 1985.
For further information, the full Financial Statements and the Independent Auditors’ Report on those Financial Statements 
should be consulted. Copies of the full Annual Report and Financial Statements may be obtained, free of charge, on request 
from the Company Secretary at the Company’s registered office. Members may elect to receive the full Annual Report and 
Financial Statements in place of the Summary Annual Report for future years by writing to the Company Secretary.

31 1 Basis of preparation
The financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the EU. 
The financial information is prepared on the historical cost basis. The financial information is presented in pounds Sterling 
rounded to the nearest thousand.
The preparation of the financial information in conformity with IFRSs as adopted by the EU requires the Directors to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other 
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the 
judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision only affects that period, or in the period of revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both the current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRSs that have a significant effect on the Financial Statements and 
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are disclosed in Note 36 in the full Annual Report 
and Financial Statements.

EBITDA is a key measure used by the Group’s management to assess the performance of the Group. As this is a  
non-GAAP measure, and is not defined within International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU,  
this reconciliation has been provided.
The figures quoted above are for continuing operations only.

the highest-paid Director was £Nil (2007: £31,821 – after deducting tax and NI borne by the Director).

33 Ancillary Information:
Notice of Annual General Meeting – continued
(i)  Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001, members will be entitled to attend and vote 
at the meeting if they are registered on the Company’s register 
of members by 6.00 pm on 29 July 2008 or by 6.00 pm 
two days prior to the date of any adjournment of the meeting. 
Changes to entries on the Register of Members after that time 
shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person  
to attend and vote at the meeting. 
(ii)  Any member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled 
to appoint a proxy or proxies to attend. A proxy need not be a 
member of the Company. A separate Form of Proxy is enclosed. 
Completing and returning a Form of Proxy will not prevent any 
member from attending the meeting in person and voting should 
that member so wish. If you are not a member of the Company 
but you have been nominated by a member of the Company to 
enjoy information rights, you do not have a right to appoint any 
proxies under the procedures set out in this paragraph. Please 
read paragraph (vii) below.
(iii)  Members may register their proxy appointments or voting 
directions electronically via the www.shareview.co.uk website, 
where full details of the procedure are given. Members will 
need the reference number, card ID and account number set 
out on the enclosed Form of Proxy. If more than one proxy 
appointment is returned relating to any share, either by paper 
or by electronic communication, the proxy received last by the 
Registrar before the latest time for receipt of proxies will take 
precedence. The Company will not accept any communication 
that is found to contain a computer virus.
(iv)  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through 
the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by 
using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST 
personal members or other CREST sponsored members and 
those CREST members who have appointed a voting service 
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service 
provider(s) who will be able to take the appropriate action on 
their behalf.
  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using  
the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message 
(a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated  
in accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’s (‘EUI’s’) 
specifications and must contain the information required for 
such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The 
message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment 
of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a 
previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be 
transmitted so as to be received by Equiniti (ID 7RA01) by 
no later than 1 1.00 am on 29 July 2008. No such message 
received through the CREST network after this time will be 
accepted. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken 
to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to 
the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which our 
registrars are able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST 
in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change 
of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be 
communicated to the appointee through other means.
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors 
or voting service provider(s) should note that EUI does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular 
messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore 
apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. 
It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to 
take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member 
or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service 
provider(s) to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service 
provider take) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that 
a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any 
particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where 
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers 
are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST 
Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST System 
and timings.
  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction 
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
(v)  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the 
meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so 
that (a) if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman 
of the meeting as its corporate representative with instructions 
to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of 
the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at 
the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives 
will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman 
will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in 
accordance with those directions; and (b) if more than one 
corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder 
attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not 
appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate 
representative, a designated corporate representative will be 
nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, 
who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives 
will give voting directions to that designated corporate 
representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to the 
guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and 
Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives – 
www.icsa.org.uk – for further details of this procedure. The 
guidance includes a sample form of representation letter if  
the Chairman is being appointed as described in (a) above.
(vi)  As at 5.00 pm on 4 June 2008, the Company’s issued share 
capital comprised 183,032,367 ordinary shares of 25p each. 
Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general 
meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number of 
voting rights in the Company as at 5.00 pm on 4 June 2008  
is 183,032,367 .
(vii)  If you are a person who has been nominated under Section 
146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights 
(Nominated Person):
you may have a right under an agreement between you  >
and the member of the Company who has nominated 
you to have information rights (Relevant Member) to be 
appointed or to have someone else appointed as a  
proxy for the meeting;
if you either do not have such a right or if you have such  >
a right but do not wish to exercise it, you may have a 
right under an agreement between you and the Relevant 
Member to give instructions to the Relevant Member as  
to the exercise of voting rights;
your main point of contact in terms of your investment in  >
the Company remains the Relevant Member (or, perhaps, 
your custodian or broker) and you should continue to 
contact them (and not the Company) regarding any 
changes or queries relating to your personal details and 
your interest in the Company (including any administrative 
matters). The only exception to this is where the Company 
expressly requests a response from you.

THUS Group plc Summary Annual Report 2008 Notes
Resolution 1
The Directors are required by law to present to the meeting the 
Financial Statements and the Report of the Directors and Auditors  
for the year ended 31 March 2008.
Resolution 2
The shareholders are being asked to vote on the Remuneration Report 
relating to the Directors and senior executives. The vote is advisory 
and the Directors’ entitlement to remuneration is not conditional on the 
resolution being passed. 
Resolutions 3–5
The Articles of Association require that Directors stand for election  
by the shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting following 
their appointment and also that one-third of the Directors retire at 
every Annual General Meeting. The Board, following its evaluation 
of the performance of those Directors standing for election and 
re-election, confirms that each of those Directors performs effectively 
and demonstrates commitment to the role. The biographical details  
of each of the Directors who are offering themselves for election  
or re-election are shown on pages 22 and 23. The election and  
re-election of those Directors shall, subject to the passing of the 
relevant resolutions, take effect immediately upon the conclusion  
of the meeting.
Resolution 6
The reappointment of the Auditors is proposed. Following assessment 
of the audit service by the Audit Committee, the Board considers the 
Auditors to be effective and independent in their role.
Resolution 7
Under the Companies Act 1985 (Section 80) the Directors of a 
company may only allot unissued shares if authorised to do so. 
Passing this Resolution will continue the Directors’ flexibility to act in 
the best interests of shareholders when opportunities arise by issuing 
new shares. 
In Resolution 7 , the Company is seeking authority to allot shares 
with a nominal value of up to £3,61 1,623.75, which represents 
approximately 14,446,495 ordinary shares of 25 pence each or 
approximately 8% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. 
The Directors intend to use this authority, which will lapse at the 
conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company  
(to be held in 2009), or, if earlier, 30 September 2009, for general 
corporate purposes. 
Resolution 8
If shares are to be offered for cash, the Companies Act 1985 
requires that those shares are offered first to the existing shareholders 
in proportion to the number of shares they hold at the time of the 
offer. However, it may sometimes be in the interests of the Company 
for the Directors to allot shares other than to shareholders in 
proportion to their existing holdings. At last year’s Annual General 
Meeting shareholders authorised the Board, subject to specified 
limits:
to allot shares in connection with a rights issue, defined in  >
summary as, an offer of equity securities to shareholders which  
is open for a period decided by the Board subject to any limits or 
restrictions which the Board thinks are necessary or appropriate.
to allot shares not in connection with a rights issue up to a specific  >
amount so that the pre-emption requirement does not apply to the 
allotments of shares for cash up to that amount.
This authority requires to be renewed annually. The Directors will 
be empowered by Resolution 8 to allot equity securities (within the 
meaning of Section 94 of the Companies Act 1985) for cash without 
complying with the statutory pre-emption rights of shareholders under 
Section 89 of the Companies Act 1985, up to a maximum nominal 
amount of approximately £2,287 ,904.50. This disapplication is 
limited to allotments made to ordinary shareholders and holders of 
any other class of equity security in proportion (as nearly as may 
be) to their holdings and, otherwise, to allotments up to a maximum 
of 9,151,618 ordinary shares (representing approximately 5% of the 
Company’s issued ordinary share capital). 
This means that the interests of existing shareholders are protected. 
If a share issue is not a rights issue the proportionate interest of 
existing shareholders could not without their agreement be reduced 
by more than 5% of the value of the new shares in cash issued to 
new shareholders by reference to the issued share capital at the date 
of this notice. There are no current plans to allot shares except in 
connection with the employee share schemes.
Resolution 9
This resolution which is being proposed as a special resolution 
will give the Directors authority to make market purchases of the 
Company's ordinary shares up to a maximum aggregate number 
of 27 ,436,551 ordinary shares (representing 14.99% of the share 
capital of the Company in issue at 4 June 2008). This resolution 
authorises the Company to pay a maximum price per share of 
an amount equal to the higher of (i) 105% of the average closing 
middle market price for an ordinary share for the five dealing days 
preceding any such purchase and (ii) the price stipulated by Article 
5(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2273/2003 (the Buy-back 
and Stabilisation Regulation), being the higher of the last independent 
trade for an ordinary share or the highest current independent bid 
for an ordinary share as derived from the trading venue where the 
purchase is carried out. 
Any shares repurchased by the Company under the authority would 
be cancelled. There is currently no intention to hold such shares 
in treasury. The Company did not hold any ordinary shares in the 
capital of the Company in treasury at 4 June 2008 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice) except for 
1,618,548 market-purchased ordinary shares held in the Employee 
Share Trust in connection with employee share schemes.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising on behalf of the 
Company the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares. 
The Directors would only cause the Company to purchase shares if, 
in their opinion, the expected effect would be to result in an increase 
in earnings per share and would benefit shareholders generally.  
The Directors are making no recommendation as to whether 
shareholders should sell their shares in the Company. 
At 4 June 2008, being the last practicable date prior to the 
publication of this Notice, there were options outstanding over 
4,879,538 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company which 
represent approximately 2.66% of the share capital of the Company 
in issue at that date. If the authority to purchase the Company’s 
ordinary shares was exercised in full, the shares issued pursuant 
to these options would represent approximately 3.13% of the 
Company’s issued share capital.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors  
in respect of all items of business
The Board is of the opinion that all of the proposed resolutions are  
in the best interests of shareholders as a whole and of the Company. 
Accordingly, the Board recommends that you vote in favour of each 
resolution, as the Directors intend to do in respect of their own beneficial 
shareholdings held at the time of the Annual General Meeting.

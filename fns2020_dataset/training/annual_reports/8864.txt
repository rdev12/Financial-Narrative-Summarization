Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to
report a year of
further progress 
for the Group.
Particularly strong
performances by
our newer Facilities
Management and
Corporatewear
businesses have
helped us to
achieve our financial objectives
despite the impact on Drycleaning 
of the weak retail market. We have
also managed to stabilise and grow
our Apparelmaster garment rental
business after several years of
industry-wide decline and we continue
to see excellent growth from our
Stalbridge linen rental business.

Group results
Our results for the year were in line with our
expectations. Total turnover grew by 19% to £432 million
(2004: £364 million), while turnover, excluding costs
recharged to customers in our Facilities Management
division, increased by 31% to £364 million (2004: £278
million). Excluding acquisitions and costs recharged to
customers, underlying revenue rose by 4%.
The Group interest charge rose to £8.4 million (2004:
£5.5 million), reflecting the £86 million expenditure on
acquisitions, net of disposals, over the last two years.
As a result of our acquisitions, amortisation of intangible
assets increased substantially. We also incurred net
exceptional costs of £0.6 million (2004: £2.0 million);
these comprised restructuring costs of £4.0 million; a
£1.0 million provision for environmental and asbestos
remediation work and exceptional income of £4.4 million
relating to the gain on the sale of ten retail properties
and a textile rental facility. The restructuring expenditure
arose as we integrated our acquired businesses and
rationalised back office functions. This restructuring has
already led to a saving of some £500,000 in 2005 and is
expected to yield annual savings of £1.3 million from
2006. In addition, we rationalised the number of
premises that Johnson Hospitality Services trades 
from and incurred additional costs as we integrated 
the business under the management of Stalbridge 
Linen Services.
Under UK GAAP, reported profit before taxation rose by
2% to £15.7 million.
The Group has prepared its consolidated financial
statements to 31st December 2005 under UK GAAP,
supplemented with summary IFRS financial information,
rather than under IFRS as previously indicated. This is to
comply with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended
November 2004) and is a result of the 2005 accounting
year commencing on 26th December 2004, i.e. prior to
the IFRS adoption date of 1st January 2005. 
The only significant difference in the Group profit and
loss account is the treatment of amortisation of goodwill
and intangibles. Therefore, the adjusted profit (before
amortisation, restructuring and environmental costs and
exceptional items) under IFRS is nearly identical to that
reported under UK GAAP. Summary IFRS information has
been included in note 37 of the Financial Statements. 
To aid comparability with our peers who will be reporting
under IFRS, the following numbers used in this
commentary are IFRS based unless otherwise stated.
Adjusted profit before taxation rose by 15% to £28.1 million
(2004: £24.4 million) and adjusted fully diluted earnings
per share by 9% to 33.8 pence (2004: 30.9 pence).
Finances
In July we established a new £200 million five year
Revolving Credit Facility with a syndicate of seven banks.
This was agreed on more favourable terms than our
previous facility, which began to amortise at the end of
June 2005.
The Group’s net debt at the year end was £137 million
(2004: £74 million). This £63 million increase reflected
our net cash spend on acquisitions of £56.2 million,
continuing capital expenditure and a £3.4 million rise in
our working capital. Capital expenditure is expected to
continue at a substantial level through 2006, as
previously advised, but then decrease substantially as
our major IT and building programmes are completed.
The interest charge was covered over four times by
adjusted operating profit. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending an increased final dividend
of 15.0 pence per share (2004: 14.3 pence). Together with
the interim dividend of 4.4 pence paid in October , this
makes a total for the year of 19.4 pence (2004: 18.5 pence),
a rise of 5%. It is the Board’s intention to continue to
pursue a progressive dividend policy while maintaining a
prudent level of cover.

Operations
All the business-to-business divisions of the Group
performed well during the year, with Corporatewear 
and Facilities Management making particularly strong
progress. In the Rental division, Johnsons Apparelmaster’s
revenues stabilised after several years of decline;
Stalbridge maintained its excellent growth record and
Johnson Hospitality Services has begun to benefit from
its integration into this successful business. In a poor
trading climate for high street retailers in general, the
Drycleaning division experienced reductions in both 
like-for-like sales and profits. The Chief Executive and 
our divisional Managing Directors provide a fuller
commentary on these and other developments in their
Review on pages 8 to 19 of this report.
Acquisitions 
During the year we made eight acquisitions for a total
value of £62.2 million, including deferred consideration.
The acquisitions continued our strategy of refocusing the
Group towards markets which offer higher growth
business-to-business services, with strong recurring
revenue streams, hence reducing our exposure to our
traditional and more cyclical markets in garment rental
and drycleaning.  
All the acquisitions are meeting or exceeding our initial
expectations.

Outlook
The Group remains focused on further developing its
business-to-business operations which have high levels of
recurring revenues and real growth potential.
Our textile offering is comprehensive and unique, while
our expanded Facilities Management activities now cover
both the commercial and retail sectors. The strong
business model we have developed allows us to exploit
the cross-selling opportunities that exist within and
between our core activities and to deliver sustained
growth to the top and bottom line.
With our Corporatewear and Facilities Management
businesses performing well in growing markets and with
improving conditions in the workwear rental sector we
are confident in the future of the Group. 
Trading conditions for our retail Drycleaning business
remain unpredictable.
Subject to the comments above, we remain well placed to
deliver another satisfactory outcome for the year as a
whole.

Over the last three
years we have
transformed this
long-established
laundry and
drycleaning
company into a
modern and
balanced support
services Group.
The business is
now well equipped to meet the
challenges and opportunities of 
the twenty-first century. We have a
clear mission and vision for the
future, a tight focus on our two core
activities, significantly increased
exposure to growth markets and a
dynamic and supportive corporate
culture. We identified clear strategic
priorities and have delivered all our
objectives to date, while consistently
growing turnover . Most importantly,
we have built up strong management
in depth. This team has significant
capability and capacity to deliver
profitable growth into the future, 
as we exploit the undoubted 
potential of our core skills in both
Britain and Europe.

09
In 2005 we continued to build successfully on the
foundations laid over the previous two years through 
our programme of acquisitions and divestment, the
strengthening of our management and the process of 
top-to-bottom cultural change. The Group is firmly
committed to focusing on two fundamental components
with real growth potential: textile-related services and
facilities management. We have again grown in both these
sectors through a combination of organic development
and acquisition. 
Acquisitions 
The two principal acquisitions made during the year were
in the Corporatewear and Facilities Management
divisions. At the start of the financial year we acquired
the DCC corporatewear business, focusing primarily on
customers in the financial services and leisure sectors,
for a maximum consideration of £23.0 million.  
In October 2005 we bought SGP Property Services,
providing white-collar facilities management to the
financial services, leisure and retail sectors, for a
maximum consideration of £24.8 million.  
Both businesses extended our service offerings and
ideally complemented our established strengths in
corporatewear for retailers and facilities management 
for the commercial office market. Our enlarged business
dedicated to clothing people at work has an annualised
throughput of well over 10 million garments while our
Facilities Management division now provides a greatly
expanded range of services to an even larger number 
of both customers and locations nationally.
Other, smaller acquisitions made during the year were
further bolt-ons to our Corporatewear and Facilities
Management divisions and trade and asset purchases
designed to strengthen Apparelmaster and Stalbridge
while reducing industry overcapacity in their market place.
Investment
During the year we spent £23.2 million on fixed assets 
to enhance efficiency, introduce new technologies and
enlarge our capacity in markets with long-term growth
potential. Our largest single project is the £11 million 
roll-out of an Enterprise Resource Planning system,
which is expected to be largely completed by the end 
of 2006 on budget. This will give us a real competitive
advantage by allowing us to increase efficiency, reduce
costs and ensure operational best practice across the
Group. We have acquired an additional laundry to enable
Stalbridge Linen Services to continue its exemplary
organic growth, and will this year begin construction of 
a new facility for the brand in the East Midlands.
We also saw a marked increase in our rental stock
expenditure, which rose to £24.8 million (2004: 
£19.4 million). This increase was due to the high organic
growth levels experienced at our linen rental business,
Stalbridge, together with the return to growth of our
workwear rental operation, Apparelmaster. Another sign
of the improvement in Apparelmaster’s performance was
that receipts from customers who terminated their
contracts fell to £3.5 million (2004: £5.1 million) as
retention rates improved.
Strategic Overview
JSG028_AR_2005 IFC-09  30/3/06  09:27  Page 09 Johnson Service Group PLC Chief Executive’s Review
10
The Rental division saw an increase in revenues of 13%
(7% excluding acquisitions), consisting of a welcome
stabilisation in Johnsons Apparelmaster revenues and
continued strong growth from Stalbridge Linen Services.
However, adjusted operating profit fell 7% as Johnson
Hospitality Services underperformed during the second
half of the year with sales down 7%.
Johnsons Apparelmaster 
Apparelmaster, the UK leader in the laundering and
rental of workwear, has seen several years of sales
decline. Following significant management effort we
have achieved an improved business performance in
2005, with organic revenues increasing by 2%. Total
revenues rose 4% following the acquisition of customer
contracts from four small competitors who were exiting
the market. This is the first time in several years that we
have achieved a stabilising in revenues, as we
contracted in tandem with a market that has suffered
from the rapid decline in UK manufacturing. 
Strategically we have focused on developing our
turnover with smaller and medium-sized customers in
response to particularly intense price competition for
large national accounts. This approach, together with
continued investment into our sales force and marketing
plans, has resulted in new business sales and our
customer retention rates both improving. We have also
sustained the rate of investment made over the last two
years in the people and infrastructure within the
business. This has enabled us to provide a high quality
and efficient service to our customers, while maintaining
a low cost base. This action, together with the
acquisitions, has enabled us to improve the total
operating profit margin from 13.3% to 13.9%.

It is expected that the operating profit margin will be
under pressure during 2006 as the cost increases we
are experiencing are unlikely to be totally matched by
price rises.
In January 2006 Rentokil Initial announced the closure
of its UK linen and workwear operations. We are actively
marketing to the customers that it is intending to stop
servicing with some success. In addition, the processing
capacity that will be closing may help the industry
achieve greater price stability.
Stalbridge Linen Services and 
Johnson Hospitality Services (JHS)
Stalbridge again achieved excellent organic revenue
growth of 28% in the premium hotel, catering and
corporate hospitality sector, where it is the market
leader. These remarkable results have been achieved
against at best a broadly inert marketplace, which
makes the performance even more impressive. Total
revenues increased by 46% following the strategic
acquisitions of businesses in Winchester and Essex,
which increase our geographic coverage. The operating
margin decreased from 15.5% to 12.8% as expected,
following the acquisitions and the increased investment
in operational and management infrastructure required
to support future growth. Further expansion is planned
in 2006, when we will begin construction of a new state-
of-the-art laundry facility in the East Midlands. Business
has grown in all parts of the country, supported by
innovative marketing that is recognised as the best in
the industry, and by successful new product launches.
Very high levels of customer retention again
complemented an exceptional new business sales
performance. Indeed, the company prides itself in its 
‘no contract’ offering, based on our confidence that
customers will receive service levels far in excess of
those offered elsewhere. 
JHS is the market leader in the provision of furniture
and catering equipment to the contract catering market.
Following a disappointing trading performance during
the second half of the year JHS was merged under the
Stalbridge management team, though they remain as
separate customer-facing brands. This integration was
designed to enhance service, maximise cross-selling
opportunities and realise operational and distribution
efficiencies and cost savings. The new management
Stalbridge Linen Services provides table linen
for Nunsmere Hall Hotel near Chester
team is also working to develop a flexible cost base that
more appropriately reflects the seasonal pattern of
demand. We also embarked on a rationalisation of the
JHS branch network, with three locations closing in
2005 and a further closure planned in the current year,
when we will also be relocating the head office to new
premises in Buckingham. We have expanded and
radically altered the JHS sales function to focus on the
business-to-business market, and to ensure that we
leverage the strong cross-selling opportunities with
Stalbridge. We remain convinced that the combined JHS
and Stalbridge offering is a robust business model and
we have already seen an improvement in the
performance of JHS in 2006.

Clothing for people at work
The Corporatewear Division saw revenue growth of 132%
and adjusted operating profit growth of 178% over the
year, largely due to our acquisition activity during 2004
and the start of 2005. Excluding the acquisitions we still
saw good organic revenue growth of 10%. The five
acquired businesses complemented our existing
company, CCM, and achieved our aim of creating the UK’s
clear market leader in the supply of high quality
corporate clothing. 
The market for corporatewear is continuing to grow
strongly and has significant further potential. Over half
the workers in the US wear corporate uniforms. In the UK
penetration is under 40%, and on the Continent it is
below 20%. As the market leader in Britain and one of
the largest suppliers in Europe, we are well placed to
benefit from the development potential this affords.
Our strategy is to capitalise on the individual strengths of
the various businesses we have acquired, which all have
strong brands and close customer relationships built on
specialist knowledge of distinct market sectors. This
enables us to provide our customers with the focus that
they demand. At the same time, we have been able to
leverage our Group scale in worldwide sourcing to reduce
product costs and improve quality, while enhancing
efficiency and service levels through the integration of
back office functions. These efficiencies have seen the
operating margin of the division increase from 11% to
13%. Management has been unified under a
Corporatewear board to ensure that we exploit potential
synergies and cross-selling opportunities to the full.
All our brands achieved good organic growth during the
year . Dimensions, which is primarily focused on large, blue
chip retail customers, has continued to develop its enviable
client list, which includes Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose,
Marriott hotels, Marks & Spencer and Boots. 
DCC mainly serves the financial services sector , where its
clients include HSBC, Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of
Scotland. Our workwear brand CCM continued to exceed
our expectations, achieving organic revenue growth of 7%.

Wessex provides clothing for 
Surrey Ambulance Service NHS Trust
We have also developed a public services offering with
Yaffy, focusing on high quality police outerwear, and
Wessex, providing clothing for ambulance staff. 
These were complemented by the £4.0 million acquisition
in April 2005 of Boyd Cooper, a supplier of nurses’
uniforms. All these businesses have performed well and
are benefiting from being part of a larger organisation.
Across the business we are experiencing good growth that
reflects the strength of our customer relationships and the
high quality of our newer and more comprehensive
catalogue offering. Our skills in design and logistics
enable us to provide even the largest corporations with
comprehensive management of their clothing brand
images. In addition, the substantially increased
throughput coupled with our procurement experience 
is resulting in savings of £3 million per annum in the
sourcing of new garments. Many of these savings will be
passed onto customers, but together with our other skills
they have contributed to a number of notable business
gains during the year, such as Group4Securicor, Post
Office Counters, Mothercare and Alliance Pharmacy.
2006 has already started strongly with two major pan-
European contracts being secured as well as Virgin
Atlantic Airways being won as a new customer.

Our market-leading retail drycleaning business, which
operates under the Johnsons, Sketchley and Jeeves
brands, was affected by the general reduction in
consumer spending on the high street throughout 2005.
Although overall revenue of the division that includes
Alex Reid, rose 4% to £101 million, we saw like for like
shop sales fall by 2.7% during the year. We took a range
of actions to reduce costs, which resulted in the
operating margin of the retail business improving from
3.8% in the first half of the year to 7.7% in the second
half, without compromising quality.
During the year Johnsons Cleaners opened 13 new
concessions within Sainsbury’s stores, and four new
drive-in sites at Sutton Coldfield, Plymouth, Winchester
and St Austell. We also acquired four independent shops
and closed 31 underperforming branches, giving us a
total of 587 units at the year end. A further 60 branches
were converted to the environmentally friendly
GreenEarth® cleaning process during the year, extending
the technology to 230 locations.
Our Priority Club is continuing to expand, and at the 
year end reached a total of 520,000 active members. 
In the final months of the year we began a co-ordinated
marketing drive designed to increase customer numbers
and the frequency of their visits.
Following a full staff survey and independent consumer
research, comprehensive change plans have been
developed to raise the profile of our shops and further
improve the effectiveness of our marketing. We have also
begun trialling a range of innovative services designed to
enhance our convenience to customers, including

In line with this strategic priority, the focus of our future
branch opening plans will be on the acquisition of highly
accessible and convenient drive-in sites.
The trading performance of Jeeves of Belgravia, 
our luxury brand, steadily improved during the year, 
as we began to see the results of increasing customer
recognition of our investment in both technology and
people. We are confident that further improvements will
be achieved in the current year, when we plan to launch
an exciting new brand design.
Alex Reid, our business which is the leading supplier of
consumables to the drycleaning industry, performed well
in holding revenue and profits steady despite the tough
market conditions experienced during the year. In August
2005 we strengthened the business by acquiring
Firbimatic UK, a market leader in the supply and servicing
of drycleaning machinery and ancillary equipment.
Excellent progress has been made in developing cross-
selling opportunities and capitalising on the synergies
available. 
As the European Master Licence holder, Alex Reid has
actively promoted the operational and marketing
advantages of the environmentally preferable
GreenEarth® cleaning system process to drycleaners
across the EU. Although poor market conditions have
limited investment by potential customers, sales were
encouraging in the latter part of the year.
In addition to the trading activities outlined above, the
Drycleaning segmental results include £1.8 million 
(2004: £1.4 million) of profit from the disposal of
freehold properties and other non-trading income. 
A similar income is expected during 2006. 
The Drycleaning business benefits from a property
portfolio that extends to around 90 freehold sites. 
If these sites were leasehold and charged at a market
rent to the division, the operating profit of the retail
business would be approximately £1.6 million 
(2004: £1.7 million) lower.

Organic revenue growth of 5% was supported by the
acquisitions of Acame in January and SGP Property
Services (SGP) in October 2005. These helped our
Facilities Management division grow total revenues
(excluding costs recharged to customers) by 57% and
adjusted operating profit by 144%, with the margin
moving from 6.1% to 9.4%.
SGP specialises in the provision of property management
services to the financial, leisure and retail sectors, ideally
complementing Johnson Workplace Management (JWM),
our existing facilities management business, which is
focused primarily in the commercial office market. Both
share the ‘white collar’ model of facilities management,
subcontracting lower-value commodity services. The
acquisition gives us significantly enhanced scale in this
market, enabling us to offer a more complete service to
potential customers. 
SGP has met all our expectations since acquisition, and has
enjoyed outstanding year-on-year growth. Strong sales
progress was achieved both organically with established
clients, and through a number of business gains with
leading national retailers and financial service companies. 
SGP provides a full range of property management
services structured into three key profit centres:
Technical, Property and Maintenance. Technical
comprises building services, project management, health
and safety, surveying and construction services and
procurement. In Property, we provide asset and
investment management, landlord and tenant services,
portfolio and property management, retail agency
services and advice on rating and service charges.

Our Maintenance centre operates a state-of-the-art
24/7 /365 helpdesk which handles roughly 750,000 
calls each year, and is recognised as the market leader 
in this sector.
There is already an encouraging new business pipeline
with both existing and potential new clients. This is aided
by the current retail downturn, which is a positive
environment for selling the outsourced services that we
offer. Although we will exploit the synergies available in
procurement we intend to maintain the distinctive
strengths of our two customer-facing brands.
JWM has achieved good organic growth of 5%, with a
number of new three-year contracts being recently awarded
by existing clients in the pharmaceuticals, electronics and
telecoms sectors. We have also gained a number of new
clients in both the public and private sectors. At the same
time, we have again been successful in reducing costs
through the delivery of improved operational efficiencies.
Continuing investment in staff training and development
programmes has played a key role in reinforcing our
position as the UK’s premier provider of outsourced
facility management services. 
Workplace Engineering is our new brand for the delivery
of hi-tech electrical, engineering and project fit-out
services. It brings together two recently acquired
businesses, Ace (Ascot) and Acame, both of which
achieved significant growth in 2005 through a
combination of open market tenders and referrals from
JWM. Their integration has now been completed,
providing further efficiencies and cost savings and
enabling us to take full advantage of the continuing
opportunities in this buoyant sector.
The continuing development of new management
processes, supported by integrated IT solutions, will
ensure that we remain at the forefront in delivering
leading edge facilities management services to a
broadening market place.

I would like to thank my colleagues in management and 
all employees for their contribution to the Group as a
whole and for their part in the achievements in the year
under review.
We have made good progress towards our strategic
objectives of creating a dynamic, empowered culture 
in which all our people are motivated to exceed our
customers’ expectations and are properly rewarded for
success. This has made an important contribution to
meeting our performance targets for the Group over the
last year as we seek to ensure that the interests of all
our people are aligned with those of our Shareholders 
as a whole.
People and Culture
We remain totally committed to fulfilling our Corporate
Social Responsibility to the environment and the wider
community. During the year we were pleased to have this
commitment recognised by confirmation of our
membership of the FTSE4GOOD Index, and admission to
the Kempen/SNS Smaller Europe SRI Index of socially
responsible companies.
The Group Environmental Committee has continued to
play a critical role in monitoring and mitigating risk
across the Group, and in driving improvements to the
environmental friendliness of our plants and processes. 
A particularly important contribution has been made by
the continued roll-out of the GreenEarth® cleaning
system in our own drycleaning business and across
Europe under our Master Licence. This technology
replaces traditional chlorinated or hydrocarbon based
solvents with a process based on siloxane. This degrades
rapidly after use to harmless silica and does not 
bio-accumulate. 
We attach great importance to our written code of
business ethics, which sets out clear guidelines for all
staff to ensure that the Group meets the highest
standards of conduct in business dealings. 
The Community and 
the Environment
GreenEarth® drycleaning is odour free and 
kinder to the environment

Over the last three years we have made solid,
incremental progress in building a managed services
Group that is equipped to deliver sustained growth at
both the top and bottom line. We have sold
underperforming and volatile businesses, and invested 
in those with more predictable revenues and genuine
growth potential. All of our operations are either clear
market leaders or in positions of real strength.
Management capabilities have been greatly enhanced,
including the recruitment of a number of senior people
with experience of markets outside the UK. Our excellent
team has been supported by the roll-out of state-of-the-
art IT systems, while our people have been empowered,
motivated and rewarded for their successes. Together
these actions give us a real competitive edge.
I am confident that Johnson Service Group has the 
right combination of material, intellectual and cultural
resources to continue delivering our proven strategy 
and to generate value for Shareholders.
Stuart Graham
Chief Executive

The Future
We pay close attention to the standards observed by our
major overseas garment suppliers, with whom we have
agreed a written code of conduct. Compliance with this is
monitored through regular factory visits.
The Group also seeks to fulfil its social responsibilities by
supporting good causes. Last year we made charitable
donations to Macmillan Cancer Relief, the NSPCC and the
RNLI, while the Johnson Group Cleaners Charity has
continued to support a range of registered charities
targeted at improving the well-being of the sick and
underprivileged.

Reporting
The annual report for 2005 presents the results in
accordance with UK GAAP, in order to comply with
current legislation. As the majority of UK listed
companies will be reporting under IFRS for 2005,
summary IFRS information is provided in note 37.
There is little difference in the adjusted profit before
taxation between UK GAAP and IFRS, following the
adoption of FRS 17 (Retirement Benefits) and FRS 20
(Share-based Payment) which have the same impact 
on profit under both GAAP and IFRS. The effects of
adopting the two new standards are detailed in note 2.
Results
The segmental analysis in note 10, which on the new
basis does not allocate central overheads across the four
divisions, clearly shows our success in repositioning the
Group into stronger and expanding markets. The method
of presenting the segmental analysis has been changed
so that the divisional performance is clearer.
The Rental division now accounts for 35% of Group
revenue (excluding costs recharged to customers) 
(2004: 41%). Within this division we have achieved a
stabilisation of revenue from our garment rental business
whilst enjoying continued double digit growth from
Stalbridge, our premium linen rental business. 
The divisional adjusted operating margin before central
overhead fell from 14.5% to 11.8% due to continued
pressure on the cost base in our garment rental business
and a disappointing result from Johnson Hospitality
Services (JHS), the hospitality service business. JHS was
restructured towards the end of the year with significant
reductions in the fixed cost base as we reduced the
number of operating sites and brought the business
under the management of our Stalbridge operation. 
The Corporatewear division has been significantly
expanded over the last two years by acquisitions and now
represents 24% (2004: 13%) of Group revenue (excluding
costs recharged to customers). The adjusted operating
margin before central overhead is 13.1% (2004: 10.9%)
which reflects the quality of service provided and
efficiencies achieved particularly in procurement which
are being realised in the growing business.
The Drycleaning division, which now includes the
specialist supplies business Alex Reid, represents a
reduced proportion of Group revenue (excluding costs
recharged to customers), 28% compared to 35%. 
In common with many high street businesses low
consumer spending and confidence has resulted in a fall
in like-for-like sales of 2.7%. Despite our actions to reduce
costs across the branch network adjusted operating
margin before central overhead fell from 11.1% to 9.7%.
The Facilities Management division continued to expand
with the acquisition of SGP in October 2005 and in 2005
accounted for 13% (2004: 11%) of Group revenue
(excluding costs recharged to customers) at an adjusted
operating margin before central overhead of 9.4%
(2004: 6.1%). The reduction in throughput revenue in
2005 arises from the acquisition of a specialist
mechanical services company and an engineering
business in November 2004 and January 2005
respectively, resulting in the turnover now being included
in turnover excluding costs recharged to customers.
Overall adjusted operating profit has increased by 21% 
to £36.3 million on revenue growth of 31%. The operating
margin at adjusted operating profit level has fallen from
10.7% to 10.0%. This is primarily due to the continued
decrease in the margin of the Rental division. Given the

costs recharged to customers) and profit from the

Corporatewear and Facilities Management divisions it is
likely that the Group’s adjusted operating profit margin
will remain above 10% in the foreseeable future.
We have incurred a restructuring provision of £4 million in
the year . This has arisen from integrating the acquisitions
made over the preceding eighteen months. The restructuring
will produce annual cost savings of £1.3 million. In addition 
a provision of £1 million has been made relating to
environmental and asbestos clean up. Both of these costs
have been excluded from the adjusted operating profit.
The exceptional income of £4.4 million arose from the
disposal of both retail property and a textile rental site. 
The proceeds arising from these disposals were £8.3 million.
The interest charge reflects the increase in borrowings
following acquisition activity during the year. Under the
newly adopted FRS 17 the interest charge includes a
notional net cost of £0.9 million (2004: £0.7 million) in
respect of the excess of interest on pension scheme
liabilities over pension scheme assets. This charge is a
non cash item.
Taxation
The effective tax rate excluding exceptional items and
intangibles amortisation was 28.3% (2004: 28.5%). 
The tax relief on all exceptional items was £1.4 million. 
Tax relief is only available on intangibles amortisation in
certain circumstances and available capital losses have
offset any tax charge arising on property disposals.
Acquisitions
The Group completed eight acquisitions during the year
at a total cost of £62.2 million of which £55.8 million was
paid in cash during the year. Net cash expenditure on
current and prior year acquisitions amounted to £56.2
million. The two largest acquisitions were DCC Corporate
Clothing at the end of December 2004, at a total cost of
£23.0 million, and SGP Property Services, in October 2005,
at a total cost of £24.8 million.
Several small acquisitions have been made in the Rental
division which have helped to take out production
capacity within the market and to improve efficiency at
our existing plants.
Dividend
A final dividend of 15p is proposed bringing the total
dividend to 19.4p (2004: 18.5p). The recommended
dividend is covered 1.7 times by adjusted fully diluted
earnings per share.
Capital Expenditure
The Group has continued its programme of investment in
the infrastructure with expenditure of £22.4 million, 
up from £12.6 million in 2004. This includes £7.7 million
of expenditure on software relating to the design, build
and implementation of the new Enterprise Resource
Planning software. This project remains on target in 
both timing and cost.
The upgrading of rental production facilities has
continued with resultant efficiency improvements and
this process will continue. We are nearing capacity in our
Stalbridge Linen plants and work has commenced on a
new facility for this expanding business with an expected
capital cost of £7.0 million. 
Rental stock expenditure increased to £24.5 million from
£20.1 million reflecting the expansion of the Stalbridge
customer base and improved customer retention in our
garment rental business, Apparelmaster. Rental stock
expenditure is likely to remain at a similar level to 2005
as long as the market continues to improve.
Cash Flow and Borrowings
Free cash flow excluding net capital expenditure was
109% (2004: 116%) of adjusted operating profit and is
used as a key cash management measure by the Group.
Net debt increased to £137 million from £7 4 million
reflecting fixed asset additions and acquisition activity.
Interest cover remains satisfactory at 4.3 times (2004: 5.5
times) based on adjusted operating profit. 
The Group’s committed bank facility was increased to £200
million in July 2005, arranged with a group of seven banks,
at a reduced margin. The facility extends to 2010. 
In addition we have access to a £10 million overdraft facility
which is utilised to manage working capital requirements.
Defined Benefit Liabilities
As previously reported in our Trading Update in January
2006 we face an increased deficit in our pension
schemes as the result of rising life expectancy and lower
corporate bond yields. Our main defined benefit scheme,
the Johnson Group Staff Pension Scheme, was closed to
new entrants in 2002. However, the normal triennial
valuation was conducted during the year and this,
updated in December under FRS 17, has resulted in an
£11.3 million increase in the deficit compared with that
reported last year. This brings the net deficit after tax for
all our pension schemes to a total of £34 million. 
JSG028_AR_2005 p10-23  30/3/06  09:29  Page 22 Financial Review    Johnson Service Group PLC  
23
The two main sensitivities associated with the valuation
of the schemes are related to longevity assumptions and
movements in the discount rate, both of which are
outside the control of the Group. A one year change in
the longevity assumed will alter the deficit by £5 million
whilst a 0.5% movement in the discount rate will cause
the deficit to change by £17 million. The age assumptions
used are that women of 65 will live for 24 years whilst
men will live for 21 years.
Treasury Policy
Treasury activity is managed centrally and is principally
concerned with the monitoring of working capital,
managing internal and external funding requirements
and monitoring and managing the Group’s interest rate
and foreign currency exposure.
The treasury operation is not a profit centre and its
activities are carried out in accordance with Board
approved policies.
Policies and Strategies
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings,
cash and various items such as trade debtors, trade
creditors and provisions that arise directly from its
operations. The main purpose of these financial
instruments is to raise finance for Group operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review,
the Group’s policy that no trading in financial
instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial
instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and
foreign currency risk. A Board Committee reviews and
agrees policies for managing each of these risks and
these are summarised below.
The policies are designed to mitigate the impact of
fluctuations in interest and exchange rates and are
unchanged from previous years.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of
retained profit, bank borrowings and lease arrangements.
The Group borrows at floating rates and has hedging
products in place to provide fixed rate interest payments
over a specified period. This enables the Group to
forecast borrowing costs with a degree of certainty. 
At December 2005 a proportion of the Group’s
borrowings was at fixed rates.
As required by FRS 13 the fair value of the interest rate
risk hedge has been disclosed in note 33.
Liquidity Risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity is to ensure that it has a
committed borrowings facility available to provide
continuity of funding. The current facility, which is of the
multi-option type, is complemented by an overdraft
facility to allow short term flexibility. Additional facilities
to fund acquisitions are negotiated when required.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group has little investment in overseas operations
and consequently all current borrowings are in sterling.
With the value of overseas trade undertaken by the
Group continuing to increase, foreign currency hedges
are entered into by the Group’s central treasury function,
when considered appropriate. At December 2005 a
proportion of the Group’s future currency requirements
was covered by forward exchange rate contracts. 
As required by FRS 13 the fair value of the exchange rate
risk hedge has been disclosed in note 33.
Details of the numerical results of the above policies are
disclosed in note 33 to the financial statements.
Going Concern
After due consideration the Directors confirm that they
have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the
Group have adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the Group’s financial statements.
Summary
The Group is in a strong financial position and we look
forward to another successful year.

BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain properties, has been used throughout these
financial statements on a basis consistent with the prior year with the exception of the adoption of FRS 17 “Retirement
Benefits” and FRS 20 “Share-based Payment” . These changes in accounting policy are described further in note 2. 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting
standards in the United Kingdom.
Accounting standards, FRS 21 “Events after the balance sheet date”, FRS 22 “Earnings per share”, FRS 23 “The effects of
changes in foreign exchange rates”, FRS 24 “Financial reporting in hyper inflation economies”, FRS 25 “Financial
Instruments: disclosure and presentation”, FRS 26 “Financial Instruments: measurement” and FRS 28 “Corresponding
amounts” have not been adopted in these financial statements as their effective date is for accounting periods
commencing on or after 1st January 2005 and early adoption is not permitted.
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The financial statements consolidate the results of Johnson Service Group PLC and its subsidiary undertakings. The
principal subsidiary undertakings are listed in note 36. The accounting periods of subsidiary undertakings are co-
terminous with those of the Company. Results and cash flows of subsidiary undertakings acquired are included from 
the effective date of acquisition and accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting. Results and cash flows of
subsidiary undertakings disposed of are included up to the date of disposal.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates ruling on the dates of those transactions, adjusted
for the effect of any hedging arrangements. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling 
at year end rates, unless the item is hedged, when it will be translated at the hedged rate.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in interest rates in line with the
Group’s risk management policies. Amounts payable or receivable in respect of these instruments are recognised as
adjustments to interest expense over the relevant period of the financial instrument.
GOODWILL
Goodwill, which represents the excess of the fair value of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired, arising
on consolidation and on trading acquisitions by subsidiary undertakings prior to 27th December 1997 has been written off
against reserves. In accordance with FRS 10, the goodwill arising on acquisitions after that date has been included on the
balance sheet as an intangible fixed asset and depreciated over the shorter of 20 years or the expected useful life of the
goodwill. The Directors regard 20 years as a reasonable maximum for the estimated useful life of goodwill. Goodwill which
has been written off to reserves will be transferred to the profit and loss account on the subsequent disposal of the
business to which it relates. For those acquisitions where consideration is contingent upon one or more future events, 
the Directors include their best estimate of the amounts expected to be payable in the future. The cost of acquisition is
adjusted where revised estimates are made, with consequential corresponding adjustments continuing to be made to
goodwill until the ultimate amount is known.
Where circumstances indicate there may have been an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment
review is carried out using cash flows from approved budgets and projections discounted at the Group’s weighted average
cost of capital. Any such impairment is charged to the profit and loss account.
TURNOVER AND INCOME RECOGNITION
Turnover represents the invoiced value of goods and services supplied exclusive of VAT and similar taxes. Rental 
services, Corporatewear and Facilities Management income is recognised on an accruals basis representing contractual
arrangements. Drycleaning income is recognised at the time that goods are processed. Facilities Management turnover
comprises fees receivable and costs recharged to customers, where the relationship with the supplier of services is that 
of principal. The element of turnover that comprises supplier costs recharged to customers has been shown separately 
on the profit and loss account to aid interpretation of the business.

PROVISIONS
Property
Provision is made for the anticipated net costs of onerous leases on non trading properties and for dilapidations and
environmental clean up costs. Liabilities for environmental costs are recognised as a property provision when
environmental assessments or clean-ups are probable and the associated costs can be reliably estimated. Generally, the
timing of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on
closure of inactive sites. The provisions will be utilised by the payment of annual costs, shortfalls on sub-tenanted
property, expenses of early termination, environmental clean up operations and dilapidations.
Self Insurance
Provision is made for the expected costs of uninsured incidents arising prior to the balance sheet date and for the
anticipated cost of benefits due to existing claimants under the, now discontinued, self insured incapacity payroll scheme.
Deferred Taxation
Deferred taxation is accounted for on an undiscounted basis at expected tax rates on all differences arising from the
inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which the items
are reported in the profit and loss account. Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation
of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset. A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is more likely
than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of timing differences can be deducted.
PENSIONS AND POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Group has defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and an unfunded post retirement medical benefit scheme.
The plans are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds, determined by
periodic actuarial calculations.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined
obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised
actuarial gains or losses and past service costs and is shown net of related deferred tax (to the extent that it is
recoverable). The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash
outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which benefits will
be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. Actuarial gains and
losses, differences between the expected and actual returns, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions are
recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in the year in which they arise. The expected service cost
under the plan is recognised as an employee benefit expense and the expected interest income on plan assets and
expected interest cost on plan liabilities are recognised as interest in the profit and loss account.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans
on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions
have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid
contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
For the unfunded post retirement medical benefit scheme, the cost of post retirement cover, as calculated by an
independent actuary, is charged to operating profit, and the liability recognised on the balance sheet, net of deferred tax
(to the extent that it is recoverable). Finance costs in the profit and loss account include a charge equal to the expected
increase in the plan’s liabilities over the year.

34
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS – PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, or valuation, less depreciation which is calculated to write off these assets, by
equal annual instalments, over their estimated useful lives. The estimated life of plant and fixtures is two to fifteen years
and of vehicles four to five years. Improvements to short leasehold properties are amortised over the terms of the leases.
Following the implementation of FRS 15 freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated over their estimated
remaining useful life not exceeding 50 years commencing on 26th December 1999 or, if later, date of purchase. The Group
has not adopted a policy of revaluation but, as permitted by the transitional provisions of FRS 15, the carrying amounts of
freehold and long leasehold properties reflect previous valuations. In the event of an impairment in property value the
deficit below cost is charged to the profit and loss account.
The fitting out costs of new freehold or long leasehold industrial buildings are depreciated, in equal annual instalments, over
their expected useful lives which range from ten to twenty five years from the date on which the assets are fully commissioned.
Tangible fixed assets bought through acquisition of other businesses are accounted for as if they had been owned by the
Group since new.
TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS – RENTAL ITEMS
Rental items, which principally comprise workwear garments, cabinet towels, linen, dust mats and event hire equipment,
are initially treated as stock. On issue to customers or into pool stock, rental items are transferred to fixed assets and are
stated at invoiced cost less depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated lives of the
items in circulation, which range from two to ten years. Issued rental items bought through acquisition of other
businesses are accounted for as if they had been owned by the Group since new.
Where proceeds are received in respect of textile rental items withdrawn from circulation these are deducted from the net
book value of those items. Amounts invoiced to customers in relation to breakages of event hire equipment are treated as
turnover and the related estimated net book value deducted from fixed assets and charged as cost of sales.
LEASED ASSETS
Rentals payable in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the
lease term.
Where assets are financed by leasing or hire purchase arrangements which give rights approximating to ownership, the
assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright and are capitalised at their fair value at the date of inception of
the lease. The capital element of outstanding lease or hire purchase commitments is treated as a liability and disclosed as
obligations under finance agreements. Interest is allocated to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease or
hire purchase agreement and represents a constant proportion of the outstanding commitment.
INVESTMENT IN OWN SHARES
Ordinary shares in the Company held by the Trustee of the Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) are recorded in the
balance sheet as a reduction in Shareholders’ funds.
FACILITIES MANAGEMENT PRE CONTRACT COSTS
Pre contract costs are expensed as incurred up to the point that preferred bidder status is awarded from which time
further directly attributable pre contract costs are recognised as an asset and amortised over the life of the contract.
STOCKS
Stocks of materials, stores, goods for resale and new rental items are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is stated on a first in, first out basis and comprises invoiced cost in respect of the purchase of finished goods and
materials, direct labour and a share of production overheads in respect of garments for sale.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The expense for employee share options is calculated with reference to the fair value of the award on the date of grant.
The fair value is recognised as an employee expense over the vesting period of the scheme, adjusted to reflect actual and
expected levels of vesting, with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of each award is calculated using a
suitable option valuation model, based on the terms of each award.

these financial statements. The retained profit of the Parent Company is shown in note 27 on page 51.
2 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Group has changed its accounting policy in respect of share-based payments to comply with the provisions of FRS 20, “Share-based
Payment”. The standard requires that the fair value of share-based payments be recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account
over the period of service to which the award relates. In accordance with the transitional rules of FRS 20, the Group has applied the
requirements of the standard to awards granted after 7th November 2002 that had not vested by 26th December 2004.
The Group has also changed its accounting policy in respect of pensions and other retirement benefits to comply with the provisions of
FRS 17, “Retirement Benefits”. The standard requires the assets and liabilities of defined benefit retirement plans to be shown in the
balance sheet, service costs and expected interest on plan assets and liabilities to be shown in the profit and loss account and changes in
actuarial assumptions and movements on scheme assets and liabilities to be shown in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Consequently, the Group has made the following adjustments in respect of 2004:
Operating Profit Before Profit After Shareholders’
Profit Taxation Taxation Funds
£m £m £m £m
Year ended 25th December 2004
FRS 20 – Share-based Payments (0.2) (0.2) (0.3) 0.4
FRS 17 – Retirement Benefits 0.7 (0.1) (0.1) (25.4)
Total Prior Year adjustment 0.5 (0.3) (0.4) (25.0)
For the year ended 31st December 2005, the adoption of FRS 20 and FRS 17 has increased operating profit by £0.3 million and reduced
profit before taxation by £0.7 million.
The prior year adjustment has reduced Company Shareholders’ funds at 25th December 2004 by £21.1 million.

The basis of segmental analysis has been revised to show the unallocated central overheads separately and to include the results of Alex Reid
Limited within the Drycleaning segment. 2004 has been re-analysed accordingly. The operating profit before restructuring and
environmental costs and goodwill amortisation and profit before taxation from Drycleaning includes £1.8 million (2004: £1.4 million) of 
profit from the disposal of properties formerly occupied by the Drycleaning business and other non-trading items. Of the exceptional 
items in 2005, £2.1 million has been included in the Rental segment and £2.3 million in the Drycleaning segment in the analysis of profit
before taxation.
Turnover from continuing activities originates in the United Kingdom. There is no significant difference between turnover by origin and
turnover by destination.

Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by 
the ESOP, based on the profit on ordinary activities after taxation.
Adjusted earnings per share figures are given to exclude the effects of goodwill amortisation, restructuring and environmental costs 
and exceptional items, all net of taxation and are considered to show the underlying results of the Group. For diluted earnings per share, 
the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares. 
The Company has dilutive potential Ordinary shares arising from share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less
than the average market price of the Company’s Ordinary shares during the year.

Bank loans are unsecured and are drawn down under a committed Revolving Credit Facility, which matures between two and five years.
Individual tranches are drawn down, in sterling, for periods of up to six months at the rates of interest prevailing at the time of draw down.
The Group and Company unsecured bank loans are stated net of unamortised issue costs of £0.8 million (2004: £0.1 million). In 2005 the
Company incurred total issue costs of £0.9 million in respect of the five year multi–option committed facility entered into in July 2005.
Of the amounts due to subsidiary undertakings after more than one year, £173.9 million (2004: £214.5 million) bears interest at 1%
below base rate and £148.9 million (2004: £128.8 million) does not bear interest.
22 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
GROUP
At 31st December 2005 there were no contingent liabilities except for those arising from the ordinary course of the Group’s business.
Johnsons Apparelmaster Ltd is the defendant in a claim from an employee of a subcontractor. Johnsons Apparelmaster’s defence is in
the process of being proved and currently it intends to strongly resist the claim in both quantum and cause. The likely outcome cannot
be determined at this time.
Sketchley Services Ltd (Sketchley) acquired in 2004, may benefit from potential tax benefits from the future utilisation of brought
forward trading losses which could arise subject to agreement with the Inland Revenue. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the
availability and value of the losses the Directors believe it to be prudent not to recognise any potential benefit at this stage. If a benefit
is realised in future years this will give rise to a liability for deferred consideration, the maximum liability under the agreement being 
£5 million. If the maximum liability arises, tax benefits of £8.5 million will have been realised.
COMPANY
The Company has guaranteed the banking facilities of certain UK subsidiary undertakings under a cross guarantee arrangement. 
No losses are expected to result from this contingent liability.

SELF INSURANCE
The self insurance provision includes a provision for payments due to existing claimants under the self funded incapacity scheme over a
period of 27 years. This scheme is now closed. The balance of the provision, which is in respect of general insurance arrangements, is
expected to be utilised within five years except for any claims resulting in litigation.

Total provision/(asset) for deferred taxes 0.6 0.3 (0.2) (0.7)
The Company’s deferred tax asset of £0.2 million (2004: £0.7 million) is included in debtors (note 20).
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the
asset as such tax would only become payable if the property were sold without relief being obtained. The tax which would be payable in
such circumstances is estimated to be £nil (2004: £nil) due to the existence of indexation allowances and capital losses.
The Group also has a £15.1 million (2004: £10.2 million) deferred tax asset in respect of its defined benefit liabilities. In accordance with
current UK accounting requirements, the deferred tax asset is netted off against the gross defined benefit liability and is therefore excluded
from the above figures.

24 PENSION AND OTHER RETIREMENT BENEFIT LIABILITIES
The Group operates pension schemes of both the funded defined benefit and the defined contribution type for a substantial number of
employees.
The disclosures below are in respect of all of the Group schemes. The Company accounts reflect the liabilities of the Johnson Group
Staff Pension Scheme, the Semara Augmented Pension Plan and the Private Healthcare Scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds. The schemes are subject to independent actuarial valuations
every three years, using the Attained Age Method, and pension costs are assessed in accordance therewith.

JOHNSON GROUP STAFF PENSION SCHEME
The updated actuarial valuation at 31st December 2005 showed an increase in the deficit to £45.7 million (2004: £30.0 million).
Discussions are still taking place regarding the new contribution rate to be paid.
SEMARA AUGMENTED PENSION PLAN
The updated actuarial valuation at 31st December 2005 showed a small reduction in the deficit. Contributions to the Semara Augmented
Pension Plan were equal to the individual funding rates for each active member plus £81,700 per annum.
WML FINAL SALARY PENSION SCHEME
On 28th October 2003, the Group inherited the WML Final Salary Pension Scheme as a result of its acquisition of Workplace Management.
The updated actuarial valuation at 31st December 2005 showed an increase in the deficit to £2.6 million (2004: £2.0 million). Cash
contributions to the scheme have been at the rate of 41.9% of Pensionable Salaries from 5th April 2002. The results of the actuarial
valuation at 5th April 2005 are still being discussed.
PENSIONS – DEFINED CONTRIBUTION
The Johnson Group Retirement Plan is a defined contribution scheme. The cost for the year was £2.3 million (2004: £2.0 million).
PRIVATE HEALTHCARE
The Group operates an unfunded defined benefit private healthcare scheme for eligible retirees. The scheme is subject to an
independent actuarial review which assesses the cost of providing benefits for current and future eligible retirees.
The latest formal review was undertaken as at 31st December 2005. The actuarial review was performed using the Projected Unit Credit
Method, using a discount rate of 4.9%. The main long term actuarial assumptions used in the review were that the annual increase in
medical costs would be 4.25% and that the retirement age of eligible employees will be 60 for females and 62 for males.
The full actuarial valuations of the pension schemes disclosed above have been updated to 31st December 2005 by an independent
qualified actuary.

An annual contribution of £81,700 will be payable to the Semara Augmented Pension Plan for the next 10 years in respect of past
service. The Company is in discussion with the Trustees regarding additional contributions to be made to the Johnson Group Staff
Pension Scheme and WML Final Salary Pension Scheme in order to reduce the deficit over an agreed period of time.
The contribution rates to the Johnson Group Retirement Plan are not expected to be significantly different from the rates 
disclosed above.

26 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Equity-settled share-based payments
The Johnson Group 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme and unapproved share option schemes provide for an exercise price equal to
the average quoted market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant, as determined by the Remuneration Committee. The
vesting period is generally three years. Both market based and non-market based performance conditions are generally attached to the
options, for which an appropriate adjustment is made when calculating the fair value of an option.
The Johnson Group Savings Related Share Option Scheme provides for an exercise price equal to the average quoted market price of
the Company’s shares on the date of grant, less 20 percent. The vesting period is either three or five years and no performance
conditions are attached to the options.
If options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options will lapse if the
employee leaves the Group before the options vest, unless under exceptional circumstances.

Options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the period. The weighted average share price of Johnson Service Group PLC
during the period was £4.43 (2004: £3.92).
For options outstanding at 31st December 2005, the exercise date and the exercise price are disclosed within Note 25.
During the year, a long term incentive plan (LTIP) in which certain executive directors and senior executives may be invited to participate
was introduced. The plan is designed to reinforce the importance of management meeting the Group’s medium term financial objectives in
a way that will align their reward with shareholder returns. Full details of the plan are included within the Board Report on Remuneration.
The inputs into the share option valuation models (Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo) used in calculating fair values are as follows:
Options Options
granted granted
during 2005 during 2004
Weighted average share price at date of grant (£) 3.92 3.92
Weighted average exercise price (£) 4.27 3.7 4
Weighted average fair value (£) 0.42 0.37
Expected volatility (%) 14.94 16.91
Expected life (years) 3.60 3.68
Risk free rate (%) 4.39 4.70
Expected dividend yield (%) 5.03 5.32
Expected volatility and expected dividend yield were determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price and the
historical dividend yield for a period akin to the expected life of each option scheme. The risk free rate of return is based on the rate for
UK government gilts on the date of grant, for a period akin to the expected life of the option.
The Group recognised total expenses of £0.5 million and £0.3 million in relation to equity-settled share based payment transactions in
2005 and 2004 respectively. In addition a charge of £0.3 million (2004: £nil) was recognised in relation to the LTIP.

The total facility available as at 31st December 2005 was £200.0 million (2004: £110.0 million) leaving an undrawn committed facility of
£61.0 million (2004: £40.0 million). The Group also has an overdraft facility of £10.0 million which is reviewed annually, the next review
date being December 2006.
HEDGES
As explained in the Financial Review it is the Group’s policy to partly hedge interest and exchange rate risks.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has off-balance sheet (unrecognised) gains and losses in respect of financial
instruments used as hedges at the end of the year. It also shows the amount of such gains which have been included in the profit and
loss account for the year and those gains and losses which are expected to be included in the next year’s, or later, profit and loss
account.

The Group’s creditors falling due within one year (other than bank and other borrowings) are excluded from the above tables either due
to the exclusion of short term items or because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability.
FIXED RATE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
The effect of the Group’s interest swap is to classify £50 million (2004: £25 million) of borrowings in the above table as fixed rate, 
the weighted average rate, excluding margin, being 4.63% (2004: 6.62%) and weighted average period remaining being 31 months
(2004: 3 months).
The interest rates on finance lease arrangements are fixed and are set at the point of inception. The average interest rate incurred is
6.2% (2004: 6.4%) and the weighted average period remaining is 60 months (2004: 67 months).
FLOATING RATE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents. Interest rate swaps are taken to fix
interest rate payments for periods of between one and six months. The weighted average period remaining for floating rate financial
liabilities is 55 months (2004: 18 months).
FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Bank loans are drawn down and interest fixed for no more than a six month period. In view of this the fair value of bank loans is not
materially different from the book value. Except as shown in the table below, the fair value of other financial liabilities was not materially
different from the book value.

37 SUMMARY IFRS INFORMATION
a)  BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Group will be required to report under IFRS for the accounting period ending on 31st December 2006. The summary income statement and
balance sheet for 2005 and 2004 presented below have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as they are expected to apply to the Group.
The summary IFRS information that follows in this note has been prepared in accordance with those IFRS standards and the International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations issued and endorsed or issued and expected to be endorsed by the
European Union (EU), as at the time of preparing these summary statements (March 2006). In addition, the Group has adopted the
amendment to IAS 19, Employee Benefits, that permits actuarial gains and losses arising on defined benefit pension plans to be taken to the
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The Johnson Service Group PLC consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (UK GAAP) until 31st December 2005. UK GAAP differs in some areas from IFRS. Summary reconciliations and descriptions of the
effect of the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS on the Group’s equity and its net income and cash flows are provided in this note.
The summary information presented in this note does not include all the disclosures required in full IFRS financial statements and is
therefore not fully in accordance with IFRS disclosure requirements.
The revised principal accounting policies set out in the IFRS Impact Statement issued in July 2005 are expected to be formally adopted by
the Group when it prepares its first annual report for the year ending 31st December 2006. These standards remain subject to further
amendments and interpretative guidance from the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as well as ongoing review and
endorsement by the EU. Consequently, the accounting policies are provisional and are subject to change.

The Board has reviewed the procedures, as required by the UK Listing Authority, to comply with the provisions of 
Section 1 of the Revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003
(‘Revised Combined Code’).
COMPLIANCE
The Company has complied with the provisions of the Revised Combined Code throughout the period other than the
provisions for the attendance by the Senior Independent Director at meetings with major Shareholders. The Chairman,
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer all regularly meet with the Company’s major Shareholders and the Board is of
the opinion that additional regular meetings, other than those specifically requested by Shareholders, with the Senior
Independent Director would not assist further in the dialogue with Shareholders. The Senior Independent Director is
available to meet with Shareholders, at their request, and the Board believes this arrangement to be sufficient. In addition
all Non-Executive Directors have met with the Company’s largest Shareholder.
The Company’s compliance with the Code has been reviewed by the Auditors to the extent specified by the UK Listing
Authority and their report is given on pages 81 and 82.
THE BOARD
The Board met formally seven times during 2005. Additionally, the Directors met informally on two other occasions.
Individual attendance at the formal meetings is set out in the table below. Where N/a appears in the table, the Director is
not a Committee member.

Number of Meetings 7 4 1 8
In addition, the Non-Executive Directors have met during the year without their Executive colleagues and additionally
without the Chairman. A performance evaluation of the Board was conducted during the year by way of one-to-one
meetings between the Chairman and each member of the Board. These meetings discussed the Board composition, the
format and effectiveness of Board Meetings and the contribution to the Board of the particular member. The Senior
Independent Director, with input from discussions with the Executive Directors, appraised the performance of the
Chairman.
During the year a formal evaluation of the Audit Committee was conducted by means of a questionnaire being sent 
to members of the Audit Committee. The responses were reviewed by the Chairman of the Committee and actions to
improve the effectiveness of the Committee were agreed and have been implemented accordingly. 
The results of these reviews were discussed by the Board as a whole, with action taken as appropriate.
The Board currently consists of a Non-Executive Chairman, five Executive Directors and three Non-Executive Directors, 
all of whom are considered to be independent in character and judgment. Until December 2003, Mr. M. B. Del Mar had 
been connected to the Company through his position at UBS Investment Bank, the Company’s former corporate finance
advisors. Prior to his appointment, the Board considered the independence of Mr. M. B. Del Mar with particular care and
Corporate Governance
JSG028_AR_2005 p62-end  30/3/06  09:33  Page 62 Corporate Governance    Johnson Service Group PLC  
63
concluded that Mr. Del Mar was fully independent. He has demonstrated this independence in the manner in which he 
has discharged his duties to date. The Non-Executive Directors are a strong element within the Board with their views
carrying significant weight in the decision making process. All Directors are subject to re-election at the Annual General
Meeting if appointed by the Board since the last Annual General Meeting or if they have held office for more than 30
months since last appointment. Appropriate training is available to Directors upon appointment and as required on an
ongoing basis. Furthermore, on appointment, Directors participate in a customised induction programme to familiarise
them with the Group.
There is a clear division of responsibility, as set out in writing and agreed by the Board, between the Chairman and the
Chief Executive, each of which has clearly defined roles. The Chairman is responsible for the effective running of the
Board whilst the Chief Executive is responsible for operating the business and implementing the Board’s strategies 
and policies. The commitments of the Chairman are disclosed within the Directors’ and Officer’s Biographies’ Section on
page 25. The overall time commitments have not changed during the year.
The Board, in addition to routine consideration of both financial and operational matters, determines the strategic
direction of the Group. The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for its decision which can only 
be amended by the Board itself. The specific responsibilities reserved for the Board include: approval of the Group’s long-
term objectives and overall strategy; approval and monitoring of the annual operating budget; approval of major
acquisitions, disposals and capital expenditure; dividend policy; approval of appointments to the Board and of the
Company Secretary; approval of policies relating to Directors’ remuneration; consideration of succession planning for 
key members of the management team; and determining the terms of reference for the Board committees.
To assist the Board in performing these responsibilities, information appropriate in quality and timeliness, is received in 
an agreed format, for each Board meeting.
The following responsibilities have been delegated to Executive management: the development of strategic plans that
reflect the longer term objectives and priorities established by the Board; implementation of strategies and policies as
determined by the Board; monitoring of operational and financial performance against plans and budgets; and developing
and implementing risk management systems.
The Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and it is acknowledged that individual
Directors may wish to seek independent professional advice in connection with their responsibilities and duties. The
Company will meet reasonable expenses incurred in this regard.
The Committees of the Board are the Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee and the Nomination Committee. The
Audit Committee consists wholly of the Non-Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee consists of the Chairman
and the Non-Executive Directors whilst the Nomination Committee consists of the Chairman, Non-Executive Directors and
the Chief Executive. Board appointments are subject to approval by the Board as a whole. Members of the Committees 
are shown on page 26. Each Committee has written terms of reference which are available on the Company’s website.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee meets at least three times per year, on each occasion also meeting, in private, with the external
auditors. The Board has satisfied itself that the composition of the Audit Committee is in compliance with the 
Combined Code.
The main responsibilities of the Committee include: review of the financial statements and announcements relating to
financial performance and recommending them to the Board; review of the system of internal control including the 
work of internal audit; ensuring the maintenance of a control environment and the appropriate management of risk;
recommendation of appointment of and liaison with the external auditors; annual review and monitoring of external
auditors’ independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process; development and implementation of
JSG028_AR_2005 p62-end  30/3/06  09:33  Page 63 Johnson Service Group PLC Corporate Governance
64
policy on the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services; and review of arrangements under which
employees may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other
matters ensuring that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and independent investigation and appropriate
follow-up action.
In 2005 the Audit Committee discharged its responsibilities by: reviewing the Group’s draft financial statements and
interim results statement prior to Board approval and reviewing the external auditors’ report thereon; reviewing the
progress of the IFRS conversion project and the appropriateness of accounting and transition policies to be adopted;
reviewing appropriateness of UK GAAP accounting policies; reviewing the external auditors’ plan for the audit of the Group
accounts, confirmations of auditor independence and proposed audit fee and approving terms of engagement for the audit;
reviewing internal audit’s work programme and reports on its work during the year; review of the risk management
programme; review of Group Directors’ expenses; formalisation of auditor independence policy; and monitoring of
reporting and follow up of items reported on the employee hotline established in line with the Code of Ethics.
The Committee also regularly monitors the non-audit services being provided by the external auditors. Note 6 details fees
relating to non-audit services, summarised according to the type of services provided. A policy regarding the provision of
non-audit services has been formalised, such that non-audit work has been categorised into three areas: normally
performed by the auditor; may be performed by the auditor; and that normally performed by another provider. With
reference to this policy, the selection of professional service firms for non-audit work is at the discretion of the
management, taking into account which firm is best placed to perform such work to meet the interests of the Company
and Shareholders and with regard to ensuring that independence is not compromised.
The Committee confirms it is satisfied with the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of the external auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and accordingly a resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors will 
be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The work undertaken by the Audit Committee, supported by the internal audit function, helps to enable the Board to
make the statements relating to internal control on page 65 and the going concern basis on page 23.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are outlined in the Board Report on Remuneration, page 71.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The responsibilities of the Nomination Committee include: reviewing the Board structure, size and composition; identifying
and nominating candidates to fill vacancies; keeping up to date and fully aware of the strategic and commercial changes
affecting the Group and the markets in which it operates; keeping under review the leadership needs of the business with
a view to ensuring the continued ability to compete effectively in the marketplace; considering the continuing service of a
Director; and providing recommendations for reappointment of Directors retiring by rotation.
The Committee meets as required and met during the year to review the structure and composition of the Board. 
No changes were recommended during the year.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company has an active investor relations programme with the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer
meeting key institutions, both Shareholders and prospective Shareholders, in the periods following the announcement 
of the annual and interim results and at other appropriate times during the year. To ensure effective two-way
communication the Chairman also meets with major Shareholders during the year. The Board is of the opinion that
additional routine meetings with the Senior Independent Director would not assist further in the dialogue with
shareholders. However the Senior Independent Director is available to meet with shareholders, at their request. Feedback
is provided to the Board on any issues raised at these meetings. External brokers’ reports are circulated to the Directors.
Corporate Governance continued
JSG028_AR_2005 p62-end  30/3/06  09:33  Page 64 Corporate Governance    Johnson Service Group PLC  
65
The Shareholders’ views of the meetings with the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer following the interim and
final results are obtained by the Group’s brokers and circulated to the Board.
The Board welcomes private and institutional Shareholders to the Annual General Meeting, which is normally attended by all
Directors, to discuss appropriate topics during the meeting or with the Directors after the formal proceedings have ended.
The Board considers that the Preliminary Announcement, Annual Report including the Chairman’s Statement, Chief
Executive’s Review of Operations and Financial Review which are contained therein, and the Interim Report present a
balanced and clear assessment of the Group’s position and prospects. 
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
There is an on-going process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks that has been in 
place throughout the year ended 31st December 2005 and up to the date of approval of the financial statements. 
This process has been regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the internal control guidance of the Revised
Combined Code for Directors.
The Audit Committee receives reports setting out key performance and risk indicators and considers possible control
issues brought to its attention by early warning mechanisms which are embedded within the operational units and
reinforced by risk awareness training. 
The Audit Committee also receives regular reports from the internal audit function and, where appropriate,
recommendations for improvement are considered. The Audit Committee’s role in this area is confined to a high level
review of the arrangements for internal control.
The Board’s agenda includes a bi-annual consideration of risk and control and it receives reports thereon from the 
Audit Committee. The emphasis is on obtaining the relevant degree of assurance and not merely reporting by exception.
The main features of the internal financial control framework are detailed below.
FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Board reviews the strategies of the Group and of the subsidiary undertakings. There is a detailed budgeting system
with an annual budget both challenged and approved by the Board. Monthly trading results and indebtedness are
reported against the corresponding figures for the budget and the previous year with corrective action initiated by the
Board as appropriate. 
TREASURY MANAGEMENT
The Group’s treasury activities are operated within Board-approved guidelines. Facilities are approved by the Board and 
all transactions are controlled and monitored. Frequent reports are made to the Chief Financial Officer and monthly
summaries are prepared for the Board. Speculative transactions are not undertaken. 
RISK MANAGEMENT
The identification of major business risks is carried out in conjunction with operating management and reviewed by the
Audit Committee and the Board. The Board regularly assesses the financial implications and effectiveness of the control
process in place to mitigate or eliminate these risks. The Group has insurance cover where it is considered appropriate
and cost effective.
JSG028_AR_2005 p62-end  30/3/06  09:33  Page 65 Johnson Service Group PLC Corporate Governance
66
FINANCIAL CONTROL 
Each business maintains financial controls and procedures appropriate to its own operating environment.
The Group has a centralised internal audit function, based at Head office, which can second additional resources from
operating companies, and which reviews the systems and procedures in all operating companies and reports regularly to
the Audit Committee. A review of control procedures is undertaken in respect of all new acquisitions, within the first three
months of ownership, and action taken where necessary to bring the controls up to the level required by the Group.
The Group has clearly defined guidelines for the review and approval of capital expenditure projects. These include annual
budgets and designated levels of authority.
CODE OF ETHICS
The Group has a written code on business ethics, which is reviewed regularly by the Board and which sets out guidelines
for all staff to enable the Group to meet the highest standards of conduct in business dealings including those with
overseas garment suppliers. New acquisitions are made aware of these standards on joining the Group and plans are put
in place to ensure compliance is achieved. 
Senior employees are required to sign an annual statement of compliance with the code. A confidential hotline service is
available to employees should anyone wish to report perceived improprieties. Arrangements are in place to ensure any
reports are followed up and the appropriate action taken. 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Board is aware of its responsibilities with regard to the environment and receives regular reports on all environmental
matters and has nominated an Executive Director responsible for such matters. Potential areas of risk are identified
through the Group’s risk assessment programme and mitigated wherever possible. A Group Environmental Committee has
been established to consider the risks presented by environmental matters and to develop and implement plans to clean
up contaminated sites and to prevent future contamination. A working party monitors environmental performance and
assists with the education of employees. Key operating locations are subject to comprehensive, quantitative audits which
enable a measure of environmental improvement to be made. The Group keeps under review the advances made in
technology and the requirements of relevant regulations. Several of the Group’s operating companies have achieved or
are working towards ISO 14001 European Environmental Management Systems Accreditation. In the course of the year,
the Group has been prosecuted and fined £10,000 for one minor environmental offence relating to a discharge to
controlled waters.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss and cash flows of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements the Directors are required to
• Select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently.
• Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
• State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
• Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume the Group 
will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
Corporate Governance continued
JSG028_AR_2005 p62-end  30/3/06  09:33  Page 66 Corporate Governance    Johnson Service Group PLC  
67
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Johnson Service Group PLC website is the responsibility of the Directors. The work
carried out by the Auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and accordingly, the Auditors accept no
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented 
on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.

EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
The employment policies of the Group embody the principles of equal opportunity and are tailored to meet the needs of
its different businesses and the local areas in which they operate. The involvement of employees in the performance of
the business is encouraged and efforts are made to give all employees an understanding of the financial position through
periodic Group newsletters. Each operating company is responsible for the development of employee involvement and
communication practices which are appropriate to its own particular needs. An approved Savings Related Share Option
Scheme has been in operation for eligible employees since 1987.
The Group is committed to providing adequate training for employees at all levels and is constantly reviewing and
improving its procedures. Johnsons Apparelmaster Limited holds Investor in People status. 
Suitable procedures are in operation to support the Group’s policy that disabled persons, whether registered or not,

aptitudes and abilities. Where members of staff become disabled every effort is made to ensure that they are retrained
according to their abilities.

successor to Mr. D. Bryant following his announced retirement from the Board in October 2006.
Health and Safety matters are a permanent agenda item at all Board and subsidiary company Board meetings.
A detailed report outlining subsidiary company activities is provided for each regular Board meeting, including up to date
statistics relating to accidents and incidents that have occurred since the last report.
The Board has appointed the Health and Safety Director of Johnson Workplace Management to advise the Directors and

INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee consists of the Non-Executive Directors: Baroness J. A. Wilcox (Chairman), 
Mr. S. P. Sherrard, Mr. M. R. B. Gatenby and Mr. M. B. Del Mar. None of the members of the Committee have or had any
personal financial interests (other than as Shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day 
to day involvement in running the business.
The Committee is responsible for overseeing the policy regarding executive remuneration and for determining the
remuneration packages for the Executive Directors.
During the year the Committee consulted the Chief Executive about its proposals with regard to remuneration and terms
of employment of Executive Directors, other than the Chief Executive himself. The Committee has also consulted with
KPMG and Mercer who have provided advice in relation to Directors’ pension arrangements and the proposed changes 
to pension legislation. The Group Human Resources Director has provided assistance to the Committee with regards 
to benchmarking Executive Directors’ remuneration. Allen & Overy LLP provided advice in relation to the design of the
Long Term Incentive Plan which was approved at the 2005 AGM.
Reward surveys provided by New Bridge Street Consultants and KPMG have been used for benchmarking purposes.
REMUNERATION POLICY
Executive Directors’ remuneration is designed to attract, motivate and retain executives of the necessary calibre and to
reward them for enhancing shareholder value. Total remuneration comprises fixed pay, variable pay and benefits, of which
fixed pay currently forms the largest proportion. Remuneration is aligned with shareholders’ interests through an annual
bonus scheme which is based on performance related criteria. A long term performance based share option scheme, 
the 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme, has also operated during the year.
The current remuneration of Executive Directors comprises the five elements of basic salary, annual bonus, taxable
benefits, share options and for some Executive Directors, a Long Term Incentive Plan.
BASIC SALARY
A salary which reflects the Remuneration Committee’s assessment of the market rate for relevant positions and the
individual Director’s experience and value to the business. Annual reviews are considered against published information
for similar sized Groups and the level of increases awarded to staff throughout the Group.
ANNUAL BONUS
The Group operates a Short Term Incentive Programme (STIP) for senior executives. The Executive Directors participate
in the STIP, which provides for a performance related bonus based on a combination of the Group’s results, achievement
of goals set in relation to the individual’s area of responsibility and divisional results. The individual targets for the
Executive Directors are established by the Committee with a view to maximising shareholder value and meeting other
Group objectives. Subject to the achievement of the targets, the annual performance related bonus can represent up to
100% of basic salary for Mr. S. W. Graham, Mr. J. H. Wilkinson, Mr. D. R. Toon and Mr. S. R. Moate and up to 75% of basic
salary for Mr. D. Bryant. The Committee reviews, on an annual basis, the performance criteria for each Executive Director
to ensure that they remain appropriate.
TAXABLE BENEFITS
Taxable benefits principally include a car allowance, private medical insurance and life assurance.
SHARE OPTIONS
The Executive Share Option Scheme which was available to Executive Directors and other senior executives within the
Group reached the end of its life in 1997. The last grant under this Scheme was in April 1996.

Board Report on Remuneration continued
The 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme (the “Plan”) was approved at the 2003 Annual General Meeting. The Plan 
is designed to align the long term incentives provided by the Company for senior employees with the interests of
Shareholders. Options have been granted under the Plan (which comprises an Inland Revenue approved plan and an
unapproved plan) to Executive Directors and other selected managers in the Group. Grants have been made subject to 
an individual maximum limit based on the market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant of options under 
the plan, which will normally not exceed two times earnings. However, in year one of an individual’s participation in the
Plan it has been the practice of the Committee to apply a limit of up to three times salary, which was the limit applied 
for the 2003, 2004 and 2005 year one awards. Further, although the rules of the Plan refer to multiples of earnings, the
Committee has determined that awards will be restricted so as to replace the word “earnings” with “salary” . The options
may not normally be exercised earlier than three years or more than ten years after the date of grant, provided that any
performance conditions imposed have been fulfilled.
The vesting of options will normally be subject to stretching performance conditions which will be based upon a
combination of Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”), adjusted earnings per share growth (“EPS”) and operating profit,
depending on the employee’s position within the Group. The performance conditions will be tested after three years and
no re-testing will be permitted.
Vesting will be as follows:
• 25% of options subject to relative TSR-based conditions will vest if the Company’s three year TSR equals the TSR of a
specified index. Options will vest in full if the Company’s TSR exceeds that of the index by 10% per annum. For
performance between these levels, options will vest on a straight line sliding scale.
• 25% of options subject to absolute TSR-based conditions will vest if the Company’s three year TSR equals 7% per
annum. Options will vest in full if the Company’s three year TSR exceeds 17% per annum. For performance between
these levels, options will vest on a straight line sliding scale.
• 25% of options subject to EPS-based conditions will vest if the Company’s three year adjusted EPS growth equals RPI
plus 3% per annum. Options will vest in full if the Company’s adjusted EPS growth exceeds RPI plus 6% per annum. For
performance between these levels, options will vest on a straight line sliding scale.
• 25% of options subject to division operating profit conditions, aggregated over the three year performance period and
adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect the effect of any acquisitions or disposals will vest for budgeted operating profit
performance. Options will vest in full at a predetermined level of operating profit performance, which is set by the
Committee each year with reference to the budgeted level of performance and which is deemed to represent stretching
financial performance. For performance between these levels, options will vest on a straight line sliding scale.
These performance measures were chosen since the Committee believes that both TSR and EPS growth are closely
related to the interests of the Shareholders. EPS growth also provides a measure of Group financial performance, whilst
divisional operating profit provides a measure of financial performance for those individuals with responsibility for
specific divisions. The FTSE Small Cap Index excluding investment companies was the specified index for the awards in
2003 and the FTSE Support Services Index was the specified index in 2004 and 2005. In the opinion of the Committee
the FTSE Support Services Index was, at the time of grant, the most appropriate index against which to compare the TSR
of the Group since it includes companies operating in similar sectors.
It is the current intention of the Committee that no further awards will be made under the 2003 Executive Share Option
Scheme.
Grants under the plan were made to the Executive Directors, and other senior managers on 18th April 2005.
Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Group’s Savings Related Option Scheme.

73
On 15th February 2006 the Remuneration Committee approved a change to the rules of the 2003 Executive Share 
Option Scheme to allow participants to elect to receive the value of vesting share options by equity-settled SAR’s (Share
Appreciation Rights) instead of the full number of shares subject to option. The calculation of the fully diluted number of
shares will continue to be based on the full number of shares under option even though in practice only some of these
shares may be issued.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
A new long term incentive plan for executive directors and senior executives was introduced following shareholder
approval during the year. The plan is designed to reinforce the importance of management meeting the Group’s medium
term financial objectives in a way that will align their reward with shareholder returns. The Remuneration Committee will
periodically review the grant policy and the performance targets under the plan to ensure that they remain appropriate
for the Company.
The principal features of the Johnson Service Group 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan are as follows:
• With the exception of Mr. S. W. Graham, who will be granted an award to receive shares which are not subject to any
restriction, eligible employees selected to participate will be granted awards to receive a number of shares, a proportion
of which will be subject to restrictions as described below. The shares acquired in either case will have a value (at the
time of vesting) equal to the amount of the award specified at the date of grant which has vested.
• Vesting of the award will normally be subject to continued employment and the satisfaction of performance targets. 
A participant who receives restricted shares on the vesting of his award will, ordinarily, be required to retain 25% of 
the shares vested for a period of one year from the date of vesting and a further 25% of the shares vested for a period
of two years from the date of vesting.
• The maximum level of an award will be five times’ the annual salary of the eligible employee at the time of the award.
• The performance targets will be determined by the Remuneration Committee and, in normal circumstances, will have to
be satisfied over a performance period of three years. It is currently envisaged that 50% of each award will have a
performance target based on the annual compound growth in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of the Company over
the performance period and 50% will have a performance target based on a measurement of the Company’s total
shareholder return (TSR) over the performance period ranked against the TSR performance of the companies in the
FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts).
• The EPS target will be reviewed at the time of each award but, in respect of the initial awards, there will be no vesting
at all of the tranche of the award subject to the EPS target if the annual compound growth in the Company’s EPS over
the performance period is 5% or less. 100% of the tranche of the award will vest if the annual compound growth in EPS
is 13% or more with vesting on a sliding scale between these two points.
• The TSR target will be reviewed at the time of each award. However, in respect of the initial awards: if the Company is
ranked at or below the median the tranche of an award subject to the TSR target will not vest at all; if the Company is
ranked at or above the upper quartile all of the tranche of the award subject to the TSR target will vest; and if the
Company is ranked between the median and the upper quartile the tranche of the award subject to the TSR target will
vest on a pro-rata straight line basis between 0% and 100%.
• Where an award is to be satisfied by the transfer of shares, this may be done either by the transfer of shares from
treasury or by the transfer of shares purchased in the market by the Company’s employee share ownership plan trust.
Awards may not be satisfied by the issue of new shares.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Non-Executive Directors receive fees which are set by the Board and which are commensurate with their experience and
contribution to the Group. Non-Executive Directors do not participate in decisions regarding their own remuneration. They
do not participate in any of the Group’s pension, share option or performance related bonus schemes.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
In the event of termination, without cause, the Company has a contractual obligation to compensate the Director for the
unexpired period of his notice. The Company will seek to reduce this payment by means of the Director’s duty to mitigate
this payment wherever possible.
Executive Directors
Mr. S. W. Graham, Mr. J. H. Wilkinson, Mr. D. R. Toon and Mr. S. R. Moate are employed under service contracts, dated 22nd
April 2002, 28th September 2004, 16th December 2002 and 1st October 2002 (as amended on 22nd January 2003)
respectively, which provide that the Company has to give twelve months’ notice and the Director is required to give six
months’ notice.
The service contract of Mr. D. Bryant, dated 14th February 2003, provides for the period of notice to be given by both the
Company and the Director, to be twelve months. Mr. D. Bryant has given notice of his intention to retire from the Company
and the Board in October 2006.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors have fixed term appointments.
Each Non-Executive Director has a letter of appointment, dated as detailed below, which requires the Company to provide
three months’ notice and the Director is expected to provide at least one months’ notice. At 31st December 2005, the
unexpired terms of the Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment were:-
Date of Letter of Appointment Unexpired Term
S. P. Sherrard 8th December 2005 3 years
M. R. B. Gatenby 8th December 2005 2 years 9 months

PERFORMANCE GRAPH
Over the last five years to December 2005 the Group has
outperformed the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding Investment
Companies and the FTSE Support Services Index to give a net
total shareholder return of 120% against a net return of 16%
and a net decline of 25% for the respective Indices.
These indices have been selected for this comparison as, in
the opinion of the Directors, they represent the general and
specific sectors in which the Company operates.

A new long term incentive plan for executive directors and senior executives was introduced during the year. The principal
features are outlined on page 73.
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
Retirement benefits, which are calculated on basic salary, are accruing to the Executive Directors under one or more of
the Group's contributory defined benefit schemes or defined contribution scheme. 
Details of the schemes are given in note 24 on pages 45 to 48.
PENSION BENEFITS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Set out below are details of pension benefits to which each Executive Director, who served during the year, is entitled
under the Group’s defined benefit schemes.

The accrued pension entitlement shown is the amount that would be paid annually on retirement based on service to 31st
December 2005. This pension is calculated based on the total period of service to the Company, both before and after
becoming a director.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year end and that at the
previous year end.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement in respect of qualifying services represent the value of assets that the
pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the scheme’s liability in respect of 
the Director’s pension benefits that they earned for qualifying services. They do not represent sums payable to individual
Directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in the transfer value less Directors’ contributions is the increase in the transfer value of accrued benefits 
in respect of qualifying services during the year after deducting the Director’s personal contributions to the scheme.
Voluntary contributions paid by Directors and the resulting benefits are not shown.
With the exception of Mr. J. H. Wilkinson, who is a member of the Johnson Group Retirement Plan, a defined contribution
scheme, and Mr. D. R. Toon, who is a member of the Johnson Group Retirement Plan, a defined contribution scheme, 
the Johnson Group Staff Pension Scheme and the Semara Augmented Pension Plan, both defined benefit arrangements,
the remaining Directors are all members of the Johnson Group Staff Pension Scheme, a defined benefit arrangement.

Set out below is the benefit structure applicable under the pension arrangements for each Director:
The accrual rate for Mr. S. W. Graham is 1/30th for each year of pensionable service, based on one-half of salary, subject
to the Earnings Cap (the “Cap”), which is currently £105,600. For the period prior to 31st March 2004, employee
contributions were 8% of one-half of salary subject to the Cap. With effect from 1st April 2004, Mr. S. W. Graham’s
employee contributions were increased to 12% of one-half of salary subject to the Cap. Mr. S. W. Graham’s normal
retirement age was reduced to 60 on 1st June 2005;
Prior to 31st March 2004, the accrual rate for Mr. D. Bryant was such that a pension of two thirds salary would be payable 
at age 63, previously his normal retirement age, which equated to an accrual rate of 1/58th for each year of pensionable
service since 1st December 2000 and 1/60th for each year of pensionable service prior to that date. For service from 
1st April 2004, the accrual rate has been changed to 1/60th for each year of pensionable service. Mr. D. Bryant is not
subject to the Cap. For the period prior to 31st March 2004 employee contributions were 4% of salary and increased to
5% with effect from 1st April 2004. Mr. D. Bryant’s normal retirement age was reduced to age 60 on 1st June 2005. A 15%
reduction will be applied to those benefits arising out of pensionable service accrued as on and from 1st April 2004 up to
and including 31st May 2005 where Mr. D. Bryant retires at normal retirement age. An actuarial reduction will be applied
on early retirement before 60 for all service;
Mr. D. R. Toon is a member of both the Johnson Group Staff Pension Scheme and the Semara Augmented Pension Plan. 
Prior to 31st March 2004 the accrual rate under these arrangements was such that a pension of two thirds salary, 
which is subject to the Cap, would be payable at age 65, previously his normal retirement age. This equated to accrual
rates of 1/60th and 1/397th under the Johnson Group Staff Pension Scheme and the Semara Augmented Pension Plan,
respectively. With effect from 1st April 2004, the accrual rate under the Johnson Group Staff Pension Scheme has
changed to 1/80th. Employee contribution rates, effective from 1st October 2004, are 6% of salary subject to the Cap. 
Mr D. R. Toon’s normal retirement age was reduced to age 60 on 1st June 2005. A 25% reduction will be applied to those
benefits arising out of pensionable service accrued as on and from 1st April 2004 up to and including 31st May 2005
where Mr D. R. Toon retires at normal retirement age. An actuarial reduction will be applied on early retirement before
age 60 for all service. With effect from 1st April 2004, the Company also pays £15,000 per annum into the Johnson Group
Retirement Plan for Mr. D. R. Toon;
The accrual rate for Mr. S. R. Moate is 1/60th for each year of pensionable service prior to 1st April 2003 and 1/80th
thereafter. Benefits are subject to the Cap. Employee contribution rates, effective from 1st October 2003, are 6% of salary
subject to the Cap. Mr. S. R. Moate’s normal retirement age was reduced to age 60 on 1st June 2005. A 25% reduction will
be applied to those benefits arising out of pensionable service accrued as on and from 1st April 2003 up to and including
31st May 2005 where Mr. S. R. Moate retires at normal retirement age. An actuarial reduction will be applied on early
retirement before age 60 for all service;
Mr. J. H. Wilkinson is a member of the Johnson Group Retirement Plan. The employee contribution rate, chosen by 
Mr. J. H. Wilkinson, is 7% of salary subject to the Cap. The corresponding Company contribution rate is 14% of salary
subject to the Cap. Mr. J. H. Wilkinson’s normal retirement age was reduced to age 60 on 1st June 2005.
Other provisions of the Johnson Group Staff Pension Scheme which are applicable to all members of the scheme include: 
a spouse’s pension at the rate of 50% of the member’s pension payable on the death of the member; pensions accrued in
respect of service prior to 6th April 1997 are guaranteed to increase at the rate of 3% per annum on the excess over the
member’s Guaranteed Minimum Pension; pensions accrued in respect of service after 5th April 1997 will increase at the
rate of 5% per annum, or the increase in the Retail Price Index, if lower, with a guaranteed minimum of 3% per annum.
For Mr. S. W. Graham, Mr. D. Bryant and Mr. D. R. Toon, the 3% per annum minimum guarantee is not applicable to
pensions accrued in respect of service after 1st April 2004. For all other members the minimum guarantee is not
applicable to pensions accrued in respect of service after 1st April 2003.

Auditors’ Report
Independent Auditors’ report to the members of Johnson Service Group PLC
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’) of Johnson Service
Group PLC for the period ended 31st December 2005, which comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, the
Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Total
Recognised Gains and Losses, the Consolidated Historical Cost Profits and Losses and the related notes. These financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the
Board Report on Remuneration that is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Board Report on Remuneration and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Board Report on Remuneration to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the Board Report on Remuneration to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the
financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of
the 2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we
report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks
and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited 
financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the unaudited part of the Board Report
on Remuneration, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Financial Review and the Corporate
Governance Statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information.

BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements and the part of the Board Report on Remuneration to be audited. It also includes an assessment of
the significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of
the Board Report on Remuneration to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in
the financial statements and the part of the Board Report on Remuneration to be audited.
OPINION
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice, of the state of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31st December 2005 and of the Group’s
profit and cash flows for the period then ended; and
• the financial statements and the part of the Board Report on Remuneration to be audited have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

All Shareholders will find enclosed with this document a form of proxy to be used in connection with the AGM.

JSG028_AR_2005 p62-end  30/3/06  09:33  Page 84 NOTES
1) The form of proxy is enclosed. The form of proxy and power of attorney or other authority, if any, under which it 
is signed or a notarially certified copy of such power of authority must be received by the Company’s registrars,
Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4BR not later than 48 hours prior to
the commencement of the Annual General Meeting. Completion of the form will not prevent you from attending
and voting at the meeting instead of the proxy, if you wish.
2) CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the proxy voting service may do so for the
meeting (and any adjournment thereof) by following the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST
Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members (and those CREST members who have appointed a voting
service provider) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider, who will be able to make the
appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST
Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s specifications and must contain
the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message (regardless of
whether it relates to the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction given to a previously
appointed proxy) must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID “RA10”) 
by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in, or in a note to, the notice of meeting. For this
purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message
by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST
in the manner prescribed by CREST.
CREST members (and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers) should note that
CRESTCo does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings
and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of
the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored
member or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider
takes) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system 
by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members (and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting
service providers) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations
of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) 
of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
3) The following documents will be available for inspection at the Registered Office of the Company during normal
business hours on any business day from the date of this Notice until the close of the meeting and at the place 
of the meeting for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting: 
3.1) the Register of Directors’ interests kept by the Company under Section 325 of the Companies Act 1985; 
3.2) copies of all service contracts between the Directors and the Company together with other appropriate
documentation; and 
3.3) copies of the terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors.
4) Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that only
those shareholders registered in the Register of Members of the Company as at 6.00pm on 9th May 2006, or in
the event that the Meeting is adjourned, in the Register of Members 48 hours before the time of any adjourned
meeting, shall be entitled to attend or vote at the Meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their
name at the relevant time. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after 6.00pm on 9th May 2006 or, in 
the event that the Meeting is adjourned, less than 48 hours before the time of any adjourned meeting, shall be
disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the Meeting.
5) In accordance with the Companies Act 1985, directors of listed companies are required to prepare a remuneration
report which must be approved by the members of the Company at the meeting at which the Company’s annual
accounts are to be laid. Therefore, it is proposed that the Board Report on Remuneration for the financial year
ended 31st December 2005, as set out on pages 71 to 80 of the Company’s Annual Report, be approved.

Annual Report.
7) Explanation of Special Business
7.1) Renewal of Directors’ authority to allot shares and disapplication of pre-emption rights
At the Annual General Meeting held on 11th May 2005 the Directors were empowered to allot shares and, in
certain circumstances, to allot shares for cash otherwise than pro rata to existing shareholdings. Resolutions 
9 and 10 seek approval for the renewal of such authorities.
Resolution 9 seeks approval for the renewal of the Directors’ authority to allot relevant securities in
accordance with Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985. The authority will be limited to an aggregate nominal
value of £2,276,958 of Ordinary shares which represents approximately 38.7% of the Ordinary share capital in
issue at the date of this Notice. This limit comprises a number of Ordinary shares equivalent to approximately
one third of the Ordinary shares in issue as at 13th March 2006 plus a further number of Ordinary Shares set 
aside for issue on the exercise of outstanding share options, and is calculated in accordance with generally
accepted guidelines.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority. This resolution will be proposed as an
Ordinary Resolution.
Resolution 10 seeks approval for the renewal of the Directors’ power to allot equity securities for cash other
than by way of a rights issue or other offer to Shareholders or for the purpose of the Group’s share option
schemes. If approved, Resolution 10 will authorise the Directors to issue shares in connection with a rights
issue and otherwise to issue shares for cash up to a nominal amount of £294,256 which includes the sale on a
non pre-emptive basis of any shares the Company holds in treasury for cash. The £294,256 nominal amount
of equity securities to which this authority relates represents approximately 5% of the issued share capital of
the Company as at 13th March 2006.
The authority given under Resolutions 9 and 10 will lapse at the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting of the Company.
The renewal of the authority to allot shares in the Company will enable your Board to take full advantage of
any business or financing opportunities which may arise in the future. Your Board also considers it desirable
that the Company should, in certain circumstances, have the ability to issue shares for cash other than on a
pro rata basis.
7.2) Renewal of Company’s authority to purchase Ordinary shares
A Special Resolution (numbered 11) will be proposed to seek renewal of the authority for the Company to make
market purchases of up to 5,885,122 Ordinary shares, representing 10% of the Company’s issued Ordinary
share capital as at 13th March 2006.
The price paid for shares will not be less than the nominal value of 10p per share nor more than 5% above 
the average of the middle-market quotation of the Company’s ordinary shares as derived from the London
Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the
shares are purchased.
The authority given under this Resolution will lapse, unless renewed, at the conclusion of the next Annual
General Meeting of the Company. It is the present intention of the Directors to seek renewal of this authority
annually. The Directors have no present intention of purchasing Ordinary shares in the market.
Renewing the authority for the Company to purchase Ordinary shares in the market will allow your Board to
take advantage of any opportunities that may arise to increase Shareholder value.
JSG028_AR_2005 p62-end  30/3/06  09:33  Page 86 The power given by this Resolution will only be exercised if the Directors are satisfied that any purchase will
increase the earnings per share of the Ordinary share capital in issue after the purchase and, accordingly, that
the purchase is in the interests of Shareholders. The Directors will also give careful consideration to gearing
levels of the Company and its general financial position. The purchase price would be paid out of distributable
profits. The total number of options to subscribe for Ordinary shares that were outstanding at 13th March
2006 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice) was 4,925,515. The proportion of
issued share capital that they represented at that time was 8.4 per cent and the proportion of issued share
capital that they will represent if the full authority to purchase shares (existing and being sought) is used is
9.3 per cent. With effect from 1st December 2003 the Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury
Shares) Regulations 2003 (the “Regulations”) enables certain listed companies to hold shares in treasury as
an alternative to cancelling them following a purchase of own shares by the company in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.
Shares held in treasury may subsequently be cancelled, sold for cash or used to satisfy share options and
share awards under the Company’s Employees’ Share Schemes.
Once held in treasury, the Company is not entitled to exercise any rights, including the right to attend and
vote at meetings in respect of shares. Further, no dividend or other distribution of the Company’s assets may
be made to the Company in respect of the treasury shares.
If the Directors exercise the authority conferred by Resolution 11, they will consider holding those shares in
treasury, rather than cancelling them. The Directors believe that holding shares in treasury would provide the
Company with greater flexibility in the management of its share capital.
Although none of the investor groups has yet issued any guidelines in relation to the purchase, holding or
resale of treasury shares, your Board will have regard to any such guidelines which may be in force at the time
of any such purchase, holding or re-sale of treasury shares.
7.3) Voting
Your Directors consider the passing of Resolutions 9, 10 and 11 to be in the best interests of the Company and
its Shareholders and accordingly recommend that you vote in favour of these Resolutions as they intend to do
in respect of their own shareholdings.

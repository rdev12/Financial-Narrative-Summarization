Chairman’ s statement
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
We have continued to demonstrate the
strength of our business model and to create
value for shareholders.
Simon Robertson Chairman
10885 R&A 2005 actual  15/3/06  07:55  Page 04 Having completed my ﬁrst 12 months as
Chairman, I am delighted to be able to report
another year of strong progress for the Group.
We have continued to demonstrate the
strength of our business model and to create
value for shareholders.
Our ﬁnancial results for 2005 reﬂect the
value of past investment and of the Group’s
consistent strategy. Underlying proﬁts rose by 
49 per cent, earnings per share by 55 per cent
and debt levels were signiﬁcantly reduced.
We are therefore proposing an increase in the
payment to shareholders.
Rolls-Royce is continuing to invest in 
new technologies, products and programmes.
The long-term nature of these investments 
and the increasing numbers of our engines in
service should enable the Group to generate
growth and improving returns over many years.
The Group attaches a particular priority to
the environment by investing in technologies
which minimise the environmental impact of
our operations and products.
We also take seriously our obligations to all
our stakeholders as we believe that excellence
in corporate responsibility delivers competitive
advantage and long-term success.
There have been a number of Board
changes over the year. After nearly 40 years 
with the Group, Mike Howse retired from the
Board in June as Director of Engineering and
Technology and has been succeeded by 
Colin Smith. I would like to thank Mike for 
the outstanding contribution he has made.
Colin Smith has been with the Group for over
30 years and brings to the Board a similar
wealth of engineering expertise.
We announced in January of this year that 
Colin Green is to retire from the Group and 
the Board in April. Again, I would like to thank
Colin for the huge contribution he has made 
to the Company and to the aerospace industry,
which was publicly recognised last year when
he received a well deserved CBE.
As foreshadowed in last year’s report, Iain
Conn has joined the Board as a non-executive
director and has brought to our discussions 
his extensive international business experience.
I would like to thank the management 
and all our employees very much for another
successful year.Their commitment has been
outstanding. I should also pay tribute to my
fellow directors for the considerable contribution
they have made in support of the Group.
Our past investments have enabled us to
build strong positions in markets which offer
long-term growth.Looking forward, we continue
to lay the foundations for long-term success
and value creation in a demanding international
business environment. I expect the Group 
to continue to make progress in 2006, as the
returns from past investments grow while 
we continue to invest in new technologies 
and products.

Chief Executive’ s review
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
Rolls-Royce continued to make 
good ﬁnancial progress in 2005.
Sir John Rose Chief Executive
10885 R&A 2005 actual  15/3/06  07:56  Page 06 07
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
Rolls-Royce continued to make good ﬁnancial
progress in 2005, with a substantial increase in
our proﬁtability and cash ﬂow. By cutting costs
and working more efﬁciently, we were able to
counter the impact of higher commodity prices
and an adverse trend in our achieved US dollar
exchange rate. It was good to see the results
reﬂected in a rising share price.
We continue to grow organically and 
our sales increased in 2005 by 11 per cent to
£6,603 million, with growth achieved in each 
of the Group’s market sectors. Our underlying
proﬁt, on a like-for-like basis, increased by 49 per
cent and a strong cash inﬂow of £552 million
resulted in positive net funds of £335 million on
the balance sheet at the year-end.Average net
debt was reduced by a further 59 per cent,
to £260 million.
Underlying earnings per share rose 55 per
cent to 24.14p and basic earnings per share 
rose 29 per cent to 20.11p. A ﬁnal payment to
shareholders has been proposed of 5.38p per
share, making a total payment for the year of
8.72p per share, a 6.6 per cent increase
compared to the payment in 2004.
We attach great importance to minimising
the impact on our ﬁnances of volatility in the
global currency markets.We continued in 2005
to pursue our strategy of hedging future net
dollar revenues and at the end of the year we
had approximately US$10.5 billion of forward
cover, at an average exchange rate of 
1.67 dollars to the pound.The achieved rate in
2005 deteriorated by four cents relative to 2004.
We will use this hedge book – in conjunction
with cost-reduction initiatives and further
‘dollarisation’of our cost base – to manage 
our future foreign exchange exposure.
We believe it desirable to continue to increase
the strength of the balance sheet, reﬂecting the
long-term nature of the business.This will also
stand us in good stead as we manage pension
obligations over the coming years.
New orders in 2005 reached a record level
of £11.3 billion, and brought the year-end ﬁrm
order book to a record £22.9 billion, an increase
of 21 per cent over 2004.Over the past ten years,
the order book has grown at an annual
compound rate of 14 per cent. Over the past
ﬁve years, Asia has been a signiﬁcant source 
of new business and it now represents 
33 per cent of the order book.
Progress in Asia
Growth in Asia is prompting more air travel,
both for business and for pleasure, increasing
the energy requirements to support industrial
development and larger numbers of afﬂuent
homes. It is stimulating investment in oil and
gas exploration and transmission and it is
boosting orders for marine propulsion systems
from Asia’s ship building industries, now the
largest and fastest growing in the world.
These are all target markets for Rolls-Royce 
and we are beneﬁting accordingly.In 2005 
sales to the region increased by 18 per cent 
and the order book for the region increased 
by 70 per cent.
Our physical presence in Asia is also
growing.We incorporated a new subsidiary 
in Bangalore, in order to expand engineering
capacity over a range of new programmes.
We established a joint venture in Singapore,
to develop a commercially viable power system
based on solid oxide fuel cell technology.
We opened a new marine factory in Shanghai,
from which the Group’s £300 million turnover
merchant business will be managed. And we
established new sources of supply in markets
such as China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore
and Taiwan.
All this added to the increasingly international
nature of the Group.Today 40 per cent of our
employees work outside the UK, 87 per cent 
of our sales are to destinations outside the UK
and we have ofﬁces, manufacturing and locally-
supported service facilities in 50 countries.
Priorities
We focused on three priority areas in 2005.
– Investment in technology and products
Acquisition of new technologies is
conducted very methodically.We aim to
have ‘on-the-shelf’innovations ready to
incorporate into our next generation of
products, whilst at the same time exploring
what might be possible further into the
future.We see no shortage of market
opportunities and expect the level of 
self-funded investment in our research 
and development work to remain at
approximately ﬁve per cent of Group sales.
The impact of this investment on our
income in any one year will reﬂect the mix
and maturity of our current development
programmes. During 2005 we launched 
a number of new programmes, notably 
the Trent 1700 for the Airbus A350 and 
the Avon 200, an upgrade of the existing 
Avon engine that has been so successful 
in the energy sector.

Chief Executive’ s review continued
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
– Operational and unit cost reduction
We made further progress in improving
efﬁciency, thereby offsetting the impact 
of higher commodity prices by cutting
costs.We achieved this by increasing
productivity in our plants, managing 
our supply chain better and buying more 
from low-cost sources.Where we had 
to carry higher inventories to facilitate 
our factory-modernisation programme,
we more than offset their ﬁnancial impact
through a rigorous management of our
working capital. Importantly, more efﬁcient
working practices were implemented as 
a pre-condition for new factory investment.
A signiﬁcantly higher work load, particularly
in relation to our civil aerospace engines,
has challenged the ability of our supply
chain to match our needs and this remains
an area for attention.
– Continued development of 
aftermarket services
Aftermarket service revenues, including 
100 per cent of our repair and overhaul
joint ventures, increased by 12 per cent in
2005 and have grown at 11 per cent per
annum compound over the past ten years.
Services now represent 54 per cent of our
revenues.This is a consequence of the
successful broadening of the Group’s product
range, the steady increase in the number of
our engines in service and the investment
we have made in a comprehensive range
of aftermarket-service capabilities.
Increasingly, we are taking responsibility
for the maintenance of our engines and
systems under long-term service agreements.
This aligns our commercial interests closely
with those of our customers, and maximises
the value that our skills and assets can 
add. During 2005 a number of innovative
service agreements were announced 
in each of the Group’s business sectors.
Technology and the environment 
We continued to pay particular attention 
in 2005 to the environmental impact of our
products and of our manufacturing operations.
In civil aerospace, our strategy is to seek to
maintain the beneﬁts to society of the growth
in air travel, whilst helping to rein back as 
much as possible the negative consequences 
of air travel for the global environment.We are
accordingly pursuing new technologies that
should enable us to meet a series of highly
demanding environmental targets, described 
in more detail on pages 36 and 37.
We will succeed in this because our
engineers and scientists have the skills and
dedication to tackle some daunting technical
challenges.Their talents are a timely reminder 
of the importance of attracting gifted
individuals to a career in the sciences. As a
Group, we are increasingly impressed by the
commitment to science teaching in many
countries, especially in Asia.The picture in the
UK, though, is very different with increasing
evidence that young people’s enthusiasm 
for the physical sciences is in decline.
To help address this issue, in 2004 we
introduced the Rolls-Royce Science Prize. It has
been designed to reward imaginative science-
teaching projects in the classrooms of the UK
and Ireland each year, across all ages.
It offers substantial cash awards for the
winning entrants. It gathered momentum
encouragingly in 2005, with a 55 per cent
increase in the number of schools taking part 
in the prize as compared with its inaugural year.
Community
The Group’s other community activities in 
2005 were far ranging.They involved the active
participation and generosity of our employees.
This was notably true of our response to the 
sad consequences of both the tsunami that
struck in the Indian Ocean just before the start
of the year and the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes
that swept across the southern US in
September. Employees added over £250,000 
of their own money to our corporate donations
of £500,000 for recovery projects in Asia.
Several of these were supported by Rolls-Royce
managers and engineers based in the region.
In the US, where three sites with 136 employees
were directly affected, Group assistance was
similarly backed up by generous support from
Rolls-Royce colleagues.
We received a Gold Award from the UK
Institute of Fundraising in 2005 for our Payroll
Giving Scheme.This provides and pays for the
administration of employees’donations to
charity, enabling them to be made regularly 
and in a tax-efﬁcient way. Employees last year
gave in excess of £396,000 to charities of their
own choosing.
Employees
Our contribution to community activities
reﬂects a strong corporate culture that 
remains one of the Group’s most valuable
assets. It owes much to the unusually long
average tenure of our employees, many of
whom spend their entire careers with 
Rolls-Royce. It is therefore especially pleasing
that the rise in our share price will beneﬁt a
broad constituency of shareholders within 
the company, with a signiﬁcant number of our
employees participating in ‘sharesave’schemes
and a large number owning shares directly.
A consistent strategy ,built around ﬁve objectives
All four of our market sectors are characterised
by strong demand trends that stretch well 
into the future. Our business strategy is built
around ﬁve key objectives:
Address four global markets 
We are a leading power-systems company,
operating in the civil and defence aerospace,
marine and energy markets.We manufacture 
in 20 countries and serve customers in 
150 countries.
Invest in technology,
capability and infrastructure
Over the past ﬁve years we have invested
more than £3 billion in research and
development.We invest on average £30 million
annually on training,and the Group invests 
£200 – £300 million every year in capital projects.
10885 R&A 2005 actual  15/3/06  07:56  Page 08 09
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
Our improved ﬁnancial performance has 
also meant that, for the ﬁrst time in many 
years, executive share options have vested.
The vesting of this component of executive
remuneration is tied to performance criteria
designed with a view to securing and
rewarding long-term success. It is worth 
noting that our executive directors all 
own, either directly or in trust, substantial
shareholdings in Rolls-Royce.This demonstrates
their commitment to the Group, and has the
added beneﬁt of aligning their personal
interests with those of all other shareholders.
Future prospects
Rolls-Royce is addressing four long-term growth
markets.Their aggregate demand for engines
and services over the next 20 years is estimated
to be worth approximately two trillion dollars.
The Group’s consistent investment in
technology and in new products and services
enables us to respond effectively to new
developments, creating opportunities for
organic growth in each of the four markets.
In civil aerospace, we see the market
continuing to recover from the recession that
began at the start of this decade, the impact of
which was exacerbated by the events of 9/11,
SARS and the Gulf War.We expect to beneﬁt
further from this recovery.The number of 
Rolls-Royce jet engines in service is increasing
and ﬂying hours across our ﬂeet are
accumulating steadily.This growth, combined
with our broadening of the services we make
available, is expected to lead to a steady
increase in our service revenues.
In defence aerospace, we have developed a
broad product portfolio that addresses all of the
major market sectors, from combat and trainer
aircraft to transport and tactical aircraft and
helicopters. Our mix of mature programmes,
new production programmes, development
programmes and service revenues is expected
to enable the Group to make good progress in
spite of the volatility that may be experienced
on individual programmes, as exempliﬁed by
the uncertainties surrounding the alternate
engine for the Joint Strike Fighter in the wake 
of the US Quadrennial Defense Review.
Our marine business is beneﬁting from its
broad access to naval and commercial markets.
Here again, we are bringing new products to
market, from gas turbines such as the MT30 
to rim-driven tunnel thrusters, which we believe
are likely to have a major impact on marine
propulsion systems. Boosted by the rise in oil
and gas prices, the commercial offshore market
remains very strong – and we are conﬁdent 
that we can continue to capture a good share
of the available business.
Our energy business is strengthening its
presence in emerging oil and gas markets and
is well positioned to secure a growing share 
of the power-generation market. Its proﬁtability
will be constrained for some time by the
investments it is making in new technology –
including the development of solid-oxide fuel
cell systems.
In aggregate, we are expecting continued
progress in 2006, underpinned by the rising
order book, the growth in service revenues 
and sustained cost reduction. As a result,
though we see no likelihood of any reduction 
in competitive intensity in our markets, we do
expect increased proﬁts and a positive cash
ﬂow for the year.
The proposed increase in the payment to
shareholders for 2005 represents an increase

Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
Highlights of the year
Orders for 246 Trent engines worth
approximately US$3 billion were announced.
The Airbus A380, powered by the Trent 900
engine, made a successful maiden ﬂight and
good progress through its comprehensive 
ﬂight-test programme.
Agreement was reached with Airbus for 
Rolls-Royce to supply the Trent 1700 to 
power the new A350 airliner.
The 1,000th BR710 engine was delivered to
Gulfstream to power its G550 long-range
business jet.
International Aero Engines (IAE) achieved 
a record order intake of approximately 
600 engines worth over US$1.5 billion to 
Rolls-Royce.
Rolls-Royce has established a strong market
position in civil aerospace through its portfolio
of competitive aero engines, powering a broad
range of aircraft from corporate jets to the
largest airliners.
We made good progress with the
development of our product range.The 
Trent 900 engine powered the Airbus A380 
on its maiden ﬂight and has now accumulated 
4,000 hours of ﬂying experience.The ﬁrst 
Trent 1000 engine build, for the Boeing 787,
was commenced on schedule in November
and the Trent 1700 became the sixth member
of the Trent engine family, following its selection 
by Airbus to power the A350.The Trent family
celebrated the tenth anniversary of its entry into
service and passed the milestone of 15 million
ﬂying hours during the year.
We extended our links with Japanese
industry on the Trent 1000 programme by
selecting Sumitomo Precision Products to
supply the heat management system for the
engine. Carlton, the US forging and machining
specialist, also became a risk and revenue
sharing partner on the Trent 1000 engine.
International Aero Engines (IAE), in which
Rolls-Royce is a principal shareholder, took an
increasing share of the strong single-aisle market,
with a record order intake of approximately 600
engines worth over US$1.5 billion to Rolls-Royce.
This included signiﬁcant success in the rapidly
growing Indian low-cost airline market where
the V2500 engine was selected by a number 
of new operators.
IAE also launched V2500Select
SM
, a combined
engine upgrade and aftermarket service
programme, which improves fuel burn, reduces
operating costs and offers time-on-wing
improvements.By the end of 2005, contracts for
aftermarket-service agreements with IAE were
covering almost 1,000 engines.
Civil engine deliveries increased by seven
per cent, to 881, reﬂecting strong growth in
V2500 deliveries and continuing recovery in the
corporate jet market, partially offset by a decline
in regional airline engine deliveries.While the
decline in regional deliveries is expected to
continue, the Group expects total civil engine
deliveries to grow in 2006 as the Trent 900
enters service,V2500 deliveries increase and 
the corporate sector remains strong.
The Rolls-Royce civil ﬂeet ﬂying hours
increased by 11 per cent compared to 2004 
as a result of a combination of world trafﬁc
growth and increased ﬂeet size.
The installed base of civil jet engines 
grew to 11,500.This provides a signiﬁcant
aftermarket-services opportunity, which the
Group is addressing with innovative long-term
service arrangements for its customers.
TotalCare contracts worth more than 
US$13 billion have now been signed,
covering 80 per cent of new customers since
2001.The Group achieved record growth for 
its CorporateCare programme, signing 90
contracts in 2005. TotalCare contracts covered
77 per cent of all the engines ordered in 2005.
Services sales increased by 14 per cent 
to £2.1 billion, representing 59 per cent of 
civil aerospace sales.We expect services sales 
to continue growing at a double-digit rate.

The Group’s defence aerospace business 
is broadly based, with a strong portfolio of
products and services covering the key defence
aerospace market sectors.This enables the
Group to make good progress in spite of the
volatility that may be experienced on individual
programmes, as exempliﬁed by the uncertainties
surrounding the alternate engine for the Joint
Strike Fighter, following the recent US
Quadrennial Defense Review.
In 2005, Rolls-Royce continued to develop
its range of engine programmes and customer
services. More than 3,000 hours of testing
were completed on the LiftFan® system for 
the US DoD’s Joint Strike Fighter programme.
In December, an agreement was signed 
by the governments of the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia and the UK, under which the 
Royal Saudi Air Force will acquire Euroﬁghter

A new marine facility in Shanghai was 
formally opened.
The Rolls-Royce marine business is a global
leader in marine propulsion, engineering and
hydrodynamics expertise, with a broad product
range and a full systems-integration capability.
In 2005, the marine business made good
progress, with higher sales and higher proﬁt.
The recovery of the offshore oil and gas support
market continued and Rolls-Royce secured a
good share of the available business.The 500th
order was placed for a Rolls-Royce UT-Design
vessel, one of the most successful designs in 
the history of commercial shipping. UT-Design
ships are sold as complete systems and are
ﬁtted with a range of Rolls-Royce equipment.
The Group is developing rim-driven 
tunnel-thruster technology, which is likely to
have a major impact on marine propulsion 
in the future.The ﬁrst thrusters are to be 
ﬁtted to an offshore support vessel but the
technology will also be suitable for merchant
and cruise ships.
Asia’s ship building accounts for nearly 
80 per cent of the world’s commercial ship
construction. During 2005 Rolls-Royce
expanded its presence in Asia, opening a new
factory in Shanghai, which, together with our
existing factory in Korea, creates a north-east
Asian production hub.
In the naval market sector, Rolls-Royce achieved
a major development milestone when the MT30
gas turbine was awarded American Bureau of
Shipping certiﬁcation. In February 2005, the ﬁrst
MT30 marine gas turbine generator set was
delivered to the US Navy to power land-based
test runs for the DD(X) destroyer.
Lockheed Martin installed two MT30 gas
turbines on the ﬁrst prototype Littoral Combat
Ship for the US Navy.These gas turbines are the
largest ever installed on a naval ship.
The Group is working with the US Navy as
prime contractor on the advanced electric ship
demonstrator project that will be the proving
ground for the Rolls-Royce AWJ-21 waterjet,
the next generation of naval waterjet.
In 2005, 40 per cent of marine sales were
derived from services and support activities.
The Group announced a £137 million long-term
service and support contract for Olympus and
Tyne engines that power 27 ships in service
with the Royal Navy and the French, Belgian and
Royal Netherlands navies.

Highlights of the year
The ﬁrst 12 industrial RB211-based compression
packages were installed and commissioned 
for the West-East Pipeline Project in China,
four months ahead of schedule. An additional
three gas turbine units were ordered for the
expansion of the pipeline’s capacity.
Six industrial Trent-based compression 
packages were delivered to Qatar for the 
Middle East Dolphin project.This is the ﬁrst
mechanical drive application of the Trent 60,
the most powerful and efﬁcient aero-derived
gas turbine on the market.
Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority chose
two Trent 60 power-generation sets for the
latest phase of the Wasit power-plant
expansion, and the ﬁrst Trent 60 for Asia was
ordered by a major electricity producer in
Yinchuan, China.
Ten RB211 industrial gas turbine power-
generation units were ordered to provide
electrical power for f ﬂoating production, storage
and ofﬂoading vessels operated by Total off the
coast of Nigeria and by Petrobras, off the coast
of Brazil.
The 500th industrial RB211 was shipped from
the Rolls-Royce assembly and test facility in
Montreal.
A joint venture was established with a
Singaporean consortium to continue
development work on solid-oxide fuel 
cell technology.
The Rolls-Royce energy business supplies a wide
range of gas turbine packages to the worldwide
oil & gas and power-generation markets, with
more than 4,000 industrial gas turbines sold and
over 140 million hours of operating experience.
The ﬁnancial results for 2005 reﬂect a
strong performance by the oil & gas business,
offset by the slow recovery of the power-
generation market and continued investment 
in new product technologies.
In oil & gas, we continued to strengthen 
our presence in emerging markets, winning
orders worth over US$120 million for projects in
West Africa, over US$100 million from customers 
in Asia, and over US$70 million for gas turbine
packages for Brazil.
The international power-generation market
has shown signs of recovery and the Group
won important new orders for the industrial
Trent in the United Arab Emirates and China.
In 2005, the Group continued to invest 
in its fuel cell technology. Rolls-Royce and the
Singaporean consortium, Enertek Singapore 
Pte Ltd, will between them invest a further
US$100 million in the project. In addition,
Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems Limited opened 
a new Rolls-Royce facility in the UK that will pilot
the production of ceramic components for use 
in fuel cell systems.This business is developing
solid-oxide fuel cell systems for megawatt-scale,
stationary power-generation applications 
with the goal of introducing a competitive
product this decade.
The services sector enjoyed a record order
intake in 2005 and contributed 38 per cent 
of energy sector sales. Strong growth in 
long-term service agreements was maintained,
with a further £93 million of business secured
during the year.This brings the backlog of
energy business long-term service agreements
to £220 million.

Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
The ability to innovate is at the heart of 
our business and is the means by which we
maintain our world-class position.We continue
to invest signiﬁcant amounts in research and
development.These deliver new and improved
technology, lower costs and better aftermarket
services, on new and existing products across
their lifecycle.
In 2005 we invested £663 million (gross) 
in research and development, an increase of 
10 per cent on 2004.The net charge to the
income statement was £282 million.
The markets in which we operate are
exceptionally challenging.Customer expectations
are increasing, which combined with growing
environmental pressures, causes us to drive our
technology forward.
In 2005 we made signiﬁcant technological
strides towards meeting the environmental
challenge. One example is the completion of 
a 30-hour test programme in May for the ANTLE
engine, successfully demonstrating a number 
of environmentally friendly technologies in a
European collaborative project.The demonstrated
technologies from ANTLE will be rolled out
across our products in the coming years.
We have continued the product development
of the high efﬁciency solid-oxide fuel cell
programme for the energy business, with a
number of successful rig tests forming the
building blocks for sub-assembly demonstration
in 2006.
For some years our University Technology
Centre network has been key to our research
work. In 2005 we further strengthened this
global network by opening two new centres – 
one in Cottbus, Germany, researching structural
mechanics and vibration, and the other in
Trondheim,Norway,covering ship performance.
Amongst our many research achievements,
we ﬁled a record 306 patent applications.
We have continued to develop our
engineering tools for use on all our projects.
One key aspect to this work has been the
progressive rollout of Product Lifecycle
Management (PLM), a computer-system tool
that signiﬁcantly increases our design capabilities
and then enables us to manage data cost
effectively throughout the product lifecycle.
We have continued to build on the 
success of the Trent family.The Trent 900 is
gaining maturity during the intensive Airbus
A380 ﬂight-test period and the Trent 1000 for
the Boeing 787 is progressing towards its
engine-test programme.
Our marine business saw the Trent 800-derived
MT30 running in the land-based DD(X)
demonstrator and a novel 50kW rim-driven
tunnel thruster, which we believe will have a
major impact on marine propulsion systems.
In the defence aerospace sector, the 
multi-partner TP400 engine for the Airbus
A400M made a successful ﬁrst run in October.
Excellent progress continues to be made on 
our Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programmes with
the LiftFan® being developed to support the
ﬁrst STOVL aircraft ﬂight in 2007 and the
completion of the successful F136 concept-
demonstrator phase leading to the award in
August of the System Development and
Demonstration contract worth around 
US$1 billion to Rolls-Royce.
In 2006, we will continue to build on our
proven strategy of  ‘invest once and use many
times’at both the technology and product level.

Our loading increased by 17 per cent over 2004.
Within this total, UK load increased whilst US
load fell as the mix shifted away from regional
jet engines towards smaller helicopter engines.
Operationally the year was signiﬁcantly
affected by raw material supply issues.
The speciality metals industry struggled to 
meet our increased demand, which gave rise 
to some delivery disruption during the year.
Notwithstanding this, we delivered a creditable
result. As usual, I take this opportunity to thank
all our employees and suppliers for their efforts
in 2005 in this regard.
We made good progress in 2005 on our
programme to restructure our supply chain.
Our supplier base was reduced by 13 to 698
even though we added 38 new suppliers. Our
sourcing in emerging low-cost markets
increased from six per cent to nine per cent of
purchases. Our newest civil aerospace product,
the Trent 1000, was launched with an external
supply chain of only 71 suppliers.
The prices of metals and of fuel rose
throughout the year and closed at, or close to,
new highs. We are accustomed to managing
this through long-term supplier relationships
that reduce volatility, together with long-term
positions in the metals market for those that
are traded.
We continued to drive for lower operating costs
against a background of steeply rising volume.
We increased our employee population by 
two per cent and delivered an improvement
from £169,000 to £186,000 in sales per employee.
In 2005 we were able to deliver a small reduction
in product unit cost, effectively neutralising the
effects of commodity-price inﬂation.
We completed construction of new
factories at Derby and Hucknall and commenced
commissioning.We completed all the remaining
moves into our new factory at Inchinnan from
Hillington. The latter site was closed and sold in
its entirety in December. Construction of new
factories at Barnoldswick and Bristol is
proceeding satisfactorily towards completion in
2006 and full operation in 2007.We constructed 
a new factory for our commercial marine
business in Shanghai and commenced
operations in November.
More efﬁcient working practices, which 
are a precondition for new factory investment,
are now implemented in most UK locations 
and are under discussion elsewhere. Our new
Global Council covering all our employees met
successfully twice in 2005.
Our Process Excellence culture-change
programme continued through 2005, delivering
training to 27,000 employees and putting in
place fully accredited six-sigma ‘Black Belts’and
‘Green Belts’at 0.6 per cent and 2.0 per cent of
total employee population respectively.
In conjunction with our IT supply chain and our
principal IT partner, EDS, further reductions in
the operating cost of our IT estate provided the
opportunity to increase our new investment in
this area whilst maintaining total IT expenditure
within 2.6 per cent of turnover. In 2005 we
connected 70 per cent of our worldwide
operations to a single wide-area-network,
took important steps towards full global
standardisation of our ERP systems and
commenced the roll-out of the latest generation
of Product Lifecycle Management software.
As forecast, our inventories increased in
2005 to respond to higher output volume 
and to buffer the moves associated with new
factories.We offset this increase by tighter
management of ﬁnancial working capital 
to effect a further improvement of working
capital utilisation.
In 2006 our priorities will be to complete
our infrastructure-renewal projects in the UK
and to advance our move into the new
factories. We shall persist with operating 
and product unit-cost reduction, turning 
our focus towards overhead costs in particular,
and we will continue our drive with Process
Excellence to eliminate waste and achieve
continuous improvement.

Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
We have been following a consistent strategy 
in services for a number of years, focused on
generating value for our customers and
ourselves by delivering high equipment
availability at an affordable and predictable 
cost.These principles are fundamental to
developing and sustaining the collaborative
long-term relationships that underpin our
success in the marketplace.
Under TotalCare, in the civil aerospace
market, and similar contracts in defence
aerospace, energy and marine, we provide
services over the long term at ﬁxed prices.
We are well-qualiﬁed to manage the risks 
we assume in such contracts through our
knowledge of the product and the data we
capture in respect of its service life.
In the defence aerospace sector we 
provide these services under the banner
Mission Ready Management Solutions.
The UK Defence Industrial Strategy published 
in December 2005 cited our Spey and RB199
contracts as exemplars for the style of through-
life support contract that will increasingly
become the norm for the UK defence market.
In the civil aerospace market some 
45 per cent, by value, of our ﬂeet is now under
our management. A notable contract was the
TotalCare agreement signed by LCAL, allowing
this leader in the leasing industry to provide an
innovative, transferable engine-maintenance
agreement with its aircraft.
Earlier investments to support our service
business continue to deliver beneﬁts:
Aeromanager, our customer-care portal for the
civil aerospace market, now provides access to
our services for some 700 customers and over
10,000 users; Data Systems & Solutions retains a
leadership position in the real-time equipment
health-monitoring market, with a portfolio of
more than 6,000 engines; and the Civil
Operations Room is providing an around-the-
clock-service to our customers. During 2005 
we continued to invest, with the defence
aerospace business opening its Operations
Room in Bristol and the opening of our new
repair and overhaul facility in Derby.
A feature of our engine repair and overhaul
network is our partnership with customers and
leading independent maintenance, repair and
overhaul companies.The sharing of good
practice across the network and the deployment
of a common information-technology platform
has enabled efﬁciency improvements and
reduced turnaround times.
In 2006, our priorities for services will remain
the same: innovation in service products to
create value for customers and generate growth
in our revenues; improvements in our service
delivery capability; and further progress with the
development of a responsive customer-focused
service culture among our employees.

Results for the year
Underlying proﬁt before tax, on a ‘like-for-like’
basis* (see above) increased by 49 per cent 
to £584 million (2004 £392 million), and
underlying earnings per share were 24.14p
(2004 15.56p). Basic earnings per share were
20.11p (2004 15.56p).
The Group implemented International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) during the 
year.Comparative ﬁgures for 2004 are restated
accordingly. A full analysis of the impact is
provided in note 33 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Sales growth in all market segments
Sales increased by 11 per cent.
– Civil aerospace engine deliveries 
increased by seven per cent to 881 engines.
Civil aftermarket sales grew by 14 per cent.
– Defence aerospace sales increased slightly,
with small increases in both original
equipment sales and services revenues.
– Marine sales increased by 14 per cent,
with strong growth in the offshore oil & 
gas support market sector.
– Energy sales increased by three per cent,
with sales in the oil & gas sector offsetting
the effects of the depressed power
generation market.
Group aftermarket-services revenues including
100 per cent of repair and overhaul joint ventures
grew by 12 per cent to £3.9 billion and have
grown by 11 per cent per annum compound
over the past ten years. Service revenues
accounted for 54 per cent of total revenues.
87 per cent of sales were to customers
outside the UK.
Margins beneﬁted from some improvement
in demand, continuing growth in services sales
and our focus on cost reduction, which
mitigated headwinds caused by commodity
price inﬂation and an adverse trend in our
achieved US dollar exchange rate.
Underlying ﬁnancing costs amounted 
to £95 million, comprising principally net
interest (£39 million), risk and revenue sharing
partners’ﬁnance cost (£43 million) and net
pension scheme ﬁnance cost (£9 million).
Group interest was covered 16.2 times 
(2004 7.6 times), based upon underlying proﬁt
before interest, excluding joint ventures.
Restructuring charges of £48 million (2004 
£37 million), which were incurred for ongoing
operational improvements, were included
within operating costs.
The Group made an underlying proﬁt 
before tax of £584 million (2004 £364 million).
The Group deﬁnes an underlying measure of
proﬁt to avoid the distortions caused primarily 
by the treatment of derivative foreign exchange
and commodity contracts under IAS 39 (see
note 28).The adjustments to reported proﬁt are:
a) reverse the impact of releasing the transition
hedging reserve arising on the valuation of
derivatives on January 1, 2005; b) eliminate 
the impact of unrealised gains and losses 
on derivatives and other ﬁnancial assets and
liabilities recognised during the year; and 
c) include the realised gains and losses 
of derivative contracts settled in the year.
An adjustment is also made to eliminate the
restructuring, re-measurement and foreign
exchange gains and losses of ﬁnancial RRSPs.
Proﬁt before tax was £477 million (2004 
£364 million).
A ﬁnal payment to ordinary shareholders 
of 5.38p is proposed making a total of 8.72p 
per ordinary share (2004 8.18p).The Company
will continue to issue B Shares in place of
dividends in order to accelerate the recovery 
of its advance corporation tax.
Order book
The order book, at constant exchange rates,
was £22.9 billion (2004 £18.9 billion). Items are
included in the order book when a ﬁrm, signed
contract exists.
In civil aerospace it is common for a
customer to take options for future orders in
addition to ﬁrm orders placed. Such options 
are excluded from the order book until they
become ﬁrm, signed orders.
In defence aerospace,long-term programmes
are often ordered for only one year at a time.
In such circumstances, even though there may
be no alternative engine choice available to 
the customer, only the contracted business is
included in the order book.
Aftermarket-services agreements, including
TotalCare packages, represented 38 per cent of
the order book.These are long-term contracts
where only the ﬁrst seven years’revenue is
included in the order book.
Business which has been announced but
for which contracts have not yet been signed 
is excluded from the order book.This amounted
to a further £1.5 billion at the year end (2004 
£2.4 billion).

Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
Aftermarket services
The Group continues to be successful in
developing its aftermarket-services activities.
These accounted for 54 per cent of revenue
in 2005.
In particular,TotalCare packages in the 
civil aerospace sector now cover 45 per cent,
by value, of the installed ﬂeet.TotalCare 
packages cover long-term management of 
the maintenance and associated logistics for 
our engines and systems, monitoring the
equipment in service to deliver the system
availability our customers require with
predictable costs.The pricing of such contracts
reﬂects their long-term nature. Revenues and
costs are recognised based on the stage of
completion of the contract, generally measured
by reference to ﬂyinghours.The overall net
position of assets and liabilities on the balance
sheet for TotalCare packages was an asset of
£367 million (2004 £389 million).
Cash
The Group cash ﬂow statement is shown on
pages 52 and 53 of the ﬁnancial statements.
The Group generated a positive cash ﬂow 
of £552 million during 2005 (2004 £251 million).
The net cash balance at the year-end was 
£335 million (2004 net debt £217 million, after
adjustment for the implementation of IFRS).
Net working capital reduced year-on-year with
the main items being increased inventories 
of £219 million, offset by an increase in customer
advances of £181 million and an increase in
payables of £294 million.The average net debt
level reduced from £632 million to £260 million.
With positive cash ﬂow expected again in
2006,there should be little if any average net debt
and the balance sheet will strengthen further.
Net cash ﬂow from operating activities 
was £1,060 million (2004 £610 million).
T axation
The overall tax charge on the proﬁt before tax
was £130 million (2004 £100 million), a rate of
27.3 per cent (2004 27.5 per cent).
The tax charge was reduced by £18 million
(2004 £13 million) in respect of the expected
beneﬁt of the UK research and development 
tax credit.
The tax charge on underlying proﬁt was 
£167 million (2004 £100 million), a rate of 
28.6 per cent (2004 27.5 per cent).
Pensions
As a result of the transition to IFRS, the charges
for pensions are now calculated in accordance
with the requirements of IAS 19 Employee
Beneﬁts; the amounts for 2004 have been
restated accordingly. IAS 19 is broadly similar 
to FRS 17, the effects of which were disclosed 
in previous years. Its principal impact is to
include the entire surplus or deﬁcit of any
deﬁned beneﬁt scheme on the balance sheet,
based on deﬁned valuation requirements.
Details of the pensions charge and the
deﬁned beneﬁt schemes’assets and liabilities
are shown in note 23 to the ﬁnancial
statements.This shows a net deﬁcit, after taking
account of deferred tax, of £1,154 million (2004
£984 million). Changes in this deﬁcit are affected
by the assumptions made in valuing the
liabilities and the market performance of the
assets. Most importantly, the discount rate used
for measuring the UK deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities
has fallen from 5.3 per cent in 2004 to 4.7 per
cent in 2005. In addition, the mortality
assumptions have been updated for the 
Rolls-Royce Pension Fund (the largest Scheme
in the Group) based on the actual mortality
experience within the scheme and also to allow
for future mortality improvements.These factors
more than offset the better than expected
returns on the scheme assets.
During 2005, a revised beneﬁt structure was
agreed with the members of the Rolls-Royce
Group Pension Scheme, similar to that
implemented in the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund 
in 2003.
The next actuarial review is due in 2006 
in respect of the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund.
Investments
The Group continues to subject all investments
to rigorous examination of risks and future 
cash ﬂows to ensure that they create
shareholder value. All major investments 
require Board approval.
The Group has a portfolio of projects at 
different stages of their life cycles. Discounted
cash ﬂow analysis of the remaining life of projects
is performed on a regular basis. Sales of engines
in production are assessed against criteria in 
the original development programme to ensure
that overall value is enhanced.
Gross research and development
investment amounted to £663 million (2004
£601 million). Net research and development
was £282 million (2004 £288 million).The level
of self-funded investment in research and
development is expected to remain at
approximately ﬁve per cent of sales in the
future.The impact of this investment on the
income statement will reﬂect the mix and
maturity of individual development
programmes and will result in a signiﬁcantly
lower level of capitalisation of costs in 2006.
Investment in training was £30 million 
(2004 £30 million).
Capital expenditure on property, plant and
equipment was £248 million (2004 £191 million)
and is expected to increase over the next year.
Partnerships
The development of effective partnerships
continues to be a key feature of the Group’s 
long-term strategy. Major partnerships are of 
two types: joint ventures and Risk and Revenue
Sharing Partners.
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are an integral part of our
business.They are involved in engineering 
and manufacturing, repair and overhaul,
and ﬁnancial services. They are also normal
business structures for companies participating
in international, collaborative defence projects.
They share risk and investment, bring
expertise and access to markets, and provide
external objectivity. Some of our joint ventures
have become substantial businesses. A major
proportion of the debt of the joint ventures 
is secured on the assets of the respective
companies and is non-recourse to the Group.
The Group’s share of joint venture assets
and liabilities is shown in the chart below.

Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
Risk and revenue sharing partners (RRSPs)
RRSPs have enabled the Group to build a broad
portfolio of engines, thereby reducing the
exposure of the business to individual product
risk.The primary ﬁnancial beneﬁt is a reduction
of the burden of research and development
(R&D) expenditure on new programmes.
The related R&D expenditure is expensed
through the income statement and the initial
programme receipts from partners, which 
re-imburse the Group for past R&D expenditure,
are also recorded in the income statement,
as other operating income.
RRSP agreements are a standard form 
of co-operation in the civil aero-engine 
industry.They bring beneﬁts to the engine
manufacturer and the partner. Speciﬁcally,
for the manufacturer they bring some or all 
of the following beneﬁts: additional ﬁnancial 
and engineering resource; sharing of risk; and
initial programme contribution. As appropriate,
the partner also supplies components and as
consideration for these components, receives
a share of the long-term revenues generated
by the engine programme in proportion to its
purchased programme share.
The sharing of risk is fundamental to RRSP
agreements. In general, partners share ﬁnancial
investment in the programme; they share market
risk as they receive their return from future 
sales; they share currency risk as their returns 
are denominated in US dollars; they share 
sales ﬁnancing obligations; they share warranty 
costs; and, where they are manufacturing or
development partners, they share technical 
and cost risk. Partners that do not undertake
development work or supply components are
referred to as ﬁnancial RRSPs and, under IFRS
from 2005, are accounted for as ﬁnancial
instruments as described below.
In 2005, the Group secured new partners
for the Trent 1000 engine programme.
However, as the number of new programmes
has reduced and in particular as government
launch investment was not sought for the 
Trent 1000 programme, receipts from partners
have declined. In 2005, other operating income
amounted to £60 million (2004 £73 million) 
and is expected to be at a similar level in 2006.
Payments to RRSPs are recorded within cost
of sales and increase as the related programme
sales increase.These payments amounted 
to £146 million (2004 £240 million, including 
£98 million in respect of ﬁnancial RRSPs).
The classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial RRSPs as 
ﬁnancial instrument has resulted in a liability of
£423 million being incorporated in the balance
sheet and an associated underlying ﬁnancing
cost of £43 million recorded in the income
statement. In 2005 the restructuring of
arrangements with a ﬁnancial partner resulted
in a reduction of the liability, of £86 million,
with an associated gain within ﬁnancing costs
in the income statement. This gain has been
excluded from the underlying proﬁt calculation.
In the past, the Group has also received
government launch investment in respect of
certain programmes.The treatment of this
investment is similar to non-ﬁnancial RRSPs.
Financial services 
The ﬁnancial services businesses comprise:
engine leasing (Rolls-Royce & Partners Finance),
aircraft leasing (Pembroke), and electrical power
project development (Rolls-Royce Power Ventures).
Rolls-Royce & Partners Finance, the Group’s
joint venture engine-leasing business,owns 
a portfolio of 281 engines with 35 customers.
The proportion of engines on lease remains
high, at 98 per cent, by value.
Pembroke, the Group’s joint venture 
aircraft-leasing business, owns 19 aircraft all of
which are on lease to 12 customers. A charge 
of £13 million was incorporated in the 2005
results to reﬂect the current market valuation 
of Pembroke’s aircraft assets.
Rolls-Royce Power Ventures, the Group’s
power-project developer, has 11 power-
generation projects under way.The business is
being restructured and proceeds of £49 million
were raised from asset sales.
Intangible assets 
The Group carried forward £1,281 million (2004
£1,227 million) of intangible assets.This comprised
purchased goodwill of £751 million, engine
certiﬁcation costs and participation fees of 
£146 million, development costs of £265 million
and recoverable engine costs of £119 million.
The recognition of development costs and
recoverable engine costs has resulted from 
the transition to IFRS (see note 33).
Risk management
The Board has an established,structured approach
to risk management.The risk committee (see
Report of the directors) has accountability for 
the system of risk management and reporting
the key risks and associated mitigating actions.
The Director of Risk reports to the Finance
Director.The Group’s policy is to preserve the
resources upon which its continuing reputation,
viability and proﬁtability are built, in order to
enable the corporate objectives to be achieved
through the operation of the Rolls-Royce
business processes.Risks are formally identiﬁed
and recorded in a corporate risk register and 
its subsidiary registers within the business,
which are reviewed and updated on a regular
basis, with risk mitigation plans identiﬁed for 
all signiﬁcant risks.
Financial risk
The Group uses various ﬁnancial instruments in
order to manage the exposures that arise from 
its business operations as a result of movements
in ﬁnancial markets. All treasury activities are
focused on the management and hedging 
of risk. It is the Group’s policy not to trade
ﬁnancial instruments or to engage in
speculative ﬁnancial transactions.There have
been no signiﬁcant changes in the Group’s
policies in the last year.
The principal economic and market risks 
continue to be movements in foreign currency
exchange rates, interest rates and commodity
prices.The Board regularly reviews the Group’s
exposures and ﬁnancial risk management and 
a specialist committee also considers these 
in detail. All such exposures are managed by 
the Group Treasury function, which reports to
the Finance Director and which operates within
written policies approved by the Board and
within the internal control framework described
in the report of the directors.
Counterparty credit risk
The Group has an established policy towards
managing counterparty credit risk. A common
framework exists to measure, report and control
exposures to counterparties across the Group
using Value at Risk and fair value techniques.
Counterparties are assigned a credit limit that
reﬂects their credit standing.The Group assigns
an internal credit rating to each counterparty,
which is assessed with reference to publicly
available credit information such as that
provided by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and
other recognised market sources and is
reviewed regularly.
10885 R&A 2005 actual  15/3/06  07:57  Page 27 28
Finance Director’ s review continued
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
Financial instruments are only transacted with
counterparties that have a publicly assigned
long-term credit rating from Standard & Poor’s of
‘A-‘ or better and from Moody’s of ‘A3’or better.
Funding and liquidity
The Group ﬁnances its operations through 
a mixture of shareholders’funds, bank
borrowings, bonds, notes and ﬁnance leases.
The Group borrows in the major global markets
in a range of currencies.
It employs derivatives where appropriate 
to generate the desired currency and interest
rate proﬁle.
The Group took advantage of favourable
market conditions during 2005 to extend the
maturity proﬁle of its main £250 million
revolving credit facility from 2009 to 2012 on
improved pricing and terms. As at December 31,
2005 the Group had total committed borrowing
facilities of £1.7 billion on an IFRS basis (2004
£1.8 billion).
There are no rating triggers contained in
any of the Group’s facilities that could require
the Group to accelerate or repay any facility for 
a given movement in the Group’s credit rating
and no material impact on the Group’s interest
charge is expected to arise from a movement 
in the Group’s credit rating.
The Group holds ﬁnancial investments and
maintains undrawn committed facilities at a
level sufﬁcient to ensure the Group has available
funds to meet its medium-term capital and
funding obligations and to meet any
unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group from time to time holds cash and
short-term investments which, together with
the undrawn committed facilities, enable the
Group to manage its liquidity risk.
The Group continues to have access to 
all the major global debt markets.
Credit rating
The Group subscribes to both Moody’s Investors
Service and Standard & Poor’s for its ofﬁcial
publicised credit ratings. As at December 31,
2005 the Group’s assigned long-term credit
ratings were:
Rating Agency Rating Outlook Category
Moody’s Baa1 Stable Investment 
grade
Standard & Poor’s BBB+ Stable Investment 
grade
During the year the Group saw positive actions
by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s such that the
ratings and outlook from both agencies are
now equivalent.
The Group attaches signiﬁcant importance
to maintaining an investment grade credit
rating, which it views as necessary for the
business to operate effectively.
The Group’s medium-term objective is to
achieve, through the normal course of business,
an ‘A’category investment grade credit rating
from both agencies.
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to movements in exchange
rates for both foreign currency transactions and
the translation of net assets and proﬁt and loss
accounts of foreign subsidiaries.
The Group regards its interests in overseas
subsidiary companies as long-term investments.
The Group has tended to manage its
translational exposures through the currency
matching of assets and liabilities where
applicable. The matching is reviewed regularly.
Appropriate risk mitigation is undertaken where
material mismatches arise.
The Group is exposed to a number 
of foreign currencies.The most signiﬁcant
transactional currency exposure is the US dollar
followed by the Euro.US dollar income, net of
expenditure represented 27 per cent of Group
turnover in 2005 (2004 26 per cent).
The Group operates a hedging policy 
using a variety of ﬁnancial instruments with 
the objective of minimising the impact of
ﬂuctuations in exchange rates on future
transactions and cash ﬂows.
The permitted range of the amount 
of cover taken is determined by the written
policies set by the Board, based on known 
and forecast income levels.
The forward cover is managed within the
parameters of these policies in order to achieve
the Group’s objectives, having regard to the
Group’s view of long-term exchange rates.
Forward cover is in the form of standard foreign
exchange contracts and instruments on which
the exchange rates achieved are dependent 
on future interest rates.The Group may also
write currency options against a portion of 
the unhedged dollar income at a rate which 
is consistent with the Group’s long-term 
target rate. At the end of 2005 the Group 
had approximately US$10.5 billion of forward 
cover (2004 US$9.0 billion).
The consequence of this policy has been 
to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign
exchange rates. Note 20 includes the impact of
revaluing forward currency contracts at market
values on December 31, 2005, showing a value
of £228 million (2004 £986 million) which will
ﬂuctuate with exchange rates over time.
The Group has entered into these forward
contracts as part of the hedging policy,
described above, in order to mitigate the 
impact of volatile exchange rates.
Interest rate risk
The Group uses ﬁxed rate bonds and ﬂoating
rate debt as funding sources.The Group’s policy
is to maintain a higher proportion of net debt 
at ﬁxed rates of interest having regard to the
prevailing interest-rate outlook.To implement
this policy the Group may utilise a combination
of interest-rate swaps, forward-rate agreements
and interest-rate caps to manage the exposure.
Commodity risk
The Group has an ongoing exposure to the
price of jet fuel and base metals arising from
business operations.The Group’s objective 
is to minimise the impact of price ﬂuctuations.
The exposure is hedged in accordance with
parameters contained in a written policy set 
by the Board.
10885 R&A 2005 actual  15/3/06  07:57  Page 28 Sales ﬁnancing 
In connection with the sale of its products,
the Group will, on some occasions, provide
ﬁnancing support for its customers.This may
involve the Group guaranteeing ﬁnancing for
customers, providing asset-value guarantees
(AVGs) on aircraft for a proportion of their
expected future value, or entering into leasing
transactions.
The Group manages and monitors its 
sales ﬁnance related exposures to customers
and products within written policies approved
by the Board and within the internal framework
described in the report of the directors.The
contingent liabilities represent the maximum
discounted aggregate gross and net exposure
that the Group has in respect of delivered
aircraft, regardless of the point in time at which
such exposures may arise.
The Group uses Airclaims Limited as an
independent appraiser to value its security
portfolio at both the half-year and year-end.
Airclaims provides speciﬁc values (both current
and forecast future values) for each asset in the
security portfolio.These values are then used 
to assess the Group’s net exposure.
The permitted levels of gross and net
exposure are limited in aggregate, by
counterparty, by product type and by calendar
year.The Group’s gross exposures are divided
approximately 60:40 between AVGs and credit
guarantees.They are spread over many years 
and relate to a number of customers and a
broad product portfolio.
The Board regularly reviews the Group’s
sales ﬁnance related exposures and risk
management activities. Each ﬁnancing
commitment is subject to a credit and asset
review process and prior approval by the 
Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
The Group operates a sophisticated 
risk-pricing model to assess risk and exposure.
Costs and exposures associated with providing
ﬁnancing support are incorporated in any
decision to secure new business.
The Group seeks to minimise the level of
exposure from sales ﬁnance commitments by:
– the use of third party non-recourse debt
where appropriate;
– the transfer, sale, or re-insurance of risks; and
– ensuring the proportionate ﬂow down 
of risk and exposure to relevant RRSPs.
Each of the above forms an active part of 
the Group’s exposure management process.
Where exposures arise, the strategy has
been, and continues to be, to assume where
possible liquid forms of ﬁnancing commitment
that may be sold or transferred to third parties
when the opportunity arises.
Note 30 to the accounts describes the
Group’s contingent liabilities as revised following
the adoption of IFRS.
There were no material changes to the
Group’s gross and net contingent liabilities in
this respect in 2005.
International Financial Reporting Standards 
As we described last year, from 2005 all
European Union listed companies are required
to adopt International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) for their ﬁnancial statements.
Accordingly these are the ﬁrst ﬁnancial
statements prepared on this basis. On April 14,
2005, we announced the impact on Rolls-Royce
of the transition to IFRS.This is set out in note 33
to the ﬁnancial statements and further details
are available in the Investors section on the
Group’s website at www.rolls-royce.com
In summary, the key areas of impact for
Rolls-Royce relate to:
– ﬁnancial instruments accounting under 
IAS 32 and IAS 39;
– capitalisation of development expenditure
under IAS 38;
– the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on
accounting for ﬁnancial RRSP receipts 
and payments;
– pension-scheme accounting under IAS 19;
– fair valuing share-option schemes in
accordance with IFRS 2; and
– the cessation of goodwill amortisation 
in accordance with IFRS 3.
During 2005, the International Accounting
Standards Board has published further new
standards and amendments to existing
standards. Of these, the Group has chosen 
to adopt early the amendment to IAS 19
Employee Beneﬁts allowing the recognition,
in full, of actuarial gains and losses on post-
retirement beneﬁt schemes in the statement 
of recognised income and expense in 2005.
A summary of other changes, which have not
been adopted in 2005, is included within the
accounting policies in note 1 to the ﬁnancial
statements.
Share price 
During the year the Rolls-Royce share 
price increased by 73 per cent from 247p to
427.5p per share, compared to a 55 per cent
increase for the aerospace and defence sector
and a 17 per cent increase for the FTSE 100.
The Company’s shares ranged in price from
236p in April to 430.5p in December.
The number of shares in issue at the end 
of the year was 1,759 million, an increase of 
54 million of which 19 million related to share
options and 35 million related to conversion 
of B Shares into ordinary shares.
The average number of shares in issue was
1,740 million (2004 1,690 million). Underlying
earnings per share were 24.14p an increase of 
55 per cent over 2004.

2005 Directors&Rem.qxd  15/3/06  07:57  Page 31 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
32
The directors present their report and the audited ﬁnancial statements of 
Rolls-Royce Group plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as
the Group) for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Principal activities
Rolls-Royce is a global business providing power systems for use on land, at sea 
and in the air.The Group has a balanced business portfolio with leading positions
in the civil and defence aerospace, marine and energy markets.There are some
54,000 Rolls-Royce gas turbines in service and they generate a demand for 
high-value services throughout their operational lives. Rolls-Royce is a technology
leader employing 36,200 people in ofﬁces, manufacturing and service facilities in
50 countries.
Results for the year and the issue of B Shares
The Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review and the Finance Director’s
review describe the year’s operations, research and development activities and
prospects.
At the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on May 3, 2006, the directors will
recommend an issue of 53.8 B Shares with a total nominal value of 5.38p for each
ordinary share.Together with the interim issue on January 3, 2006 of 33.4 B Shares
for each ordinary share with a total nominal value of 3.34p, this is the equivalent of
a total annual payment to ordinary shareholders of 8.72p for each ordinary share.
Shareholders are given the opportunity to redeem their B Shares for cash or
to convert them into additional ordinary shares in the Company. For those
shareholders who have not elected to redeem or convert their B Shares, a B Share
dividend at a rate of 75 per cent of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is
payable half yearly in arrears.
The Board believes that there continues to be a signiﬁcant beneﬁt to be
gained from the issue of B Shares. Payments to shareholders will, therefore,
continue to be made through further issues of B Shares, generally in January and
July each year.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the
Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis
in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
Share capital
The following shareholder has a notiﬁable interest in the Company’s ordinary
shares at February 8, 2006:
% of issued ordinary 
share capital
BMW AG 9.02
Authority to purchase own shares
At the AGM in 2005 the Company was authorised by shareholders to purchase
up to 173,313,853 of its own ordinary shares representing ten per cent of its
issued ordinary share capital as at February 9, 2005.The Company did not make
use of this authority during 2005.
The authority for the Company to purchase its own shares expires at the
conclusion of the AGM in 2006 and a resolution to renew it will be proposed at
that meeting.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint the auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, and to authorise the
directors to determine their remuneration, will also be proposed at the AGM.
Political donations
In line with its established policy, the Group made no political donations 
during 2005.
Directors
The directors’biographical details, including their other signiﬁcant commitments,
are set out on pages 30 and 31. During the year there were a number of Board
changes: Simon Robertson was appointed non-executive Chairman with effect
from January 1, 2005; Iain Conn was appointed as an independent non-executive
director with effect from January 20, 2005; Sir Robin Nicholson retired as the
Company’s senior independent director on February 9, 2005 and as a 
non-executive director, at the conclusion of the AGM on May 4, 2005; Peter Byrom
succeeded him as the senior independent director; Dr Mike Howse retired as an
executive director on June 30, 2005; and Colin Smith was appointed as an
executive director of the Company on July 1, 2005. Colin Green will retire from the
Board as an executive director on April 4, 2006.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, one third of the directors are
subject to re-election every year, with each director also being subject to 
re-election at intervals of not more than three years. Any director appointed
during the year is separately required to retire and seek re-election by the
shareholders at the next AGM.The Board also requires any non-executive director
who has served on the Board for more than nine years to be subject to annual 
re-election at the AGM.The directors retiring at this year’s AGM are Peter Byrom,
Sir John Rose, Colin Smith, Ian Strachan and Carl Symon.They all offer themselves
for re-election.
The Company has entered into separate Deeds of Indemnity in favour of its
directors.The deeds provide substantially the same protection as that already
provided to directors under the indemnity in Article 170 of the Company’s
Articles of Association.The Company has also arranged appropriate insurance
cover for any legal action taken against its directors.
Corporate governance
Statement on corporate governance compliance 
Rolls-Royce attaches the highest priority to corporate governance, the system by
which the Company is directed, managed and controlled in the interests of all its
stakeholders.The strength of the Company’s corporate values, its reputation and
its ability to achieve its objectives are inﬂuenced by the effectiveness of the
Company’s approach towards corporate governance.
The Board conﬁrms that throughout 2005, the Company complied with the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code).This report
and, where appropriate, the Directors’remuneration report, explain how the
Company discharges its corporate governance responsibilities.
The Board’ s composition and directors’independence
Simon Robertson chairs the Board of the Company and Sir John Rose is the Chief
Executive.The division of responsibilities between them is set down in writing and
agreed by the Board. Peter Byrom is the Company’s senior independent director.
There are currently 14 directors on the Board comprising the non-executive
Chairman, the Chief Executive, ﬁve other executive directors and seven 
non-executive directors.
The quality and broad experience of the directors, the balance of the Board’s
composition and the dynamics of the Board as a group ensure the Board’s
effectiveness and also prevent any individual or small group dominating the
Board’s decision making.
Each executive director receives a service contract on appointment (see the
Directors’remuneration report for further information) and each non-executive
director receives a letter setting out the conditions of their appointment.
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of three years, which may
be extended subsequently with the agreement of the Board. Executive directors
are employees who have executive responsibilities in addition to their duties as
directors. Non-executive directors are not employees and do not participate in the
daily business management of the Group.
Report of the directors
2005 Directors&Rem.qxd  15/3/06  07:57  Page 32 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
33
The Board applies a rigorous process in order to satisfy itself that its non-executive
directors remain independent. On his appointment as Chairman on January 1,
2005, Simon Robertson met the criteria for independence contained in the
Combined Code. His other signiﬁcant commitments are described on page 30.
In the case of the non-executive directors, the Board reviews their independence
every year, using its own judgement when applying the criteria in the Combined
Code. Having undertaken this review in 2005, the Board conﬁrms that all the 
non-executive directors are considered to be independent in character and
judgement.
On January 1, 2006, Peter Byrom completed nine years service on the Board
and therefore does not meet one of the criteria for independence contained in
the Combined Code. Having conducted a thorough review, the Board has
concluded that Peter Byrom remains independent in character and judgement,
that there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect his
independent judgement and that he is in no way dependent on the
remuneration he receives from the Company.The Board believes strongly that in
a long-term, complex and technologically advanced business, it is essential that
non-executive directors have the opportunity to acquire, over a number of years,
the experience and knowledge of the business and the sectors within which the
Group operates.With his ﬁnancial background, City experience and deep
knowledge of the Group’s business, Peter Byrom is particularly well qualiﬁed to
serve as the Chairman of the audit committee and as the senior independent
director.The Board therefore considers it to be in the interests of shareholders that
he should continue to support the Company in both these roles, a judgement
which has been endorsed by the independent consultancy, which undertook a
review of the Board’s effectiveness during 2005 (see below). In line with the policy
adopted by the Board, Peter Byrom will in future be subject to annual re-election
by shareholders.
Role of the Board 
The Board is responsible to all its stakeholders for the conduct and performance
of the Company.
The day-to-day running of the Company is delegated by the Board to the
executive team under the leadership of Sir John Rose, the Chief Executive.
The Board retains responsibility for the approval of certain matters which
affect the shape and risk proﬁle of the Company, as well as such items as the
annual budget and performance targets, the published accounts, payments to
shareholders, major capital investments and any substantial change to balance
sheet management policy.This division of responsibilities between the Board and
the executive team is set out in detail in a schedule approved annually by the
Board, which deﬁnes those decisions which can only be taken by the Board itself.
The Board has approved the following statement summarising its core
responsibilities:
Primary goal
The primary goal of the Board is to ensure that the Company’s strategy creates
value for the long-term investor within an acceptable risk proﬁle.
The Board's tasks
In line with its primary goal, the Board’s principal tasks are to:
– ensure the development of the Company’s strategy and keep it under
rigorous review;
– monitor the implementation of the strategy, ensuring that the necessary
ﬁnancial and human resources are in place to deliver it and that effective
controls exist to manage risk;
– safeguard the values of the Company, including its brand and corporate
reputation and the safety of its products;
– oversee the quality and performance of management and ensure through
effective succession planning and remuneration policies that it is maintained
at world-class standards; and
– maintain an effective corporate governance framework that delivers 
long-term value to shareholders.
Directors’induction, training and information
Newly appointed directors participate in a structured induction programme and
receive a comprehensive data pack providing detailed information on the Group.
An existing executive director acts as a mentor to each newly appointed 
non-executive director, giving guidance and advice as required. As part of their
brieﬁng, non-executive directors visit key sites and meet a cross-section of
managers and employees to gain a better understanding of the Group and its
operations. On-going training is available for all the directors, including
presentations by the executive team on particular aspects of the business.
There is an agreed procedure for directors to take independent professional
advice at the Company’s expense.This is in addition to the access every director
has to the Company Secretary and the General Counsel.
Board effectiveness
The Chairman meets at least once a year with the non-executive directors
without the executive directors present, in order to review the operation of the
Board.
The Chairman has an annual meeting with each non-executive director to
review their contribution to the Board.The senior independent director chairs an
annual meeting with the non-executive directors to review the performance of
the Chairman, the outcome of which is reported back to him.
Each year, the Chairman reviews the performance of the Chief Executive as
part of the annual salary review process overseen by the remuneration
committee.The Chief Executive reviews the performance of the other executive
directors in the same way.
The Board attaches considerable importance to ensuring that it performs
effectively as a team. In 2005, an in-depth review of the effectiveness of the Board
and its committees was undertaken by Consilium Associates, an independent
consultancy.The review covered Board and committee structure, Board dynamics,
the conduct of Board meetings, the information provided to directors and
corporate governance.The report prepared by Consilium Associates was
discussed by the Board in December 2005 and will be used by the directors in
2006 to implement a number of improvements in the way the Board operates.
The audit, remuneration and nominations committees have separately
undertaken reviews of their terms of reference and effectiveness during 2005.

* The number of meetings held during the period a director was in ofﬁce or a member of a

** During 2005, Carl-Peter Forster was unable to attend the Board and committee meetings shown above
as a result of the demands placed on him at short notice in his capacity as President of General Motors
Europe. In all cases when he was unable to attend a meeting, he communicated his views to the Board or
committee Chairman and in the Board’s view, he continues to make a very strong contribution to the
Company and to the work of the Board and its committees.
Nominations committee
In 2005 the nominations committee was chaired by Simon Robertson. Its other
members were the Hon Amy Bondurant, Peter Byrom, Carl-Peter Forster,
Sir John Rose, Ian Strachan, Carl Symon and Sir Robin Nicholson (until his
retirement as a non-executive director on May 4, 2005). On November 17, 2005
Iain Conn and Sir John Taylor joined the committee, reﬂecting the Board’s view
that all the non-executive directors should serve as members of the committee.
The committee met ﬁve times during the year.
The committee makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment
of executive and non-executive directors and on the membership of Board
committees. It is assisted in the former task by external recruitment consultants.
It reviews succession planning for appointments to the Board and to other senior
positions within the Group.
In carrying out these tasks, the committee gives careful consideration to the
balance of skills required on the Board, including the need to reﬂect diversity,
international experience and strong managerial and business skills. Before
recommending the appointment of a non-executive director to the Board, the
committee satisﬁes itself that the candidate will have sufﬁcient time available to
discharge his or her responsibilities effectively.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee determines appropriate levels of remuneration for
the executive directors and other senior executives.The committee met six times
during the year.The committee’s membership and principal terms of reference
are set out in the directors’remuneration report on page 39.
Audit committee
The audit committee consists exclusively of independent, non-executive directors
and is chaired by Peter Byrom who has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience.
In 2005, its other members were Sir Robin Nicholson until May 4, 2005 and 
Ian Strachan. Iain Conn became a member of the committee with effect from
January 20, 2005.The committee met four times during the year.
The committee has responsibility for recommending to the Board the
published accounts and for reviewing the Group’s ﬁnancial reporting and
accounting policies, including major announcements made to a regulatory
information service. It is also responsible for the relationship with the external
auditors and for the internal audit function, which in Rolls-Royce is termed
Business Assurance. In addition, the committee reviews the Group’s procedures 
for detecting, monitoring and managing the risk of fraud.
The committee has responsibility for recommending to the Board the
appointment of the external auditors and for reviewing the scope of the audit,
approving the audit fee and, on an annual basis, satisfying itself that the auditors
are independent. It keeps under review the Group’s internal controls and systems
for assessing and mitigating ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial risk. It also reviews and
approves the Business Assurance work programmes and ensures that this
function is adequately resourced and co-ordinated with the work of the external
auditors.
In order to safeguard auditor independence and objectivity, the following
policy is applied in relation to services provided by the auditors:
Audit related services – these are undertaken by the auditors as it is work that they
must, or are best suited to, perform. It includes formalities relating to borrowings,
shareholder and other circulars, risk management services, various regulatory
reports and work in respect of acquisitions and disposals.
Tax,accounting and mergers and acquisitions – The auditors are used for this work
where they are best suited to undertake it. All other signiﬁcant consulting work in
these areas is put out to tender.
All other advisory services/consulting – The auditors are generally prohibited from
providing these services.
Throughout the year the committee monitors the cost of non-audit work
undertaken by the auditors and is, therefore, in a position to take action if at any
time it believes that there is a risk of the auditors’independence being
undermined through the award of this work.
Risk committee
The Board has a risk committee, chaired by the Chief Executive, with speciﬁc
accountability for the system of risk management and for reporting key risks and
their associated mitigating actions to the Board. In 2005, membership of the
committee comprised John Chefﬁns, Colin Green, James Guyette, Sir John Rose,
and Andrew Shilston. Dr Mike Howse was a member of the committee until his
retirement on June 30, 2005. Colin Smith became a member with effect from 
July 1, 2005. Colin Green will cease to be a member of the committee when he
retires from the Company on April 4, 2006.

Internal controls and risk management
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for
maintaining and reviewing its effectiveness from both a ﬁnancial and operational
perspective.The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and to provide
reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Group’s approach to internal control is based on the underlying principle of
line management’s accountability for control and risk management.
In reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control, the Board 
has taken account of the results of the work carried out to audit and review the
activities of the Group.
There is an ongoing process to identify, assess and manage risk, including
those risks affecting the Group’s reputation.This process is subject to continuous
improvement and has been in place throughout the ﬁnancial year to which these
statements apply and up to the date of their approval. In 2005 the risk review
framework has been enhanced at both programme and sector level and
assurance activities more closely co-ordinated with the risk management process.
The Board has reviewed the risk management process and conﬁrms that
ongoing processes and systems ensure that Rolls-Royce continues to be
compliant with the current Turnbull Committee Guidance on Internal Control and
the Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code issued in October
2005, which takes effect for ﬁnancial years beginning on or after January 1, 2006.
Organisation
The Group has a clearly deﬁned organisation structure within which operational
management has detailed responsibilities and levels of authorisation, supported
by written job descriptions and operating manuals.
Rolls-Royce also has a code of business ethics which lays down the principles
to be followed by employees in the course of conducting business.The code 
also gives guidance to support achievement of the required standards.
Additionally, conﬁdential reporting lines enable UK and US employees to report,
outside the normal management chain, any concerns they may have with regard
to business conduct.
The risk management system
The risk management system is an integral part of management’s approach to
delivering business objectives and is a systematic process designed to identify,
assess, treat, manage and communicate risks. It also provides a method of
escalation and delegation to the appropriate level within the organisation and
ensures actions are owned, deﬁned, resourced and effective.
Management is responsible for the ongoing identiﬁcation and evaluation of
signiﬁcant risks within their areas of responsibility and, using a common process,
for the operation of suitable controls or mitigation actions. Risks are recorded in
regularly updated risk registers operating at all levels of the organisation and are
continuously reviewed and monitored. During the review process, signiﬁcant
emphasis is placed on learning from and sharing prior experience. Risks may arise
from a variety of internal and external sources.They may be associated with
regulations, customer requirements and competitor actions or could result from
the capability of the processes used to execute the business or from external and
largely unpredictable events, such as terrorist activity or war.
Risks, irrespective of source, are managed through processes operated by
project and functional teams. Management reports regularly to the risk
committee on its view of risks and how they are managed so that the Board can
then consider and review these risks in terms of their potential impact.
Management has continued to perform comprehensive risk reviews for all
key projects, programmes and business change plans. In addition, all the
processes operated by the Company are subject to continuous improvement,
including the risk management process itself.
Systems of internal control 
The general managers of individual businesses are aware of their responsibility 
to operate systems of internal control which provide reasonable assurance of
effective and efﬁcient operations, reliable ﬁnancial information and compliance
with laws and regulations. Financial managers are required to acknowledge in
writing that their routine ﬁnancial reporting is based on reliable data and that
their results are properly stated in accordance with Group requirements.
The Group has a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual 
budget approved by the Board. Revised forecasts for the year are reported at 
least quarterly. Actual results are reported monthly against budget and variances
reviewed.
The activities of the Group are subject to review by the Department of Risk,
including Business Assurance and Project Risk Assessment, and the assurance
functions of Health, Safety and Environment, Quality and Engineering.These
functions operate to work programmes agreed by the appropriate Board
member.
The Business Assurance function, which works closely with the external
auditors, undertakes a programme of ﬁnancial and operational audits and reviews
agreed by the audit committee and covering all Group activities.The programme
includes independent reviews of the systems of internal control and risk
management.The ﬁndings and the status of corrective actions taken to  address
these are reported to the audit committee four times a year and to the risk
committee twice a year.
Export controls 
The Group attaches the highest priority to complying fully with export controls in
all the jurisdictions in which it operates. Detailed processes have been put in place
to ensure that the Group follows all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
The Board has established an exports committee, chaired by the Chief
Operating Ofﬁcer, which has responsibility for the application of appropriate
controls to the Group’s export activity.
In the UK, the Group fully complies with the provisions of the UK Export
Control Act on tangible and intangible exports and trade between third parties.
Additionally, the Group complies with the relevant EU regulations regarding the
export of dual use goods and technology. In other jurisdictions, most notably the
USA, the Group vigorously enforces a policy of compliance with both the relevant
national legislation and its underlying regulatory intent.
Communication with shareholders  
The Company attaches importance to the effectiveness of its communications
with shareholders. It publishes an Annual review and summary ﬁnancial
statement as well as a full Annual report.There are also separate reports for the
Environment and Community Relations.
The Company maintains a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders
and the ﬁnancial community.This includes presentations of the preliminary and
interim results, regular meetings with major shareholders, participation in
stockbrokers’seminars and site visits.
In November 2005, the Company hosted a major investors’seminar in Derby,
at which a number of Board directors and other senior executives described the
Group’s progress. All shareholders can gain access to these and other
presentations, as well as to the Annual report and other information about the
Group, on the Group’s website at www.rolls-royce.com
Holders of ordinary shares may attend the Company’s AGM at which the
Company highlights key business developments during the year and at which
shareholders have an opportunity to ask questions.The chairmen of the audit,
remuneration and nominations committees are available to answer any questions
from shareholders on the work of their committees.

Report of the directors continued
The Company conﬁrms that it sends the AGM notice and relevant
documentation to all shareholders at least 20 working days before the date of
the AGM. For those shareholders who have elected to receive communications
electronically, notice is given of the availability of documents on the Group’s
website.
Responsibility for maintaining regular communications with shareholders
rests with the executive management team led by the Chief Executive. However,
the Board is informed on a regular basis of key shareholder issues, including share
price performance, the composition of the shareholder register and City
expectations. Independent research is commissioned annually into institutional
shareholder perceptions of the Group.The Chairman, the senior independent
director and the non-executive directors make themselves available to meet with
shareholders as required.
Corporate responsibility 
The Group believes that excellence in corporate responsibility delivers
competitive advantage and contributes to long-term success. It helps the Group
attract and retain the best people and maintain successful working relationships
with customers, suppliers and governments. It also enables the Group to build
goodwill and to support the communities in which its employees live and work.
The sustained wealth, created by providing thousands of highly skilled jobs,
represents the Group’s single greatest contribution to those communities.
Charitable donations and community involvement are encouraged within a
global framework which assists local regeneration and promotes education in
business and technology-based studies.
The Group supports its own employees with well-developed policies and
practices in health, safety and environment, employment policy and employee
learning and development.The Group also operates proactive policies to manage
its supplier and customer relationships responsibly.
The Group’s achievements during the year were recognised when it was
ranked in 9th position in the 2004 UK Business in the Community Corporate
Responsibility Index and retained its inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Indices.
The following paragraphs describe in more detail how the Group addresses
speciﬁc aspects of its policy and practice in the ﬁeld of corporate responsibility.
Supply chain 
The Group makes its approved suppliers aware of the expected business
requirements and performance standards through its supplier quality system,
‘Supplier Advanced Business Relationships’(SABRe).This includes a supplier code
of conduct and a health, safety and environmental management system, which
set minimum standards. Regular visits are made to suppliers to assess their
performance and a supplier awareness programme is delivered through
conferences and regular communications.The Rolls-Royce purchasing code of
conduct for employees complements the supplier code of conduct and ensures
that employees act consistently with suppliers.
In 2005, Rolls-Royce won a UK award from the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply in recognition of its contribution to corporate
responsibility through the recycling of material in its supply chain.
The Group’s sourcing policies in the USA reﬂect US Government regulations
on small and disadvantaged businesses and our performance is monitored
regularly.
Health, Safety and Environment (HS&E)
Rolls-Royce recognises that exceptional HS&E performance makes sound
business sense. Our strategy is to protect our employees, contractors and the
wider community; attract and retain a motivated workforce; maintain business
continuity; avoid asset damage; and reduce overall costs.We also aim to have zero
injuries and environmental incidents and to minimise the environmental impact
of our operations.
The Chief Executive chairs the HS&E committee which is responsible for
deﬁning strategy, the management system, Group objectives and all performance
measures.The Group is supported by the Environmental Advisory Board (EAB),
whose members include respected external authorities.The EAB reviews and
makes independent recommendations on the environmental and sustainability
aspects of the Group’s activities.
The Chief Operating Ofﬁcer chairs the Major Incident Board which reviews
incidents to ensure that lessons learnt are effectively communicated throughout
the Group. Incidents considered in 2005 were a ﬁre in a magnesium cutting
operation and an explosion in a hydrogen bell furnace. Fortunately, these
regrettable incidents did not result in any injuries and the Group experienced no
work-related fatalities in 2005.
Three-year targets were set across the Group in 2003 covering: lost time
injury rate; number of working days lost; incident rate of occupational diseases
and other work related ill health; 100 per cent health surveillance of any
populations at risk; energy use; solid waste; solid waste recycling and hazardous
liquid waste. Programmes are in place to improve performance in these areas and
an update, with data for 2005, will be published on the Group’s website in April
2006. Independent assurance is provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP .
The Group operates three sites in the UK which manufacture, test and
support nuclear reactor cores for Royal Navy submarines. All these sites continue
to maintain a strong health, safety and environmental record.
The Group’s HS&E audit programme independently assesses the
implementation of its HS&E management system. Several audits were completed
in 2005, covering operations in the UK, USA, Finland and Norway. Good progress
continues to be made in implementing the Group-wide standard for an
integrated HS&E management system. HS&E reviews were also undertaken at
joint venture operations in the UK and the USA and at selected suppliers in
Bulgaria, Romania and Taiwan.
The Group recognises HS&E performance with annual awards presented by
the Chief Executive. Recognition was given in 2005 to those sites achieving zero
lost time injuries.
Environment 
The Group operates environmental management systems which are third party
certiﬁed to the international standard ISO 14001. In 2005 the Group’s operations at
Oberursel and Dahlewitz in Germany received certiﬁcation and all the Group’s
major sites are now certiﬁed. Our aim is for newly acquired businesses to achieve
certiﬁcation within two years of acquisition.
The Group continues to make excellent progress in improving the
environmental performance of its products, with environmental impacts reduced
by sustained investment in technology.We work with industry groups to support
these objectives and in 2005, we were a key participant in the development of
the UK Sustainable Aviation initiative.This deﬁnes a long-term strategy to maintain
the beneﬁts of growth in air travel, whilst managing the environmental impacts
within sustainable limits.
The Group also supports the long-term goals published by the Advisory
Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe (ACARE). ACARE seeks, by 2020 from a
2000 baseline, to develop aero-engine technology to help reduce fuel burn and
carbon dioxide emissions per passenger kilometre by 50 per cent, noise by 50 per
cent and emissions of oxides of nitrogen by 80 per cent. Rolls-Royce engines for
the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 787 show improvements in environmental
performance which are fully consistent with achieving these goals. Similar
programmes are being followed in the energy and marine businesses.
2005 Directors&Rem.qxd  15/3/06  07:58  Page 36 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
37
The Group continues to participate in the UK carbon dioxide emissions trading
scheme and the Chicago Climate Exchange and has targets for reduced carbon
dioxide emissions from its operations in the UK and North America. In 2005, the
Group again exceeded its obligations to reduce emissions under the UK
Emissions Trading Scheme and sold some emissions units, thereby enhancing the
cost-saving beneﬁts of energy reduction.
In 2005, the Group was again placed ﬁrst in its business sector in the
Business in the Environment index of corporate environmental management. Its
environmental achievements have also been recognised by several UK awards,
including Business in the Community’s  ‘Big Tick,’Business Commitment to the
Environment and the Energy Accreditation Scheme.
Occupational Health 
The Group’s strategy is to provide a progressive Occupational Health service
recognised for delivering best practice based upon prevention and with
processes fully integrated into the quality management system.
The Group recognises the link between physical and mental health and the
need for employees to enjoy working effectively and successfully with proper
regard for their personal well-being.To support the link between well-being and
productivity, the HS&E committee in 2005 endorsed a preventative occupational
health strategy, which concentrates on four key areas: screening and surveillance;
rehabilitation; health promotion; and education.
In screening and surveillance, stringent targets are set for assessing ﬁtness for
work, reducing occupational disease and work-related ill health. A campaign
continues to reduce noise-induced hearing loss and the Company played a
signiﬁcant part in 2005 in advising on the introduction of ‘The Control of Vibration
at Work Regulations’and their supporting guidance.
The priority in rehabilitation is early intervention and active case
management of individuals.Training is provided to assist managers in managing
absence and rehabilitation effectively.
Health promotion in 2005 included awareness campaigns on smoking and
obesity. Employees are encouraged to stop smoking by highlighting the many
beneﬁts of not smoking and promoting the wide range of help and support in
giving up. A three-month educational campaign called ‘Reduce Hazardous Waist!’
was launched with the aim of reducing health problems associated with obesity.
The Group’s approach to managing workplace pressure has previously been
recognised as an example of best practice by the UK’s Health and Safety
Executive (HSE) commissioned report on ‘Beacons of Excellence’ . Similarly its
approach to absence management was cited by the HSE in its ‘Better business’
campaign.
Dr Ian Lawson, the Group’s Chief Medical Ofﬁcer, has recently completed a
term of ofﬁce as President of the Society of Occupational Medicine and has
become a member of the International Commission on Occupational Health.
Employment policy
At the end of 2005, the Group employed 36,191 employees (2004 35,372).
The Group and employee representatives continue to work closely together
to improve the quality of employee engagement and participation in the
development of the business.This was reﬂected by the creation in April 2005 of a
Global Council. It comprises employee representatives from countries worldwide
and provides a structured approach to consultation and communication on
international issues.The Global Council meets at least twice a year, supported by
the Global Council’s Executive Committee which progresses issues between the
Council meetings.
In 2005, the Group consulted widely over changes to the Rolls-Royce Group
Pension Scheme for UK employees. New arrangements took effect from July 1,
2005 after agreement with employee representatives and acceptance by
employees.The changes introduced were similar to those made to the 
Rolls-Royce Pension Fund in 2004.
As part of its commitment to effective consultation with all employees, the Group
carried out a worldwide Employee Engagement survey in 2004. In 2005 the
results of this survey were shared with all employees. Each business identiﬁed an
action programme to address the issues arising.
The Group’s global policy on diversity and equality continues to develop in
consultation with employee representatives.The Group is committed to equal
opportunities and to developing a diverse and inclusive workforce. It continues 
to support initiatives to encourage more women and people from ethnic
minorities to pursue careers in engineering.The Group recognises the need to
promote its policies effectively and widely reﬂecting the international scope of 
its operations.
The Group’s policy is to provide, wherever possible, employment and training
and development opportunities for disabled people. It is also committed to
supporting employees who become disabled and to helping disabled employees
make the best possible use of their skills and potential.
The Group actively encourages employee share ownership. All employees
are regularly invited to participate in sharesave plans and the workforce has
committed to save over £90 million to buy shares in the Company. In addition,
statutory arrangements enable UK employees to receive part of their annual
bonus in Company shares and make monthly share purchases from their salary.
Learning and development 
To strengthen its competitive position, the Group has over many years invested in
the training and development of its employees, customers and suppliers. In 2005,
we spent £30 million on the education, training and professional development of
employees.
Training programmes were delivered to support major change programmes.
In particular, we have launched the ‘Process Excellence’initiative to improve our
management and operating processes and we have trained people to undertake
speciﬁc projects to raise standards of performance and improve customer
satisfaction.
Some 2,000 people were trained to support ‘Product Lifecycle Management’
which enables the Group and its supply chain to deliver products and services at
a higher quality and with greater efﬁciency.
The Company offers employees access to wide-ranging courses on-line and
over 5,000 employees have taken an on-line course over the past two years.
The Group continues to attract trainees into its skilled and professional
workforce. In the UK, graduate applications totalled over 3,500 in 2005 and we
recruited 183 graduates.We also recruited 136 apprentices and technicians. In
addition, over 500 undergraduate students were employed for training periods of
between two and 12 months. At the end of the year, worldwide there were 273
graduates and 370 apprentices and technicians in formal training programmes.
In 2005, the Group was ranked ﬁrst in its business sector and 24th overall in
the UK Times Newspaper Top 100 Graduate Employers list.
The Group continues to work closely with schools, colleges and universities
to promote science, technology and enterprise. Our policy is to work with
government, local and national bodies and educational institutions to widen
pupils’and students’experience of industry and to promote careers in the
aerospace, marine and energy sectors. In 2005, the Group progressed two ﬂagship
activities: Proﬁtable Pursuit, a business simulation to stimulate enterprise
education in schools, and the Rolls-Royce Science Prize which promotes and
rewards science teaching in schools and colleges in the UK and the Republic of
Ireland. In 2005 the ﬁrst round ﬁnalists and special merit award winning teams
were selected, representing a wide range of schools.

Report of the directors continued
The Group supports educational projects and initiatives to promote engineering
education in schools including Open Industry, Specialist Schools, Education Action
Zones and Science and Engineering Ambassadors. In North America, Rolls-Royce
supports ‘Project Lead the Way,’a programme which creates partnerships with
schools to encourage more students to consider careers in engineering and
technology.
Some of the Group’s training facilities are made available to local
communities with free places being offered on internal training programmes.
In addition, working on local community projects forms a key part in developing
employees.
We continue to meet customer training needs with management and
business education.We led the initiative to establish the British University in Dubai
and developed executive programmes for China’s aviation industry leaders. Under
the UK Government’s Chevening scheme, the Group sponsored students from
Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Taiwan.We also manage a company
scheme for placing English language teachers in China, arranging 40 assignments
for UK graduates.
Community investment 
The Group community investment committee is responsible for the Group’s
policy on charitable donations. In 2005, total charitable donations amounted to
£1,484,000. A list of the principal donations made in the year is available on
written request to the Company Secretary.
The committee is supported by national committees and all operate within
the following guidelines:
‘As a forward-looking, innovative and global company, Rolls-Royce Group plc
is committed to being a good corporate citizen in its operations throughout the
world.The Group’s policy on donations is to direct its support primarily to causes
with educational, engineering and scientiﬁc objectives, as well as to social
objectives connected with the Group’s business and place in the wider
community.’
During 2005, charitable donations in the UK amounted to £671,000.They
included support for The Prince’s Trust, Community Foundations, SS Great Britain,
The Industrial Trust and Duxford AirSpace.
The Group has made charitable donations of £563,000 in other major
regions. In North America, this included support for the work of United Way,
Habitat for Humanity, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and
Purdue University. In Germany, the Group supported a range of organisations
including the Brandenburg Summer Festival,World Youth Day and the
International Airport Race. In the Nordic countries, it supported a number of local
sports and arts-based projects.
In response to the tsunami disaster in south east Asia, the Group contributed
£250,000 in 2004 and an additional £250,000 in 2005 to match employee
donations. Funding is being used to support a number of projects in the affected
areas, including the construction of a primary care clinic in Aceh, Indonesia, the
construction of a school in India and other projects in Thailand.
Our response to the hurricane Katrina disaster was very visible in the
devastated communities affected.The Group provided housing, transportation
and medical support, followed by a range of special support services. Employee
groups mobilised their support through food and clothing drives and also raised
over £35,000.The Rolls-Royce response was exemplary and was recognised as
such both externally and internally.
In addition to our charitable donations, contributions of £1,700,000 were
made by the Group’s sponsorship committee and individual business groups,
primarily to support arts and educational programmes.
The Group also ﬁnances the administration of the Payroll Giving Scheme for
UK employees. In 2005, the scheme helped employees make donations of over
£396,000 to over 200 charities of their choice. Sixteen per cent of employees
participate, one of the highest levels in the UK.The scheme received a Gold Award
from the UK Institute of Fundraising in 2005. In addition, 36 per cent of employees
in North America have contributed over £200,000 to good causes through ‘United
Way’schemes, which are partly matched by the Company.
The Company also supports its commitment to being a good corporate citizen
by supporting projects in which employees are encouraged to participate.
Examples include:
– running successful mentoring and literacy programmes for school pupils
through education business partnerships ;
– participating in the UK’s Science and Engineering Ambassadors Scheme;
– undertaking community projects with trainees as part of their training;
– supporting employees who are school governors; and
– providing business mentors and advisers through The Prince’s Trust and
Young Enterprise.
The Group offers support in-kind to local initiatives including providing places on
in-house training programmes; donating surplus computer equipment and
furniture; and offering the free use of meeting rooms and premises.
The Company is a member of Business in the Community and actively
supports Common Purpose programmes across the UK.These two organisations
aim to promote greater business awareness and involvement in wider
community issues and to encourage greater employee participation.
Rolls-Royce has a long and successful history of community involvement
which it is determined to maintain.We continue to attach particular priority to
supporting education, the environment, the arts and economic and social
regeneration. Our approach supports our values of reliability, integrity and
innovation.

Directors’remuneration report Information not subject to audit
Introduction
This report to shareholders covers:
– The policy under which the executive directors, the Chairman and the 
non-executive directors are remunerated; and
– Details of the remuneration and share interests of the executive directors
and the fees paid to the Chairman and the non-executive directors.
It provides the information required by the Directors’Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002 (the Regulations) and describes how the Company applies 
the principles of the Combined Code in relation to executive directors’
remuneration.The Company conﬁrms that it complies with the requirements 
of the Combined Code.
The report was approved by the remuneration committee (the committee)
on February 6, 2006 and was signed on the Board’s behalf by Carl Symon as 
the Chairman of the committee. A resolution will be put to shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on May 3, 2006 inviting them to approve 
this report.
The remuneration committee
The committee has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on
the Group’s policy towards executive remuneration.The committee determines,
on the Board’s behalf, the speciﬁc remuneration packages of the executive
directors and a number of senior executives. It also makes recommendations to
the Board on the remuneration of the Chairman. A copy of the committee’s terms
of reference is available in the Investors section on the Group’s website at 
www.rolls-royce.com
The committee consists exclusively of independent, non-executive directors.
At January 1, 2005, it was chaired by Carl Symon and its other members were
Peter Byrom and Carl-Peter Forster. With effect from February 9, 2005, the 
Hon Amy Bondurant and Sir John Taylor joined the committee, with the
chairmanship and other members of the committee remaining unchanged
throughout the year.
In 2005, Simon Robertson, Chairman, Sir John Rose, Chief Executive,
John Rivers, Director – Human Resources, and Charles Blundell, Company
Secretary, attended meetings by invitation of the committee but were not
present during any discussion of their own emoluments.
The committee met on six occasions in 2005 and details of members’
attendance are set out on page 34.
Advice to the remuneration committee
The committee may call for information and advice from advisers inside and
outside the Group. In 2005, Simon Robertson and Sir John Rose made
recommendations to the committee relating to the performance of their direct
reports. Internal support was provided primarily by John Rivers, advised by
Deloitte & Touche LLP . Additional advice was provided by senior employees from
Human Resources, Finance and Business Development.
The committee received advice on remuneration matters from Deloitte &
Touche LLP and the Company’s lawyers, Freshﬁelds Bruckhaus Deringer.
During 2005, Deloitte & Touche LLP also advised the Group on tax, assurance,
pensions and corporate ﬁnance.
Remuneration policy
The policy framework
The Group operates in a highly competitive, international market. Its business is
complex, technologically advanced and has long time horizons.The Group is
committed to achieving sustained improvements in performance and this
depends crucially on the individual contributions made by the executive team
and by employees at all levels.The Board therefore believes that an effective
remuneration strategy plays an essential part in the future success of the Group.
Accordingly the Board has adopted, on the recommendation of the
committee, a remuneration policy reﬂecting the following broad principles which
it will continue to apply in 2006:
i) the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives should
reﬂect their responsibilities and contain incentives to deliver the Group’s
performance objectives; it must also be capable of attracting and retaining
the individuals necessary for business success;
ii) a signiﬁcant proportion of total remuneration should be based on Group
and individual performance, both in the short and long term; and
iii) the system of remuneration should establish a close identity of interest
between senior executives and shareholders through measures such as
encouraging the acquisition of a signiﬁcant shareholding in the Company.
When determining remuneration the committee takes into account pay and
employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
The committee regularly reviews both the competitiveness of the Group’s
remuneration structure and its effectiveness in incentivising executives to
enhance value for shareholders over the longer term. It considers that a successful
remuneration policy needs to be sufﬁciently ﬂexible to take account of future
changes in the Group’s business environment and in remuneration practice.
The main components of remuneration 
The main components of remuneration comprise base salary, annual incentive
arrangements, long-term share-based incentives and pension and life assurance
beneﬁts. Executive directors and senior executives are also entitled to a company
car or car allowance, private medical insurance, ﬁnancial counselling and, in the
case of James Guyette, a housing allowance.
The committee considers that there should be a continuing emphasis on
those elements of remuneration, such as annual and long-term incentives, which
directly inﬂuence the performance of senior executives.
Base salaries
In determining the relative importance of these elements of remuneration, the
committee believes that base salaries should be set at levels required to recruit
and retain high quality senior executives.
The committee believes that base salaries should be set with reference to
the median level of the relevant marketplace for companies of a similar size and
complexity. All salary increases must be justiﬁed on the basis of performance and
are not automatic.
Other beneﬁts are generally at the median of market practice.

Annual incentives
Executive directors and selected senior executives participate in the Annual
Performance Related Award plan (APRA). For UK participants APRA awards do not
form part of pensionable earnings.
Target and maximum APRA bonus opportunity
Under APRA as operated in 2005, executive directors were eligible for awards in
accordance with the table below.

It is possible for a bonus award to be increased by a further 20 per cent to reﬂect exceptional 
personal performance.
2
The award for Colin Green reﬂected the performance of the business sector for which he is
responsible, in addition to Group and personal objectives.
3
Colin Smith was appointed as an executive director on July 1, 2005. His maximum bonus award was
increased from 45 per cent to 80 per cent from the date of his appointment as an executive director.
Performance measures
The APRA performance measures set by the committee are based on the Group’s
annual operating plans. For 2005, the measures for executive directors included
underlying proﬁt, average cash balance, cash ﬂow and personal performance
against speciﬁc personal objectives. Forty per cent of any APRA bonus depends
on personal performance against these speciﬁc objectives.
In 2005, to emphasise the importance of the corporate result, the APRA
bonus pool available for distribution to all participants was generated solely by
the ﬁnancial performance of the Group and no bonus would have been available
to any participant unless the Group achieved predetermined performance
targets.The performance of the business sector in which an executive is
employed is also a factor in that it determines the extent to which an executive
has access to the pool generated by corporate performance.
All executive directors have a high proportion of their annual remuneration
at risk. For the Chief Executive, his 120 per cent maximum bonus opportunity
means that 55 per cent of his combined basic pay and bonus opportunity is
directly related to annual ﬁnancial and personal performance. In 2005, the level of
achievement against the ﬁnancial measures was sufﬁcient to generate 95 per
cent of the bonus for individual participants.
Deferred APRA award
One third of the value of APRA is delivered in the form of a deferred award in the
Company’s shares. A participant who is granted a deferred share award under
APRA must normally continue to remain an employee of the Group for two years
from the date of the award in order to retain the full number of shares, although
shares will be released early in certain circumstances including retirement or
redundancy.
The value of any deferred share awards is derived from the annual bonus
criteria and is therefore dependent on personal and business ﬁnancial
performance; the release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the
achievement of any further performance conditions.The deferred share element
operated for 2005 will result in share awards as described on page 43.The
committee intends to maintain the deferred share element in respect of 2006.
This arrangement provides a strong link between performance and
remuneration, promotes a culture of share ownership amongst the Group’s senior
management and encourages decisions in the long-term interest of shareholders.
Other annual incentives
The same targets set for APRA are used for the All-Employee Bonus Scheme,
which enables all employees worldwide to receive a bonus of up to two weeks’
pay, based on corporate and business performance.Those executives
participating in APRA are excluded from the All-Employee Bonus Scheme.
A Deferred Share Incentive Plan (DSIP) was operated for 2002, which was
restricted to a small number of key executives, including executive directors. No
awards under the DSIP were made in 2005 and it is not intended that the plan
will be operated again. DSIP grants made in 2002 vest in April 2006.
Long-term incentives
In 2003 the committee completed a review of long-term incentive arrangements
and concluded that the introduction of a new plan, the Rolls-Royce Group plc
Performance Share Plan (PSP), would provide stronger incentives to improve
Group performance than executive share options. Shareholders approved the
introduction of the PSP at the 2004 AGM. As stated in the 2004 Annual report, the
committee does not intend to make further grants under the Rolls-Royce 1999
Executive Share Option Plan.
Rolls-Royce Group plc Performance Share Plan
The PSP is designed to reward and incentivise selected senior executives who can
inﬂuence the long-term performance of the Group.
Under the rules of the PSP selected executives are granted conditional share
awards entitling them to a number of shares determined by reference to
corporate performance over a three-year performance period.The measures of
corporate performance are cash generation, earnings and total shareholder
return.These measures are considered particularly important in generating
shareholder value and are explained in more detail on page 41.There is no
retesting of the performance criteria and no automatic vesting in the event of 
a take-over.
PSP award levels
The sizes of the awards under the PSP are aimed at the median of the
marketplace for UK companies of a similar size and complexity to the Group.
In 2005, Sir John Rose received an award of shares with a market value at the time
of grant of 100 per cent of his annual salary. For other executive directors and
business heads the grant was 66.6 per cent, and 50 per cent for other members of
the Group Executive. During the year the committee reviewed the PSP award
levels against market practice and for 2006 it is intended that the award level
policy will be 110 per cent, 80 per cent and 65 per cent of annual salary
respectively for the Chief Executive, executive directors and business heads, and
other members of the Group Executive.The rules of the PSP permit grants of up
to 200 per cent of annual salary. As described below, it is possible for the number
of shares under an award to be increased by a further 25 per cent based on the
Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance.
2005 Directors&Rem.qxd  15/3/06  07:58  Page 40 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
41
Performance measures
No shares will be released from the PSP unless the growth in the Company’s
Earnings Per Share (EPS) exceeds the UK retail price index by three per cent per
year over the performance period.
The number of shares released (if any) will be determined in accordance
with Cash Flow Per Share (CPS) targets, which will not be adjusted for inﬂation.
CPS is calculated as cash ﬂow after interest, taxation and capital expenditure, but
before cost of business acquisitions or proceeds of disposals and payments to
shareholders, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue.
Shareholders have authorised the committee to set CPS performance
targets for future grants provided that, in the committee’s reasonable judgement,
the targets are no less challenging in the light of the Group’s business
circumstances and its internal forecasts than the targets for the initial grant in
2004 as approved by shareholders.
The following CPS targets will apply to the grants to be made in 2006:
Aggregate CPS over Percentage of
three-year performance period maximum award released
52p 30%
69p 100%
The committee believes that these CPS targets are challenging and that the
performance necessary to achieve awards towards the upper end of the range is
stretching.They should not, therefore, be interpreted as providing guidance on
the Group’s performance over the relevant period.
Intermediate levels of performance attract pro rata releases.The shares
released will be determined by the total CPS generated over the three-year
period.
The Company’s TSR over the performance period will be compared with 
the TSR of the companies constituting the FTSE 100 index on the date of grant.
This comparison will be carried out by an external independent agency. If the
Company’s TSR exceeds the median of that group of companies, the number of
shares due to be released to an executive following achievement of the EPS and
CPS targets will be increased by 25 per cent.
EPS and TSR performance measures are calculated from a base year, which 
is the year before grant.
In line with the committee’s established policy, it is envisaged that existing
shares will be used to satisfy awards, but in order to provide ﬂexibility, the PSP
rules permit the issue of new issue shares within standard limits.
Share retention policy
The committee requires participants in the PSP to retain at least one half of the
number of after tax shares released from the PSP until their retirement, except
that shares may be sold within one year before the normal or agreed retirement
date or on leaving for any other reason once a committed date has been agreed.
This exception is intended to ensure that participants are not disadvantaged
under capital gains tax rules on leaving employment.
Executive share option plan
As mentioned on page 40, following the introduction of the PSP it is not intended
to continue granting executive share options.
The exercise of existing options is subject to a performance condition that
the Company’s growth in underlying EPS must exceed the UK retail price index
by an average of three per cent per year over a rolling three-year period.These
performance conditions apply to all the executive directors.The committee
reviews achievement of the EPS target annually.
In 2001, in order to help meet a series of demanding challenges, key
members of the executive team, including the executive directors, received a
larger than normal level of grant. As described in the Company’s 2001 Annual
report, this award had more demanding performance criteria and personal share
ownership requirements (see pages 46 and 47).
All-employee share plans
The committee believes that share-based plans make a signiﬁcant contribution to
the close involvement and interest of all employees in the Group’s performance.
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the Group’s all-employee share
plans on the same terms as other employees.There are three main elements to
these arrangements:
i) the ShareSave Plan – a savings-related share option plan available to all
employees.This plan operates within speciﬁc tax legislation (including a
requirement to ﬁnance the exercise of the option using the proceeds of a
monthly savings contract).The exercise of the option is not subject to the
achievement of a performance target;
ii) the ‘Free Share’element of the Share Incentive Plan, under which UK
employees receive shares of up to the equivalent of one week’s pay as part
of the Company component of any bonus paid for 2005; and
iii) the ‘Partnership Share’element of the Share Incentive Plan under which UK
employees may make regular purchases of shares from pre-tax income.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The committee is working closely with the audit committee to monitor and react
appropriately to any impact which the introduction of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) may have on the performance measures under annual
and long-term incentive plans. In particular, since many of the performance
targets were set based on UK GAAP , but will be measured under IFRS, appropriate
adjustments will be made to ensure that performance is measured on a
consistent basis.
Service contracts
The committee’s policy is that executive directors appointed to the Board are
offered notice periods of 12 months.The committee recognises that in the case of
appointments to the Board from outside the Group, it may be necessary to offer a
longer initial notice period, which would subsequently reduce to 12 months after
that initial period.
The committee has a deﬁned policy on compensation and mitigation to be
applied in the event of a UK director’s contract being prematurely terminated. In
these circumstances, steps are taken to ensure that poor performance is not
rewarded.When calculating termination payments, the committee takes into
account a range of factors such as age, length of service contract and the
director’s obligation to mitigate his or her own loss.
The following table summarises the terms of executive directors’service
contracts.
Notice period Notice period

In the event of the service contracts for Sir John Rose or Colin Green being terminated by the
Company, other than in accordance with the contracts’terms, they are entitled to receive a liquidated
sum calculated as 12 months’salary and beneﬁts. Performance related payments are not covered under
this arrangement, although an annual bonus may be paid if the executive is in post at the end of the
year.

James Guyette has a contract with Rolls-Royce North America Inc, drawn up under the laws of the
State of Virginia. It provides that on termination without cause he is entitled to 12 months’severance
pay without mitigation, and in addition appropriate relocation costs.

Executive directors’directorships of other companies
During 2005, Sir John Rose was a non-executive director of Eli Lilly and Company
until his resignation on October 14, 2005. James Guyette was a director of the
Private Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, Illinois and of priceline.com Inc. and
Andrew Shilston was a non-executive director of Cairn Energy PLC.
In all these cases, the director retained the relevant fees from serving on the
boards of these companies, as shown in the table below:

In addition to an annual fee, James Guyette received 8,000 stock options in priceline.com at an option
price of US$22.59 per share. He also received 3,000 stock options in Private Bank at an option price of
US$30.59 per share.

Following the resignation of Sir John Rose from the board of Eli Lilly and Company, he received 
1,216 shares in respect of the release of shares from the Lilly Directors’Deferral Plan.
Non-executive directors
The Chairman and the non-executive directors have letters of appointment rather
than service contracts. No compensation is payable to the Chairman or to any
non-executive director if the appointment is terminated early.
Non-executive directors’fees
The Board takes account of independent market surveys in determining the fees
payable to the Chairman and the non-executive directors.The committee makes
recommendations to the Board on the remuneration of the Chairman.The fees
paid to the Chairman and non-executive directors are shown in the emoluments
table on page 43.
Up to April 2005, each non-executive director received an annual fee of
£30,000. In addition, fees of £6,000 per annum were paid to members of the audit,
remuneration and nominations committees, with the chairmen of the audit and
remuneration committees receiving a further £6,000 per annum.
In February 2005 the Board reviewed the fees payable to non-executive
directors as reported in the 2004 Annual report. It concluded that there was a
strong case for increasing the non-executive directors’fees to more competitive
levels in order to reﬂect the increased responsibilities and time commitments
which changes in corporate governance were imposing on all non-executive
directors.The Board therefore agreed that with effect from May 2005 a 
non-executive director would receive an annual fee of £50,000 covering his or 
her membership of the Board and of Board committees.The audit committee
chairman and the remuneration committee chairman would receive additional
fees of £15,000 and £12,000 per annum respectively.The senior independent
director would receive an additional fee of £5,000 per annum for carrying out 
this role.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors are not eligible to participate
in any of the Group’s share schemes, incentive arrangements or pension schemes.
A facility is in place which enables non-executive directors to use some or all of
their fees, after the appropriate statutory deductions, to make market purchases of
shares in the Company on a monthly basis.

Pensions
James Guyette participates in pension plans sponsored by Rolls-Royce North America Inc.
All other executive directors who are under their normal retirement ages are members of the Group’s UK pension schemes.These schemes are funded and
approved deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes providing, at retirement, a pension of up to two thirds of ﬁnal remuneration.
New HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) pensions regulations are effective from April 2006.There is no intention to compensate directors or other senior
executives for any additional tax they may be required to pay as a result of these regulations.
The committee has determined that where further pension accrual would exceed the new HMRC annual and/or lifetime allowances applicable from April 6, 2006,
executives may choose to opt out of pension accrual and receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension provision. Alternatively, as permitted under the new pension
regime, the committee will have the discretion to enable the drawing of pension beneﬁts to commence while the executive is still in employment with the Group.
In such circumstances the pension schemes provide for appropriate early retirement factors to reduce the pension payable.

The ﬁgure in brackets is the increase in pension/retirement lump sum during the year ended December 31, 2005 but in this case excluding the effect of inﬂation.
2
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, based on service to the end of the year.
3
The transfer values stated represent liabilities of the Rolls-Royce sponsored pension schemes and not sums paid to the individuals.The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in
accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 (GN11). GN11 covers individual transfer calculations and the above ﬁgures have been calculated using assumptions certiﬁed by the Actuaries as being consistent
with GN11.Transfer values calculated on this basis will vary up or down from one year to the next due to changes in ﬁnancial conditions, principally long-term interest rates from which the Actuary derives the
assumptions used to place a capital value on the pension entitlement.Whilst ﬂuctuating up or down in individual years, transfer values generally trend upwards over time as individuals complete more service
and become older. A large part of the increase in transfer values over 2005 is attributable to falls in the market interest rates on which the transfer value calculations are based.
4
The ﬁgure in brackets is the transfer value of the increase in pension/retirement lump sum during the year ended December 31, 2005 excluding the effect of inﬂation, and net of the member’s own contributions.
5
Dr Mike Howse ceased to accrue pension beneﬁts after reaching his normal retirement age on July 1, 2004. He began receiving his pension beneﬁts from this date, although he remained an executive director
until he retired from the Board on June 30, 2005. No pension beneﬁts were therefore earned by Dr Mike Howse over the six month period in 2005 while he remained a director.
6
The Group operates the Rolls-Royce Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS).The purpose of the SRS is to fund pension provision above the pensionable earnings cap which was imposed on approved pension
schemes under the 1989 Finance Act. Membership of the SRS is restricted to executive directors and to a limited number of senior executives.The members of the SRS include Andrew Shilston. He joined the
Group after the introduction of the earnings cap and his terms and conditions on joining the Group included a commitment to provide pension and life cover based on total salary, in line with other directors and
senior executives. Employer contributions to the SRS during 2005 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2005 for the approved deﬁned beneﬁt plans, and are therefore included in the ﬁgures
shown in the right hand column of the ﬁrst table. In addition, the employer has paid £51,000 to Andrew Shilston directly in order to meet the income tax liability that he will incur on these employer contributions
to the unapproved plan.
7
Colin Smith was appointed as a director with effect from July 1, 2005.The additional pension earned and the corresponding transfer value relate only to the period for which he was a director ie to the period 
July 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005. For Colin Smith, the comparator transfer value ﬁgure at the start of the year is the value as at June 30, 2005, immediately before his date of appointment as a director.
8
Members of the schemes have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions. Neither the contributions nor the resulting beneﬁts are included in the above table.
9
Beneﬁts are translated at US$1.82 = £1.
10
The lump sum entitlement shown is that which would be paid on immediate retirement based on service to the end of the year.
11
The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice.
12
James Guyette is a member of two deﬁned beneﬁt plans in the USA, one qualiﬁed and one non-qualiﬁed. He accrues a retirement lump sum beneﬁt in both of these plans which, as cash balance arrangements,
operate on the same basis as deﬁned contribution except a guaranteed minimum rate of interest of four per cent is applied to investments.The aggregate value of the retirement lump sums accrued in these
two plans, and the transfer values of these beneﬁts, are shown in the second table. In addition, James Guyette is a member of two 401(k) deﬁned beneﬁt savings plans in the USA, one qualiﬁed and one 
non-qualiﬁed, to which both he and his employer, Rolls-Royce North America Inc., contribute.The aggregate employer contribution invested in the cash balance and 401(k) plans each year is calculated with
reference to taxable basic and annual incentive compensation to reﬂect market practice in the USA. However, this is capped at no more than 26 per cent of basic salary. James Guyette is also a member of an
unfunded non-qualiﬁed deferred compensation plan in the USA, to which his employer makes notional contributions calculated with reference to his basic salary. Employer contributions to the 401(k) and
deferred compensation plans during 2005 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2005 for the deﬁned beneﬁt plans, and are therefore included in the ﬁgures shown in the right hand column of
the second table.

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
1  Signiﬁcant accounting policies
The Company
Rolls-Royce Group plc (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in the United
Kingdom.The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Company for the year
ended December 31, 2005 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together
referred to as the ‘Group’) and the Group’s interest in jointly controlled entities.
The ﬁnancial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 
February 8, 2006.
Basis of preparation and statement of compliance
In accordance with European Union (EU) regulations, these ﬁnancial statements
have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as
adopted for use in the EU effective at December 31, 2005, together with the
amendment to IAS 19 Employee Beneﬁts – as explained under post-retirement
beneﬁts below.The Company has elected to prepare its parent company
accounts under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP).
These are the Group’s ﬁrst consolidated ﬁnancial statements prepared in
accordance with adopted IFRS.
The Group has adopted the exemption granted by IFRS 1 First-time
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards that IAS 32 and IAS 39
Financial Instruments need not be applied to the comparative period.
Consequently the restated results for the year ended December 31, 2004 have
been prepared using the accounting policies for ﬁnancial instruments previously
adopted under UK GAAP . Additionally the following optional exemptions,
provided by IFRS 1 from full retrospective application of IFRS accounting policies,
have been applied:
– Business combinations – the provisions of IFRS 3 have been applied from
January 1, 2004.The net carrying value of goodwill at December 31, 2003
under the previous accounting policies has been deemed to be the cost at
January 1, 2004;
– Property, plant and equipment – where assets have previously been
revalued, the revalued amount at January 1, 2004 has been deemed to be
the cost at January 1, 2004;
– Cumulative translation differences arising on consolidation of overseas
subsidiaries are required to be held in a separate reserve.This reserve has
been deemed to be nil on January 1, 2004.
An explanation of how the transition to IFRS has affected the reported ﬁnancial
position, ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows of the Group is provided in 
note 33, which also includes the balance sheet at January 1, 2005 showing the
impact of the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 in 2005.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis
except where IFRS require an alternative treatment.The principal variations from
the historical cost basis relate to pensions (IAS 19), monetary items (IAS 21),
ﬁnancial instruments (IAS 39) and share-based payments (IFRS 2).
The Group’s signiﬁcant accounting policies are set out below, together with
the judgements made by management in applying these policies, which have
the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements,
apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with separately below.
These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented
in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements and in preparing an opening IFRS
balance sheet at January 1, 2004 for the purposes of the transition to IFRS subject
to the application of IFRS 1 as noted.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by Group entities.
Basis of consolidation
The Group ﬁnancial statements include the ﬁnancial statements of the Company
and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to December 31, together with the
Group’s share of the results of joint ventures up to December 31.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control exists when the
Company has the power, directly or indirectly to govern the ﬁnancial and
operating policies of the entity so as to derive beneﬁts from its activities.
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest
and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers
under a contractual arrangement.The results of joint ventures are accounted for
using the equity method of accounting.
Any subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures sold or acquired during the
year are included up to, or from, the dates of change of control.
Signiﬁcant accounting policies and judgements applied
Foreign currency translation
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into local
currency at the rate ruling at the year end. Exchange differences arising on foreign
exchange transactions and the retranslation of assets and liabilities into sterling at
the rate ruling at the year end are taken into account in determining proﬁt before
taxation.
The trading results of overseas undertakings are translated at the average
exchange rates for the year. Exchange adjustments arising from the retranslation
of the opening net investments, and from the translation of the proﬁts or losses at
average rates, are taken to equity.The net investment hedging of overseas
undertakings is described under hedge accounting.
Revenue recognition
Revenues comprise sales to outside customers after discounts, excluding value
added tax.
Sales of products are recognised when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of
ownership of the goods are transferred to the customer, the sales price agreed
and the receipt of payment can be assured. On occasion, the Group may
participate in the ﬁnancing of engines in conjunction with airframe
manufacturers. In such circumstances, the contingent obligations arising under
these arrangements are taken into account in assessing whether signiﬁcant risk
and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.Where it is
judged that sufﬁcient risks and rewards are not transferred, the transaction is
treated as a leasing transaction, resulting in an operating lease between the
Group and the customer. No deliveries of engines were treated as operating
leases during 2005. Depending on the speciﬁc circumstances, where applicable,
the ﬁnancing arrangements may result in the consolidation of the entity
established to facilitate the ﬁnancing. Such special purpose entities will be
consolidated as required by IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial
Statements if it is considered that the Group controls the entity.The Group has
consolidated one such entity (Pembroke 717 Holdings Limited).
Sales of services are recognised by reference to the stage of completion
based on services performed to date.The assessment of the stage of completion
is dependent on the nature of the contract, but will generally be based on: costs
incurred to the extent these relate to services performed up to the reporting date;
achievement of contractual milestones where appropriate; or ﬂying hours or
equivalent for long-term aftermarket arrangements.
Linked sales of product and services are treated as a single contract where
these components have been negotiated as a single commercial package and
are so closely interrelated that they do not operate independently of each other
and are considered to form a single project with an overall proﬁt margin. Revenue
is recognised on the same basis as for other sales of products and services as
described above.
Provided that the outcome of construction contracts can be assessed with
reasonable certainty, the revenues and costs on such contracts are recognised
based on stage of completion and the overall contract proﬁtability.

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued
Full provision is made for any estimated losses to completion of contracts having
regard to the overall substance of the arrangements.
Progress payments received, when greater than recorded revenue are
deducted from the value of work in progress except to the extent that payments
on account exceed the value of work in progress on any contract where the
excess is included in trade and other payables.The amount by which recorded
revenue of long-term contracts is in excess of payments on account is classiﬁed
as ‘amounts recoverable on contracts’and is separately disclosed within trade and
other receivables.
Risk and revenue sharing partnerships (RRSPs)
From time to time, the Group enters into arrangements with partners who, in
return for a share in future programme revenues or proﬁts, make cash payments
that are not refundable (except under certain remote circumstances). Cash sums
received, which reimburse the Group for past expenditure, are credited to other
operating income.The arrangements also require partners to undertake
development work and/or supply components for use in the programme at their
own expense. No accounting entries are recorded where partners undertake such
development work or where programme components are supplied by partners
because no obligation arises unless and until programme sales are made; instead,
payments to partners for their share in the programme are charged to cost of
sales as programme revenues arise.
The Group has arrangements with partners who do not undertake
development work or supply parts. Such arrangements are considered to be
ﬁnancial instruments as deﬁned by IAS 32 and are accounted for using the
amortised cost method.
Government investment
Where a government or similar body invests in a development programme, the
Group treats such receipts as the sale of an interest in the programme.
Subsequent payments are royalty payments and are matched to related sales.
Research and development
In accordance with IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ , expenditure incurred on research
and development, excluding known recoverable amounts on contracts, and
contributions to shared engineering programmes, is distinguished as relating
either to a research phase or to a development phase.
All research phase expenditure is charged to the income statement. For
development expenditure, this is capitalised as an internally generated intangible
asset, only if it meets strict criteria, relating in particular to technical feasibility and
generation of future economic beneﬁts.
Expenditure that cannot be classiﬁed into these two categories is treated as
being incurred in the research phase.The Group considers that, due to the
complex nature of new equipment programmes, it is not possible to distinguish
reliably between research and development activities until relatively late in the
programme.
Expenditure capitalised is amortised over its useful economic life, up to a
maximum of 15 years from the entry-into-service of the product.The intangible
assets are assessed for impairment bi-annually, or earlier if there are indications of
impairment.
Recoverable engine costs
On occasion, the Group may sell original equipment to customers at a value
below its cost, on the basis that this deﬁcit will be recovered from future
aftermarket sales to the original customer.Where the Group has a contractual
right to supply aftermarket parts to the customer and its intellectual rights,
warranty arrangements and statutory airworthiness requirements provide
reasonable control over this supply; these arrangements are considered to meet
the deﬁnition of an intangible asset. Such intangible assets are recognised and
amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected period of utilisation by the
original customer, generally a maximum of ten years unless the speciﬁc
contractual circumstances indicate a longer period.The assets are tested for
impairment on a bi-annual basis.
Purchased goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration for
shares in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures over the fair value to the
Group of the net assets acquired.
i) To December 31, 1997: Goodwill was written off to reserves in the year of
acquisition.
ii) From January 1, 1998: Goodwill was recognised within intangible assets in
the year in which it arose and amortised on a straight line basis over its
useful economic life, up to a maximum of 20 years.
iii) From January 1, 2004, in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’
goodwill is recognised as per (ii) above but is no longer amortised. Instead it
is subject to annual impairment testing.
Certiﬁcation costs and participation fees
Costs incurred in respect of meeting regulatory certiﬁcation requirements for new
civil engine/aircraft combinations and payments made to airframe manufacturers
for this, and participation fees, are carried forward in intangible assets to the extent
that they can be recovered out of future sales and are charged to the income
statement over the programme life, up to a maximum of 15 years.
Post-retirement beneﬁts
Pensions and similar beneﬁts (principally healthcare) are accounted for under 
IAS 19 ‘Employee Beneﬁts’ . For deﬁned beneﬁt plans, obligations are measured at
discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value.The service
and ﬁnancing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income
statement; current service costs are spread systematically over the lives of
employees and ﬁnancing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
The Group has adopted the amendment to IAS 19 early, whereby actuarial gains
and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income
and expense.
Payments to deﬁned contribution schemes are charged as an expense as
they fall due.
Share-based payments
The Group applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments from
January 1, 2004. In accordance with the transition provisions, IFRS 2 has been
applied to all grants made after November 7, 2002 that were unvested as of
January 1, 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair
value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date 
of grant.The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled 
share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares or options that will eventually
vest. For cash-settled share-based payments a liability equal to the proportion of
the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined
at each balance sheet date.
2005 Group Financials.qxd  15/3/06  07:58  Page 56 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2005
57
Fair value is measured using the binomial pricing model for the sharesave plans
and the Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP). Fair values of awards made under the
Performance Share Plan (PSP) are measured using a pricing model adjusted to
reﬂect non-entitlement to dividends (or equivalent) and the Total Shareholder
Return market-based performance condition.
See note 27 for further description of the share-based payment plans.
Financial instruments
IAS 39 requires the classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial instruments into separate categories
for which the accounting requirement is different. Rolls-Royce has classiﬁed its
ﬁnancial instruments as follows:
– Fixed deposits, principally comprising funds held with banks and other
ﬁnancial institutions and trade receivables, are classiﬁed as loans and
receivables.
– Investments (other than interests in joint ventures and ﬁxed deposits) and
short-term deposits (other than ﬁxed deposits) are classiﬁed as available 
for sale.
– Borrowings, trade payables, certain risk and revenue sharing partnerships and
B Shares are classiﬁed as other liabilities.
– Derivatives, comprising foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and
commodity swaps are classiﬁed as held for trading.
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value.Their subsequent
measurement depends on their classiﬁcation:
– Loans and receivables and other liabilities are held at amortised cost and not
revalued unless they are included in a fair value hedge accounting
relationship.Where such a relationship exists, the instruments are revalued in
respect of the risk being hedged. If instruments held at amortised cost are
hedged, generally by interest rate swaps, and the hedges are effective, the
carrying values are adjusted for changes in fair value, which are included in
the income statement.
– Available for sale assets are held at fair value. Changes in fair value arising
from changes in exchange rates are included in the income statement. All
other changes in fair value are taken to equity. On disposal of the related
asset, the accumulated changes in value recorded in equity are included in
the gain or loss recorded in the income statement.
– Held for trading instruments are held at fair value. Changes in fair value are
included in the income statement unless the instrument is included in a
cash ﬂow hedge. If the instruments are included in a cash ﬂow hedging
relationship, which is effective, changes in value are taken to equity.When
the hedged forecast transaction occurs, amounts previously recorded in
equity are recognised in the income statement.
– Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on transactions are recognised in
the income statement.
Hedge accounting
The Group does not apply hedge accounting in respect of forward foreign
exchange contracts held to manage the cash ﬂow exposures of forecast
transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group does not apply hedge accounting in respect of commodity
swaps held to manage the cash ﬂow exposures of forecast transactions in those
commodities.
The Group applies hedge accounting in respect of transactions entered into
to manage the fair value and cash ﬂow exposures of its borrowings. Forward
foreign exchange contracts are held to manage the fair value exposures of
borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and are designated as fair value
hedges. Interest rate swaps are held to manage the interest rate exposures and
are designated as fair value or cash ﬂow hedges of ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate
borrowings respectively.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated as cash ﬂow hedges
and are effective are recognised directly in equity. Any ineffectiveness in the
hedging relationships is included in the income statement.The amounts deferred
in equity are recognised in the income statement to match the recognition of the
hedged item.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and
changes in fair value of the related hedged item are recognised directly in the
income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or
is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁes for hedge accounting. At
that time, for cash ﬂow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging
instrument recognised in equity, is retained in equity until the forecast transaction
occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative
gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
The portion of a gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net
investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is
recognised directly in equity.The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in
the income statement.
Until December 31, 2004, and as allowed by IFRS 1, the Group applied hedge
accounting for forecast foreign exchange transactions and commodity exposures
in accordance with UK GAAP . On January 1, 2005, the fair values of derivatives used
for hedging these exposures were included in the transition hedging reserve.This
reserve is released to the income statement based on the designation of the
hedges on January 1, 2005.
Interest
Interest receivable/payable is credited/charged to the income statement using
the effective interest method.
Taxation
The tax charge on the proﬁt or loss for the year comprises current and 
deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable for the year, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing
for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and
liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation
purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences
arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the Group
is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates
that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled. Deferred tax is
charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items
credited or charged directly to equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt
with in equity.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable proﬁts will be available against which the assets can be utilised.
Segmental reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in
providing products and services. As the risks and rates of return are predominately
affected by differences in these products and services, the primary format for
reporting segment information is based on business segments.

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements continued
Inventory
Inventory and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value on a ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out basis. Cost comprises direct materials and, where
applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in
bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable
value represents the estimated selling prices less all estimated costs of
completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and short-term
deposits with a maturity of three months or less on inception.The Group
considers overdrafts (repayable on demand) to be an integral part of its cash
management activities and these are included in cash and cash equivalents for
the purposes of the cash ﬂow statement.
Property,plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any provision for impairments in value.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the
estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment over their estimated
useful lives. Estimated useful lives are as follows:
i) Land and buildings, as advised by the Group’s professional advisors:
a) Freehold buildings – ﬁve to 45 years (average 23 years).
b) Leasehold buildings – lower of advisors’estimates or period of lease.
c) No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
ii) Plant and equipment – ﬁve to 25 years (average 16 years)
iii) Aircraft and engines – ﬁve to 20 years (average 13 years)
iv) No depreciation is provided on assets in the course of construction.
Leases
i) As Lessee
Assets ﬁnanced by leasing agreements which give rights approximating to
ownership (ﬁnance leases) have been capitalised at their fair value and
depreciation is provided on the basis of the Group depreciation policy.The
capital elements of future obligations under ﬁnance leases are included as
liabilities in the balance sheet and the current year’s interest element, having
been allocated to accounting periods to give a constant periodic rate of
charge on the outstanding liability, is charged to the income statement.The
annual payments under all other lease arrangements, known as operating
leases, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis.
ii) As Lessor
Amounts receivable under ﬁnance leases are included within receivables
and represent the total amount outstanding under the lease agreements
less unearned income. Finance lease income, having been allocated to
accounting periods to give a constant periodic rate of return on the net
investment, is included in revenue.
Rentals receivable under operating leases are included in revenue on a
straight-line basis.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a
past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that
obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors‘ best estimate of the
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are
discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Contingent liabilities
In connection with the sale of its products, the Group will, on some occasions,
provide ﬁnancing support for its customers.These arrangements fall into two
categories; credit based guarantees and asset value guarantees. In accordance
with the requirements of IAS 39 and IFRS 4, credit based guarantees are treated as
insurance contracts. As the Group considers asset value guarantees as being 
non-ﬁnancial liabilities, these have also been treated as insurance contracts.
The Group’s contingent liabilities related to ﬁnancing arrangements are
spread over many years and relate to a number of customers and a broad
product portfolio, and are reported on a discounted basis.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised as income over the periods necessary to
match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
In applying the above accounting policies, management has made appropriate
estimates in many areas, and the actual outcome may differ from those
calculated.The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date,
that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year are:
Forecasts and discount rates
The carrying value of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on
the estimates of future cash ﬂows arising from the Group’s operations:
– The impairment tests for goodwill are dependent on forecasts of the cash
ﬂows of the cash generating units that give rise to the goodwill and the
discount rate applied. No impairment resulted from the annual impairment
tests in 2005.
– If the assessment of development, participation, certiﬁcation and recoverable
engine costs recognised as intangible assets indicates the possibility of
impairment, a detailed impairment test is undertaken.The impairment test
would be dependent on the forecast cash ﬂows of the engine programmes
and customer aftermarket activity as appropriate and the discount rate
applied. No impairment resulted from the assessment in 2005.
– The ﬁnancial liabilities arising from ﬁnancial risk and revenue sharing
partnerships are valued at each reporting date using the amortised cost
method.This involves calculating the present value of the forecast cash ﬂows
of the arrangement using the internal rate of return at the inception of the
arrangement as the discount rate.
– The realisation of the deferred tax assets recognised is dependent on the
generation of sufﬁcient future taxable proﬁts.The Group recognises deferred
tax assets where it is more likely than not that the beneﬁt will be realised.
Assessment of long-term contractual arrangements
The Group has long-term contracts that fall into different accounting periods. In
assessing the allocation of revenues and costs to individual accounting periods,
and the consequential assets and liabilities, the Group estimates the total
revenues and costs forecast to arise in respect of the contract and the stage of
completion based on an appropriate measure of performance.
Post-retirement beneﬁts
The Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes and similar arrangements are
assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19.The accounting valuation, which was
based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in
a deﬁcit of £1,659m before deferred taxation being recognised on the balance
sheet at December 31, 2005.The size of the deﬁcit is sensitive to the market value
of the assets held by the schemes and to actuarial assumptions, which include
price inﬂation, pension and salary increases, the discount rate used in assessing
actuarial liabilities, mortality and other demographic assumptions and the levels
of contributions. Further details are included in note 23.

Provisions
As described in the accounting policy above, the Group measures provisions at
the directors’best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at
the balance sheet date.These estimates are made, taking account of information
available and different possible outcomes.
Contingent liabilities
As described in note 30, the Group has signiﬁcant long-term contingent
obligations.The directors consider that the possibility that there will be any
signiﬁcant loss arising from these contingencies as remote. In reaching this
opinion, the directors have considered the likelihood of the contingency
crystallising and have taken account of forecast aircraft values that generally
provide security against the contingent liability.
2004 policies relating to ﬁnancial instruments
The Group has adopted the exemption granted by IFRS 1 that IAS 32 and IAS 39
Financial Instruments need not be applied to the comparative period.
Consequently the 2004 disclosure provided for ﬁnancial instruments (note 28) is
in accordance with UK GAAP , under which the accounting treatment of the key
ﬁnancial instruments used by the Group is as follows:
i) Gains or losses arising on forward exchange contracts are taken to the proﬁt
and loss account in the same period as the underlying transaction.
ii)  Net interest arising on interest rate agreements is taken to the proﬁt and loss
account.
iii) Premiums paid or received on currency options are taken to the proﬁt and
loss account when the option expires or matures.
iv) Gains or losses arising on jet fuel swaps are taken to the proﬁt and loss
account in the same period as the underlying transaction.
If the underlying transaction to a hedge ceases to exist, the hedge is terminated
and the proﬁts and losses on termination are recognised in the proﬁt and loss
account immediately. If the hedge transaction is terminated, the proﬁts and losses
on termination are held in the balance sheet and amortised over the life of the
original underlying transactions.
Revisions to IFRS not applicable in 2005
During 2005, the IASB published an amendment to IAS 39 relating to Financial
Guarantee Contracts.This amendment is applicable from 2006 and will require
the accounting policy for credit based guarantees to be amended.The Group has
not ﬁnalised its assessment of the impact of adopting this amendment, but does
not anticipate that its impact on the income statement will be signiﬁcant.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and Amendment to IAS 1 Capital
Disclosures are applicable from 2007.These amendments to disclosure
requirements will have no effect on the reported results.
The Group does not consider that any other standards or interpretations
issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a signiﬁcant impact on the
ﬁnancial statements.

7  Earnings per ordinary share and underlying proﬁt reconciliation
The Group seeks to present a measure of underlying performance, which excludes items considered to be non-operating in nature. Underlying proﬁt excludes the
unrealised amounts arising from revaluations required by IAS 32 and IAS 39, and includes the realised amounts arising from settled derivative hedging transactions.The
calculation of underlying proﬁt and underlying earnings per share is shown below. For the year to December 31, 2004, IAS 32 and IAS 39 were not applied and
consequently no adjustment is required.
Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the proﬁt attributable to ordinary shareholders of £350m (2004 £263m) by 1,740 million
(2004 1,690 million) ordinary shares, being the average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held under trust which have been
treated as if they had been cancelled.
Underlying earnings per ordinary share have been calculated as follows:
2005 2004
Pence £m Pence £m
Proﬁt attributable to equity holders of the parent 20.11 350 15.56 263
Exclude:

Related tax effect (2.13) (37) ——
Underlying earnings per ordinary share 24.14 420 15.56 263
Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the proﬁt attributable to ordinary shareholders of £350m (2004 £263m) 
by 1,813 million (2004 1,747 million) ordinary shares, being 1,740 million (2004 1,690 million) as above, adjusted by the bonus element of 
existing share options of 73 million (2004 57 million).

The Group uses various ﬁnancial instruments to manage its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates.The Group uses commodity swaps to manage its
exposure to movements in the price of jet fuel. From January 1, 2005, the Group does not include foreign exchange or commodity ﬁnancial instruments in any cash
ﬂow hedging relationships for accounting purposes.To hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing denominated in US$, the Group has currency derivatives
designated as part of a fair value hedge.

B Shares
Since July 2004, the Company has issued non-cumulative redeemable convertible preference shares (B Shares) as an alternative to paying a cash dividend.
Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their B Shares for cash or convert them into ordinary shares. Any B Shares retained, attract a dividend of 75 per cent of
LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis, and have limited voting rights. In certain circumstances the Company has the option to
compulsorily redeem the B Shares, at any time if the aggregate number of B Shares in issue is less than ten per cent of the aggregate number of B Shares issued, or on
the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.
On a return of capital on a winding-up, the holders of B Shares shall be entitled, in priority to any payment to the holders of ordinary shares, to the repayment of
the nominal capital paid-up or credited as paid-up on the B Shares held by them, together with a sum equal to the outstanding preferential dividend which will have
been accrued but not been paid until the date of return of capital.
Movements in the B Shares during the year were as follows:

In addition there are temporary differences of £467m (2004 £380m) relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures. No deferred tax has been provided in
respect of these differences, since the timing of the reversals can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the future.

23  Post-retirement beneﬁts
Deﬁned beneﬁt schemes
The Group operates a number of deﬁned beneﬁt schemes. For the UK deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds, and
employees are entitled to retirement beneﬁts based on their ﬁnal salaries and length of service.
Overseas deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans. Additionally in the USA, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the
Group’s employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance beneﬁts for retired employees.These schemes are unfunded.
The valuations of the schemes are based on the most recent funding valuations, updated by the scheme actuaries to December 31, 2005.The most recent
funding valuations of the main UK schemes were:
Rolls-Royce Pension Fund – March 31, 2003
Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme – April 5, 2004
Vickers Group Pension Scheme – March 31, 2004
The principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows:

Beneﬁts accruing after April 5, 2005 are assumed to increase in payment at a rate of 2.1 per cent.
The mortality assumptions used for the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund (the largest scheme in the Group) are based upon actual recent mortality experiences of members
within the scheme and also allow for future mortality improvements.
The future costs of healthcare beneﬁts are based on an assumed healthcare costs trend rate of nine per cent grading down to ﬁve per cent over seven years.

Share-based payment plans in operation during the period
The Group had the following share-based payment plans in operation during the period:
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
This plan involves the award of shares to participants subject to performance conditions.Vesting of the performance shares is based on the achievement of both 
non-market based conditions (EPS and cash ﬂow per share) and a market based performance condition (TSR). Further information regarding the operation of the plan
can be found on pages 40 and 41 of the Directors’remuneration report.
Sharesave share option plan
Based on a three or ﬁve year monthly savings contract, eligible employees are granted share options with an exercise price of up to 20 per cent below the share price
when the contract is entered into.Vesting of the options is not subject to the achievement of a performance target. In the UK, the plan is Inland Revenue approved.
Overseas, employees in 28 countries participate in sharesave plans through arrangements broadly comparable to the UK plan. A small proportion of the sharesave
options are settled in cash. Further information regarding the operation of the plan can be found on page 41 of the Directors’remuneration report.
Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP)
This plan involves the grant of market value share options to participants.The options are subject to a non-market based performance condition (growth in EPS).
The options have a maximum contractual life of ten years. Further information regarding the operation of the plan can be found on page 41 of the Directors’
remuneration report.There was no grant of executive share options in 2004 or 2005. Following the introduction of the PSP , it is not intended to grant any further
executive share options.
Annual Performance Related Award plan (APRA) deferred shares
Deferred shares awarded as part of the APRA. One third of the value of any annual bonus is delivered in the form of a deferred share award.The release of deferred
share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that participants remain an employee of the Group for two
years from the date of the award in order to retain the full number of shares. During the two year deferral period, participants are entitled to receive dividends on the
deferred shares.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
The ‘Free Share’element of the Share Incentive Plan (SIP). Eligible employees receive shares with a value of up to one week’s salary.There are no conditions attached to
the shares.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, the Group has recognised an expense in respect of all grants under these plans made after November 7, 2002
and unvested at January 1, 2005.
The Group recognised a total expense of £26m (2004 £19m).

Fair values
The weighted average fair values for PSP awards, Sharesave grants, APRA deferred share awards, and SIP Free Share awards made during the year are as follows:
2005 2004
Pence Pence
PSP 282p 249p
Sharesave – 3 year 131p —
Sharesave – 5 year 154p —
APRA deferred share awards 260p 220p
SIP Free Share awards 257p 231p
Details of the assumptions used in the calculation of these fair values are set out below. Expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company’s share
price over the seven years prior to the grant or award date. Expected dividends were based on the Company’s payments to shareholders over the ﬁve years prior to
the grant or award date.
PSP awards
The fair value of shares awarded under the PSP are calculated using the market value of shares at the time of the award adjusted to take into account non-entitlement
to dividends during the vesting period and the TSR performance condition.The PSP fair values were calculated using the following assumptions:
2005 2004
Weighted average share price 262p 233p
Expected dividends 7.81p 7.61p
Volatility 34% 35%
Correlation 19% 22%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Risk free interest rate 4.9% 5.2%
As explained on page 41 of the Directors’remuneration report, the PSP has a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) market-based performance condition, such that the
Company’s TSR over the performance period will be compared with the TSR of the companies constituting the FTSE 100 index on the date of grant. If the Company’s
TSR exceeds the median TSR of the FTSE 100, the number of shares that vest will be increased by 25 per cent.The fair value of an award of shares under the PSP has
been adjusted to take into account this market-based performance condition using a pricing model based on expectations about volatility and the correlation of
share price returns in the group of FTSE 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share price performance and TSR
vesting.This adjustment increases the fair value relative to the share price at the date of grant.
Sharesave awards
The fair value of options granted under the Sharesave plan are calculated using a binomial pricing model with the following assumptions:
2005 2004
Weighted average share price 351p —
Exercise price 298p —
Volatility 40% —
Expected dividends 7.86p —
Expected life
1
– 3 year Sharesave 3.3-3.8 years —
– 5 year Sharesave 5.3-5.8 years —
Close periods:
From January 1 6 weeks 6 weeks
From July 1 1 month 1 month
Risk free interest rate 4.4% —
1
The binomial pricing model assumes that participants will exercise options at the beginning of the six month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price. Otherwise it assumes that options are 
held until the expiration of their contractual term.This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between the start and end of the exercise window.
Deferred shares under APRA and Free Shares under SIP
The fair value of shares awarded under these plans is calculated as the share price on the date of award.

with the following grant date fair values:

For the Sharesave options, the binomial pricing model assumes that participants will exercise options at the beginning of the six month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price. Otherwise it
assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term.This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between the start and end of the exercise window.

28  Financial instruments
The principal ﬁnancial risks to which the Group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk; interest rate risk; and commodity price risk.The Board has approved
policies for the management of these risks.
In accordance with the option allowed by IFRS 1 ‘First time adoption of IFRS’ , the Group has adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments’prospectively from
January 1, 2005, and consequently information for 2005 is provided on this basis. For 2004, information has been provided on the previously published basis under 
UK GAAP .
Risk management policies and hedging activities
Foreign currency exchange rate risk – The Group has signiﬁcant cash ﬂows (most signiﬁcantly US dollars, followed by the Euro) denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency of the relevant trading entity.To manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash ﬂows, so as to maintain relatively stable
long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions. For accounting purposes, these
derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
The Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments denominated in foreign currencies.To manage the risk of changes in these
fair values, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
The Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments.The Group aims to match its translational exposures by matching the
currencies of assets and liabilities.Where appropriate, foreign currency ﬁnancial liabilities may be designated as hedges of the net investment.
Interest rate risk – The Group’s interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its ﬁxed rate borrowings (fair value risk) and ﬂoating rate borrowings (cash ﬂow risk). Interest rate
derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate proﬁle within the Group policy, which is to maintain a higher proportion of net debt at ﬁxed rates of interest
having regard to the prevailing interest rate outlook.These are designated as either fair value or cash ﬂow hedges as appropriate.
Commodity risk – The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations.To minimise its cash ﬂow exposures to changes in
commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions. For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are not designated as hedging
instruments.
Other price risk – The Group’s cash equivalent balances represent investments in money market instruments, with a term of up to one month.The Group does not
consider that these are subject to signiﬁcant price risk.
Liquidity risk – The Group’s policy is to hold ﬁnancial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufﬁcient to ensure that the Group has available
funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.The Group holds cash and short-term
investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
Credit risk – The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its ﬁnancial instruments.The Group has
credit policies covering both trading and ﬁnancial exposures. At the balance sheet date, there were no signiﬁcant concentrations of credit risk.The maximum exposure
to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each ﬁnancial asset, including derivative ﬁnancial instruments.

Fair values of ﬁnancial instruments
The fair value of a ﬁnancial instrument is the price at which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s
length transaction.Fair values have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet date, using the methodologies discussed
below.
The carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are as follows:

Other non-derivative ﬁnancial liabilities (246) (246)
Unlisted ﬁxed asset investments –These primarily comprise Floating Rate Convertible Loan Stock.The conversion conditions are such that fair value approximates to the
book value.
Trade receivables,trade payables,short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents – Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term
maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after periods not exceeding six months.
Borrowings,other ﬁnancial assets and other ﬁnancial liabilities – Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.Where market values are not
available, fair values have been estimated by discounting expected future cash ﬂows using prevailing interest rate curves. Amounts denominated in foreign curencies
are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.

Jet fuel swaps —9
Interest rate swaps 23 129
Forward foreign currency contracts — 986
Forward purchase of shares to meet share option commitments — 40
Where available, market values have been used to determine current values.Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting
expected future cash ﬂows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits and short-term borrowings:
The book value approximates to fair value either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of investments is reset after periods
not greater than six months.
Derivatives:
The fair value of derivatives is the estimated amount, based on current market rates, which the Group would expect to pay or receive were it to terminate the
derivatives at the balance sheet date.
Hedges of future transactions
As described in the Finance Director’s review on pages 24 to 29 the Group’s policy is to hedge the following exposures:
Interest rate risk – using interest swaps
Currency exposures on future forecast sales – using forward foreign currency contracts, currency swaps and currency options
Commodity price risk – using jet fuel swaps
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are dealt with as outlined in the accounting policies on page 59.

30  Contingent liabilities
In connection with the sale of its products the Group will, on some occasions, provide ﬁnancing support for its customers.The Group’s contingent liabilities relating to
ﬁnancing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio.
Under UK GAAP , contingent liabilities were reported: (a) at the full potential exposure regardless of the time at which such exposures may arise; and (b) in sterling
taking account of forward exchange contracts held. Following the adoption of IFRS, the Group has reviewed this policy and has concluded that it is more appropriate
to disclose contingent liabilities on a discounted basis. As directors consider the likelihood of these contingent liabilities crystallising to be remote, this amount does
not represent a present value. However, the amounts will be discounted at the Group’s borrowing rate to reﬂect better the time span over which these exposures
could arise. In addition, following the decision to cease hedge accounting from January 1, 2005, it is no longer appropriate to take account of forward exchange
contracts. As the contingent liabilities are denominated in US dollars, this amount will be reported, together with the sterling equivalent at the reporting date spot rate.
Applying this revised policy, the discounted value of the total gross contingent liabilities relating to ﬁnancing arrangements on all delivered aircraft less insurance
arrangements and relevant provisions, at December 31, 2005 amounted to $1,097m (£638m, 2004 $1,143m, £595m, previously reported £999m).Taking into account
the net realisable value of the relevant security including unrestricted cash collateral of $108m (£63m, 2004 $104m, £54m), the discounted value of the net contingent
liabilities in respect of ﬁnancing arrangements on all delivered aircraft amounted to $259m (£150m, 2004 $294m, £153m, previously reported £189m). Sensitivity
calculations are complex, but for example, if the value of the relevant security was reduced by 20 per cent, a net contingent liability with a discounted value of
approximately $363m (£211m, 2004 $403m, £210m, previously reported £277m) would result.There are also net contingent liabilities in respect of undelivered aircraft,
but it is not considered practicable to estimate these as deliveries can be many years in the future, and the relevant ﬁnancing will only be put in place at the
appropriate time.
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, performance and reliability.The
Company and some of its subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export ﬁnance, performance bonds,
countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items.Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of
business, some of which are for substantial amounts. As a consequence of the insolvency of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured
against known and potential claims from employees who worked for certain of the Group’s UK based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those
businesses by the Group.While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal
actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in signiﬁcant loss to the Group or Company.

33  Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
As stated in note 1, in accordance with European Union Regulations, the Group adopted IFRS from January 1, 2004, and restated its ﬁnancial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2004, which were previously reported under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP). An analysis of the impact of implementing
IFRS was published in a news release on April 14, 2005, available on the Investors section of the Group’s website www.rolls-royce.com
The major changes required by the introduction of IFRS were:
– recognition of intangible assets, whereby certain qualifying costs, in particular related to research and development and recoverable engine costs, which were
written off under UK GAAP , are required to be recognised and amortised over a future period of time;
– treatment of ﬁnancial instruments, whereby the majority of ﬁnancial assets and derivatives, employed by the Group to provide stability for long-term business
planning, for example in respect of foreign exchange rates, will be fair-valued on the balance sheet with subsequent changes in fair values recorded in the income
statement, unless cash ﬂow hedge accounting is applied;
– ﬁnancial risk and revenue sharing partnerships, whereby a balance sheet liability is required to be established to reﬂect the expected future value of payments to
partners;
– pensions and other post-retirement costs, whereby pension scheme deﬁcits are required to be recorded on the balance sheet;
– the cessation of amortisation of goodwill; and
– the recording of share-based payments at fair value.
The Group achieved hedge accounting under UK GAAP . However the strict methodology to achieve hedge accounting under IAS 39 limits its application for use by
the Group unless there are signiﬁcant changes to the way in which the Group operates its economic hedging policies.The Group has determined that its existing
hedging strategy is in the best interests of the business and its shareholders. It has not, therefore, altered its hedging activities in order to achieve a particular
accounting presentation under the new rules.
The Group has applied hedge accounting to its interest rate derivative hedge book, but has not applied cash ﬂow hedge accounting to its foreign exchange and
commodity derivative hedge books.
Details of the adjustments made in adopting IFRS are provided below. Reconciliations for the 2004 restated opening and closing balance sheets, income
statement and cash ﬂow are also provided.
Presentation of ﬁnancial statements
The Group’s primary ﬁnancial statements have been presented in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The principal impact on the income statement is the presentation of the Group’s share of the results of joint ventures (which are accounted for using the equity
method) as a single line. Under UK GAAP , the Group’s shares of operating proﬁt, interest and taxation were reported separately. As a consequence, the Group’s share of
joint venture taxation is included in proﬁt before tax.There is no impact on reported proﬁt after tax.
The format of the balance sheet has been amended to include the items required by IAS 1 to be presented on the face of the balance sheet.
Transitional arrangements
The rules for the ﬁrst-time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1. In general, a company is required to determine its IFRS policies and apply those retrospectively to
determine its opening balance sheet under IFRS. IFRS 1 allows a number of exemptions to this general requirement.Where Rolls-Royce has applied these exemptions,
they are noted in the relevant section below. In particular the Group has adopted the exemption that IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments need not be applied to
the comparative period. Consequently the restated results for the year ended December 31, 2004 have been prepared using the accounting policies for ﬁnancial
instruments previously adopted under UK GAAP . This has led to a second transition at January 1, 2005, details of which are provided below, together with a balance
sheet reconciliation.

33  Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) continued
Research and development
IAS 38 requires that all development costs meeting speciﬁed criteria be capitalised as intangible assets.
As part of its IFRS transition project, Rolls-Royce reviewed all development projects, whether the costs were previously recognised under UK GAAP or not, to
determine whether the criteria in IAS 38 were met.The key eligibility criteria for capitalisation relate to:
i) Identiﬁcation of development costs. In general, research and development activities are closely interrelated and it is not until the technical feasibility of the
project can be determined with reasonable certainty that development costs can be separately identiﬁed; and
ii) The generation of future economic beneﬁt. Intangible assets are not recognised unless the project is expected to generate future economic beneﬁt
exceeding the amount capitalised.
Certain expenditures on internal product development meet all the criteria of IAS 38 and have therefore been capitalised.
Development costs capitalised are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period not exceeding 15 years.The impact arising from this change is summarised as
follows:

Recoverable engine costs
On occasions, the Group may sell original equipment to customers at an amount below its cost of manufacture, with the expectation that this deﬁcit will be recovered
from future aftermarket sales to the original customer. Where the Group has a contractual right to supply aftermarket parts to the customer and its intellectual rights,
warranty arrangements and statutory airworthiness requirements provide reasonable control over this supply, these arrangements are considered to meet the
deﬁnition of an intangible asset. Under UK GAAP , these intangible assets were required to be written-off as they arose; under IAS 38 such intangible assets are required
to be recognised.The resulting intangible asset will be amortised over the expected utilisation period of the equipment by the initial customer – generally to a
maximum of ten years, subject to any speciﬁc contractual circumstances.

Goodwill and business combinations
IFRS 3 Business Combinations prohibits the amortisation of goodwill. Instead, it requires goodwill to be carried at cost. Annual impairment tests are required to 
be performed.
The Group has applied the exemption granted by IFRS 1 to apply IFRS 3 prospectively from the date of transition to IFRS.This has the following impact:
– All prior business combination accounting is frozen at the transition date; and
– The value of goodwill is frozen at the transition date and amortisation previously reported under UK GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2004 is reversed for
the IFRS restatement.

Pensions and other post-retirement beneﬁts
IAS 19 Employee Beneﬁts requires separate recognition of the operating and ﬁnancing costs of deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes (and similarly funded employee
beneﬁts) in the income statement.The standard permits a number of options for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.The Group’s policy is to recognise
immediately any variations in full in a statement of recognised income and expense, as permitted in the IASB’s amendment to IAS 19 entitled Actuarial Gains and
Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures.
The cash funding of the plans is designed, in consultation with independent qualiﬁed actuaries, to ensure that present and future contributions should be
sufﬁcient to meet future liabilities.

Share-based payments
IFRS 2 Share-based Payments requires the fair value of share options granted to employees since November 7, 2002 (the publication date of the exposure draft of 
IFRS 2) to be charged to the income statement.The fair value is calculated using an option-pricing model and is charged to income over the relevant vesting periods,
adjusted to reﬂect actual and expected levels of vesting.
The basis of calculation for deferred taxation is in respect of all schemes (including pre November 7, 2002 grants) and is the difference between the market price
at the date of the ﬁnancial statements and the option exercise price.This will not necessarily correlate to the fair value charge.

Scope of consolidation
On transition to IFRS, IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements required the consolidation of all subsidiaries and special purpose entities that the Group
controlled at January 1, 2004. Based on the IAS 27 Deﬁnitions of Control, and after taking into account the facts and circumstances relevant at the transition date, the
Group determined that it controlled one arrangement (Pembroke 717 Holdings Limited) that was not required to be consolidated under UK GAAP . The consolidation
of this company did not have any net impact on the reported results for 2004.
The impact arising from this change is summarised as follows:

Financial instruments (applicable from January 1, 2005)
IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments address the accounting for, and ﬁnancial reporting of, ﬁnancial instruments. IAS 32 covers disclosure and presentation, while IAS
39 covers recognition and measurement including detailed rules for hedge accounting.These include the requirements to match the hedged item to the hedging
instrument and to measure hedge effectiveness. IAS 39 requires certain ﬁnancial assets and certain ﬁnancial liabilities to be recognised at fair value. Accounting for
movements in fair value is dependent on the designation of the relevant ﬁnancial instrument and whether hedge accounting is adopted.
The Group has applied the exemption, granted by IFRS 1, not to apply IAS 32 and IAS 39 to its comparative ﬁgures for 2004. On January 1, 2005, the fair value of
foreign exchange and commodity derivatives were included in a transition hedging reserve. As the Group has not adopted cash ﬂow hedge accounting for future
foreign exchange transactions under IAS 39 from January 1, 2005, the reserve was frozen and will be released to the income statement based on the designated
maturities on that date.
The impact on the Group’s derivative ﬁnancial instruments is described below.
Foreign exchange derivatives
A large element of the Group’s trading is denominated in US dollars and a signiﬁcant portion of its costs is incurred in sterling and Euros. In order to protect itself from
the associated currency volatility, the Group takes signiﬁcant levels of forward cover. Under UK GAAP , gains or losses on this cover are not recognised in the income
statement until realised, matching them with the underlying transactions. As contracts may be signed several years in advance of delivery, delivery dates may change
and meeting the strict criteria for hedge accounting in IAS 39 is not considered to be practicable within the current risk management practices. Rolls-Royce considers
that it could amend its risk management practices to achieve hedge accounting. However, Rolls-Royce believes that its current risk management practices are in the
best economic interests of shareholders and should not be amended purely to achieve a particular accounting treatment. Accordingly, Rolls-Royce has decided not to
adopt cash ﬂow hedge accounting for forecast foreign exchange transactions. Rolls-Royce will continue to hedge its future forecast US dollar income on a portfolio
basis, which it considers is the most efﬁcient economic basis for doing so.
As a result of not hedge accounting for forecast foreign exchange transactions, the movements on the fair value of derivative contracts held for the purpose of
hedging these transactions will be recognised in the income statement.The size of this movement in fair values will be largely dependent on movements in spot
exchange rates.
Under UK GAAP , as part of its hedging policy, Rolls-Royce:
– recognised revenues and costs at the average exchange rate achieved in the year;
– recognised monetary assets and liabilities at the rate expected to be achieved in settling these items, taking account of the foreign exchange cover in place;
– incorporated rates achieved on forward cover in its assessment of the proﬁtability of service and long-term contracts.
Under IFRS, Rolls-Royce will:
– recognise revenues and costs at the exchange rate at the time of the transaction;
– recognise monetary assets and liabilities at the spot exchange rate on the reporting date; and
– assess the proﬁtability of service and long-term contracts without including the impact of forward exchange rate contracts.
Rolls-Royce will adopt fair value hedge accounting for foreign exchange derivatives entered into for the purposes of hedging the fair values of borrowings
denominated in a foreign currency. Under fair value hedge accounting, the borrowings being hedged will be measured at fair value in respect of the foreign exchange
risk, with movements in fair values of both the derivatives and the borrowings being included in the income statement.
Rolls-Royce will adopt net investment hedge accounting in respect of foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency denominated borrowings. Under net investment
hedging, foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the fair value of the borrowings are included in equity to the extent they offset equivalent losses and gains
arising on the consolidation of the subsidiary.This policy is unchanged from UK GAAP .

33  Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) continued
Interest rate derivatives
Rolls-Royce will adopt hedge accounting for hedges entered into for the purposes of managing its exposure to movements in interest rates. Fair value hedge
accounting will be used for the hedging of ﬁxed rate borrowings and cash ﬂow hedge accounting will be used where the underlying borrowing is a ﬂoating rate
instrument.Where fair value hedge accounting is used, the debt being hedged will be measured at fair value in respect of the interest rate risk, with movements in the
fair values of both the derivative and the debt being included in the income statement.Where cash ﬂow hedge accounting is used, the effective element of the fair
value of the derivative will be included in a hedging reserve in equity.This hedging reserve will be released to the income statement to offset changes in interest rates
on the hedged ﬂoating rate borrowings.
Risk and revenue sharing partnerships
Risk and revenue sharing partnership (RRSP) agreements are a standard form of co-operation in the civil aero-engine industry. In general, partners share: investment in
the programme; market risk as they receive their return from future sales; currency risk as their returns are denominated in US dollars; sales ﬁnancing obligations;
warranty costs; and, where they are manufacturing or development partners, technical and cost risk.
As part of the IFRS transition project, RRSP arrangements have been reviewed to assess whether they are ﬁnancial instruments as deﬁned by IAS 32. Following this
review, certain partnerships, where the arrangement is not part of an overall supplier arrangement, will be reclassiﬁed as ﬁnancial instruments on transition to IFRS.
Reclassiﬁed RRSP arrangements are accounted for using the amortised cost method, based on the effective interest rate at the inception of the transaction.
Government investment
In the past, Rolls-Royce has received investment in certain projects from the UK Government. Under UK GAAP , these amounts were recognised as income when they
were received with the levies being recognised as they became due on engine delivery. A similar review to that for RRSPs concluded that these arrangements were
not ﬁnancial instruments and that no changes are required to the accounting treatment.
Other ﬁnancial derivatives
The Group has an ongoing exposure to the price of jet fuel from business operations. For reasons similar to those described for foreign exchange above, Rolls-Royce
will not adopt hedge accounting for its exposures to changes in the price of jet fuel.These are hedged using commodity swaps.
The Group has entered into forward contracts to purchase its own shares for the purposes of meeting obligations to issue shares under employee share
schemes. Under UK GAAP , these contracts were not recognised until the shares were purchased and issued to employees. Under IAS 32, these contracts are
categorised as ﬁnancial liabilities and accounted for on the amortised cost basis.
The Company has issued non-cumulative redeemable convertible preference shares (B Shares) as an alternative to paying a cash dividend. Under IAS 32 these
shares are categorised as ﬁnancial liabilities.
The impact of the transition to IFRS on the net assets in respect of ﬁnancial instruments as at January 1, 2005 is summarised as follows:

Contingent liabilities
The Group’s customer ﬁnancing arrangements fall into two categories that need to be considered separately for IFRS purposes:
Credit Based Guarantees
Credit based guarantees are speciﬁcally exempt from being treated as ﬁnancial derivatives under IAS 39.They are required to be treated as insurance contracts in
accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. Under IFRS 4 the existing UK GAAP treatment (FRS 12) is ‘grandfathered’until such time as the new Insurance Contracts
standard comes into effect.
Asset Value Guarantees (AVGs)
The treatment of AVGs is less well deﬁned under IFRS.The Group has treated AVGs as insurance contracts in accordance with IFRS 4, as it considers that this treatment
best reﬂects the underlying nature of the arrangements.
There are no material changes to the treatment of contingent liabilities upon transitioning from UK GAAP to IFRS.
Other
The Group’s banking covenants are not affected by the transition to IFRS as they are based on UK GAAP prevailing at the time the relevant borrowing facility was
entered into (‘frozen UK GAAP’).
The Group’s borrowing powers under its Articles of Association were amended at the 2004 AGM to a ﬁxed limit in anticipation of the transition to IFRS.
The Scheme of Arrangement and the reduction in share capital undertaken in 2003 provides Rolls-Royce Group plc with a buffer in respect of Distributable
Reserves available inter alia for the purposes of making payments to shareholders.

Statement of directors’responsibilities In respect of the Annual report and the ﬁnancial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the Group and
parent company ﬁnancial statements, in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent company
ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the directors are
required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the EU and have elected to prepare the parent company ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
The Group ﬁnancial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by
the EU to present fairly the ﬁnancial position and performance of the Group; the
Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such ﬁnancial statements that
references in the relevant part of that Act to ﬁnancial statements giving a true and
fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The parent company ﬁnancial statements are required by law to give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent company.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company ﬁnancial statements,
the directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
– for the Group ﬁnancial statements, state whether they have been prepared
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;

preparing a directors’report, directors’remuneration report and corporate
governance statement that comply with that law and those regulations.

statement, the Group consolidated balance sheet, the Group consolidated cash
ﬂow statement, the Group consolidated statement of recognised income and

prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁnancial statements of
Rolls-Royce Group plc for the year ended December 31, 2005 and on the
information in the directors’remuneration report that is described as having been
audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other
purpose.To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors  
The directors’responsibilities for preparing the Annual report and the Group
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU are set out in the statement of
directors’responsibilities on this page.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group ﬁnancial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the Group ﬁnancial statements have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of
the IAS Regulation.We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’report is
not consistent with the Group ﬁnancial statements, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed
by law regarding directors’remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reﬂects the Company’s
compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined Code speciﬁed
for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we
report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual report and consider
whether it is consistent with the audited Group ﬁnancial statements.We consider
the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group ﬁnancial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
(UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures
in the Group ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the Group
ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to
the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group ﬁnancial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy
of the presentation of information in the Group ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion  
In our opinion:
– the Group ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
December 31, 2005 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended; and  
– the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

Notes to the Company ﬁnancial statements continued
7  Contingent liabilities
The Company has not adopted amendments to FRS 26 in relation to ﬁnancial guarantee contracts which will apply for periods commencing on or after 
January 1, 2006.
Where the Company enters into ﬁnancial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these
to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it
becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the ﬁnancial statements for the period commencing January 1, 2006.
At December 31, 2005 these guarantees amounted to £1,344m (2004 £1,513m).

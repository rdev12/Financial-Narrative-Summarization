Chairman’ s statement
This year the Group became a fully integrated,
international professional services firm, operating under
one brand and delivering business and IT consultancy
services across four chosen industry sectors. Following
the successful demerger of the mobile banking
applications business, Monitise, in June 2007, Morse 
is now totally focused as a pure professional services
business and over the past year we have made many
changes to our operating model to ensure we have the
right foundation to take the business forward. Morse now
has the ability and resources to pursue its own growth
strategy, building on our outstanding blue chip client base
and leveraging our range of specialist capabilities.
Results
Operating profit before interest, taxation and exceptional
items from continuing operations was up 16% to £12.2
million (2006: £10.6 million). The continuing business has
seen a significant increase in operating profit over the past
two years (2005: £7.6 million to 2007: £12.2 million).
Operating margin percentage from continuing operations
was up 1.2% points to 4.8% (2006: 3.6%). The increase 
in operating margin reflects the continuing improvement in
the underlying quality and mix of our services business.
We will aim to maintain solid earnings per share growth at
similar levels to that achieved in the year to 30 June 2007. 
Group revenue from continuing operations for the year to
30 June 2007 was £256.5 million (2006: £296.5 million).
The decline in revenue was principally due to our
continued withdrawal from the IT infrastructure product
fulfilment business and our desire to ensure product is
only ever delivered as part of a services engagement.  
We now believe that our revenue is reaching a level of
support from which we can progress.
A final dividend of 2.80p (2006 2.70p) will be proposed for
shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting to be
convened on 30 October 2007 and, subject to shareholder
approval, will be paid to shareholders on the register as 
at 12 October 2007. The dividend will be payable on 
5 November 2007.
Morse
Morse’s advisory and execution services are focused on
three main areas: Management Consulting, Applications
Consulting and Infrastructure Consulting. We will continue
to manage the business broadly along these lines in the
short term as we strengthen our existing vertical sector
capabilities in four key markets: financial services, 
media and communications, commercial and public
sector. We are already transitioning our relationships with
many strategic clients and over time will move to a full 
client-driven vertical sector model.  
By combining the strengths of our three business units
into a single portfolio of services, we are now providing our
clients with specialist services in support of their business
strategies and operating models, including business
processes, IT applications and IT infrastructure. We maintain
strong partnerships with the market-leading product and
solutions vendors. We are also leveraging our specialist
expertise and deep industry domain knowledge to develop
long-term sustainable client relationships.
Morse operates under one brand, with one culture,
utilising a unified client franchise. We have established
Richard Lapthorne
Chairman Morse plc Annual Report 2007 3
strong thought leadership in our chosen sectors and
emerging information technology and we aim to deliver
total solutions to clients. We can deliver in a consistent
style and develop our people within a single coordinated
talent management process and we aim to attract and
retain the best talent available.
Morse is a top 15 consultancy player in the UK consulting
market with strong international reach and is gaining
market and client momentum. As such, the business is
now well placed to move towards the operating margins
that are consistent with other established advisory and
execution firms and we therefore aim to match or exceed
industry benchmarks and double the operating margin
percentage from 30 June 2006 over the medium term.
Following the demerger of Monitise at the financial year-end,
Morse now has the strategic focus and financial strength
to fulfil its potential as a pure professional services firm.
With the demerger of the Monitise business from Morse,
Kevin Alcock was appointed Chief Executive Officer of
Morse plc, having been Chief Executive of the Morse
operating business since July 2006. Duncan McIntyre,
previously Chief Executive Officer of Morse plc, has moved
to the role of Deputy Chairman. Management remains
focused on the strong financial management that has
been a hallmark of the Morse story to date, while pushing
forward with clearly stated performance objectives and
well defined actions to deliver shareholder value.
Richard Lapthorne

4 September 2007
Changes to 
Group structure
Over the last few years the Group has been transforming itself
from a reseller to technology integrator to a business and
IT consulting company. We have undertaken this transformation 
in order to provide our substantial blue chip customer base with
the broader offerings they now require, combining advisory and
execution consulting and delivery services with industry and
technology skills and capabilities. We have managed this
transition by a combination of organic development and
acquisition. The acquisitions together with the selective disposals 
we have made have enabled us to accelerate the transformation
process, and our financial controls have allowed the Group to
remain consistently cash-generative, at the operating profit level.
We now have the framework in place for the remaining significant
activities and geographies to become important components of
Morse, a single, international advisory and execution professional
services business.
With the successful transformation of the Morse business and
development of the Monitise business it was recognised that both
businesses had increasingly distinct characteristics with different
funding requirements and growth strategies. The Morse Board
decided a demerger of Monitise from Morse plc was the best way
forward as this would demonstrate the independent value of both
businesses, allow each to focus on its core competencies, pursue
its own investment strategies and provide shareholders in Morse
plc with investment choice.

strategic goals of the business, the Morse Partnership

and governance.

Chief Executive Officer’ s review
Forward thinking
Kevin Alcock
Chief Executive Officer
Morse has transformed itself into a fully integrated
professional services company operating under one brand
and, as a result, has made significant progress in improving
the quality and mix of our business. By combining the
strengths of our three business units into a single portfolio
of services, we are now providing our clients with
specialist advisory and execution services in support of
their business strategies and operating models including
business processes, IT applications and IT infrastructure.
What differentiates us from other companies in the market
is our specialist knowledge, our ability to respond quickly
to our clients’ business and IT needs, and our company
culture. The new Morse brand is developing an outstanding
reputation in the business and IT services market in our
chosen sectors and we have the right strategy, investment
capability and management skills in place to exploit our
key strengths and to build on the strong position we have
already established in our chosen markets.
The Morse transformation programme has focused on
improving the quality and shape of the business in terms
of client relationships, mix of advisory and execution
services and balance between product services and
consultancy-led engagements. This strategy has provided
the foundation for the progress we are making towards 
our medium-term strategic goals to:
� Double the operating margin to 7.2% 
(from 30 June 2006) by growing it between 0.5% 
and 1.0% per annum 
� Deliver absolute operating profit of £20.0 million
� Improve gross margins to between 27% and 30%
� Enhance recurring revenue streams from 24% to 30%
� Increase chargeable headcount aligned to our revenue 
and profit targets
� Develop the balance of One Morse clients to greater 
than 50% of our core relationships
Achievements in the year
Having completed our transformation during the past year,
we are now in the process of implementing our strategies
and delivering the tangible results we sought:
� Successful demerger of Monitise with no further funding
obligations, giving Morse the strategic focus and 
financial strength to fulfil its potential as a professional 
services firm
� Fully integrated business operating under a single Morse
brand, with strong differentiation in the business and IT 
consulting services market
� We have enhanced and strengthened the senior 
management team and have implemented a structured 
and very active talent management programme
� Progress against our clearly defined growth strategy and
medium term performance objectives:
– Operating profit from continuing operations before 
exceptional items up 16% to £12.2 million 
(2006: £10.6 million), having significantly improved 
in the last two years (2005: £7.6 million)
– Operating margin percentage from continuing 
operations before exceptional items up 1.2% points 
to 4.8% (2006: 3.6%) Morse plc Annual Report 2007 9
Integrating the business
This is a major milestone for us and helps position Morse as a
leading international consulting business. Differentiating us from
other companies in the market are Morse’s specialist knowledge,
our ability to respond quickly to our clients’ needs and our
company culture.
Our recent integration and rebranding
positions Morse as a leading

Forward thinking
‘The Morse business now represents a
balanced portfolio of business and IT
consulting services and capabilities that
we will continue to enhance by focusing
on increasing client value and exceeding
industry standard benchmark metrics.’
– Recurring revenue enhanced from 22% to 24% over 
the last three years
– Chargeable headcount has increased by 30% over 
the last three years
– One Morse clients now represent 10-15% of 
the business
� Strong cash position of £15.3 million to support ongoing
investment in the business
Strategic objectives
The Morse business now represents a balanced portfolio
of business and IT consulting services and capabilities that
we will continue to enhance by focusing on increasing
client value and exceeding industry standard benchmark
metrics. To drive the business forward we are focusing 
on seven strategic objectives, each with detailed key
performance indicators. These are reviewed, developed
and cascaded throughout the organisation.
� Making the most of the breadth and depth of Morse 
resources and capabilities through a strategic client 
management programme designed to enhance our 
client relationships
� Increasing our focused industry proposition capabilities 
through the development, recruitment and acquisition of
specialist skills
� Developing a culture and values framework that, together
with a structured people development programme, 
creates an inspiring environment for all stakeholders
� Optimising our core business process management to 
maximise the quality of client engagement and align 
resources directly to providing client value
� Growing the balance of our business profitably so that 
we can support our investment programme for 
enhancing our specialist consulting skills
� Delivering, in all aspects of the Morse business, the One
Morse brand promise to offer better value to our clients
� Enhancing our capabilities as an international consulting
business with selected investment in increasing local 
operational resources and skills base
Shape of the business going forward 
There are three key dimensions to the Morse business that
will shape the way that we develop and grow:
� The range of our advisory and execution consultancy 
services
� The breadth and depth of our infrastructure, applications
and management consulting capabilities
� The level of focused industry segment specialisation 
within the financial services, media and 
communications, commercial and public sector 
vertical markets
We plan to significantly increase the advisory services
within our applications and infrastructure consultancy
business units. At the same time, we will develop and
grow our execution services within our management
consulting business unit from the strong base of advisory
services that exist already.
We will also drive a more comprehensive balance of
services across our business units as we develop Morse’s
specialist capabilities and vertical market expertise. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 11
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Industry verticals – Morse will continue to build on its
significant position within the financial services market
where we are a top five player and has revenues of 
£116.1 million. We are developing the specialist media 
and communications business with a well-articulated client
focus and market offering including defined propositions
and solutions coverage that draws on a full range of
Morse’s consulting capabilities, and we continue to
develop clients across the large operators, network
providers, equipment manufacturers and media and
content companies. Media and communications now
represent £50.4 million of revenue. We will also continue 
to develop the breadth and depth of our proposition in the
commercial sector, which already delivers £73.1 million in
revenue, with emphasis on the retail and consumer goods
segments. In the public sector, a relatively small segment
for Morse with revenues of £16.9 million, our focus will be
on opportunities arising from the Government’s
transformation agenda and back office transformation 
in local government.
Plans are in place to move forward with all these areas
from within our own resources. We continue to invest
organically and during the current year examples include;
the development of our business in France and our focus
on the Government’s Building Schools for the Future (BSF)
initiative which is already yielding opportunities for which
we are short listed. In addition, the Company will make
acquisitions where these offer the opportunity to add
specialist capabilities or accelerate the overall
development effort.

F&C Asset Management
F&C Asset Management (F&C) is a leading investment specialist
managing over £101 billion in assets for a range of investors,
including private investors, financial advisors and institutional clients.
Towards the end of 2006 F&C faced some operational challenges
with their front office applications. Managing multiple inherited
applications was leading to difficulties in providing new functionality
to their fund managers. 
To overcome these challenges, F&C engaged our services to advise
and help them to redesign the front office architecture and to
improve their efficiency in delivering functionality to the fund managers.
Drawing on our extensive experience in the financial services sector,
Morse was in a position to meet the client’s business needs as well
as provide specialist industry expertise. Our ability to offer the full
spectrum of consultancy, from operational advice through to
implementing the solution architected, was central to our
engagement on this assignment. Morse consultants worked with the
client to understand how their existing systems were supporting their
business before designing a revised architecture and associated
delivery processes. F&C are now implementing their new applications
architecture and are confident that they are now well placed to
incorporate new developments in their front office as they arise.
Luc Leclercq, Director of Operations, F&C Asset Management says,
“Very pleased with timely and professional advice given by Morse”. 
Outlook
We have made a good start to the current financial year
across all business units and remain on track to achieve
our performance targets of a 7.2% operating margin

Key performance indicators
Comments
Revenue represents third party revenues generated from
Morse's four business segments. The decline in turnover is
consistent with the transition of the Group from a reseller to a
professional services firm. Decline in product sales mainly in
the UK is compensated for by growth in consulting services
across the Group. The 13% year on year decline in FY07 is
due to the decision to withdraw from the product fulfilment
market in the UK.
Revenue – Continuing Operations

FY07
The Board and Executive Team have put in place a set of
focused strategic objectives and key performance
indicators (KPIs) to underpin Morse’s transition to a
business and IT consulting company. The KPIs are
designed to allow the Board, Executive and shareholders
to monitor operating performance and progress against
strategic goals. As a people-based business, going
forward Morse will be collecting and evaluating a portfolio
of internal and external data points including: client
satisfaction, stakeholder returns, employee satisfaction,
skills utilisation, attrition and headcount. We are
developing a more comprehensive KPI analysis for our
management processes and FY08 reporting.
Comments
Gross margin percentage (GM%) represents gross profit as a
proportion of third party revenues. Gross profit is the difference
between turnover and cost of sales and excludes exceptional
items. The improvement in GM% is consistent with the
transformation of the business from a product reseller model to
a pure play consulting player. The GM% improvement is also a
reflection of the quality and mix of business. The Group’s
objective is to improve gross margin to between 27% and 30%
in the medium term.

Earnings per share (EPS) is a ratio that shows how much of a
company’s after-tax profits each shareholder owns, and is
stated in pence per share. Adjusted EPS represents profit after
tax excluding exceptional items divided by the weighted
average number of shares in issue (see Earnings Per Share
section of the Financial Review on page 31). The improvement
in EPS reflects the improved profit generation of the continuing
businesses over the period with little change in the number

BUSINESS REVIEW
Business risk assessment
The Morse business is constantly evolving which brings
with it changes in the risks the Company faces. The
financial performance of our business could be affected by
any of these changes and associated risks. Whilst not all
risks are foreseeable and are difficult to plan for, Morse has
established a proactive and collaborative approach to risk
assessment and management, utilising the expertise of its
own executive and management teams, a decision
making and governance process, an approvals matrix 
and the advice of its professional advisers.
Risk management process
Senior management is aware of their responsibility 
for managing risk within their Strategic Business Units
(‘SBU’). Each SBU head reports to the Morse Executive
Committee, which in turn reports to the Board on the
status of these risks through management reporting.
Throughout the business, risk is constantly being reviewed
to take account of the changing structures and issues
affecting the Group.  
The Audit Committee actively reviews business risk twice
annually and is reasonably satisfied that the Group has
adequate tools and control mechanisms to mitigate risk
and ensure it is identified promptly and monitored.
The Board regularly reviews Group risk to ensure that 
risk management is being implemented and 
monitored effectively.
The Board’s policy is to ensure the SBUs are empowered
to manage their businesses effectively and appropriately,
bearing in mind the requirements for timely decision
making and commercial reality.
The Company regularly reviews its commercial insurance
programme and maintains an appropriate and adequate
portfolio of insurance policies in line with the nature, size
and complexity of the business.
Operationally, an approvals matrix is utilised to ensure 
risk is identified and escalated to the relevant managerial
levels, with a rigorous internal sign-off process governing
risk decisions. Standard form contracts are provided for
business use and to assist the commercial function to
negotiate within an appropriate and approved safety zone.
The legal department regularly provides update contract
seminars to ensure that processes are known, being
adhered to and updated as necessary to meet the
changing needs of the business. The legal department
further supports the drafting and implementation of the
risk and approvals process.
Through the management reports, risks are highlighted
and monitored to identify potential business risk areas
and, wherever possible, to quantify and address the risk
with a contingency/mitigation plan.
General risks 
There are three specific areas of risk that Morse has identified as being of core
importance to its business, and hence, merit specific focus:
Delivering against client contracts
With the transformation of Morse into an advisory and execution professional
services firm, the size, complexity and duration of the contracts it delivers increases.
As a business and IT partner to our clients, we are tasked with delivering solutions
that are business critical in nature. The projects normally involve interdependencies
with our clients’ operational systems, and indeed with other IT suppliers, and as such
there is a risk that our projects could be subject to delay. This brings the risk that
cash flows are affected. It also involves the appropriate management of major fixed
price implementation contracts.
People-based business
Our people, their experience, expertise, skills and capabilities are our major asset,
and represent a key means by which we are able to differentiate ourselves from our
competitors. If Morse loses key individuals with specialist skills, it can prove difficult
and costly to replace them and the market for quality individuals with specialist
business, industry and technology skills is highly competitive. Morse utilises a variety
of mechanisms to attract, develop, retain and incentivise staff, in order to mitigate
this risk. The management and development of people through our talent
management programme is a key objective.
Reputation with clients
In conjunction with the contract and people-based risks above, we could fail to 
meet client expectations, the clients’ operations could be adversely affected, and
consequently, our reputation for delivery damaged.
Principal risks 
� Maintenance of sufficient liquidity to enable the Group to continue to invest in new 
acquisitions to allow the business to refresh and grow talent for long-term future 
development
� The ongoing successful execution of the One Morse change programme to ensure
integration continues, synergies are maximised and the business prospers through
‘pull-through’ deals encouraged by cross-selling of services and product. The 
sales environment will require education and possibly incentivisation to support the
cross-selling philosophy. Resistance to change must be highlighted and properly 
dealt with by the Group. Acquisitions could further impede the One Morse 
integration strategy
� Fluctuations in demand and project phasing for a consultancy-based services 
business can result in non-recoverable costs and poor utilisation of resource
� Ensuring that bonus schemes across the Group adequately incentivise and 
motivate the sales staff to exceed budgeted performance
� Ensuring the Group processes, systems and structures are rationalised and ‘fit for 
purpose’ for a professional services business. The Group has undergone a full 
review of existing practices and processes in an attempt to stream-line the 
business to improve the control environment and robustness of process. The risk 
of not transitioning similar processes across the Group could impact on the overall 
performance and integration of the One Morse strategy
� Ensuring that the quality of business and margin is maintained and enhanced
� Dependency on quarterly resulting peaks, which need to be transitioned to a 
monthly cycle, which in turn would assist in providing greater predictability and 
faster identification of trends.
The above principal risks are mitigated and managed through robust internal ‘checks
and balances’ with the involvement of all Managing Partners (Morse Executive team)
and the legal department as appropriate. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 20
Operating review
Management Consulting
Management Consulting had an excellent year, showing
continued growth and development. The strategy of the
business remains unchanged: to provide specialist
consultancy services to our key clients in the industry
verticals, our strength today lies in the financial services
industry. We have achieved growth in the current year by
broadening our service to clients through better integration
of our applications and infrastructure offerings alongside
our proven management consulting services. We have
done this within the context of expanding our
management consulting business geographically.
During the year, the business developed a range of new
services for hedge fund managers and life & pension
companies. We also developed specialist knowledge
regarding operating models and IT applications to help
clients trade more complex instruments such as
derivatives. These capabilities have enabled us to gain 
a deeper understanding of the Capital Markets industry,
where we can start to exploit the overlap of services with
the Investment industry.
As a result, revenue for the year increased to £17.8 million
(2006: £14.1 million) and operating profit before exceptional
items increased to £2.4 million (2006: £2.2 million). 
Since the acquisition of CSTIM in 2004, which provided
the foundation for our management consulting business
unit, turnover has grown from £7.3 million to £17.8 million.
£17.8m
Revenue
Across all geographic regions (UK, Channel Islands,
France, Luxembourg, South Africa, Australia and
Singapore), our Management Consultancy business
experienced steady growth in revenues and profit.  
In particular, the development of our business in France
was pleasing, in the first full year of operation we achieved
an operating margin of 6%, we ended the year with a
chargeable headcount of 17 staff and became an
established consultancy in the region. We have
experienced extremely strong demand for our services
throughout the year; however the recruitment of suitably
skilled personnel has remained a particular challenge and
restricted our further growth.
SkillsHub, our specialist financial services resourcing and
contractor placement business, became wholly-owned by
the Group during the year and it recorded strong growth
with profit increasing by 10% on the previous year.
Our Transaction Services practice, which provides
consulting services to organisations undertaking merger 
or acquisition activities, had excellent revenue growth,
lifted by the buoyant private equity market. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 21

JPMorgan Asset Management
JPMorgan Asset Management
Based in London and Luxembourg, JPMorgan Asset Management, with circa 
US$275 billion assets under management, manages a number of single manager
hedge funds.
In 2006, Morse were engaged to review their administration and internal operating
model options for a range of Luxembourg domiciled hedge funds with the aim of
ensuring that service provision would meet current requirements and future 
growth aspirations. 
Morse applied expertise and tools to review the options and relative costs available,
including use of internal service provision, existing and potential service providers and
prime brokers:
� Operating model review completed to capture current and future requirements
� Review and evaluation of administration services provided by three tier-one 
prime brokers
� Review and evaluation of internal service provision
� RFP evaluation of leading hedge fund administrators benchmarked against
operational best practice 
Morse sourcing strategy and advice has benefited JPMorgan Asset Management by:
� Enabling a material reduction in operating costs through the design of a simpler, 
more integrated infrastructure which incorporates variable cost services
� Putting JPMorgan Asset Management client servicing on a pan-European footing
through the establishment of a full-passported Luxembourg-based administration hub
� Brokering an innovative commercial structure that encourages service providers to
invest in service quality improvement and operational risk reduction
The full benefits of the proposed solution will be realised once the implementation phase
has been completed. 
Steve Clifford, Project Sponsor at JPMorgan Asset Management says, “Engaging the
Morse team has quickly enabled us to move to a market leading operating solution for
our Hedge Fund business. The skills and expertise that Morse has brought to the table
has proven to be invaluable in realising our strategic goal in this space”.

relating to people, processes and capabilities in certain
areas and a small number of challenging (fixed price) client
contracts in the SAP division. We have duly made changes
to the operational structure of the business, re-balancing
the headcount and our approach to new business
opportunities, with a focus on transforming our consulting
business from a generalist project organisation to one 
with a greater emphasis on specialist consulting. We are
pleased to report good progress in the second half as a
result of the actions taken.
We continue to be pleased with the development and
growth of the GSS business. This area has exceeded
expectations at both revenue and profit levels during
FY07. A significant proportion of this business’ revenues
are annuity-based and these have seen strong growth
over the year, with revenues more than doubling
compared to the same period last year. Such performance
enables us to maintain a strong ongoing relationship with
clients to support their organisation’s internal change
programmes. In Consulting, the IT Transformation
business had a strong year and is starting to leverage the
broader range of Morse clients. We expect another strong
performance in the current year. 
Our ECM business has continued to develop well. 
The second half of the year has seen stronger revenues
and profits from delivery engagements involving software
products including Stellent, Vignette, Autonomy and our
in-house niche product Wisdom which continues to build
a strong client base.
Applications Consulting (formerly referred to as ‘Business
Consulting’), consists of four main lines of business:
� Consulting delivers management, IT transformation 
and enterprise-wide systems integration in support of 
technologies such as SAP , Oracle and Microsoft
� Global Support Services (GSS) provides a 24x7 
managed service, business process optimisation 
and offshore delivery and support
� Enterprise Content Management (ECM) provides 
solution implementation skills in support of technologies 
such as Stellent, Vignette, Autonomy and Wisdom
� Strand is an IT placement business for contractor staff 
aligned to our applications consulting capabilities 
The business operates in three main territories: the UK,
Asia and the USA.
In the year ended 30 June 2007 sales were £74.9 million
(2006: £84.9 million) and operating profit before
exceptionals was £5.5 million (2006: £6.7 million).  
The ECM, IT Transformation and GSS lines of business
have all performed strongly. In the GSS business in
particular, we now have a global support model and are
seeing strong performance in the UK and a significantly
improved performance in Asia and the USA. 
Although we have seen some extremely profitable and
exciting business throughout the year, we undertook a
strategic review of the Consulting business following the

Marshall Wilkins, the permanent recruitment business, 
was disposed of during the year as this did not fit with 
our ongoing business strategy.  We continue to build and
develop Strand, our IT resourcing and contractor
placement business.
Moving into the current financial year, our focus will be 
on deepening the specialisation within our business and
generating a higher quality of revenue, making changes
that allow us to further develop our existing client
relationships and build new relationships based upon 
the value we can deliver.
Operational excellence is critical to our success. We have
made significant changes to the operating model of the
Applications Consulting business during the year. The
changes were mainly in relation to the development of
specialist business and IT skills, the sales model, staff
remuneration structures, cost management processes 
and project governance. We will look to further improve
and evolve these processes and procedures as the
business develops. Equally important, we are a people
business and we have made great efforts to develop a
career development framework to provide opportunity 
and progression to all our staff on whom we rely to deliver
our strategies for success.

EMI
EMI is the world's largest independent music company,
employing over 6,600 people. EMI Music represents some of the
most famous international recording artists, whilst EMI Music
Publishing owns the largest catalogue of songs in the world.
Keen to improve the efficiency of its business, EMI decided to
implement an SAP enterprise resource planning solution across
Europe, Japan and North America. Recognising the need for
effective management of the large and sophisticated solution, the
client did not want the expense of building and running its own
support organisation and enlisted Morse’s expertise to help set
up a global competency centre. 
Morse is now seen as an integral part of the client’s organisation,
providing seamless, global, 24/7 support in local languages
through Morse offices worldwide. Additional functionality is
developed and deployed by Morse, based on the client’s evolving
business requirements. The cost-effective service provides the
client with access to SAP expertise that it could not retain
in-house, locating support teams offsite and only charging the
client for the services it uses.

Operating profit*
* From continuing operations excluding all exceptional items Morse plc Annual Report 2007 24
The year saw a good performance and we continued to
capitalise on our business transformation progress. The
first half was particularly strong with profits of £3.5 million
before exceptional items; in the second half the business
achieved operating profits before exceptional items of 
£2.1 million.
We have continued to execute on our strategy to 
increase the level and range of services that we provide.
Our client-led approach has supported the successful
transformation to an infrastructure consulting business.
This has resulted in significant growth in our services
business and a greater proportion of advisory and
consultancy work. Our business wins are now Morse
proposition led. This shift has enabled us to reduce the
risks associated with a vendor-led business model and
enabled us to better protect operating margins. Instead,
we now operate a strong, sustainable and relationship-led
business that is much more under our control. 
The Morse-led marketing plans developed in the last year
to 30 June 2007 have continued to evolve. Building on 
our reputation for technology expertise and handling
complex projects we have focused on positioning Morse
as a thought leader in infrastructure technologies and
related business issues. We now take four key technology
propositions to market: technology services, flexible
resourcing, managed services and technology consulting.
We will continue to further develop these propositions and
have the full support of our vendor partners in following
this approach. 
In the year to 30 June 2007, we increased the services
capability of our UK Technology & Integration business to
create Morse Infrastructure Consulting. This has included
the development of our technology and consulting
services at advisory and implementation levels and has
resulted in a shift in focus to higher quality business for 
the technologies we provide with all infrastructure sales
now being services led. We have also restructured the
organisation to increase operational efficiency, balance
cost and resources, and ensure concentration on key
clients, vertical markets and promising propositions. 
Our drive to gain cost efficiencies through improvements
to our sales model and back office business processes is
an ongoing process.
Morse Infrastructure Consulting revenue for the year
decreased by 31% to £97.3 million (2006: £140.7 million),
with operating profit before exceptional items increasing to
£5.6 million (2006: £2.6 million). This reflects our strategy
to focus on higher margin, services-led client engagements
and withdraw from pure product fulfilment business. Whilst
we were expecting a decline in revenues as a result of this
shift, the drop-off in revenue has been sharper than
anticipated. Moving forward, we will continue to focus on
growing our services business, however product delivered
as part of the service remains a key part of the offering and
we believe that in this regard product revenues are now
reaching a level of support from which we can progress.

incremental opportunity from the pull-through of business

‘We have worked with Morse for many years and highly value
their advice and support. Most recently they architected and
implemented a bespoke solution to enhance our IT reporting
capability. Previously our IT staff could spend days manually
compiling basic reports about how our technology was
performing against the services that we provide to the business.
This not only wasted valuable time but could still only provide a
limited amount of information. Morse tailored our new reporting
framework to enable us to create automatic reports which match
against key business services quickly and easily, freeing up time
which can be used for more valuable tasks. Morse has also
helped us gain a greater insight into the services we are providing
so we can react faster to systems that are underperforming.’ 
‘Morse has also been instrumental in helping us to improve the
efficiency of our enterprise and systems management, allowing us
to save in excess of £1.1 million over three years in both capital
and operational expenditure on one initiative alone. Morse’s
consultants have been involved in the architecting and design 
of our solution, which has not only helped us improve the
management of our IT environment but has reduced the cost of
managing it. Not only did Morse help design the strategy, but as
we introduce new applications and devices and our management
needs change, Morse is always on hand to help us ensure that
our management is effective and efficient. Morse’s experience
working with customers in the telecommunications sector, their
in-depth knowledge of our environment, the solutions we use,
and their company culture have proved crucial to the success of
our partnership. Morse’s consultants are not only experts but they
work as a seamless extension of our IT team.’

SSL wanted to reduce business risk by replacing its large number

platform and Morse as its implementation partner. 
Morse helped the client reduce business risk by implementing a

Corporate social responsibility
At Morse we recognise that our community responsibilities
reach beyond our clients, shareholders, employees and
suppliers. Our high ethical standards extend to everything
we do; including meeting all relevant legislative
requirements on environmental issues and minimising the
environmental impact of Morse’s operations. 
We also support a wide range of charities and encourage
members of staff to become involved in local projects and
initiatives and support their efforts. We are proud of our
membership of the FTSE4Good Index Series which
measures the performance of companies that meet
globally recognised corporate standards. 
Values
Morse is a client driven organisation. Our values underpin
the behaviours required for success and to ensure we
conduct our business to the highest standards. We:
� Work in partnership
� Are refreshing
� Act with integrity
� Are specialists
� Are passionate about our work 
Charity work
Morse’s charity policy focuses on supporting the charitable
activities of our staff and, where possible, our clients and
partners. Over the course of FY07 Morse has supported
over 40 separate charity requests from employees
participating in a range of activities. These included The
Flora London Marathon, the British Heart Foundation’s
London to Brighton Bike Ride and the Florida Ironman
Challenge. In addition, the company has donated surplus
computers to charitable organisations.
Morse recognises the importance of company initiatives
and so leads a number of such activities including the 
annual charity Christmas card and participation in the
‘girl-child in Afrika’ project. Founded by St. Cyprian’s
School in Cape Town to help to break the cycle of poverty
and lack of education that is the plight of many in 
South Africa, it provides financial assistance to girls 
who would otherwise not be able to afford the quality of
education offered by the school. We have supported the
charity since 2005.
Give As You Earn (GAYE)
We recognise that many Morse employees wish to donate
to charitable causes. Parts of the company operate a
GAYE scheme, enabling staff to donate to a charity of their
choice via regular deductions from their salary. We plan to
extend the scheme throughout the Group in the near
future.
Environmental awareness
We acknowledge Morse’s environmental responsibility and
so are committed to operating the business in an
environmentally sensitive manner.
Recycling
All Morse UK offices are provided with paper and toner
recycling facilities and a system will shortly be rolled out
across the business for recycling glass, plastic and
cardboard.

BUSINESS REVIEW
Asset recycling
Morse operates an asset retirement programme internally
and offers this as a service to its clients. It donates surplus
computers to charitable organisations.
Reducing the carbon footprint
We aim to reduce Morse’s carbon footprint wherever
possible. We also advise our clients on methods to limit
their carbon emissions while trimming their costs as well.
Recommended techniques include reducing power
consumption, improving equipment utilisation, 
managing the datacentre efficiently and changing
employee behaviours.
The Group has chosen not to set environmental key
performance indicators (KPIs) due to its relative size and
limited impact which it has on the environment. Morse’s
environmental policy is proactive in limiting its impact and
includes internal infrastructure which is purchased in
compliance with the RoHS directive and disposed of in
compliance with the WEEE directive. Compliance with
these directives has had no material impact on the Group.
Supporting students
In order to build strong links between the Group, schools
and colleges as well as the local and regional economic
communities in which we operate, Morse offers work
experience and placements to students. In doing so, 
we strive to make Morse work placements positive,
challenging and relevant to participants’ current studies
and their future job prospects.
We also present lectures and seminars on career options
in the business and IT consulting space to university
students, to help them decide on their future career.
Health and safety
Morse recognises that health and safety is a business
function and must, therefore, continually progress and
adapt to changes. Health and safety has positive benefits
to the organisation. Therefore, our commitment to a high
level of safety makes good business sense. 
We fully comply with the Health and Safety at Work Act
1974. As part of this process, we ensure allocation of
appropriate levels of resources to health and safety issues
and activities within the organisation and work to
encourage a positive culture within this context. Our
overall approach to health and safety is soundly based 
on the identification and control of risks.
By reviewing our Health and Safety Policy annually we 
are able to track any changes in legislation or in our own
operations and act accordingly. We have in place effective
procedures for communication and consultation between
all levels of staff on matters of health, safety and welfare.
Employees
Morse provides employees with regular information about
the business through newsletters, email, and update
meetings that allow the free flow of information and ideas
between management and employees.
The Group recognise the importance of non-discriminatory
employment practice and has an equal opportunities
policy that includes the employment of people with
disabilities. It gives full consideration to applications from
disabled persons when the requirements for the job can
be fulfilled and this applies equally where existing
employees become disabled. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 30

Changes in Group operations
There have been two major changes in the Group’s
operating entities compared to the prior period.
Morse Germany
The disposal of Morse Germany was completed on 
24 July 2006. There was no profit or loss on disposal this
year as a consequence of goodwill being impaired by 
£1.6 million in the accounts for the year to 30 June 2006.
Monitise
On 28 June 2007 Monitise was demerged from 
Morse and listed on the AIM independently raising 
£20.2 million of funds from the placing of shares. The loss
of £7.3 million incurred by the business for the year to 
30 June 2007 has been included in discontinued operations
with prior year comparatives restated accordingly.
Revenue and profit
Group revenue from continuing operations fell by 
13% year-on-year to £256.5 million. The revenue
performance reflects our strategy to focus on 
services-led client engagements and withdraw 
from product fulfilment business.
Operating profit before exceptional items for the continuing
operations was £12.2 million, up 16% on last year.
Revenue and operating profit from continuing operations
and before exceptional items by business segment is

BUSINESS REVIEW
Business disposal
The expense associated with the Monitise demerger 
was £2.5 million, which was recognised in 
discontinued operations.
Property provisions
There was a net reduction of £2.7 million in the property
provision this year.  Following a review of ongoing
requirements, the Group exited properties in Chineham,
Manchester, Hanwell and Brentford during the year.  
The settlements paid on the exit were below the provisions
held in the accounts resulting in a release of £2.1 million.
During the year, operations in Brentford were consolidated
resulting in a provision of £1.0 million being set up.
Interest
Net interest income fell by 50% year-on-year to £0.3 million.
This is a result of a lower average cash balance during the
year following the disposal of Morse Germany and
continued investment in the Monitise business.
Taxation
The tax expense of £2.0 million represents an effective
rate of 53% which compares to a rate of 30% for the year
to 30 June 2006. The high underlying tax rate was due to
non-allowable costs relating to the demerger of Monitise.
The company expects the rate to revert to 30% for the
foreseeable future.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share including discontinued
operations decreased from 2.6p last year to 1.0p in the
year to 30 June 2007. Details can be found in Note 4.
Pro forma adjusted basic earnings per share increased
from 5.0p last year to 5.6p in the current year. The 
pro forma earnings per share figure is based on profit
before tax from continuing operations before exceptional
items (2007: £12.5 million, 2006: £11.0 million) less tax at
a normalised effective group rate of 30% for both years. 
The calculated profit after tax is then divided by the
weighted average number of shares (2007: 154,573,000;
2006: 151,827,000).
Dividend
A final dividend of 2.80p per share, an increase of 3.7%
over last year, will be subject to approval at the AGM and
be paid on 5 November 2007 to all shareholders on the
register at the close of business on 12 October 2007.
This gives a total dividend for the year of 4.05p, an
increase of 3.8% on last year.
Cash flow
Cash and cash equivalents at the year-end amounted 
to £15.3 million compared to £27.3 million last year. The
principal outflows during the year were dividend payments
of £6.1 million, Monitise investment (including JV) of 
£7.2 million and disposal of Morse Germany £3.2 million.
Funding
During the year, Morse has put in place a committed
facility of £10.0 million, through a Revolving Advance
Facility with its bankers. This facility, together with
overdraft facilities and cash balances provides an
adequate headroom position for the Group to fund
investment opportunities into 2007/08.

Nicholas Sandison
Company Secretary Morse plc Annual Report 2007 39
GOVERNANCE
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Report and the Group and parent company financial statements, 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU
(and applicable law) and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK
Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position
and the performance of the Group. The Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that references
in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair
presentation.
The parent company financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
parent company.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
� select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
� make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
� for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the EU;
� for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements; and
� prepare the financial statements on the ‘going concern’ basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the
parent company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies
Act 1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of
the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulation, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ report, Directors’
remuneration report and corporate governance statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included in the
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ
from the legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of
the Report and the financial statements Morse plc Annual Report 2007 40
Corporate governance statement
Combined Code on Corporate Governance Compliance Statement
The Board is committed to the main provisions of the July 2003 Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the ‘Code’) and
endeavours to comply with the Code in all respects.
This report highlights the way in which the Board believes it has been compliant with the provisions of the Code during the
year, other than as set out below within this report.
The Board of Directors
The Board collectively embraces its responsibilities and accountability in reserving certain matters for its review and approval,
including an effective overall strategy, prudent financial strategy and planning, strategic aims, human resources to ensure the
Company can meet its objectives, material acquisitions and disposals, investments and capital projects.
The Board believes it makes its decisions in the best interests of the Company ensuring that its obligations to shareholders
and others are effectively met.
The Board currently consists of three Executive Directors and three Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman).
All Non-Executive Directors excluding the Chairman are considered by the Board to be independent for the purposes of the
Code even though they are permitted to hold other directorships with other companies. The Chairman is also considered by
the Board to be independent. As announced last year in the Annual Report and Accounts, Bill Passmore retired from the
Board on 9 November 2006 after the Annual General Meeting. Whilst he had been a Non-Executive Director of the 
Company for more than nine years, he was considered by the Board to be independent for the purposes of the Code. 
Richard Lapthorne has been Chairman of the Company for more than nine years. Richard Lapthorne’s range of other
directorships and wide previous experience has allowed him to bring distinct and challenging views to Board discussions
and it was felt important to continue to retain his on-going commitment during the recent transition of the Company,
especially through the demerger of Monitise. He has announced his intention to retire soon after the 2007 Annual General
Meeting but has agreed to retain the role until a suitable replacement has been recruited to ensure continuity of cover.
The balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors has been reviewed by the Nominations Committee and
the Board.
The posts of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are held by different Directors and their differing responsibilities defined.
The Chairman leads the Board in determining strategy, achievement of objectives and organising the business of the Board,
but has no involvement in the day-to-day business of the Group. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for formulating
the Group’s strategy and for the Group’s day-to-day business and is accountable to the Board for the financial and
operational performance of the Group.
The Board believes its style of involvement with the senior executives through the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive
Directors is the most effective way to provide confidence in the control environment of the Company. Through openness and
discussion, the Board endeavours to understand and provide leadership as to the willingness of the Company to take
appropriate risks in the interests of the shareholders. The Board focuses almost exclusively on operational and strategic
matters and thereby lays the foundation for an understanding of the business which facilitates effective governance. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 41
GOVERNANCE
The Board meets at least six times during the year and holds other meetings as necessary. All Directors have access to the
Company Secretary, who, under the direction of the Chairman, is responsible for ensuring Board procedures are followed.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring all Directors receive accurate and appropriate information in a timely manner in
advance of Board meetings. The Board is provided with comprehensive information to enable it to discharge its duties.
The Company Secretary, under the direction of the Chairman, is also responsible for ensuring that there is good information
flow to and within the Board and its Committees. The role also involves ensuring that the flow of information between the
Board and the senior executives within the business is maintained and that the Board is duly updated and made aware of
any governance matters. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is the responsibility of the entire Board.
The Chairman ensures the effective contribution of the Non-Executive Directors and ensures the maintenance of good and
constructive relations by them with the Executive Directors.
The Company has Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance cover in place covering all directors and officers.
A procedure exists for all Directors to be entitled to take independent professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s
expense where they need to ensure they are discharging their responsibilities as Directors.
Directors are required to retire at least every three years. Directors appointed to the Board during and after the period are
required to seek election at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment. Any re-election of a Non-Executive
Director, which would take them over a six-year appointment, is subject to rigorous review taking into account the need for
progression of the Board.
The performance of the Executive Directors (excluding the Chief Executive Officer) is evaluated by the Chairman in
consultation with the other Non-Executive Directors and the Chief Executive Officer. The Non-Executive Directors, led by the
Senior Independent Director, are responsible for the performance evaluation of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer,
after having sought the input of all other Directors. The results of these evaluations are used when considering the re-election
of Board members. The results will also be used by the Chairman and Senior Independent Director to ensure the strengths
and weaknesses of the Board are recognised and that there is planned and progressive refreshing of the Board.
In compliance with Code provision A.6, the Company continues to review and consider whether appropriate methods and
processes for establishing a more formal annual evaluation of all Directors is required. The Company is therefore not currently
compliant with Code provision A.6.1, in that the performance evaluation methods are not formalised. The current informal
evaluation covers individual contribution and commitment.
The Chairman and the Board believe that the Board and each Committee of the Board are operating appropriately and
effectively. They focus on operational issues and are carried out in an atmosphere of openness. Papers are usually produced
in advance to support agenda items. The Executive Directors, as managers, always seek to provide appropriate answers to
all questions asked by the Non-Executive Directors. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 42

circumstances, the absent Director is provided with a copy of the Board papers and the resultant minutes and has the
opportunity to raise questions at a subsequent meeting.
All new Non-Executive Directors are to be appointed for specified terms.
Notice periods for all Directors are set at six months or less. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 43
GOVERNANCE
The Committees of the Board
The following Committees have been established to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities.
Audit Committee
During the year the Committee met twice to fulfil its duties. A record of individual attendance is listed in the table above. 
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Group Finance Director and external auditors were invited to attend both meetings.
This Committee is responsible for overseeing the involvement of the Group’s auditors in the planning and review of the
Group’s financial statements and any other formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial performance, for
recommending the appointment and fees of its auditors, and for discussing with the auditors the findings of the audit and
issues arising from the audit. The Committee considers the independence and objectivity of the auditors with regard to the
way in which it conducts its audit duties. It reviews the Group’s compliance with accounting, legal and listing requirements.
It is also responsible, along with the Board, for reviewing the effectiveness of the systems of internal control.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available for public inspection at the Company’s registered office.
In the normal course, the Company will expect its auditors to provide audit and tax services, subject to auditor objectivity,
independence regarding audit duties, review and re-tendering every four years. The Audit Committee has discretion to 
vary this review period depending on satisfaction with the audit process. A review was conducted this year and the Audit
Committee’s recommendation is that KPMG Audit Plc be re-appointed as the Company’s auditors. An appropriate resolution
will be put before the shareholders at this year’s Annual General Meeting.
All other non-audit/tax advisory (e.g. due diligence) services will always be benchmarked by management to ensure value for
money, auditor objectivity and independence of advice. Management may exercise its discretion to retain the auditors for
such services subject to a de minimis of £50,000 per individual transaction or, for a series of smaller transactions, fees
aggregating 50% of the annual combined audit and tax fee as projected in each year’s initial auditors’ review. Transactions
involving higher fees, or where the independence of the auditors may be called into question, may be agreed by the Audit
Committee Chairman who will, at his discretion, refer the matter for approval by the full Audit Committee in material cases.
The auditors do not receive management consultancy work.
The members of the Audit Committee (all of whom are Non-Executive Directors) are Derrick Nicholson (who chairs the
Committee), Nigel Whitehead and the Hon.Michael Benson.
The Board is satisfied that Derrick Nicholson, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, has recent and relevant financial experience.
The role of the Audit Committee is to monitor all financial statements of the Company, review internal financial controls,
consider the need for an internal audit function and report to the Board on its findings if it considers action or improvement
is required.
The Board reviews the Company’s requirement for an internal audit function on an annual basis. It has determined that 
the Group is not sufficiently complex in overall size or structure to warrant a dedicated internal audit function. The Audit
Committee considers they have adequate structures in place to monitor financial statements and review financial controls
without the requirement for a permanent internal audit function. This position will be kept under annual review and, should 
an internal audit function become necessary or desirable in the future, measures will be taken to ensure the Company
establishes an internal audit function without delay.
The Company has a formal ‘whistle-blowing’ policy made available to all employees of the Company and all subsidiary
companies in compliance with Code Provision C.3.4.
Remuneration Committee
The Committee considers and approves specific remuneration packages for each Executive Director following consultation
with the Chairman. In accordance with guidelines set by the Board, it determines the Group’s policy on remuneration of
senior executives and controls the operation of share option schemes and the grant of options. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 44
Corporate governance statement (continued)
Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman is set by a Committee of the Board consisting of at least two
Executive Directors.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available for public inspection at the Company’s registered office.
The members of the Remuneration Committee (all of whom are Non-Executive Directors) are Nigel Whitehead (who chairs
the Committee), Derrick Nicholson and the Hon. Michael Benson. The Remuneration Report appears on pages 46 to 53.
Nominations Committee
The Committee meets as required to initiate the selection process of, and make recommendations to, the Board with regard
to the appointment of new Directors.
The Board has established a formal procedure for appointment of new Board Directors based upon merit and objective
criteria, ensuring the appointee has sufficient time to devote to the role. The Board is satisfied with the plans for assessment
of Directors, updating of skills and knowledge regarding the Company to fulfil their functions, and orderly succession, ensuring
that an appropriate core level of skill and experience is maintained within the Company and on the Board. Any significant
commitments which might conflict with the effectiveness of new appointees is disclosed to the Board before appointment.
Major shareholders are given the opportunity to meet new Non-Executive Directors at the Annual General Meeting.

company or the Chairmanship of such company.
The members of the Nominations Committee are the Chairman and the three Non-Executive Directors. The Committee is
chaired by Richard Lapthorne.
The employment contracts for the Non-Executive Directors are made available for public inspection at the Company’s
registered office.
The Committee’s terms of reference are also available for public inspection at the Company’s registered office.

GOVERNANCE
Management structure
The Executive Directors meet regularly as part of the Executive Committee, which comprises the Executive Directors,
Strategic Business Unit Heads and senior executives to discuss strategic and operational matters. Executive Directors also
attend subsidiary Board meetings where necessary and appropriate.
Health and safety
The Company recognises the importance of health and safety and understands the high standards required to ensure the
health, safety and welfare of its employees at work, its customers and the general public. The Company has an exemplary
health and safety record.
Internal control systems
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness on an annual
basis. However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives,
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Elements of the system of material controls in line with the Turnbull guidance (which includes financial, operational and
compliance controls) are:
� An annual budget is prepared to facilitate the monitoring of the Group’s business and financial activities and is formally
adopted by the Board.
� Board meetings are held on a regular basis to consider performance against budget, the management accounts and the
forecast for the coming months.
� Within each Strategic Business Unit, the relevant Strategic Business Unit Head meets with senior executives of businesses
within that Strategic Business Unit to discuss issues particular to that business.
� The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year to consider the plans and the results of the audit performed by the
external auditors. The external auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee and vice versa.
� Business processes and internal control procedures are maintained through the BSI Certified BS EN ISO 9001: 2000
Business Process documentation.
Risk management
During the year there were processes to ensure that business risk is considered, assessed and monitored as an integral part
of the business. The Directors are of the view that from 1 July 2006 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and
Accounts, there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks that is regularly
reviewed by the Board.
Statement from Independent Directors
The Non-Executive Directors have been asked to provide their views on the effectiveness of the corporate governance
processes within the Company to ensure compliance with the Code. These views have been determined by the 
Non-Executive Directors and shared with the full Board in open session.
‘We have addressed the quality of the relationship between the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the openness of the
Chief Executive Officer with the Board, the visibility of checks and balances between the Executive Directors and whether 
all questions asked by the Non-Executive Directors in Board and Committee meetings have been appropriately addressed. 
The Non-Executive Directors have concluded that issues are fully debated at Board and Committee meetings and subjected
to rigorous scrutiny without detracting from any openness in Board relationships at all levels – particularly as between the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman and between the Executive and Non-Executive Directors.’  Morse plc Annual Report 2007 46
Introduction
The Board presents its report on remuneration, which sets out the policy and disclosures in relation to Directors’
remuneration. This report will be submitted to shareholders for their approval at the Annual General Meeting of the 
Company to be held on 30 October 2007 and has been produced in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002.
The Remuneration Committee section, Remuneration Policy section, total shareholder return performance graph and service
contracts section below are not subject to audit.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee reviews and determines on behalf of the Board the overall remuneration package of the
Executive Directors and the Chairman. The Chief Executive Officer recommends and monitors the remuneration of all other
senior executives, with appropriate oversight from the Committee. The Committee’s terms of reference are available for
public inspection. 
Its members, all Independent Non-Executive Directors, are Nigel Whitehead (Chairman), Derrick Nicholson and the 
Hon. Michael Benson. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may, upon the Committee’s invitation, also attend the
meetings of the Committee. The Chief Executive Officer does not attend where his own remuneration is being considered.
During the year, advice has been sought from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (who have been appointed by the
Committee) in relation to current market trends and best practice with regard to Directors’ remuneration. No other services
are offered by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP to the Company save for technical advice relating to the operation of the
Company’s share incentive arrangements.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The Company’s remuneration policy is designed to ensure that Executive Directors’ rewards are competitive when 
compared to similar companies, to recognise the plans for the Group and align the interests of Directors and shareholders.
The remuneration packages comprise base salary, benefits, performance-related bonuses, defined contribution pensions
and long-term incentive awards. Base salaries are set to ensure the Company can recruit and retain the most capable talent,
which the Company believes is vital for driving shareholder value. Strong emphasis is then placed on the variable
performance-related aspects of the overall package to ensure performance, both during a single fiscal year and over longer
periods, can be appropriately rewarded. Base salaries are normally set with due reference given to the median market level
with variable incentives (annual bonus and share incentive arrangements) offering upper quartile earnings for upper quartile
performance in a normal market environment. 
When setting the remuneration levels of the Directors, account is taken of pay levels elsewhere in the Group.
There were no contracts of significance subsisting during or at the end of the year in which a Director of the Company is 
or was materially interested.
Executive Directors may accept outside appointments provided these do not interfere with their duties to the Company.
Whether a Director may retain any related fees will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Duncan McIntyre is a 
Non-Executive Director of Profero Limited but this position does not attract any remuneration.
The current elements of the remuneration packages can be summarised as follows:
Base salary
The Company has decided to alter the review date of Directors’ salaries to bring them in line with all other salary reviews.
Directors’ salaries will therefore be reviewed in August by the Remuneration Committee in accordance with the terms above.
The Group results for the previous trading year, individual performance and (as stated above) market rates are considered.  
Duncan McIntyre’s salary will reduce from £320,000 per annum for his role as Chief Executive Officer, to £170,000 for his role
as Executive Deputy Chairman, effective from 1 July 2007.  
Directors’ Remuneration Report Morse plc Annual Report 2007 47
GOVERNANCE
Kevin Alcock assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer on 28 June 2007,  and was therefore only in the role for two days –
until 30 June 2007 – during the year. His salary (effective 1 September 2007) is currently £300,000.
Eric Dodd assumed the role of Group Finance Director on 28 September 2006 – before then he was acting Group Finance
Director. His salary (effective 1 September 2007) is currently £175,000.
Benefits
Benefits include the provision of a car allowance, private medical insurance, life insurance and personal accident and 
travel insurance. 
Annual performance-related bonus
The annual bonus plan has a maximum threshold of 100% of base salary. In 2007, target bonuses for individual Directors
were set in a range of 25% to 66% of base salaries. These bonuses are triggered by achieving agreed challenging
performance objectives of the Group. Bonus payments are non-pensionable and are payable after the Group’s statutory
accounts have been audited. In respect of the year ended 30 June 2007, £175,550 of bonuses were awarded to the
Executive Directors of the Company (2006: £148,334). This represents 41% of the possible maximum bonuses available to
Executive Directors. For the year ending 30 June 2008, any bonus payable will be based on achieving challenging Group
financial targets and meeting personal objectives. 
Pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution scheme (money purchase) which is operated for Executive Directors and
employees. The Company contribution rate is set at a fixed amount for each of the Executive Directors: for the relevant year,
Duncan McIntyre’s rate was set at £35,000, Kevin Alcock’s rate was set at £20,000 and Eric Dodd’s rate was set at
£10,000, making an average contribution of 9.15%. This is below the previous recommendation of 14% from the
Remuneration Committee. In August 2007 the decision was taken to move pension contributions for Executive Directors
towards median levels. Pension contributions for Kevin Alcock and Eric Dodd are £42,000 and £20,000 respectively
(effective 1 September 2007).
Executive share incentive schemes
Executive share incentives are considered to be a key part of management retention and motivation. The policy of the
Company is to incentivise Directors to perform at high levels and to align their interests with those of shareholders. 
Prior to the Annual General Meeting held on 1 November 2004, the Company operated an options-based long-term
incentive policy. Under the Unapproved and Approved versions of the Executive Share Option Schemes 2000, all option
grants were subject to a performance condition that ‘there be an average annual increase in adjusted earnings per share of
at least 5% more than the average annual percentage increase in the Retail Price Index in the three-year performance
period’. Options granted under the Morse Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme preceding the 2000 Scheme
contained the same 5% provision, but in addition allowed re-testing in a fourth consecutive financial year. 
Further details of the Executive Share Option Schemes and the Directors' interests are given below. 
At the November 2004 Annual General Meeting, the Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘Plan’) was adopted which the Committee
intends be operated as the primary long-term incentive for senior executives of the Company. Save in exceptional
circumstances, no individual may receive awards under the Plan in any financial year over shares having a market value on
grant in excess of 150% of his or her annual rate of base salary. Prior to the Committee making an award under the Plan, 
it may require a prospective participant to buy and retain Ordinary shares in the Company worth up to one-third of the value
of the shares over which the proposed award would be made.
Awards will normally vest following the third anniversary of grant once the Committee has determined the extent to which the
applicable performance conditions have been satisfied and provided the participant is still employed in the Group.  Morse plc Annual Report 2007 48
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
The performance condition attached to awards granted under the Plan to Executive Directors thus far have related to the
Company’s relative total shareholder return (‘TSR’) performance against the FTSE All-Share Software and Computer 
Services Sector.  
The percentage of shares subject to such awards that may vest is as follows:
Rank of the Company’s TSR against  
FTSE All-Share Software and Computer Services Sector Percentage of award that vests
Below median 0%
Median 25%
Upper quartile 100%
Between median and upper quartile 25% – 100% on a straight-line basis
The performance period is a single three-year period. For awards made in the period 1 July to 31 December in the year, the
baseline year is the year immediately prior to the grant. For awards made in the period 1 January to 30 June in the year, the
baseline year is the year immediately following the grant. There is no provision for re-testing. In addition, irrespective of the
Company’s TSR performance, no awards  vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Company’s earnings per share
grows in real terms over the three-year performance period (unless the Committee believes that it would be inappropriate 
to apply this underpin).
The Committee chose this performance condition as it believed it appropriate for Directors to be encouraged to generate
returns to shareholders greater than the Company’s sector peers, albeit also taking account of the Company’s underlying
financial performance. The extent to which the performance conditions are satisfied will be determined by the Committee.
The notice of Annual General Meeting accompanying this document contains details of changes that it is proposed be made
to the operation of the Company’s share incentive arrangements, with the relevant sections of the notice of Annual General
Meeting deemed incorporated into this report. Indeed, the Committee will regularly review the operation of the Company’s
share incentive arrangements to ensure they continue to take appropriate account of market/best practice and the
Company’s changing circumstances.
The following graph shows the value of £100 invested in Morse plc on 30 June 2002 compared with the value of £100
invested in the FTSE All-Share Software and Computer Services Index, which the Committee now believes is the most
appropriate index to use for this purpose as (i) the Company has been a constituent of this index throughout the relevant
period and (ii) it is the group of companies used in the Long Term Incentive Plan for these purposes. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 49
GOVERNANCE
Employee share schemes
The Company operates a number of all-employee share schemes in which the Executive Directors are also entitled to
participate. Details of the awards, granted and outstanding, under each of the schemes are given in Note 5 to the 
financial statements.
Employee Share Option Scheme
Shortly prior to listing, all employees of the Company (apart from Directors) who had commenced employment with the
Group prior to 17 February 1999 were granted options under this scheme. The value of most of the options granted was
based on both basic salary and length of service. No further options have been granted under this scheme since listing.
Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme
A number of Directors and members of senior management have been granted options under this scheme with the intention
of motivating and retaining such key personnel. No options have been granted under this scheme since April 2000 and it has
since been replaced by the Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 2000.
Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 2000 and Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 2000
These schemes were designed to provide the flexibility required in a competitive market, and were adopted by the Company
at the Annual General Meeting in November 2000. Details of the options granted under these schemes are given in Note 5 to
the financial statements.
Sharesave Share Option Schemes
The Company has established an Inland Revenue-approved Sharesave Scheme and an international Save As You Earn
Scheme. Sharesave options will be exercisable on completion of an associated savings contract. The Sharesave options
may be granted at a discount of up to 20% to the market price of the Company’s shares on the day prior to the day of
invitation, as permitted by the relevant legislation. 
Diagonal Option Schemes
At the time of the acquisition of Diagonal Plc, Diagonal employees who held options over Diagonal shares under the 
Diagonal Plc Discretionary Award of Share Options Scheme, the Diagonal Plc Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 
Diagonal Plc 1997 Savings-Related Share Option Scheme exchanged their options for equivalent options over the
Company’s shares. There are options over the Company’s shares which remain outstanding under these schemes but 
no further options will be granted under these schemes.
Service contracts
With the exception of Duncan McIntyre who was on a 12 month notice period both to and from the Company (this changed
to six months effective 1 July 2007 to reflect his revised role), Executive Directors are employed on a rolling contract and
have a six month notice period both to and from the Company. These contracts contain no provisions for termination
payments other than those that may arise under notice provisions, which the Company believes reflects market and best
practice. With the exception of Richard Lapthorne who is on a six month notice period, Non-Executive Director
appointments contain a one month notice provision and are for a 12 month duration. There are no compensation 
provisions for early termination of Non-Executive Director appointments. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 50

aligned with the interests of shareholders, and reflect the time, commitment and responsibilities of the role. 
There is no policy of paying Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration in shares, and share incentive awards will not be granted
to them. Non-Executive Directors do not receive any bonuses or pension contributions.

4 September 2007 Morse plc Annual Report 2007 54
We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) of Morse plc for the year
ended 30 June 2007 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated and Company balance sheets,
the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense and the related notes.
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act
1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and for preparing the parent company
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting
Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on 
page 39.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report
to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements. The
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Business Review Section that is
cross-referred from the Review of the Group section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the
2003 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it
does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, 
or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risks and control procedures.
We read the other information in the Report and Accounts and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.

GOVERNANCE
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
� the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of
the Group’s affairs as at 30 June 2007 and of its profit for the year then ended;
� the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of
the IAS Regulation;
� the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice, of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2007;
� the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985;
� the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2007
1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
Morse plc is a company incorporated in the UK. 
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’)
and equity account the Group’s interest in associates and jointly controlled entities. The parent company financial statements
present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company has elected to prepare its parent company
financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on pages 102 to 109.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in
these Group financial statements. 
Judgements made by the Directors, in the application of these accounting policies, that have significant effect on the
financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in Note 30.
Application of recently issued International Financial Reporting Standards
The Group has considered the following amendments to IFRS in these financial statements.
New interpretations effective at 1 July 2006 adopted by the Group that did not have a material impact are
as follows:
IFRIC 4 ‘Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease’, IFRIC 5 ‘Rights to Interests arising from Decommissioning
Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds’, IFRIC 6 ‘Liabilities arising from Participation in a Specific Market –
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment’, IFRIC 7 ‘Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting
in Hyperinflationary Economies’.
New interpretations effective for the Group from 1 July 2007 that will not have a material impact are as
follows:
IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS 2’, IFRIC 9 ‘Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives’, IFRIC 10 ‘Interim Financial Reporting and
Impairment’, IFRIC11 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions’, IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments Disclosure’. 
Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated 
at their fair value; derivative financial instruments and financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less
costs to sell.
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or
indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing
control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements 
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control commences until the date that
control ceases. Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenditure arising from 
intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
An associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term interest, usually from 20% to 50% of the equity voting
rights, and over which it exercises significant influence. A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term
interest and over which it exercises joint control. The Group’s share of the profits less losses of associates and of joint
ventures are included in the consolidated profit and loss account, and its interest in their net assets is included in
investments in the consolidated balance sheet.  Morse plc Annual Report 2007 64

Revenue
Revenue represents the values of goods delivered and services provided within the Group’s ordinary activities net of value
added tax and excluding intra-group sales. Revenue comprises sales of hardware, software, consulting services and
maintenance/support services.
Revenue recognition occurs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, despatch has occurred, the fee is
determinable and collectability is probable.  
Hardware and installation
Hardware sales are recognised on delivery, unless significant installation work is required or customer specific conditions
must be met, in which case revenues are recognised on installation or acceptance by the customer.
Consulting services
Revenues include sales of services that are delivered over extended periods of time and recognised on a percentage
completion basis over the period that the service is delivered. Profits on fixed price contracts are taken in proportion to the
cost of work performed on each contract relative to the estimated total cost of completing the contract. Revenues derived
from variations on contracts are recognised only when they have been agreed by the customer. Full provision is made for
estimated losses on all contracts in the year in which they are first foreseen.
The gross amount due from customers for contract work is included within trade and other receivables and the gross
amount due to suppliers is included within trade and other payables.
Sales of software
Revenue from the sale of software product licences at the time the software licence is granted is recognised in accordance
with the contract, typically at the time of supply of the software product to the customer.  
Maintenance and support
Revenues from maintenance and support services are recognised over the period that the services are provided. Payments
in advance of services are recorded in the balance sheet as deferred income. 
Property, plant and equipment
The cost of the tangible fixed assets, net of estimated residual value and impairment, is depreciated in equal annual
instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The residual values of assets or group of like assets and the useful
economic lives of assets are reviewed annually.
The rates of depreciation are as follows:
Leasehold improvements: Shorter of ten years and the unexpired expected term of the lease. 
Fixtures and fittings: Four years.
Motor vehicles: Four years.
Office equipment: Four years except for computer equipment, which is depreciated by 40% in the year of 
acquisition and thereafter in equal annual instalments over the next two years. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 65
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Intangible assets and goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of
subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities represents the excess of the fair value of consideration given in respect
of the acquisition over the fair value to the Group of the net assets and any contingent liabilities acquired.  
In respect of business combinations prior to 1 July 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the
acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired (Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold
separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable).
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 July 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of deemed cost, which represents the
amount recorded under UK GAAP , (which was broadly comparable, save that only separable intangibles were recognised
and goodwill was amortised).
In accordance with IFRS 3, goodwill has been frozen at its net book value at 1 July 2004, is allocated to cash-generating
units and is not amortised, but instead is subject to annual impairment reviews. Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost
less accumulated impairment losses. Any impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement. Negative
goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised in the income statement.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Expenditure on
development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has
sufficient resources to complete development. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and
an appropriate proportion of overheads. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an
expense as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment
losses. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an
expense in the period to which it relates.
Other intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Software is capitalised as
part of other intangibles and amortised over three years.
Amortisation is charged to distribution expenses on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible
assets unless such lives are indefinite. Software is capitalised as part of other intangibles and amortised over three years.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use or acquired. The estimated useful lives are 
as follows:
Trade names Ten years
Customer relationship backlog One year
Maintenance contracts Six years
Follow on consulting Eight years
Research and development Three years
Software Three years
Intellectual property Seven years Morse plc Annual Report 2007 66
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2007 (continued)
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised tangible and intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future
economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each year end to determine
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.  
For goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance
sheet date. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds
its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any
goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a 
pro rata basis. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows and that are
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed on initial
recognition of these financial assets). Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate
largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs. 
Reversal of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of receivables carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable
amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after an impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.  
In respect of other assets an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 67

Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of the previous
carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell, with any adjustments taken to profit or loss. The same applies to gains
and losses on subsequent re-measurement.  
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be principally recovered
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is 
highly probable within one year and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale 
within one year from the date of classification.  
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or
geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of, has
been abandoned or that meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Discontinued operations are presented on the
income statement (including the comparative period) as a column analysing the post tax profit or loss of the discontinued
operation and the post tax gain or loss recognised on the re-measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on disposal of the
assets/disposal groups constituting discontinued operations.
Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise debtors, creditors, other borrowings and bank borrowings. 
The Group uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign
exchange rates. The Group does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to manage the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. The Group does not apply hedge accounting and changes in the value of derivative financial instruments are
recognised in the income statement as they arise. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The fair value
of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange 
rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.  
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are
stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are
translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are
translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of
the transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation
reserve. They are released into the income statement upon disposal. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 68
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2007 (continued)
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Taxation
The tax charge for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. Taxation is recognised in the income
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior periods.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying
amount for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not
provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting
nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset 
is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised.
Leases
Operating leases and rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the period of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total
lease expense.
Net financing costs
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in the profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive the payment is established.
Pension costs
Payments made to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they accrue. Assets of the
schemes are not included within the financial statements of the Group.
Share-based compensation
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company; these awards are
granted by the ultimate parent. Share options have been granted to Monitise Ltd employees under the Monitise share option
plan. Options granted under the Group’s share option schemes are equity settled.  
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair
value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to
the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms
and conditions upon which the options were granted. True ups are made only for service and non-market conditions. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest. In FY08 the
Company is considering moving to the Monte Carlo simulation model to value share options.
During the year, the Group introduced a share matching scheme, where senior management forgo part of their bonus
entitlement for shares in the Group. The Group matches the bonus forgone on a 2:1 basis and if the employee is still with the
Group after two years, then the shares will vest. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 69
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Accounting policies (continued)
Interest in own shares 
The assets and liabilities of the Group ESOP trusts are recognised in the financial statements where there is de facto control
of those assets and liabilities. The Company’s own shares held in the ESOP trust are deducted from shareholders’ funds until
they are transferred to employees.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group manages its short-term liquidity through holding of cash and highly liquid interest bearing deposits. For the
purpose of the cash flow statement only deposits with an original maturity period of three months or less are shown as cash
and cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are shown as cash and cash equivalents.
Provisions 
Provision is made where the Group has a present legal or contractual obligation as a result of past events and it is probable
that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been
communicated to affected parties.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less associated transaction costs. Subsequent to initial
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value
being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis and
includes expenditure incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is 
the amount that can be realised from the sale of inventories in the normal course of business after allowing for the costs 
of realisation. 
Trade receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially stated at their fair value and thereafter at amortised cost.
Trade payables
Trade and other payables are initially stated at their fair value and thereafter at amortised cost.
Dividends
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Group’s right to receive payment is established. Dividends payable to the
Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in which the
shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Segmental information
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services (business
segment), or in providing products or services within a particular economic (geographical segment), which is subject to risks
and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated
on a reasonable basis.   Morse plc Annual Report 2007 70

2 Segmental reporting (continued)
Business segments (continued)
Morse operates under four key segments – Infrastructure Consulting, Applications Consulting, Management Consulting 
and Europe. 
In the year ended 30 June 2006 a separate segment called Software included the results of Diagonal Solutions and Monitise.
In the year ended 30 June 2007 Diagonal Solutions became a part of Applications Consulting and Monitise was demerged
on 28 June 2007 and is included in discontinued operations for the year ended 30 June 2007.
Discontinued operations for the year ended 30 June 2006 comprised Monitise, which included share of Mobile ATM joint
venture, Morse Germany and Morse Austria. Morse Germany and Morse Austria were part of the Europe business until their
disposal on 24 July 2006. The assets and liabilities of these operations have been classified on the 2006 balance sheet as
being held for sale.
The Infrastructure Consulting segment comprises Morse Group Limited.
The Applications Consulting segment has four main lines of business: Diagonal Consulting Global (covering our Oracle, 
SAP , enterprise service management and information management capability); Delphis (which specialises in providing
resources at the infrastructure layer, mainly to the banking sector); Marshall-Wilkins (an IT recruitment business); 
Diagonal Solutions (Wisdom™).
The Management Consulting segment comprises four businesses: CSTIM, Morse SI, SkillsHub and Morse Transaction Services.
The European segment comprises the operations in Spain and Ireland. The business activities in Spain and Ireland are
predominantly Infrastructure Consulting related. Europe is treated as a distinct business segment as its operations are
managed separately. In the geographical segment, Europe comprises the businesses in Spain and Ireland and France
(Management Consulting).
In the geographical segments, the rest of the world relates to operations in South Africa and Australia (Management
Consulting), and Malaysia and USA (Applications Consulting).
The assets and liabilities of Infrastructure Consulting and of Central are managed collectively (for example, cash is managed
on this basis) and are therefore not capable of any meaningful separation. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 73

In the year ending 30 June 2007 total revenue comprised £92,710,000 (2006: £167,720,000) of goods revenue and
£164,615,000 (2006: £199,400,000) of services revenue. In the year ending 30 June 2007 revenue of continuing

Loss on sale of discontinued operation - (7,058)
(1,371) (748)
Demerger costs comprise legal and professional fees incurred as a result of the demerger of Monitise.
Restructuring income in the year ended 30 June 2007 of £1,084,000 relates to a release of a vacant property provision. In
2007, the Group made provisions of £1,048,000 and released in the same period provisions of £2,132,000. Restructuring
costs of £4,528,000 for the year ended 30 June 2006 related mainly to headcount reductions and property costs in the
United Kingdom and Germany and were incurred as part of the restructuring of those businesses.
The trading balance credit of £13,131,000 arose in the year ended 30 June 2006 from the normal business review of these
balances. This was highlighted because of the magnitude of the release in that period. 
The goodwill impairment charge of £2,293,000 related to the sale of Morse GmbH on 24 July 2006.  
The loss on sale of discontinued operation in 2006 relates to the disposal of the business in France, Morse SAS, 
on 12 July 2005. 
The tax effect of the exceptional items is a charge of £325,000 (2006: charge of £2,825,000).
4 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted
average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Employee Benefit Trusts (Note 5)
which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of
all dilutive potential Ordinary shares. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 75

The number of potentially dilutive options that are currently non diluting are 7,887,269 (2006: 4,328,991).
Continuing operations
Basic earnings per share of 5.8p (2006: 11.2p) for continuing operations is calculated from the net profit attributable to
equity holders of the parent from continuing operations of £8,980,000 (2006: £17,064,000) divided by the weighted average
number of shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit of £8,980,000 (2006: £17,064,000) by the
diluted number of shares per the table above.
Discontinued operations
Basic loss per share of 4.8p (2006: loss per share 8.6p) for discontinued operations is calculated from the net loss
attributable to equity holders of the parent from discontinuing operations of £7,375,000 (2006: loss £13,082,000) divided by
the weighted average number of shares. Diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss of £7,375,000 (2006: loss
£13,082,000) by the diluted number of shares per the table above. 
To provide a comparable measure of performance per share from the normal operations of the business, a supplementary
EPS has been calculated in addition to the disclosure required by IAS 33 with the following adjustments to the basic and

(e) Share based payments (continued)
In accordance with IFRS 2, the 45,000 Monitise share options granted on 1 November 2005 and the 10,000 Monitise share
options granted on 18 April 2006 per Note 5d have not been fair valued.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may
occur in future.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the recent historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also
not necessarily be the actual outcome.
No other features of the options granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
The Directors consider that the value of Diagonal shares can be calculated on the same basis as the Morse plc shares as the
nature of Diagonal shares are consistent with those of Morse plc.

Notes to the financial statements

10 Goodwill and other intangible fixed assets (continued)
Impairment testing of indefinite lived goodwill
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to the cash-generating units of Morse Spain, Morse
Ireland, Infrastructure Consulting, Applications Consulting and Management Consulting for impairment testing. These are the
lowest level of cash-generating units (CGU) that can be reliably and separately identified.
The recoverable amounts of these cash-generating units have been determined based on a value in use calculation. Senior
management have based these calculations on current approved budgeted cashflows in perpetuity. The growth rates are
based on management estimates of the industry growth rates for the activities being undertake by each CGU. The discount
rate applied to cash flow projections is a pre-tax rate of 13% (2006: 13%). The pre-tax discount rate is based on
management assessment of the weighted average cost of capital post-tax of 10%. Management estimates the discount rate
reflecting current market assessment of the time value of money and risks specific to the business.
No impairment is required in the year ended 30 June 2007. The impairment charge of £2,293,000 for the year ended 
30 June 2006 related to Morse GmbH, which was sold on 24 July 2006.

The property provision brought forward relates to the properties previously vacated in the UK in prior periods. The provision
is being utilised over the length of the lease. The property provision charged in the year relates to properties vacated in the
UK. The property provision is based on discounting future cash flows over the remaining term of the lease. There is a minimal
degree of uncertainty in the projections given the fixed term nature of the leases.
Provisions have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 13% (2006: 13%).
Other provisions relate to headcount reductions in the UK.
20 Financial risk management
The Group has a committed borrowing facility of £10,000,000 (2006: £10,000,000) which had not been used at the year end.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, cash and the availability of a borrowing facility. The
Group’s cash, other facilities and deposits are at floating rates. Management manage the interest rate risk on borrowing by
using a combination of fixed and floating rates. Other current and non-current loans incur interest at a fixed rate, while other
loan notes incur interest on a floating rate basis. No interest rate derivative contracts have been entered into. Management
will continue to monitor this position to ensure that the interest rate profile is appropriate for the Group.
Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial
assets is represented by carrying value as at the balance sheet date. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 92
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2007 (continued)

Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Group’s
earnings. Over the long-term however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on
the consolidated results.
A decrease of 1% in the currencies that the Group has exposure to would not have a significant impact on the results for 
the period.

Cash (Note 17) 15,345 27,263
Net financial assets 29,709 37,211
The loan notes are all denominated in Sterling and represent part of the consideration arising as a result of the acquisition of
Relational Concepts Limited, Hughes Rae Limited and Delphis (Holdings) Limited. The loan notes bear interest based on
LIBOR. These amounts are repayable over a fixed term to coincide with receipt from customers and are secured on these
receipts. Loan notes are disclosed with other payables.
The other loans as at 30 June 2006 represented amounts borrowed against sales made on extended credit terms. 
Other financial liabilities represent the fair valued amount of any outstanding forward contracts in place as at 30 June 2006.

Cash 15,345 27,263
The majority of cash has been invested during the year in a number of Open Ended Investment Companies’ funds which
usually offer rates of return in excess of those that can be earned on the money market but which are considered by the
Group to have a sound credit rating and therefore constitute a low risk. The remaining cash earns interest at market 
interest rates.
On 1 July 2007 the Group invested £6,672,911.70 of their surplus funds in Open Ended Investment Companies. The Group
has same day access to these funds.
Currency and exchange rate risk management
A proportion of the Group’s revenues and costs are denominated in currencies other than Sterling (principally in Euros and
US Dollars). In order to reduce the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the Group will try to purchase
both goods and services in foreign currency to match the projected revenues in that trading currency. The Group also enters
into forward contracts up to four months forward to reduce the exposure that arises on sales and purchases denominated in
foreign currency. There are no forward contracts as at 30 June 2007. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 95

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
22 Capital and reserves (continued)
The share capital issued at nominal value in the year relates to the exercise of share options (401,132 shares, £41,000) 
and to previously deferred consideration on the acquisition of CSTIM Limited (2,863,716 shares, £286,000) and of 
SkillsHub Limited (269,143 shares £27,000).  
In the year ended 30 June 2007 share capital to be issued decreased by £3,803,000 due to the issue of 2,863,716 
shares for the acquisition of CSTIM Limited. During the same period share capital to be issued increased by £625,000 
(585,096 shares) in relation to deferred consideration on the acquisition of SkillsHub Limited, of which £277,000 
(269,143 shares) were issued by the year end. Share capital to be issued of £348,000 (362,760 shares) as at June 2007
relates to the deferred consideration on the acquisition of SkillsHub Limited and is based on the business acquired achieving
certain financial targets. £174,000 of the total share capital is to be issued within one year, the relevant targets having been
settled, and £174,000 is to be issued after one year up to June 2009. 
The premium arising on the exercise of share options was £382,000 (2006: £599,000). On the exercise of share options,
£166,000 (2006: £407,000) was received from employees.
The capital redemption reserve is used to maintain the Company’s capital following the purchase and cancellation of its 
own shares.
When share options are exercised using the Morse Employee Benefit Trust, the difference between the market value of the
shares and the exercise price of the options is charged to profit and loss account reserve. Simultaneously a transfer from
other reserves to the profit and loss account reserve is made for the related charge recorded when the options were granted
under the Morse Group company share option plan, or the Diagonal employee share plans.
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange difference arising from the translation of financial
statements of foreign subsidiaries.
The increase in the merger reserve of £3,900,000 is the share premium arising on the 3,130,000 shares issued as
consideration on acquisitions, which has been recognised in accordance with s131 of Companies Act 1985. £3,650,000 of
the share premium on 2,863,716 shares relates to the prior year acquisition of CSTIM Limited and £250,000 share premium
on the 269,143 shares relates to the current year acquisition of SkillsHub Limited.
The share of profit of minority interest of £102,000 consists of a share of a current year profit of £197,000 offset by £95,000,
which represents the decrease in minority interest resulting from the acquisition of the remaining 49% of SkillsHub Limited.  
23 Capital commitments
The Group does not have any capital commitments as at 30 June 2007. Morse Group Limited, a subsidiary entity, had a

25 Demerger of a subsidiary
On 28 June 2007 Monitise group demerged from Morse plc. The demerger was effected by Morse declaring a special
dividend, equal to the book value of its shareholding in Monitise group at that time. This was satisfied by the issue by
Monitise of demerger shares, credited as fully paid, to qualifying shareholders in consideration for the transfer by Morse to
Monitise of the entire issued share capital of Monitise group. 
The aggregate of all debts owed by Monitise group to Morse plc prior to the demerger was £9,200,000. All intercompany
debts were settled by the issue of one additional ordinary share in Monitise group, in consideration for an undertaking to pay
£9,200,000 to Monitise group in respect of the share. 
The demerger costs amount to £2,455,000 and represent legal and professional fees in carrying out the demerger
transaction. Net assets demerged are as follows:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(i) Accounting policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention where appropriate, and in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards, using the following principal accounting policies which have
been consistently applied. The accounting policies below cover items which are considered material in relation to the
Company’s financial statements.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company is not presented as
part of these financial statements. The loss after taxation attributable to Morse plc for the year and dealt with in the financial
statements of the Company was £3,656,000 (2006: profit of £3,011,000).
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. Trade investments are
held at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Associates and joint ventures
An associate is an undertaking in which the Company has a long-term interest, usually from 20% to 50% of the equity 
voting rights, and over which it exercises significant influence. A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Company has 
a long-term interest and over which it exercises joint control. 
Cash flow statement
The cash flows of the Company are included within the consolidated Group cash flow statement of Morse plc.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Interests in own shares
Interests in own shares are accounted for in accordance with UITF abstract 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP trusts’ which requires
the assets and liabilities of the Group’s ESOP trust to be recognised in the financial statements where there is defacto control
of those assets and liabilities. The Company’s own shares held in the ESOP trust are deducted from shareholders’ funds until
they are transferred to employees. 
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay less tax in future have
occurred at the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19. A net deferred tax asset is regarded as
recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than
not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit/loss for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Differed tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for
taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise
required by FRS 19.

(i) Accounting policies (continued)
Dividends
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Group’s right to receive payment is established. Dividends payable to the
Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in which the
shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Foreign exchange
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the actual exchange rate at the time of the
transaction or, where forward foreign currency contracts have been taken out, at contracted rates. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. 
Cash
Cash comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.

The share capital issued at nominal value in the year relates to the exercise of share options (401,132 shares, £41,000) and
to previously deferred consideration on the acquisition of CSTIM Limited (2,863,716 shares, £286,000) and of SkillsHub
Limited (269,143 shares, £27,000).  
In the year ended 30 June 2007 share capital to be issued decreased by £3,803,000 due to the issue of 2,863,716 shares
for the acquisition of CSTIM Limited. During the same period share capital to be issued increased by £625,000 (585,096
shares) in relation to deferred consideration on the acquisition of SkillsHub Limited, of which £277,000 (269,143 shares)
were issued by the year end. Share capital to be issued of £348,000 (362,760 shares) as at June 2007 relates to the
deferred consideration on the acquisition of SkillsHub Limited and is based on the business acquired achieving certain
financial targets. £174,000 of the total share capital is to be issued within one year, the relevant targets having been settled,
and £174,000 is to be issued after one year up to June 2009. 
The premium arising on the exercise of share options was £382,000 (2006: £599,000). On the exercise of share options,
£166,000 (2006: £407,000) was received from employees.
The capital redemption reserve is used to maintain the Company’s capital following the purchase and cancellation of its 
own shares.
When share options are exercised using the Morse Employee Benefit Trust, the difference between the market value of the
shares and the exercise price of the options is charged to profit and loss account reserve. Simultaneously a transfer from
other reserves to the profit and loss account reserve is made for the related charge recorded when the options were granted
under the Morse Group company share option plan, or the Diagonal employee share plans.
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of financial
statements of foreign subsidiaries.
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 30 June 2007 (continued) Morse plc Annual Report 2007 109
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(ix) Capital and reserves (continued)
The increase in the merger reserve of £3,900,000 is the share premium arising on the 3,130,000 shares issued as
consideration on acquisitions, which has been recognised in accordance with s131 of Companies Act 1985. £3,650,000 of
the share premium on 2,863,716 shares relates to the prior year acquisition of CSTIM Limited and £250,000 share premium
on the 269,143 shares relates to the current year acquisition of SkillsHub Limited.
The decrease of £9,200,000 in retained profits represents an investment in Monitise Group Ltd, which was written off on the
demerger (Note 25). The Directors have been advised that, at the time of the dividend of Monitise plc shares (which was
made on 28 June 2007 following a shareholder resolution passed at the Company’s extraordinary general meeting on 
25 June 2007) although the management account of the Company showed that the Company had sufficient distributable
reserves to make this dividend, the Company did not show sufficient distributable reserves in a set of ‘relevant accounts’ for
Companies Act 1985 purposes. As a technical matter, it was necessary to show that the Company had sufficient
distributable reserves in ‘interim accounts’. This procedural step was not taken. At the 2007 AGM, a resolution will be
proposed rectifying the position and approving the release of shareholders from any liability to compensate the Company in
respect of such dividend. Morse plc Annual Report 2007 110

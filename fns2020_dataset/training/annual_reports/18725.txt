CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
We have completed a thorough review 
of all of our businesses during 2015 and 
have undertaken a number of appropriate 
actions. The Group ended 2015 in far better 
operational shape than it began the year.
Derek Mapp Chairman
STRONG LEADERSHIP
2015 was my first full year as Chairman 
of the Board of Huntsworth, a year 
that saw significant change with new 
leadership and a full strategic review.
I believe that we now have an Executive 
team with the balance of skills and 
qualities to take the Group forward. 
As noted in my report last year, Paul 
Taaffe joined the Group in April 2015 to 
succeed the retiring Lord Chadlington. 
The appointment of Neil Jones as 
the Group’s CFO, with effect from 
1 February 2016, was also announced 
in 2015. Neil, who joined us from ITE 
Group plc, brings a wealth of experience, 
and his financial and commercial 
expertise will be extremely valuable as 
we implement our strategy. We have 
also welcomed Pat Billingham to the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director.
We have completed a thorough review 
of all of our businesses during 2015 
and have undertaken a number of 
appropriate actions. The Group ended 
2015 in far better operational shape 
than it began the year. I am delighted 
that Huntsworth Health has continued 
its record of delivering strong growth, 
and is now the largest division in the 
Group by both revenues and profits. 
Red has also returned to revenue growth 
and has good momentum moving into 
2016. Citigate has performed strongly 
in some regions but needs to return to 
growth in others during the coming year.  Strategic

We have also implemented a number 
of cost reduction initiatives, particularly 
in Grayling, and we are confident that 
the work we have undertaken has 
positioned this division to return to 
growth. Grayling has been successful 
in securing some large contracts, 
especially in Africa and the Middle East.
The Executive leadership, the Board 
and its Committees are now at full 
strength. The key operational objective 
of 2016 is returning the Group to 
sustainable revenue and profit growth. 
A lot of hard work has gone into 
establishing a strong base for 
fulfilling this, and we begin 2016 
with cause for optimism.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank the management team and 
staff for their hard work in getting to 
this stage. I look forward to reporting 
on our progress in delivering these 
improvements during 2016.
“ THE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP, THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES 
ARE NOW AT FULL STRENGTH. THE KEY OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVE 
OF 2016 IS RETURNING THE GROUP TO SUSTAINABLE REVENUE 
AND PROFIT GROWTH.” 06 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Since joining in April 2015, I have completed 
a strategic review focused on evaluating  
the specialisations of each of our businesses, 
assessing their future potential and determining 
how to best increase their growth rates. As  
a result, the Group is undergoing a number  
of significant changes, which will allow its 
constituent businesses to deliver their  
full potential.
Paul Taaffe Chief Executive Officer
DELIVERING OUR  
FULL POTENTIAL
Achieving our strategic objectives 
requires having outstanding and 
talented people at every level of our 
businesses. During 2015 we have 
refreshed the senior management 
teams in a number of our agencies, 
invested in talent to facilitate growth 
in the businesses with the most 
potential, and put in place incentive 
schemes to better align key talent with 
Group objectives. Establishing the 
right talent in each market will drive 
new business wins and enable us to 
improve client retention, delivering both 
organic revenue and profit growth.
Alongside these investments, we 
have looked to right-size the cost 
base of each business by redeploying 
resources, closing offices where 
necessary and restructuring others 
to align them to market needs. The 
second half of 2015 focused on 
completing this restructuring, which 
positions each of our businesses for 
sustainable profit growth in 2016 and 
beyond. I am pleased to say that, as 
the Group ended 2015, the majority of 
this restructuring is now complete.
When we announced our interim results, 
I looked forward to a second half year 
in which Huntsworth Health would 
continue on its double-digit growth 
trajectory and Grayling would return to 
stronger profitability after a poor first 
half year. I am pleased to report that 
the Group delivered on both of these 
expectations, although in Grayling’s 
case, these are still early days and we 
continue to see some volatility in trading. 
Group performance overview
Full year results for 2015 have been 
mixed. Revenue grew by 1.5% on a 
like-for-like basis, returning Huntsworth 
to revenue growth for the first time 
since 2011. Operating margin before 
central costs and highlighted items 
was 13.1% (2014: 15.0%). This represents 
an absolute year-on-year reduction in 
operating profit before central costs 
of £2.6 million. Operating loss after 
highlighted items was £37.8 million 
(2014: £56.9 million) which includes 
goodwill impairment charges of £48.8 
million (2014: £71.5 million). Full year 
profit before tax and highlighted items 
was £13.3 million (2014: £16 million). Strategic  
Report

Financial

Other  
Information
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 / Huntsworth plc 07
Central costs for 2015 of £6.9 million 
have exceeded the 2014 level by 5.5%, 
largely due to the dual running of 
my costs from April with those of my 
predecessor, Lord Chadlington, who 
continues to act as Special Adviser until 
6 April 2016. I would like to acknowledge 
Peter’s personal contribution to the 
Group he led over many years. I would 
also like to thank Brian Porritt, our 
interim CFO, who successfully led 
the restructuring process in 2015.
Interest costs for the year were 
£2.0 million, a reduction of £0.2 
million compared to 2014. The Group’s 
effective tax rate has increased to 27% 
as the continued growth of Huntsworth 
Health increases the proportion of the 
Group’s profits that arise in the US.
The combination of the above 
elements results in adjusted 
diluted earnings per share of 3.0p 
compared with 3.7p in 2014.
Working capital management 
and further net debt reduction 
were priorities for the Group 
during the year, with net debt at 
31 December 2015 reducing to 
£30.4 million (2014: £35.6 million).
Divisional performance overview
Huntsworth Health
Huntsworth Health is now the Group’s 
largest division by both revenue and 
profit. It has a strong portfolio of 
specialist healthcare communications 
agencies that have continued to deliver 
double-digit revenue growth whilst 
maintaining strong operating margins. 
Revenue growth accelerated in H2 2015, 
reaching 13.7% on a like-for-like basis for 
the full year (H1: 11%; H2: 16.3%). These 
growth rates are well above industry 
averages, and represent a very strong 
result. This growth was led by Evoke 
Health, our digital consumer agency.
Revenue growth has been driven 
through expansion of key client 
relationships, significant new client 
wins, and a focused approach to 
solving the myriad of challenges facing 
our clients as the healthcare world 
continues its rapid change. Huntsworth 
Health’s top five clients delivered 
£29.4 million of revenue in 2015, 
compared to £20.6 million in 2014.
Awards won in 2015 include the 2015 
LTEN Provider Innovation Award Winner, 
Pharma Times: 2015 International 
Communications Agency Team of the 
Year Winner, Communiqué Awards 
2015 Finalist: Writing Excellence – 
HCPs (Novo Nordisk), PM Society 
Awards: 2015 Gold Winner, Craft 
Award for Primary Care Campaign 
(AstraZeneca) and IPA Best of Health 
Awards 2015 Bronze Award: Consumer 
(patient) Film Campaign (Vertex).
New business momentum is solid 
entering 2016 and the foundation 
has been set for continued organic 
revenue and operating profit 
growth with sustained operating 
profit margins in 2016. 
Huntsworth Health continues to 
establish and build new growth 
platforms with a new full-service digital 
marketing agency FIRSTHAND opened 
in Q4 2015 and a digital consulting 
business TraverseHealth opening in 
Q1 2016. Huntsworth Health is also 
growing revenues in the expansion 
markets of Asia Pacific and the Middle 
East, where we have opened new 
offices in Shanghai and Dubai.
We have also invested in talented 
teams in our other specialist agencies, 
with several ending the year under 
new senior management, and with 
strong momentum. Huntsworth 
Health is well placed to continue its 
strong performance into 2016.
Grayling
Grayling revenues fell 7.4% on a like-
for-like basis for the full year, although 
the rate of decline slowed with each 
successive quarter. Similarly, operating 
margin, whilst only 4.2% for the full 
year, improved with each quarter. 
Grayling was the focus of the majority 
of the restructuring activity in 2015 – in 
order to halt its decline, right-size its 
cost base and, importantly, to reinvest 
in order to take advantage of the most 
promising growth opportunities. 
This programme included the closure 
of seven offices, with others being 
fundamentally restructured. The 
leasehold property portfolio has 
been rationalised, with consolidations 
in the major cities completed or in 
progress by the end of the year.

08 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
A new leadership team is now in place 
following the departure of the CEO and 
CFO in January 2015, and new senior 
management has been appointed in 
a number of significant markets. 
Grayling UK underwent significant 
transition in 2015. The business saw a 
change in leadership midway through 
the year and a restructuring of the 
business in Q4 to create a more focused, 
leaner structure for growth in 2016. 
Q4 also saw the merging of Atomic 
into Grayling UK to strengthen its 
consumer and technology proposition 
in the marketplace. Significant wins in 
the second half of the year included 
wide-ranging work with HSBC and 
the prestigious 23
rd
 World Energy 
Congress in Istanbul, in partnership 
with Grayling Turkey. Grayling UK also 
won important strategic projects with 
TFL and a GP recruitment programme 
for the NHS. As we move into 2016, 
Grayling UK is already seeing the 
positive effects of the restructuring 
with some high-profile wins.
Grayling US generated organic 
growth with ZTE, the Chinese mobile 
phone manufacturer, and added 
several significant wins including 
Dechert LLP, Amadeus and integrated 
marketing work for Edmunds.com 
and Lowe’s, the national retailer. 
It expanded its affiliate network 
throughout Latin America and added 
several key hires from professional 
services and technology sectors.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 / Huntsworth plc 09
Grayling increased its regional strength 
across Continental Europe, including a 
number of key leadership appointments 
and structural transformations which 
extended the agency’s multi-market 
capabilities. Grayling’s multi-country 
accounts across Continental Europe 
now represent over 50% of the revenue, 
with 35 clients spanning at least 
three markets simultaneously. Major 
regional wins like Croatian National 
Tourist Board (‘CNTB’) are also the 
result of these changes. Grayling 
Spain received an additional boost by 
being named the ‘Best Agency of the 
Year’ by PR Noticias, the most high-
profile award available in Spain.
2015 was a stellar year for Grayling’s 
Middle East, Turkey and Africa (‘META’) 
business, with growth delivered right 
across the region. Grayling’s Africa plan 
got underway with a new office in Kenya 
now acting as the hub for business in the 
East Africa region, and the focus moving 
forward will widen as the same approach 
is taken for West Africa through entry 
into the Nigerian market. At the 2016 
African Excellence Awards Grayling 
won a number of awards, including best 
newcomer agency of the year, best 
website, best mobile communication 
and social app, best travel and 
tourism campaign, best social media 
programme as well as being named 
runner-up in the best launch category.
Moving into 2016, whilst the Qatar 
business is set to retract, the 
UAE continues to generate good 
opportunities and larger mandates 
are now coming through in Oman. 
Aside from a broader footprint across 
the region, the business continues to 
diversify with the creative services 
team providing world-class brand 
development programmes through 
to digital applications, exhibition 
support and experiential activations. 
For Grayling Asia, 2015 was a year 
of restructuring and investment; 
the office in Thailand closed, and 
two new MDs were appointed. The 
businesses are now right-sized and 
positioned for future growth. 
Citigate 
Citigate’s individual businesses have 
performed very differently in 2015.
Citigate First Financial in the 
Netherlands achieved 26.6% like-
for-like revenue growth and strong 
operating margins. Citigate’s Asian 
businesses also delivered strong 
margins on 2.9% revenue growth.
By contrast, Citigate’s London 
businesses suffered a like-for-like 
revenue decline of 16.9% and a 
sharp drop in operating margins. 
As announced at the half year, price 
competition for mandates remains 
strong and, in London, the business 
continues to face a challenging 
environment, which is reflected in the 
full year figures. A new investment 
programme, which began in the second 
half of the year, continues to progress 
with the aim of strengthening Citigate’s 
positioning, offering and margins.
Despite operating in a tough 
environment, Citigate continued to 
demonstrate its leading position in IPO 
communications by advising on key 
UK, European and Asian IPOs in 2015. 
These included Ibstock, On the Beach, 
Sanne Group and HSS Hire in the UK; 
ABN AMRO and Flow Traders in the 
Netherlands; OSE Pharma and Abivax 
in France, Nordic Nanovector in Norway 
and Jumbo Group in Singapore. 
Citigate had a stronger second half than 
first half and the division looks to return 
to growth in 2016. A number of new 
and important mandates were secured 
in the last few months of the year, 
notably QinetiQ, Charter Court Financial 
Services, Saudi Electricity Company, 
Allied Minds, Silverfleet Capital, 
Collinson, Momentum Pensions, Global 
Jet Capital, Gama Aviation and Source.
Red
Red Consultancy grew 4.2% in 2015 on 
the back of strong demand for consumer 
campaigning as well as growth in 
corporate and technology services. 
Operating margins were maintained 
at Red’s long-term level of 20%.
Notable highlights included the 
launch of McDonald’s Signature range 
of premium burgers; the launch of 
the latest instalment of the world’s 
most popular video game, Call of 
Duty Black Ops III, for Activision; 
and Carling’s Brighton or Barbados 
campaign for Molson Coors. All of these 
high-profile campaigns saw media 
relations, social media and events 
combined to create major impact.
New clients won during 2015 included 
leading housebuilders Crest Nicholson, 
Heathrow Airport, SlimFast, Listerine, 
and Royal Caribbean cruises.
Many industry awards were won 
for the agency’s lauded work for 
NHS’s Blood and Transplant service, 
as well as for work for McDonald’s, 
Samsung and Allergan.
The agency’s outstanding talent 
development was recognised 
with its second Media Employer 
of the Year award.
Growth momentum and organic 
investment plans give encouragement 
for continued improvements in 2016.
Group outlook
2015 has been a year in which the 
underlying cost base has been largely 
addressed and resources invested 
to appropriately position each of 
our businesses for the future.
The full year benefits of the 
restructuring, along with the 
introduction of new senior management 
at a number of our individual agencies 
and other investment initiatives, leaves 
the Group well placed to achieve 
stronger revenue growth and an 
improved profit performance in 2016.

CASE STUDY
Pfizer VTEAM:  
A PHARMA FIRST
Pfizer has worked in the thrombosis  
field for decades. With limited resources, 
the goal was to establish a platform for 
sustained engagement with UK 
healthcare professionals and facilitate 
peer-to-peer education and best practice 
sharing in cancer-associated thrombosis 
management. We developed a Pfizer-
first programme combining social media 
and an online community for multi-

CASE STUDY
Amyloidosis is a rare and life-threatening 
disease. It is often missed or 
misdiagnosed, resulting in patients going 
untreated and at risk of sudden death  
or life-limiting symptoms. We work  
with Prothena to improve outcomes  
for patients with amyloidosis by  
raising awareness of the symptoms, 
understanding the patient journey, and 
providing the evidence underpinning 
improved patient outcomes. Working 
collaboratively across different  
healthcare specialties and patient 
organisations, we provide a joined-up 
approach to highlighting an unmet 
medical need and providing new, 
evidence-based solutions.

OUR STRATEGY
OUR STRA TEGY
Our four principal 
agency groups 
each have sector or 
service specialisations 
which are aligned to 
Group objectives.
Market opportunity
Specialist marketing and 
communication service agencies 
that focus on delivering measurable 
improvements in clients’ performance, 
such as differentiation and the ability to 
navigate fast-changing environments, 
will always be in demand.
Huntsworth acquires, creates and 
develops specialist agencies that deliver

The shared objective of all of our Group 
companies is to deliver high-value 
solutions to clients through the 
integration of our creative and technical

CROATIAN NATIONAL TOURIST 
BOARD: FULL OF LIFE
An integrated programme across 
multiple media and markets across 
EMEA, with a strong focus on digital 
engagement, user-generated content 
and experiences, supported by ongoing 
press office. 
2015 saw a number of major activations, 
including a hugely successful social 
listening campaign reaching out to 
people, letting them know that ‘Croatia 
Loves You’ and sending them a licitar – a 
national symbol and token of affection. 
The audience was also engaged on 
Facebook with the chance to win trips to 
Croatia by creating licitars and emailing 
them to friends using a specially 
designed online app. With nearly 3,000 
licitars created, the competition was a 
huge success.
‘Full of Life’ was a giant VIP and 
consumer activation event on the 
occasion of Croatia National Tourist 
Board’s brand relaunch. Core to this was 
a 9x10m artificial island towed down the 
River Thames providing a unique photo 
opportunity and the backdrop for two 
days of Croatian festivities. Attendees 
were given RFID bracelets connected to 
their social graphs so that they could 
instantly share photographs and their 
creations on a digital graffiti wall. A video 
of the event was posted to Facebook and 
received 1.2 million views and was shared 
145,000 times.
In the first half of 2015 there were 
270,000 additional visitors to Croatia 
and a 7.6% increase in tourism revenues. 
Our campaigns generated 2.7 million 
interactions on social media, a 
phenomenal 6% of all people reached, 
and resulted in an 18% increase in search 
volume of Croatia as a destination.

Revenue and clients
Huntsworth plc is a healthcare 
communications and public relations 
Group with 63 principal offices across 
29 countries. In 2015 the Group 
worked for circa 1,870 clients.
The Group comprises four divisions: 
Huntsworth Health, Grayling, Citigate, 
and Red. At 31 December 2015 the 
Group employed approximately 
1,570 staff with an average annual 
fee income per head of £107,400.
Geographically, 30.6% of Group 
revenue in 2015 was from the UK; 
14.6% from European countries; 47.5% 
from the US; and 7.3% from Asia 
Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. 
51% of the Group’s revenue is derived 
from companies in the FTSE 100, 
Fortune 500, FTSEurofirst 300 
or Top 50 Pharma Companies. 
Currency
Sterling strengthened during 2015, 
which resulted in a £0.6 million decline 
in the Group’s operating profit due to 
changes in average exchange rates 
as compared to 2014. In addition, 
there has been a £3.6 million credit 
to other comprehensive income 
and expense from the retranslation 
of the Group’s overseas assets. Strategic

Cash flow and net debt
The strong cash collections from 
H1 continued in H2, resulting in 
overall cash conversion of operating 
profit into operating cash flows 
before highlighted items of 119%.
Operating cash flow before 
highlighted items was £18.2 million. 
Free cash flow (after interest, tax and 
capital expenditure) of £9.5 million 
was generated before dividend 
payments of £3.8 million and earn-
out payments of £0.7 million.
The resulting reduction in net debt at 
year end to £30.4 million, from £33.5 
million at 30 June and from £35.6 
million at 31 December 2014, despite the 
restructuring costs, is a strong result.
Following a £25 million voluntary 
cancellation in October 2015 of part 
of the revolving credit facility, the 
Group now maintains a revolving 
credit facility of £65 million and a 
committed overdraft facility of £5 
million – both of which mature in 2019. 
The Group remains comfortably within 
the terms of its banking facilities.
Dividends
The Board will propose at the 
forthcoming AGM a final dividend 
of 1.25 pence, bringing the total 
2015 dividend to 1.75 pence, in line 
with 2014. The record date for this 
dividend will be 27 May 2016 and it 
will be payable on 7 July 2016. A scrip 
dividend alternative will be available.
The dividend payout ratio for 
2015 is 60% (2014: 47%).
Highlighted items
Operating highlighted items of 
£53.1 million include £48.8 million 
non-cash impairment of goodwill, 
£0.6 million of impairment of 
software development costs, £0.8 
million for non-cash amortisation 
of intangible assets, £3.3 million of 
restructuring costs, and a credit of 
£0.4 million in respect of acquisition 
and transaction-related items. 
At the Interim Results announced in 
August 2015, goodwill was impaired 
by £48.8 million, being £38.0 million in 
respect of Grayling and £10.8 million in 
respect of Citigate. The carrying value of 
goodwill has been reviewed again at the 
2015 year-end but no further impairment 
charges are considered necessary.
Restructuring costs incurred during 
2015 were in relation to the Group-wide 
strategic review. Of the total costs of 
£3.3 million, the majority related to 
people (£2.7 million) with the remainder 
being property and associated costs.
Tax
The total tax credit of £0.4 million 
comprises an underlying tax expense 
of £3.6 million together with a credit of 
£4.0 million on highlighted items. The 
full-year underlying tax rate is 27.0% 
(2014: 25.0%). The highlighted tax 
credit of £4.0 million includes a £3.5 
million deferred tax credit relating to 
the goodwill impairment charge in the 
period. Net corporation tax paid in the 
year was £1.3 million (2014: £1.3 million).
Earnings 
Profits attributable to ordinary 
shareholders before highlighted 
items were £9.7 million (2014: £12.0 
million). Losses after highlighted items 
attributable to ordinary shareholders are 
£39.4 million (2014: loss of £56.2 million).
Before highlighted items, basic 
earnings per share for 2015 is 3.0p 
(2014: 3.8p) and diluted earnings per 
share is 3.0p (2014: 3.7p). Basic loss 
per share after highlighted items is 
12.3p (2014: loss of 17.6p) and diluted 
loss per share after highlighted 
items is 12.3p (2014: loss of 17.6p). 20 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015

CASE STUDY
During the course of 2015, Citigate was 
appointed to provide Financial PR for  
UK and European IPOs ranging from  
£16 million to £2.9 billion in deal value.  
It worked with the firms on all aspects  
of IPO communications, from media 
strategy and company positioning,  
to the drafting of press releases, market 
announcements and new corporate 
websites. Three notable IPOs which 
Citigate worked on were those of  
ABN AMRO, Ibstock and Jumbo Group. 
ABN AMRO Bank was privatised and 
listed on Euronext on the Amsterdam 
Stock Exchange in November 2015. 
Citigate successfully differentiated the 
business story as a strongly capitalised 
bank with focused growth and an 
attractively valued returns story versus its 
European peer group, contributing to a 
successful IPO which was oversubscribed 
and valued at €3.8 billion. 
Citigate also worked with Ibstock, a 
leading manufacturer of clay bricks and 
concrete products, with operations in the 
United Kingdom and the United States, 
which listed on the Main Market of the 
London Stock Exchange in October 2015. 
Since listing, its shares have performed 
positively and it is now a member of  
the FTSE 250.
Citigate in Singapore worked on  
Jumbo Group’s Catalist Board listing on 
Singapore’s Exchange in November 2015. 
Jumbo Group is one of Singapore’s 
leading multi-dining concept F&B 
establishments, which is best known for 
the country’s iconic dish chilli crab. With a 
market capitalisation of S$160.3 million, 
the listing raised S$40.8 million in total 
and attracted prominent institutional 
investors including a unit of Temasek 
Holdings, which is a sovereign wealth fund 
of the Government of Singapore, and 
strong interest from retail investors. 
Having nearly doubled its share price 
to date since its listing, Jumbo was one 
of the best performing IPOs of the year 
with a ‘winning recipe’ for growth 
and expansion.

RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS
RESPONSIBLE  
BUSINESS
Introduction
The Group recognises the impact of its 
business operations on a diverse range 
of stakeholders, including our employees 
and the wider community. 
This report outlines the Group’s approach 
to responsible business practices and details 
some of the activities that we have undertaken 
in 2015. We remain dedicated to growing our 
business and delivering shareholder value while 
maintaining an uncompromising stance on 
unethical practices, products or organisations. 
Our approach reflects the diverse, independent 
operations of the Group and each business 
implements these practices in a way that 
is appropriate for them. 
Our ethics 
Our overriding aim is to continue to 
build and support a culture which values 
openness, accountability and disclosure. 
Our Code of Ethics is published on 
the Group’s intranet and all employees 
have access to Group policies and 
Bribery Act training via a dedicated 
policy management system. Each 
employee is responsible for upholding 
the principles and practices set out 
within it. All employees have access to 
an independent whistleblowing hotline 
which enables them to voice any 
concerns without risk. 
Before accepting work that may pose an 
ethical risk, employees are required to 
seek advice from the responsible person 
or committee in their company and/or 
division. In certain circumstances the 
decision is referred to the Group CEO, 
who makes the final decision.
Huntsworth seeks to comply with 
all applicable laws and respect 
internationally recognised human rights 
standards in every location in which we 
operate. We aim to make a positive 
contribution to human rights through 
the clients we work with, our choice of 
suppliers and our own HR policies 
and practices.
Our people
The experience, knowledge and 
creativity of our people is integral to the 
success of our business. We have in place 
employment policies and practices that 
enable us to attract, retain and develop 
our talent and ensure that the Group 
retains its market-leading position.
Diversity
We actively deploy recruitment policies 
and practices which enable us to attract 
the widest possible sources of talent into 
our business, which develops an 
inclusive culture. 
All employees are recruited, appraised, 
trained and promoted on the basis of 
fairness, professional competence and 
contribution. We do not discriminate 
directly or indirectly against any 
individual on the basis of gender, marital 
status, race, nationality or ethnic origin, 
religion or belief, age, sexual orientation, 
disability, pregnancy or part-time or 
full-time employment status.  Strategic

2015 GENDER DIVERSITY
The Group’s equal opportunities policy 
is designed to ensure that disabled 
people are given the same consideration 
as others and enjoy the same training, 
development and prospects as 
other employees.
 
In terms of gender diversity, as at 
31 December 2015 women accounted for 
38% (29) of executive management, 57% 
(65) of senior management and 65% 
(1,028) of total employees. There are 
currently two female Non-Executive 
Directors on Huntsworth’s Board. 
The Board understands the benefits of 
boardroom diversity and its aspiration 
and expectation is to maintain the 
proportion of women on the Board to at 
least the current level, while maintaining 
flexibility to ensure that all appointments 
are made on the individual’s ability and 
competency to fulfil the requirements 
of the role.
Training and development
We aim for all employees to receive an 
appraisal and performance evaluation at 
least annually to assist them in their 
career development. The Group 
provides access to a number of training 
initiatives which enable our people to 
develop skills which will support our 
businesses’ development and strategy. 
Each of our Group companies also 
operates their own internal training 
programmes to keep staff up to date 
with developments in their sectors and 
provide additional skills in areas such as 
people management, leadership 
development, client management and 
international client director training.
Training programmes include a mixture 
of externally and internally facilitated 
courses. A number of our businesses 
allocate a mentor or coach to support 
personal development, perform 
appraisals and identify training needs. 
Our talent management programmes 
aim to recognise our best talent through 
both monetary incentives and providing 
additional development opportunities, 
for example through secondments into 
other areas of the business.
Communication
The Group makes use of its intranet as a 
communication tool and each division 
also has its own intranet site and 
communication tools which deliver 
specialised information and tools which 
enable our people to work effectively 
and keep in touch with local news 
and developments. 
Employees have opportunities to attend 
international conferences on matters of 
significance to their division as a whole. 
On a local scale, regular meetings are 
held between local management and 
employees to facilitate employee 
involvement in decision making and 
businesses performance.
Health and wellbeing
The Board recognises the need to 
maintain a safe and healthy working 
environment for all employees. 
Each business is responsible for ensuring 
that they operate in compliance with 
Group policies and local health and 
safety legislation. 
The Group deploys policies and 
practices which assist its employees in 
achieving an appropriate work/life 
balance, including policies on parental, 
maternity and paternity leave, 
emergency time off and, where 
applicable, flexible working practices. 
Initiatives to promote health and 
wellbeing vary by company and include:
• flexible working is promoted through 
a range of schemes including 
work-from-home schemes and 
flexible starting times and flexi-hours;
• flexible benefits packages allowing 
employees to take their entire 
package as remuneration or opt for a 
range of benefits, including private 
medical insurance, staff pension 
schemes, life assurance, childcare 
vouchers, cycle-to-work schemes, 
discounted lifestyle vouchers or extra 
holiday days;
• employee assistance programmes 
which provide confidential advice and 
counselling support across a range of 
areas; and

RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONTINUED
Our work
We apply our sustainability principles 
across all of our operations and 
wherever possible we make use of 
technologies that enable us to limit our 
environmental impact. Employees are 
trained in video-conferencing and 
webinar facilities, with virtual meetings 
being conducted where possible. When 
travel is the only option, public transport 
should be used where possible. 
Many of our businesses have developed 
specific sustainability, Corporate Social 
Responsibility and ethical business 
practices, where we work with our 
clients to develop, manage and 
communicate their sustainability and 
corporate responsibility activities. We 
work with various ‘not for profit’ and 
government organisations to tackle 
issues relating to the environment and to 
raise awareness of social issues. 
Community
The Group recognises its responsibility 
towards the communities in which its 
businesses operate. In support of our 
communities, Group businesses 
throughout the world organise activities 
for staff to raise money for charity as 
well as offering pro bono support to 
non-profit projects, helping to raise 
money and awareness for good causes.
We support our employees in 
participating in volunteering and 
fundraising activities. Our businesses 
have supported a wide range of charities 
through the year through organising and 
participating in events. The Group also 
makes formal contributions to charities. 
During 2015, the Group donated over 
£13,000 to 40 different charities around 
the world.
Environment
The Group recognises its responsibilities 
to conserve resources and is committed 
to continuous improvement in the 
environmental impact of its operations. 
Due to the nature of our businesses, the 
Group does not have a high 
environmental impact. Our principal 
impact arises from energy, paper and 
water consumption. 
Greenhouse gas emissions
During 2015, we have measured our 
greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions from 
our global operations. The Group 
measures GHG emissions based on 
financial control boundaries, so that all 
operations which are consolidated as 
subsidiaries in the Group’s financial 
statements are included in the 
measurement exercise.
We have identified the following key 
activities as being within the GHG 
reporting requirements:
• Scope 1: Natural gas, company cars, 
on-site fuel consumption and 
refrigerants;
• Scope 2: Purchased electricity, heat 
and steam.
At present, Scope 3 activities, including 
business travel, are excluded from the 
reporting scope.
We have identified GHG emissions per 
employee as the most appropriate KPI 
for the Group. 
We have collected data from offices 
across the Group. We have followed the 
2013 UK Government Environmental 
Reporting Guidelines and used emission 
factors from the UK Government’s GHG 
Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2015. The results are 
presented in the table on page 25.

In some offices in the Group’s portfolio, 
electricity and heat charges are included 
in the office rental charges and therefore 
information on the exact amounts 
consumed by those particular 
businesses is not available. In these 
instances, we have calculated an 
estimate based on the size of the 
property being let and usage data from 
similar properties. In addition, it has not 
been practicable to measure the Group’s 
emissions from refrigerants, although 
these are not expected to be significant.
Actions
A network of Employee Champions 
promote positive environmental actions 
around the Group. We aim to minimise 
energy and water consumption, through 
encouraging staff to switch off electronic 
appliances and using electricity 
generated from renewable sources. 
Paper wastage is minimised through 
promoting reuse, use of electronic 
communications and using paper from 
sustainable forests. By recycling, the 
Group’s UK businesses together saved 
the equivalent of 693 trees and 
72 tonnes of CO

CASE STUDY
Red Consultancy ensured the launch of 
Activision’s highly anticipated Call of 
Duty: Black Ops III, the world’s biggest 
entertainment franchise, hit headlines 
across mainstream media as well as 
gaming press in November 2015. 
An action-packed event culminating in a 
two-hour livestream showcasing the new 
game was created, with Red managing all 
logistics, on-the-night media opportunities 
and coordinating over 500 guests 
including media, celebrities and 
YouTube influencers. 
Content for use across traditional and 
social media channels was created 
pre-event to build momentum, along 
with interviews with celebrity Call of Duty 
ambassadors. Further social media 
amplification and media interview 
opportunities took place during the 
event. The livestream was hosted on 
mainstream websites including The Sun 
and Daily Express and was awarded a 
Guinness World Record for the ‘most 
watched video game launch broadcast’.
The launch generated hundreds of launch 
features and reviews across print and 
broadcast media as well as high 
engagement across social media channels.  28 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
PRINCIPAL RISKS
PRINCIP AL RISKS
The Group has undertaken a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group during the year. Our risk 
management approach is designed to identify risks to the 
Group using both a bottom-up and top-down approach.  
The Group considers macro, strategic, operational and 
process risks, which includes all operational, IT and financial 
risks. The likelihood and impact of each risk is determined 
using a risk scoring system. All risks are documented in the 
Group’s risk register which is reviewed at least six monthly  
or more frequently as required.
The Group obtains various forms of ongoing assurance 
over the controls in place to mitigate each of the risks 
identified. Details of the risk management processes 
undertaken in the year are included in the Corporate 
Governance Report.

Risk Risk and impact Mitigating factors Trend
MACRO
Economic 
downturn 
Any economic downturn may result in fewer 
new client mandates, longer procurement 
processes and a squeeze on pricing, or an 
outright reduction in business. This can 
impact both revenue growth and 
operating margins. 
Weak economic conditions can increase the 
length of time that clients take to pay for 
services, which can put pressure on the 
Group’s working capital. There is also an 
increased risk of bad debts occurring as a 
result of clients’ financial problems. 
Subdued global financial markets can result 
in reductions to the level of transactional 
activity, reducing client mandates.
The Group has a wide spread of clients both across geography 
and industry sector, reducing reliance on any particular 
economic environment. 
Costs are managed in each business such that they can be 
flexed where needed in a downturn. However, where there are 
protracted economic difficulties in the Group’s key markets, the 
ability of the Group to minimise the impact is constrained and 
performance may deteriorate.
The Group has formal procedures and processes, including 
contractual assurance, to mitigate against legal and financial 
risks associated with both new and existing clients. 
The Group closely reports and monitors aged debts, and 
ensures local management have action plans in place to 
minimise the risk of any loss.
 ­<>
STRATEGIC
Service 
offering fails to 
evolve to meet 
changing 
market needs
The communications industry is always 
changing, driven by client changes, 
technological change or emergence of 
competitors. The Group needs to be 
proactive in identifying and delivering 
solutions to changing client needs.
Failure to evolve can result in loss of market 
share, client losses and pressures on pricing, 
which can impact on revenue and margins. 
The Group’s range of services and international 
footprint increasingly allows us to offer clients an integrated 
portfolio of services across geographical locations which 
are attractive to new clients and help to strengthen existing 
client relationships. 
The Group continues to diversify its service offering to 
provide a full spectrum of healthcare communications and 
public relations services. 
Reviews of all new business opportunities won and lost 
across the Group are performed regularly. Appropriate 
actions are taken where new business conversion rates 
are below expectations.
 ­<>
Investment 
decisions fail 
to deliver 
expected 
growth
The Group’s strategy includes investing in 
new business opportunities, talent, 
start-ups and the acquisition of businesses 
which will broaden and enhance existing 
business operations. 
There is a risk that investments are based 
on inaccurate information or assumptions 
which fail to meet client needs and which 
may result in the investment being less 
financially beneficial than anticipated.
All significant investments are supported by a business case, 
which must be approved by Executive management and the 
Board, where appropriate.
Rigorous due diligence procedures are performed prior to all 
acquisitions in order to identify and evaluate potential risks to 
the extent possible.
In addition to the receipt of legal warranties and indemnities, 
the total consideration paid for a business typically includes 
an element of deferred consideration contingent upon future 
performance which mitigates the risk of overpaying for 
a business.
 ­<>
Loss of key 
clients 
Any loss of a key client would result 
in reduced revenues and profits and 
potentially an inability to recover amounts 
due under the contract.
The Group endeavours to build long-term relationships with 
its clients and to obtain preferred supplier and agency of 
record status where possible.
  
The Group has a large portfolio of clients and seeks to expand 
and diversify its client base where possible. Within each of our 
large healthcare clients, the Group typically provides services 
to multiple brands within that client. Client satisfaction 
reviews are also undertaken periodically to evaluate 
service quality.

PRINCIPAL RISKS CONTINUED
Risk Risk and impact Mitigating factors Trend
STRATEGIC CONTINUED
Loss of  
key talent
The Group’s talent base is its most 
important resource. There is strong 
competition within the industry for 
experienced healthcare communications 
and PR professionals.
Recruitment and retention of key individuals 
is important both for maintaining client 
relationships and ensuring that our services 
are of the highest quality.
The Group’s policy is to recruit both Directors and 
employees of the highest quality and to remunerate them 
accordingly. The Group carries out succession planning 
and provides promotion opportunities as well as operating 
both short-term and long-term incentive plans to motivate 
and retain key individuals.
Restrictive covenants are included in employee contracts 
where legally enforceable.
 ­<>
OPERATIONAL
Information 
systems access 
and security
Any information systems failure could 
negatively impact the Group’s business 
operations, including delays to client work.
Unauthorised access to confidential 
information held by the Group could 
compromise our client relationships and 
have a detrimental effect on our reputation.
Cyber security risks are perceived to be 
increasing across the industry at the moment.
Business and IT disaster recovery plans have been 
implemented to minimise any disruption in the event of an  
IT failure.
External access to data is protected by the Group’s IT 
security, which is reviewed and tested frequently to 
ensure that the Group’s network is as secure as possible. 
Internal access to data is restricted appropriately.
 ­­ Unethical 
business 
practices
Both reputational and operational damage 
may arise if the Group engages in actual or 
perceived unethical client work. Ethical 
matters that are not identified or managed 
appropriately could cause reputational 
damage to the Group.
The Group strives to foster a culture of openness, 
responsibility and ethical behaviour and has an externally 
managed whistleblowing process for the reporting of any 
unethical conduct. The Group’s Code of Ethics is provided 
to every employee and they are expected to read and 
formally acknowledge the content and act accordingly.
Referral processes, including divisional committees, are in 
place to manage all perceived ethical and conflict issues. 
 ­<>
FINANCIAL
Currency risk
A substantial proportion of the Group 
operates outside of the UK, with 
significant operations in the US and 
Europe. The Group may suffer restrictions 
on the ability to repatriate cash.
Reported Group earnings are impacted 
by any fluctuation of Sterling relative to 
other currencies, particularly the US 
Dollar and the Euro. 
The proportion of the Group’s profits 
made in the US is increasing which 
increases the level of risk when exchange 
rates fluctuate. The UK’s referendum on 
remaining in the European Union in 2016 
increases uncertainty over the future 
value of Sterling.
Most of the Group’s revenue is matched by costs 
arising in the same currency. Foreign exchange 
exposure is continually monitored, and the Group uses 
derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk 
where deemed necessary. 
Borrowings are also available to be drawn down in US 
Dollars and Euros if required to hedge foreign currency 
exposure. Surplus cash balances are swept to the UK 
to minimise any exposure to particular currencies 
or locations.

Loan facility and

Any liquidity issues could result in 
reputational damage and potentially 
impair the Group’s ability to make future 
acquisitions or settle existing obligations.
The Group has £70 million of multi-currency loan facilities 
with a syndicate of banks maturing in 2019. Management 
closely monitors all covenants on the Group’s facilities and 
actively manages undrawn headroom. 
The Group has robust cash management processes 
including weekly cash reporting from our operations and cash 
pooling arrangements.

COMPLIANCE
Legal and 
regulatory 
compliance
Any failure to adhere to legislative 
requirements, including imposed sanctions 
on the supply of services to certain 
individuals, businesses and countries, could 
lead to reputational as well as financial 
damage to the Group.
Compliance risks increase as the Group 
expands into new and emerging markets.
The Group uses internal and external legal counsel throughout 
the world to advise on local legal and regulatory requirements 
and minimise the risk of loss.
In-house training is conducted on key legislative matters such 
as health and safety, and the UK Bribery Act. 
Policies on gifts, entertainment, anti-bribery and corruption, 
electronic communications, share trading and confidentiality are 
communicated to all employees using dedicated Policy 
Management Software.
 ­ Going concern 
The Group’s activities, financial performance, position, cash 
flows and borrowing facilities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position 
over the next 12 months are described in the Strategic Report.
After reviewing the Group’s performance, future forecasted 
profits and cash flows, and ability to draw down on its 
facilities, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors are satisfied 
that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the Company’s and the Group’s financial statements.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Corporate 
Governance Code 2014, the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Company over a longer period than 12 
months. The Board has conducted this review over a period 
of three years, which was selected because it is in line with 
the Group’s long-term strategic planning period. 
The Group has developed an annual business planning 
process which comprises a strategic plan; a detailed 
budget for the next financial year; and financial projections 
for the two years thereafter, which combine to form a 
three-year plan. This process produces consolidated 
and divisional three-year plans which are reviewed and 
approved by the Board and used to monitor performance. 
These plans form the basis of detailed cash flow and 
covenant forecasting used by the Board to assess 
the ongoing liquidity and solvency of the Group.
In reviewing the three-year plan in 2015, the Board assessed 
the principal risks associated with the business model and 
strategy, including the likelihood and potential impact 
of these occurring. These risks formed the basis of the 
reverse stress testing undertaken to assess the longer-term 
viability of the Group. This considered severe but plausible 
scenarios and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions. 
In making their assessment, the Board considered the 
diversity of the Group’s operations, including the number 
of different agencies which make up the Group, our diverse 
client portfolio operating in a number of industry sectors 
and our broad geographic base. This naturally limits the 
impact on the Group of any individual severe event. The 
Group’s current committed loan facilities, which expire 
after the period of review, financial covenants and other 
requirements set out therein were also considered.
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three-year period of their assessment. 32 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015

After a number of significant 
changes to the Board in 2015,  
I am pleased to report that, as  
we enter 2016, we have a strong 
Board, equipped to lead the  
Group through this very important  
phase in its development.
In April 2015, we welcomed Paul Taaffe as Group CEO. We 
also announced the appointment of Neil Jones as Group CFO, 
who joined on 1 February 2016. We are confident this new 
executive team is well placed to deliver our key operational 
objectives of returning the Group to sustainable revenue and 
profit growth.
The new Non-Executive Directors appointed at the beginning 
of 2015 have established themselves as highly effective 
stewards of the Group through their work on the Board’s 
Committees as well as on the main Board. Pat Billingham also 
joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director and a member 
of both the Audit and Remuneration Committees effective 
from 1 December 2015, following the resignation of Farah 
Ramzan Golant CBE. Oscar Zhao stepped down from the 
Board on 30 June 2015, although BlueFocus remains one 
of Huntsworth’s largest shareholders. We have also been 
fortunate during 2015 to have had the financial guidance of 
interim CFO, Brian Porritt.
Throughout the Corporate Governance sections of this Annual 
Report we have sought to provide insight into the activities of 
the Board during the year and how the Board operates.
The Board has made significant progress in 2015. The 
strategic review led by Paul Taaffe revealed a number of key 
strengths, but also opportunities where our businesses can 
improve. Our development of the Group’s strategy during the 
year included detailed consideration as to where the risks lie 
across the Group and how these can best be managed and 
mitigated. Our risk assessment and reporting framework 
has been refreshed in the year to better align it with the 
Group’s strategy.
The Board has also reinvigorated the Group’s strategic 
planning, implementing a new three-year plan process 
and driving a more disciplined approach to budgeting 
and forecasting.
Establishing a stable Board has enabled me to lead a full 
Board evaluation process, including a review of the Board’s 
individual members and its Committees. I was pleased to 
conclude that the Board is operating effectively and has the 
skills and experience to lead the Group in 2016 and beyond.
Compliance with the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code
The Board has been able to operate effectively and within the 
principles of good governance. I am pleased to report that we 
have complied throughout the year ended 31 December 2015 
with all of the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code 
published by the Financial Reporting Council in 2014 (‘the 
Code’ available at www.frc.org.uk) relevant to a smaller 
company outside of the FTSE 350.

CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE REPORT
The role of the Board
The Board is responsible for delivering shareholder value over 
the long term, through the Group’s strategy, values and 
governance. The Non-Executive Directors have a particular 
responsibility for challenging the Group’s strategy and 
monitoring the performance of Executive Directors against

How the Board operates
Board information
Board papers containing, amongst other things, current and 
forecast trading results; governance, litigation and risk 
updates; and treasury and shareholder information, are 
distributed in advance of the meetings to allow the Directors 
sufficient time for preparation. Minutes of the meetings are 
also circulated to all Directors. The Board receives 
presentations from Executive Directors and from divisional 
management on specific issues as well as having direct 
access to senior operational management within the Group as 
required. Executive Directors are also members of operating 
company boards and are involved in regular meetings to 
consider financial, operational and compliance matters arising 
throughout the year.
Independent advice
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary who, through the Chairman, is 
responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are followed 
and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. 
In addition, all Directors have access to independent 
professional advice, if required, at the Company’s expense. 
The Chairman also holds meetings with the Non-Executive 
Directors without the Executive Directors being present.
Induction and personal development
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that induction and 
training is provided to each Director. The Company Secretary 
organised the induction process for Paul Taaffe, Neil Jones 
and Pat Billingham in 2015. Each new Director received an 
induction pack and undertook a bespoke induction 
programme that provided them with information on the 
Group, their responsibilities and obligations. The induction 
pack included information on Directors’ duties, matters 
reserved for the Board, Company policies and other 
operational and corporate governance matters, as well as 
practical information on the Company’s Virtual Boardroom 
and other Board facilities.
In order to give new Directors insight into the various 
businesses within the Group, a series of meetings are held 
with the Board members and senior executives. Meetings 
are also held with the external auditor and/or other advisors 
as appropriate.
All Board members receive updates on regulatory and legal 
changes as well as operational briefings. Training and 
development needs are kept under review by the Chairman.
Board performance evaluation 
During 2015, the Chairman conducted a Board evaluation 
process, covering the individual members of the Board and its 
Committees. The evaluation was carried out using structured 
interviews with each Director. The evaluation results were 
presented to the Board at its December meeting. The 
Chairman is monitoring progress against all action points 
identified. The Senior Independent Director also led an 
evaluation of the Chairman through interviews with 
relevant Directors. 38 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
Composition of the Board
The Board aims to have a diversity of skills, experience, length 
of service, knowledge and gender. The biographies of the 
Directors are set out on pages 34 to 35. These demonstrate a 
broad range of experience, expertise, and sufficient calibre  
to bring independent judgement on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources and standards of conduct, 
which are vital to the success of the Group.
Independence
The Board considers that, notwithstanding their interests in 
the shares of the Company as set out in the Report of the 
Directors on Remuneration, all of the current Non-Executive 
Directors are independent of the management of the Group 
and are free from any business or other relationship that 
could materially interfere with the exercise of their 
independent judgement. 
Terence M. Graunke manages and controls entities on behalf 
of Lake Capital, a private equity fund, which owns a 7.59% 
shareholding in the Company. Mr Graunke was appointed  
to the Huntsworth Board for his wide experience in the 
marketing services sector to complement the skills of his 
fellow Directors and not to represent the interests of Lake 
Capital. The Board has reviewed Mr Graunke’s role and has 
determined that he is independent in character and 
judgement and brings significant value to the business.
Oscar Zhao was a Non-Executive Director of the Company 
up to 30 June 2015. During this period, he was also the CEO 
of BlueFocus Communication Group Co. Ltd which, through 
its subsidiary BlueFocus International Limited (together 
‘BlueFocus’), holds 19.4% of the Company’s issued share 
capital. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement dated 
25 April 2013 BlueFocus is entitled to nominate one Non-
Executive Director to the Board. Accordingly, the Huntsworth 
Directors determined that, for the purposes of the Code, 
Mr Zhao was not considered independent in character and 
judgement for the period he was a Non-Executive Director. 
As at the date of this report, BlueFocus has not exercised 
its right to appoint a Non-Executive Director to replace 
Oscar Zhao. The right of BlueFocus to appoint or reappoint 
a Non-Executive Director lapses if it ceases to hold at least 
47,250,000 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company.
All Directors are subject to reappointment by shareholders at 
the first Annual General Meeting after their appointment and 
thereafter as required by the Articles of Association. All 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial period  
of three years, subject to reappointment.
Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to 
consider and, if it sees fit, to authorise situations where a 
Director has an interest that conflicts, or may possibly 
conflict, with the interests of the Company. The Board has put 
in place a formal system for Directors to declare conflicts to 
be considered for authorisation by those Directors who have 
no interest in the matter being considered. Furthermore, the 
Board has in place measures to manage any actual or 
potential conflict of interest situations that may arise, which 
operate effectively. In deciding whether to authorise a 
potential or actual conflict, the non-conflicted Directors are 
required to act in the way that they consider would be most 
likely to promote the success of the Company. They may 
impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation or 
subsequently, if they think this is appropriate.
Oscar Zhao was a Non-Executive Director until his resignation 
on 30 June 2015 and, as noted above, he was also the CEO of 
BlueFocus Communication Group Co. Ltd. As a result of this 
conflict of interest, Mr Zhao did not vote on, was not present 
at any discussion of, nor received any information relating to 
any matter in respect of which it was considered that he and/
or BlueFocus had a direct or indirect conflict of interest. 
The potential conflict of interest arising from Terence M. 
Graunke’s continuing position as Executive Chairman of 
Engine was reconsidered by the Board and the Board agreed 
to continue to authorise this conflict situation. Strategic

Risk management and internal control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for establishing, 
monitoring and maintaining the Group’s risk management  
and internal control systems. These systems are designed to 
enable the Board to be confident that such risks are mitigated 
or controlled as far as possible, although no system can 
eliminate the risks entirely.
The Group’s divisions have some autonomy with regard to  
the implementation of risk management and internal control 
systems which meet their particular business risks and 
requirements. The design and effectiveness of these risk 
management and internal control systems is subject to 
central oversight. The Board delegates the monitoring of 
these internal control and risk management processes to  
the Audit Committee. 
The Board has established a number of ongoing processes to 
identify, evaluate and manage the key financial, operating and 
compliance risks faced by the Group and for determining the 
appropriate course of action to manage and mitigate those 
risks. These measures have been in place throughout the year 
and up to the date of this Report. 
The Group has sought to implement the FRC Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting. Further details are included in the Audit 
Committee Report.
The key features of the risk management and internal controls 
system, which the Directors have established with a view  
to providing effective internal control are:
• ongoing review of strategy by the Board, which aims  
to identify potential strategic risks facing the Group;
• establishing and monitoring of the formal schedule of 
matters reserved for decision by the Board;
• establishing a defined list of authority and approval limits;
• monitoring of actual performance against budget. A 
detailed monthly management pack is prepared, which 
includes consolidated results and summarised results for 
each individual business and division. The performance of 
each business is reviewed monthly by the Executive 
Directors and reported to the Board at each meeting;
• Executive attendance at the Board meetings of each 
division, which cover any emerging operational, financial, 
strategic or compliance issues and controls;
• Board review of the principal risks identified at 
least annually;
• confirmations of key internal controls, including financial 
controls, are received quarterly from each business. The 
purpose of these confirmations is to confirm the operation 
of an appropriate system of internal controls and to 
highlight any potential new risks facing the business;
• the Executive Directors are responsible for appraising 
investments; those which are above pre-specified limits are 
put to the Board for approval;
• the Audit Committee reports to the Board at each Board 
meeting. Risks and controls are reviewed to ensure 
effective management of appropriate strategic, financial, 
operational and compliance issues; and
• the Group’s internal audit function provides an independent 
assessment of the systems and controls in place across the 
Group. Businesses are selected for internal audit on a risk 
focused basis; the results of internal audit are reported to 
management and to the Audit Committee. 
The Board and Group management continue to review and 
enhance the Group’s risk management framework to ensure 
that they are actively identifying and managing risks in the 
most efficient and effective way for the Group.
Company ethics and whistleblowing 
The Company is committed to the highest standards of 
integrity and honesty and expects all employees to maintain 
the same standards in everything they do at work. The 
Company recognises that effective and honest 
communication is essential to maintain our business values 
and to ensure that any instances of business malpractice are 
detected and dealt with.
The Company has a number of policies available via an online 
policy management portal. This includes a Code of Ethics, an 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, Guidance on Gifts and 
Entertainments Policy and a Whistleblowing Policy. In 
particular, the Whistleblowing Policy has procedures for 
disclosing malpractice and is intended to act as deterrent to 
fraud or other corruption or serious malpractice. It is also 
intended to protect the Group’s business and reputation.
During 2015, an external firm continued to provide access to 
confidential whistleblowing helplines across the Group. The 
Whistleblowing Policy encourages reporting of any instances 
of malpractice for investigation and action as required. During 
the year, no issues of significance were raised.
Investor relations
Relations with shareholders
The Company is committed to ongoing dialogue with all of 
its shareholders.
The Company holds presentations and conducts meetings 
with its institutional shareholders and City analysts 
throughout the year. The Chairman also meets with various 
institutional shareholders from time to time. The outcomes of 
the meetings are reported to the Board to ensure that the 
Board keeps in touch with shareholder views.
During the year the Board has consulted with principal 
shareholders to obtain their views on the new Remuneration 
Policy and Share Schemes to be proposed at the 2016 AGM. 
The consultation also covered the proposed approach for 
remuneration in 2016 for both the Executive and senior 
management plus the levels of employee share awards that 
can be satisfied by issuing new shares.
All shareholders are welcome to attend the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting and are encouraged to take 
advantage of the opportunity to direct questions to members 
of the Board. An overview of the Company’s results and 
future development plans is given by the Chairman at the 
Annual General Meeting prior to the commencement of the 
formal business of the meeting.

website at www.huntsworth.com.
Members of the Audit Committee are provided with sufficient 
resources, and have broad business and financial experience 
which has been gained in a variety of disciplines, which the 
Board considers provides recent and relevant experience to 
enable the Committee to carry out its responsibilities. The 
Directors’ biographies on pages 34 to 35 provide further detail.
Committee meetings
The Audit Committee held four meetings during the year.  
The Audit Committee provides a forum for reporting by the 
Group’s external auditors. Meetings were also attended, by 
invitation, by the interim CFO, the Group Financial Controller 
and the Head of Internal Audit. Provision is made for the 
external auditors and Head of Internal Audit to discuss any 
concerns they may have with the Committee in the absence 
of management. 
The Committee receives reports from management which 
provide additional information to facilitate their review.
Activities of the Committee 
The activities of the Committee are designed to assist the 
Board in carrying out its responsibilities in respect of financial 
reporting, risk management and internal control. The 
Committee considered, discussed and made decisions in 
relation to a range of matters throughout the course of the 
year, the most significant of which are highlighted below:
Financial reporting
The Committee reviewed with management and the  
external auditor:
• whether the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position, performance, business model and 
strategy; and
• the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis 
of accounting and whether the Group can meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over a three-year period (the 
viability assessment); and
• the significant issues and material judgements which were 
made in preparing the 2015 Interim Report and the 2015 
Annual Report and Accounts.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 / Huntsworth plc 41
The primary issues and areas of judgement considered by the Committee in relation to the 2015 Interim Report and 2015 
Annual Report and Accounts were:
Goodwill impairment 
The assumptions underlying the calculation of value 
in use require significant judgement to be exercised, 
primarily in respect of the achievability of budgets 
and medium-term forecasts. This is challenging for a 
group of this size, which is exposed to a wide variety of 
economic factors in a number of different markets. 
The Committee has addressed these issues through review, 
and raising challenge where appropriate, of reports prepared 
by management outlining the basis of their assumptions 
and analysing the impact of a number of different scenarios, 
particularly for the CGUs where impairments have been 
recognised. Individual business forecasts are reviewed and 
approved by the Board. Further detail is included in Note 11.
Covenant compliance, going concern and viability
The Group has to demonstrate that it can continue 
to meet the covenants of its banking facility for a 
period of at least 12 months from the date of approval 
of the financial statements in order for the Board 
to conclude that the Group is a going concern.
The Board also has to make an assessment of the prospects 
of the Company over a longer period of three years and state 
whether they consider the Group to be viable over this period.
Budgets, forecasts and assumptions underlying the cash flow 
and covenant compliance model are approved by the Board 
and different scenarios are prepared by management for the 
Committee to consider.
The Committee reviewed the processes undertaken by 
management in preparing the viability assessment, including 
the potential impact of principal risks and mitigating actions. 
Management and the Board considered a number of 
scenarios and performed stress testing before concluding 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the three-year period of their assessment.
Further detail on the viability assessment process can be 
found on page 31.
Revenue recognition
Revenue reflects the fair value of the proportion 
of the work carried out in the year and therefore 
judgement exists over revenue cut off at year end. 
Management reports to the Committee on this matter, 
including details of any significant judgements made.
Highlighted items
Certain acquisition and transaction-related costs, 
restructuring costs, amortisation charges and the 
impairment of goodwill and software development 
costs have been classified as highlighted items, 
in line with the Group’s accounting policies. 
Particular consideration was given to the consistency 
of classification of highlighted items and whether their 
presentation can be considered fair, balanced and 
understandable. The Committee addressed this judgement 
by reviewing with management the definition of highlighted 
items as per the Group’s accounting policy and the items 
disclosed to satisfy themselves that they are in accordance 
with this policy. Refer to detailed disclosure in Note 5.
All of the above were key areas of audit focus and Ernst & 
Young LLP also provided detailed reports to the Committee 
on their procedures, findings and conclusions.
Having undertaken the review processes detailed above, the 
Audit Committee is satisfied with the underlying assumptions 
and judgements made in respect of these issues and supports 
the conclusions reached by management.
Risk management and internal control
The Audit Committee monitors controls which are in force and 
any perceived gaps in the control environment, and also 
considers and determines relevant action in respect of any 
control issues raised by the external and internal auditors. The 
findings of the Audit Committee are communicated to the Board. 
The main areas of activity for the Audit Committee during the 
year were:
• reviewing the Group’s risk matrices and challenging the 
classification and completeness of the risks identified;
• reviewing the Group’s risk register;
• conducting an evaluation of the controls which are in force 
to ensure the integrity of the information reported to 
shareholders;
• assessing the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management systems, including fraud and bribery risk and 
controls; and
• reviewing the Group’s IT and cyber security arrangements.
The Committee reviewed and challenged a number of reports 
prepared by management in conducting these activities.
Internal audit
The Group has an internal audit function that performs 
reviews as part of a programme approved by the Audit 
Committee. The Head of Internal Audit has a direct reporting 
line to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Committee 
considers any issues or risks arising from internal audit 
reviews and monitors the implementation of actions arising. 42 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED
The main activities of the Audit Committee during the 
year were:
• reviewing and approving the scope of internal audit 
activities for 2015; 
• monitoring the effectiveness of internal audit activities, 
including reviewing the results of all internal audit 
procedures undertaken during the year; and
• reviewing internal audit resourcing, with a focus on ensuring 
that the function has the right calibre of resource in place.
External audit
Ernst & Young LLP are the Group’s auditors and provide the 
Committee with relevant reports, reviews, information and 
advice throughout the year, as set out in their 
engagement letter.
The remit of the Audit Committee included:
• advising the Board on the reappointment of the external 
auditor and on their remuneration both for audit and 
non-audit work; 
• approving the nature and scope of the external audit with 
the external auditor;
• discussing the findings of the external audit with the external 
auditor and assessing the effectiveness of the audit; and
• reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditor, including the level of fees paid.
Evaluation and reappointment of auditors
The Committee is responsible for making a recommendation 
to the Board, relating to the appointment, reappointment and 
removal of the external auditors.
One of the key responsibilities of the Audit Committee is to 
assess the effectiveness of the external audit process. The 
Committee reviews the reports they receive from Ernst & 
Young LLP, including the audit plan and the results of the 
audit work performed. The Committee challenged, where 
necessary, the risks identified and the results of the work 
performed, and sought feedback from management on the 
effectiveness of the audit process.
The Audit Committee performed a review of the cost 
effectiveness, independence, objectivity and expertise of  
the external auditors and following this review recommended 
to the Board that Ernst & Young LLP be proposed for 
reappointment as the external auditors for 2015. 
Audit firm tendering
It is the Committee’s policy to ensure that there is audit partner 
rotation every five years to safeguard the external auditor’s 
objectivity and independence. A new senior statutory auditor 
took over the engagement during 2014. Ernst & Young LLP 
have been the incumbent auditors since 2000. The external 
audit was last put out to formal tender in 2009.
Auditor’s independence and objectivity and non-audit services
The Committee continually reviews the nature and extent of 
non-audit services provided to the Group by the external 
auditor and receives confirmation from them, at least 
annually, that in their professional judgement, they are 
independent with respect to the audit. The Audit Committee 
oversees the nature and amount of non-audit work 
undertaken by the external auditor each year to ensure that 
external auditor independence and objectivity is safeguarded. 
During the year, in order to ensure the continued 
independence and objectivity of the external auditor, the 
Audit Committee refreshed its policy governing the use of  
the external auditor for non-audit related services. The policy 
prohibits the external auditor from engaging in certain 
services that may give rise to actual or perceived audit 
independence issues. In addition, the Committee has to 
approve all services that are to be provided by the external 
auditor that exceed a prescribed monetary threshold.  
A copy of the policy is available on the Company’s website 
(www.huntsworth.com).
In 2015, non-audit services were provided for review and 
covenant compliance services. Details of the non-audit fees 
paid to the external auditors are set out on page 92. The 
provision of non-audit services, within the constraints of

Key responsibilities:
• identifying and recommending candidates to the Board to 
be appointed as Directors;
• making recommendations to the Board on the composition 
of the Board Committees; and
• considering succession planning for Directors and other 
senior executives, taking into account the challenges and 
opportunities facing the Group, and what skills and 
expertise are therefore needed on the Board in the future.
The Nomination Committee meets as necessary and ensures 
that for all senior and main Board appointments, including the 
composition of the Board Committees, due consideration of 
both external and internal candidates is given prior to making 
recommendations to the full Board. 
Appointments are made on merit alone, with due 
consideration of the benefits of diversity in its broadest  
sense, including gender. The Board currently has 25% female 
representation (two out of eight). The Board understands  
the benefits of boardroom diversity and its aspiration and 
expectation is to maintain the current proportion of women 
on the Board, while maintaining flexibility to ensure that all 
appointments are made on merit, regardless of gender.
The Nomination Committee was responsible for identifying 
and nominating candidates for the approval of the Board. In 
making its recommendations to the Board, the members of 
the Nomination Committee considered the balance of skills, 
knowledge, independence and experience of the Board and 
the members of the Committees. 
The Board engaged Korn Ferry to perform executive search 
services to support the appointment of Neil Jones. Korn Ferry 
does not have any conflicting connection with the Company. 
Neither an external search agency nor open advertising was 
used for the appointment of Pat Billingham, as she already 
had a strong reputation with a number of Board members. 
After meeting with all members of the Nomination 
Committee, Ms Billingham’s appointment was endorsed by 
the Nomination Committee prior to being recommended to 
the Board.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS ON REMUNERA TION
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee’s report on Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 
31 December 2015. 
During 2015 the Remuneration Committee initiated a review of the Group’s remuneration arrangements. Our aim was to 
ensure that the structure for paying our Executive Directors and senior management is simple, that it ensures alignment with 
the objectives of the business going forward and is fit for purpose in the competitive business and talent markets in which 
Huntsworth operates. As part of the review, we were also mindful of the latest developments in market practice and corporate 
governance standards and have sought to reflect these in the new structure of executive pay. We consulted our key shareholders 
on our proposed changes to the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors and senior management and have taken 
account of the feedback we received from them in coming to these final proposals.
New Remuneration Policy
Our current Remuneration Policy was approved by a majority of shareholders at the 2014 AGM and does not require 
re-approval until the 2017 AGM. However, following the recent review of the Group’s remuneration structure, we have decided 
to revise our Policy. Furthermore, our current shareholder approved share schemes will expire at the 2016 AGM and hence we 
have also reviewed the Group’s share plan arrangements. A new Remuneration Policy to apply for the three-year period to 
2019 and new Long-Term Incentive Plan (2016 LTIP) and a Deferred Share Bonus Plan (‘2016 DSBP’) will be put to shareholders 
for approval at the 2016 AGM. The key changes are as follows:
• Annual bonus deferral – Going forward an element of the annual bonus for Executive Directors will be deferred into shares. 
For 2016, the Committee intends to require Executive Directors to defer half of any bonus payment in excess of 1x salary 
into shares for a period of two years. 
• Long-term incentives – The current Huntsworth Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’) and Performance Share Plan 
(‘PSP’) will expire at the 2016 AGM. It is proposed that these schemes be replaced by a single long-term incentive plan, the 
2016 LTIP scheme. Under this new scheme annual awards of up to 200% of salary may be made although it is the intention 
that the usual award maximum will be 100% of salary, with 200% awards being in exceptional circumstances at the 
discretion of the Committee. It should be noted that the maximum potential award levels under the ESOS and PSP is 300% 
(100% under ESOS and 200% under PSP). 
• Malus and clawback – All incentive awards from 2016 onwards granted to Executive Directors under the annual bonus, 2016 
DSBP and 2016 LTIP will be subject to both malus and clawback arrangements, in line with the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
• Shareholding guidelines – Executive Directors will still be required to hold Huntsworth shares worth 100% of their salary. 
However, half of their vested share awards after tax must now be held in shares until this target is reached. Non-Executive 
Directors will not be required to hold Huntsworth shares, but will be encouraged to do so.
We have designed the new remuneration structure to incentivise the Executive Directors to deliver long-term value for 
shareholders. The Remuneration Committee is of the view that these proposals demonstrate Huntsworth’s ongoing 
commitment to strengthening the alignment between executive and shareholder interests, ensuring that the remuneration 
arrangements are appropriate for a Group of our size and complexity and that we adopt the highest standards of 
corporate governance. 
Senior management 
During 2015, the remit of the Remuneration Committee was further extended to certain other senior executives in the Group. 
The Committee reviewed the divisional bonus plans for 2015 and 2016 and the incentive packages for individual senior 
executives. The Committee’s aim is to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration for senior 
management and to ensure that we can use equity awards as a mechanism to retain and attract new talent and to align senior 
management’s interests with those of the shareholders. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to increase the number of 
below-board senior management participants in the LTIP this year. It is proposed that the senior management awards will be 
made under the 2016 LTIP scheme, subject to shareholder approval in 2016.
Remuneration advisors
During 2015, the Committee reviewed and retendered the appointment of its independent external advisors. After a thorough 
process, Deloitte LLP were appointed to advise the Committee.
2015 and 2016 performance targets
The Committee reviewed the performance targets for Paul Taaffe for 2015, which were all financial targets, and confirmed that 
none of the targets have been met and accordingly that no bonus will be payable. The Committee has also agreed the Annual 
bonus and LTIP targets for Paul Taaffe and Neil Jones for 2016. Annual Report and Accounts 2015 / Huntsworth plc 45

The remainder of this Report of the Directors on Remuneration is split into two parts:
• The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out payments and awards made to the Directors and details the link between the 
Company’s performance and remuneration for the 2015 financial year. The Annual Report on Remuneration together with 
this letter is subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2016 AGM.
• The Directors’ Remuneration Policy section details the Company’s new proposed remuneration policy for Directors, which 
will be put for approval at the 2016 AGM.
We are also putting forward resolutions to approve the 2016 LTIP and 2016 DSBP. I hope that you are able to support these 
four resolutions at our AGM.

1. Interests disclosed as at date of leaving the Board.
2. Paul Taaffe has 2,000,000 market priced options and 3,057,324 performance share units. All of Lord Chadlington’s invested options are nil cost options.
3. The share price of 39.5 pence (as at 31 December 2015) has been taken for the purpose of calculating the current shareholding as a percentage of 
salary/fees. Unvested share options do not count towards satisfaction of the shareholding guidelines. Vested share options and shares awarded under 
the deferred share bonus plan count towards the shareholding requirement.
4. Vested but unexercised options count towards the shareholding requirement based on the intrinsic gain in the option as at 31 December 2015. For 
vested market-priced options, the number of shares which count towards the shareholding guideline is calculated as the number of shares that could 
be purchased based on the intrinsic value of such options, i.e. the value of shares less the exercise price. Where the exercise price is above the value of 
the shares, no value is attributed to these options.
No options were exercised by Directors in the 2015 financial year.
The Committee reviewed the relevant holdings as at 31 December 2015 and noted that the guidelines were satisfied by all 
Directors as at this date, taking account of Directors’ beneficial ownership of shares in the Company and the date of their 
appointment as Directors. 
The holding disclosed in respect of Terence M. Graunke consists of the ordinary shares that he manages and controls on behalf 
of Lake Capital Partners LP. The holding disclosed in respect of Oscar Zhao includes the ordinary shares held by BlueFocus 
International Limited which is a connected person in relation to him.
There were no changes in the shareholdings of Directors in office as at 31 December 2015 between the year-end and the date 
of this report.

targets. Details of the bonus potentials are set out below:
% of targets achieved % of salary payable
<90% 0%
100% 75%
105% 100%
120% 150%
The Committee is of the opinion that, given commercial sensitivity, disclosing precise PBT and revenue targets for the annual 
bonus in advance would not be in the interests of shareholders or the Company. Actual targets, performance achieved and 
awards made will be published at the end of the performance period so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts.
Subject to shareholder approval of the new remuneration policy, both awards will be subject to malus and clawback provisions 
and will be subject to compulsory deferral of half of any bonus payment in excess of 100% of salary under the 2016 DSBP.
Long-term incentive plan targets
Awards will be made to Paul Taaffe under the new policy and 2016 LTIP and 2016 DSBP, subject to their approval by 
shareholders at the 2016 AGM. 
Awards will be made to Neil Jones in accordance with his Service Agreement as disclosed on page 51. 
All of the awards will vest based on the achievement of specific EPS and TSR targets and will be subject to malus and 
clawback provisions. Further information on the performance measures and targets attaching to these awards will be disclosed 
in next year’s Annual Report.

Advisors to the Remuneration Committee
During 2014, the Committee engaged the services of Slaughter & May and Deloitte LLP as independent Remuneration 
Committee advisors. 
Slaughter & May were engaged to provide advice on the proposed new remuneration policy and share schemes, and advice on 
executive remuneration. Fees payable to Slaughter & May for these services totalled £11,000.
Deloitte LLP were appointed as advisors to the Remuneration Committee in 2015 following a competitive tendering process 
and provided advice to the Committee on executive and long-term incentive remuneration, including the proposed new 
remuneration policy and share schemes. Deloitte LLP also provided certain other tax advisory services to the Group during the 
year. The nature of these services was not considered to conflict with their role as external adviser to the Committee. Total fees 
payable to Deloitte in 2015 were £46,250. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and, as such, 
voluntarily operates under the Group’s Code of Conduct when providing advice on executive remuneration in the UK.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS ON REMUNERA TION CONTINUED
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY 
Introduction
In this section of the Report of the Directors on Remuneration we provide details of the Company’s new Remuneration Policy 
for Directors that will govern the Company’s future remuneration payments. This new policy is being introduced in order to 
implement the changes described in the Chair of the Committee’s statement above.
Subject to approval by shareholders, the policy is intended to apply for three years and will be applicable from the date of the 
2016 AGM. This part of the Report of the Directors on Remuneration will be displayed on the Company’s website immediately 
after the 2016 AGM.
The Remuneration Committee has established the policy on the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Chairman, 
whereas the Board has established the policy on the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors.
The policy is designed around the following key principles:
• providing a strong link between reward and the performance of both the individual and the Company in order to align the 
interests of Executive Directors with those of shareholders;
• maintaining a competitive package against comparable businesses, both in terms of size and sector, with reference to the 
breadth of the role and experience the role holder brings to the Company;
• encouraging a personal stake in the business and a long-term focus on sustained growth through long-term shareholding;
• providing a balanced remuneration package; 
• ensuring compliance with the latest standards of best practice through application of malus and clawback provisions to all 
elements of variable pay; and 
• taking into account the associated risks of each aspect of remuneration.
Remuneration structure (Policy table)
Policy for Executive Directors
The table below sets out the key elements of the Company’s remuneration policy for the Executive Directors: 
Base salary
Objective and link to strategy To provide a market-competitive base salary which recognises individual contribution, 
changes in responsibilities and attracts and retains talent in the labour market in which 
the Executive Director is employed.
Operation Base salary is normally set annually with any changes effective from 1 January. When 
determining the salary of the Executive Directors the Committee takes into consideration:
• the level of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility 
and skills, in comparable organisations of broadly similar size and complexity;
• the individual Executive Director’s experience and responsibilities; 
• pay and conditions throughout the Group; and
• existing contractual arrangements.
Opportunity While the Committee has not set a monetary maximum on salary, any base salary 
increases will have due regard to those applied to the wider employee population of 
the Group. 
The 2016 annual salaries for the Executive Directors are set out in the Statement of 
Implementation of Remuneration Policy on page 52.

Annual bonus
Objective and link to strategy Aligns reward to strategy by ensuring the annual performance targets which are set for 
the financial year are aligned with the Company’s KPIs. As such, the annual bonus 
targets are primarily based on key objectives relating to the Group’s financial 
operational performance.
Operation The annual bonus is reviewed annually at the start of the financial year to ensure bonus 
opportunity, performance measures and weightings support the Company’s strategy. 
The performance period for the annual bonus targets is normally linked to the 
Company’s financial year. The Committee has discretion to defer annual bonus 
payments into share awards under The Huntsworth 2016 Deferred Share Bonus Plan 
(‘2016 DSBP’). The Committee’s intention for 2016 is for bonus awards to be paid in cash 
for any payment up to 100% of salary but for half of any bonus payment exceeding 
100% of salary to be deferred.
Where any element of the annual bonus is deferred, it will be deferred into a conditional 
award of, or nil cost options over, Huntsworth shares for a period of normally not less 
than two years. These shares will not be subject to any further performance conditions 
but are conditional on the individual’s continued employment with the Group, will 
remain subject to malus and clawback provisions, and will normally vest at the end of 
the deferral period. For further details on malus and clawback provisions, please refer to 
the section on malus and clawback on page 59.
Opportunity Maximum bonus potential level: 150% of salary. 
Threshold bonus potential: 0% of salary.
On-target bonus potential: 75% of salary.
Performance conditions and 
assessment
Each year the Committee determines the bonus measures and weightings.
Measures will predominantly be based on financial performance but up to 20% may be 
based on individual or other strategic objectives.
The precise nature and weighting of measures will depend on the strategic focus of the 
Company in any given year. 
Further details on the measures for 2016 are set out in the Statement of Implementation 
of Remuneration Policy on page 52.

The Huntsworth 2016 Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (‘2016 LTIP’)
Objective and link to strategy Rewards and retains executives, aligning them with shareholder interests over a longer 
time frame. 
Ensures an alignment between the operation of the Company’s remuneration policy and 
the Company’s objectives of achieving strong longer-term performance.
Operation The 2016 LTIP is being submitted for approval by shareholders at the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting. Participants will be eligible to receive a conditional allocation of shares 
or nil cost options subject to performance conditions set by the Committee. The 
Committee reviews the quantum of awards annually. 
Awards normally vest following the end of the performance period, although may vest 
early on leaving employment or on a change of control (see page 67). The Committee 
may choose to impose an additional holding period after the end of the relevant 
performance period. If they choose to do so for any given award, the terms of the 
holding period will be detailed at the time of the relevant award.
Awards under the 2016 LTIP will be subject to malus and clawback provisions. For 
further details, please refer to the section on malus and clawback on page 59.
Opportunity Maximum awards under the 2016 LTIP in respect of any one year of 200% of salary. 
Normal awards will be 100% of salary in respect of any one year.
Awards of 200% will be made in exceptional circumstances only, at the discretion of 
the Committee.
Threshold vesting level: 25% of salary.
Performance conditions and 
assessment
Performance will be measured over at least a three-year period.
Performance for awards will typically be based on share price based measures  
(such as TSR) and financial measures (such as EPS).
Further details on the measures for the coming financial year are set out in the 
Statement of Implementation of Remuneration Policy on page 52.
Pension
Objective and link to strategy To provide a competitive retirement benefit and ensure that Executive Directors’ total 
remuneration remains competitive. 
Operation Executive Directors may receive a contribution to their personal pension plan or receive 
a cash equivalent. Any cash equivalent would not be treated as salary for the purposes 
of determining bonus or incentive awards.
Opportunity The maximum opportunity under this policy is to make annual pension contributions of 
up to 20% of salary for Executive Directors.

Other benefits
Objective and link to strategy To provide competitive employment benefits and support individuals carry out  
their roles.
Operation The level of benefits provided is reviewed regularly to ensure they remain  
market competitive.
Benefits may include:
• car or car-related allowance or benefits;
• private health insurance for the Executive Director and his family;
• life insurance;
• permanent health insurance; and
• assistance with administrative burden of tax compliance arising from the 
directorship.
Additional benefits may be provided in line with local market practice. The Committee 
retains the discretion to provide further minor benefits or amendment to existing 
benefits where it is disproportionate to seek specific shareholder approval for these.
Where an Executive Director has to be relocated, the Company may provide 
compensation to reflect this cost of relocation in line with the policy as set out for new 
recruits on pages 63 to 64. The level of relocation benefit will be assessed on a case-by-
case basis. For further detail see pages 63 to 64.
Opportunity Although no changes are expected to the current benefits provided to the Executive 
Directors as disclosed above, benefit values will vary year-on-year depending on the 
cost of insurance or method of providing the benefits. Accordingly, no maximum 
monetary value of benefits has been set.

Payments from existing awards
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising 
any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set 
out above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before 29 June 2014 (the date the Company’s first shareholder-
approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy came into effect); (ii) before the policy set out above came into effect, provided that 
the terms of the payment were consistent with the shareholder-approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy in force at the time 
they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the 
Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. For these purposes 
‘payments’ includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the 
terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted. 58 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Legacy arrangements
The table below sets out the key elements of the Company’s legacy incentive schemes for the Executive Directors where 
awards under them are still outstanding. No further awards will be made under these plans after they expire on 3 July 2016.
2006 Executive Share Option 
Scheme (‘ESOS’)
Objective and link to strategy Designed to reward and retain executives, aligning them with shareholder interests over 
a longer time frame. This plan was not normally used for Executive Directors and was in 
practice used primarily for recruitment awards, where appropriate.
Operation The ESOS was approved by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting.
The ESOS allowed for the grant of market-priced or premium-priced options to 
participants, which normally became exercisable three years after grant, subject to the 
achievement of performance conditions, until the tenth anniversary of grant.
There was no operation of clawback (of unexercised or exercised awards) in respect of 
these awards. However, the ESOS award to be made to Neil Jones on joining the Group 
will be made subject to the malus and clawback provisions described on page 59.
Opportunity Maximum award opportunity of 100% of salary in respect of any financial year (200% of 
salary when the Committee determines exceptional circumstances exist).
No more than 25% of the shares under option vest for threshold performance.
Performance conditions and 
assessment
Service and performance measures must normally be met over a three-year 
performance period.
2006 Performance Share  
Plan (‘PSP’)
Objective and link to strategy Designed to reward and retain executives, aligning them with shareholder interests over 
a longer time frame.
Ensured an alignment between the operation of the Company’s remuneration policy 
and the Company’s objectives of achieving sustained EPS growth and superior 
shareholder returns.
Operation The PSP was approved by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting. 
Participants were eligible to receive a conditional allocation of shares or nil cost options 
which normally vested three years after grant.
There was no operation of clawback (of unexercised or exercised awards) in respect of 
these awards. However, the PSP award to be made to Neil Jones on joining the Group 
will be subject to the malus and clawback provisions described on page 59.
Opportunity Maximum PSP award in respect of any one year (excluding any awards made under 
another plan) of 200% of salary.
Threshold PSP vesting level: 25% of salary.
Performance conditions and 
assessment
Service and performance measures must normally be met over a three-year 
performance period.
Performance measures for awards comprised two or three of the following:
• Revenue
• EPS
• TSR

Notes to the Future Policy table for Executive Directors
Dividend equivalents
Awards under the 2016 LTIP and 2016 DSBP may incorporate the right to receive (in cash or shares) the value of dividends 
which would have been paid on the shares that vest between the date of grant and the date of vesting (or in the case of 
awards under the 2016 LTIP that are subject to a holding period, the date of release). When calculating the relevant dividend 
amounts, the Committee may assume that the dividends were reinvested in the Company’s shares on a cumulative basis.
Award adjustment
Awards granted under the Company’s share plans may, at the discretion of the Committee, be settled in cash. They may also 
be adjusted in any manner considered appropriate by the Committee in the event of a variation of the Company’s share capital 
or such other circumstances as the Committee considers appropriate.
Performance conditions applicable to 2016 LTIP, PSP and ESOS awards may be amended if an event or series of events occurs 
as a result of which the Committee considers it fair and reasonable to make the change to take account of legal changes or to 
get or keep favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for the award, provided that the amended conditions are 
not materially easier than the original conditions.
Malus and clawback
In respect of future awards granted under the annual bonus, 2016 DSBP and 2016 LTIP, in accordance with the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code and in line with best practice the Committee will apply certain recovery provisions to reduce the 
risk of payment for failure.
Malus and clawback provisions will exist whereby in the event of gross misconduct by the participant, a material misstatement 
of the Company’s published accounts between grant and release (in the case of awards under the 2016 LTIP) or in respect of 
the bonus year (for annual bonus and awards under the 2016 DSBP), or a material breach of a law or regulation which resulted 
in significant reputational damage or harm to the Company during the same period, the Committee may:
• in respect of a bonus, or an award under the 2016 DSBP or 2016 LTIP which has yet to be paid or to vest or to be exercised, 
in its absolute discretion, reduce or cancel the award;
• in respect of a bonus or an award under the 2016 DSBP or 2016 LTIP which has been paid or has vested, in its absolute 
discretion, claw back the award (either in part or in full). This provision may be invoked for up to two years following 
payment of a bonus, two years following the original vesting date of a deferred bonus, or two years following the original 
release date of an LTIP award.
In the event that the Committee decides that a clawback circumstance has arisen, the Committee may decide that, in its 
absolute discretion, rather than trying to claw back a paid bonus or vested share award, the Committee could instead make a 
reduction of an equivalent amount to (i) any unvested share awards the individual may have under any share scheme operated 
by Huntsworth; and/or (ii) any future bonus payment which would otherwise be payable; and/or (iii) any salary payments or 
other remuneration which are due or would otherwise have been payable.
Minor amendments and waiver
An Executive Director may at any time waive any element of remuneration. Minor and administrative amendments may be 
made to the policy where, in the opinion of the Committee, it would be disproportionate to seek prior shareholder approval, in 
which case full disclosure will be made in the subsequent Annual Report on Remuneration.
Comparison of Remuneration Policy for other employees and Executive Directors
All employees of Huntsworth are entitled to base salary and benefits at levels commensurate with their role and local  
market practice.
Certain employees are eligible to receive an annual bonus based on key performance indicators measured at Group, divisional 
or local business level, alongside performance against personal objectives. The maximum opportunity available is based on the 
seniority and responsibility of the role. 
Long-term incentive awards will be available to senior executives and selected employees throughout the organisation through 
the 2016 LTIP, subject to shareholder approval at the 2016 AGM.
Typically the more senior the employee, the greater the proportion of their pay is based on performance. Executive Directors 
receive remuneration packages which reflect their role and responsibilities and consequently they are amongst the highest 
paid in the Group. 60 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Policy for Non-Executive Directors
The table below sets out the Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors (‘NEDs’):
Fees
Objective and link to strategy To attract individuals of a suitable calibre for the Company and to pay fees which are 
reflective of responsibilities, competitive with peer companies.
Operation The Board as a whole is responsible for setting the remuneration of the Non-Executive 
Directors, other than the Chairman whose remuneration is determined by the 
Committee and recommended to the Board. 
NEDs are paid a base fee with one additional fee of the highest value for Committee 
representation. Fees may also be paid for additional time spent on the Company’s 
business outside of the normal duties. In some circumstances no fees will be paid. 
Fee levels reflect market conditions and are sufficient to attract individuals with 
appropriate knowledge and experience.
Fees are reviewed periodically. Any increases in fees will be determined based on 
workload and level of responsibility and current market rates. NEDs do not participate 
in any variable remuneration element.
Maximum potential value Current fees are set out in the Statement of Implementation of Remuneration Policy.  
Fee increases are determined by reference to individual responsibilities, inflation and  
an appropriate comparator group.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, the total aggregate fees 
which can be paid to the Chairman and other NEDs in any given financial year may not 
exceed £500,000. In the event that this limit set out in the Articles of Association is 
amended by way of ordinary resolution of the Company’s shareholders, this amended 
limit will supplant the current limit within this policy as well.

Benefits
Objective and link to strategy To facilitate the NED’s performance of his or her role.
Operation The Company pays travel and accommodation expenses in respect of attendance  
at Board meetings by NEDs, which may in some circumstances be taxed as benefits  
in kind.
Additionally, the Company may provide office facilities for NEDs which are not 
restricted to use in respect of the Company’s business.
Maximum potential value Expense benefit values, if any, will vary year-on-year depending on the frequency  
and location of meetings. The value of any other benefits is considered to be minimal. 
No maximum level of benefits has therefore been set.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS ON REMUNERA TION CONTINUED
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
Notes to the Future policy tables for all Directors
Shareholding policy
To ensure that Executive Directors’ interests are aligned with those of shareholders over a longer time horizon, all Executive 
Directors are expected to hold shares (including vested share awards where applicable) equivalent in value to a minimum of 
one times their salary. Executive Directors will be required to retain 50% of all after-tax vested share awards until their 
shareholding requirement is met.
Non-Executive Directors are not subject to a minimum shareholding requirement. However, they are encouraged to hold 
shares in the Company.
Changes to Remuneration Policy from previous policy
As discussed in the Chair’s letter, the following key changes from the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in 2014 
are reflected in the new policy:
• new long-term incentive plan (the 2016 LTIP) to replace former plans (PSP and ESOS) due to expire in 2016;
• introduction of bonus deferral arrangements;
• introduction of malus and clawback provisions to all incentive schemes; and
• changes to the Directors’ shareholding policy.
Shareholders will be asked to vote on this policy at the 2016 AGM. 
Service agreements
Huntsworth’s policy is to have Executive Directors’ service contracts of no fixed term and with notice periods of no more than 
one year and for those contracts to contain contractual termination payments in certain circumstances as set out in the table 
below. The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment which provide for an initial period of three years following 
their first re-election at the Company’s Annual General Meeting. Subject to re-election at Annual General Meetings, Non-
Executive Directors would be expected to serve for a second three-year term. Non-Executive Directors may be requested to 
serve for a further (third) three-year term subject to rigorous review at the relevant time, and their agreement.
The following table sets out the dates of each Director’s service agreements and their unexpired term:
Executive Date of contract Unexpired term

Neil Jones 15 October 2015 1 year

Recruitment arrangements
The table below summarises the Company’s key policies with respect to recruitment remuneration:
Remuneration 
element Policy
General The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract 
appropriate candidates to the role. 
Our principle is that the pay of any new Director would be assessed on the basis of the same policy 
principles as for the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors, unless specific circumstances 
arise where the Committee deems it appropriate, to secure a desired candidate. The terms of any 
appointment should also be accompanied by a clear business case.
The Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure the 
preferred candidate and is cognisant of guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or 
enhanced short or long-term incentive payments made on recruitment and the appropriateness of any 
performance conditions associated with an award.
Notice periods The policy of the Company is to have service contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of 
one year. It is sometimes necessary when recruiting a new Executive Director to give a service contract 
with an initial term of longer than one year. In such circumstances it is the policy of the Company that 
the notice period should reduce to one year after the initial period of service.
Base salary or  
fee and benefits
The salary or fee level will be set taking into account the responsibilities and experience of the individual 
and the salaries paid to similar roles in comparable companies in line with the current process 
undertaken by the Committee when reviewing the salary/fee levels for its existing Directors.
When an Executive Director is recruited on a below-market standard salary, larger than normal increases 
may be offered to transition him to a market standard salary in line with his experience in the role.
The Director shall be eligible to receive benefits in line with Huntsworth’s benefits policy as set out in the 
remuneration policy table above.
Pension The Executive Director will be able to receive a pension contribution in line with the Company’s pension 
policy as set out in the remuneration policy table. 
Annual bonus and 
long-term incentives
The Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus arrangements and long-term 
incentive plans as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Therefore, the maximum level of variable remuneration (excluding share buy-outs/replacement awards 
described below) which can be awarded to a new Executive Director (in line with the policy set out 
above) in respect of his recruitment is 350% of salary.
Share buy-outs/ 
replacement  
awards
Awards may be granted to replace those forfeited by the Executive Director on taking up the 
appointment where considered by the Committee to be appropriate. Such awards may be made in 
addition to any annual bonus and long-term incentive awards described above.
Such awards will normally be made in the form of an award under the 2016 LTIP. Executive Directors 
may receive one exceptional award under the 2016 LTIP, which may not be subject to performance 
conditions, where the terms of his recruitment provide for him to be granted any award in order to 
compensate (wholly or partly) for incentives lost at his previous employer. The maximum level of 
buy-out award that may be granted under the plan rules is not restricted.
The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards such that overall they are no more 
generous in terms of quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited. In determining 
quantum and structure of these commitments, the Committee will seek to replicate the fair value and,  
as far as practicable, the timing and performance requirements of remuneration foregone.
The Committee would seek to structure buy-out and variable pay awards on recruitment to be in line 
with the Company’s remuneration framework so far as practical, but, if necessary, the Committee may 
also grant such awards outside of the framework as permitted under Listing Rule 9.4.2 subject to the 
limits on variable pay set out above. The exact terms of any such awards (e.g. the form of the awards, 
time frame, performance conditions, and leaver provisions) would vary depending on the specific 
commercial circumstances. 64 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS ON REMUNERA TION CONTINUED
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
Recruitment arrangements continued
Remuneration 
element Policy
Relocation policies In instances where the Executive Director is non-UK based or needs to be relocated, the Company may 
provide one-off or ongoing compensation as part of the Director’s relocation benefits to reflect the cost 
of relocation for the Executive Director in cases where they are expected to spend significant time away 
from their normal home country.
The level of the relocation package will be assessed on a case-by-case basis but will take into 
consideration any cost of living differences, housing allowance, schooling and may include support with 
tax and other administrative obligations relating to the move.
Internal 
appointments
Where an internal candidate is appointed to the Board, the individual’s existing contractual or award 
terms and conditions will continue to apply to any elements of remuneration (e.g. long-term incentive 
awards) made prior to his or her appointment. These will be disclosed to shareholders in the following 
year’s Report of the Directors on Remuneration. 
Payment for loss of office
When determining any loss of office payment for a departing individual, the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the 
Company whilst seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time. The Committee retains overriding discretion to make 
loss of office payments appropriate to the circumstances and applying the overriding principle that there should be no element 
of reward for failure.
Remuneration 
element Approach Committee discretion
General The Company’s policy on termination payments is to 
consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, 
taking into account the relevant contractual terms, the 
circumstances of the termination and any applicable 
duty to mitigate. It is the Committee’s policy not to 
reward poor performance. The Committee will always 
seek to minimise cost to the Company whilst seeking to 
reflect the circumstances in place at the time. 
Subject to existing contractual commitments, 
the Committee retains overriding discretion to 
make loss of office payments appropriate to the 
circumstances and applying the overriding 
principle that there should be no element of 
reward for failure.
Base salary and 
benefits
Salary will be paid over the notice period. Benefits will 
normally be provided over the notice period. 
Non-Executive Directors’ fees will be paid over the 
notice period. There is no entitlement to a payment in 
lieu of notice.
The Committee has discretion to make a payment 
in lieu of notice of up to 12 months’ salary, benefits 
allowance, pension contribution or salary 
supplement in lieu of pension and accrued but 
untaken holiday. This may be made in the form of 
a lump sum payment or in instalments. Subject to 
contractual provisions, the Company will seek to 
mitigate any payments due.
The Company may provide benefits related to the 
termination such as outplacement advice, or tax 
and legal advice. It may additionally pay amounts 
which, based on legal advice, are required or 
recommended to be paid in settlement of any 
actual or potential lost legal rights.
Pension No additional payments will be made in respect of 
pension contributions for loss of office.
Company pension contribution/salary supplements in 
lieu of pension contributions will normally be provided 
over the notice period. In all cases the Company will 
seek to mitigate any payments due.
The Committee has discretion to make lump 
sum payments in lieu of pension contributions 
payable over the notice period. Annual Report and Accounts 2015 / Huntsworth plc 65

Remuneration 
element Approach Committee discretion
Annual bonus Where an Executive Director’s employment is 
terminated after the end of a performance year but 
before the payment is made, the Executive Director 
may be eligible for an annual bonus award for that 
performance year subject to an assessment based on 
performance achieved over the period. No award will 
be made in the event of gross misconduct.
Where an Executive Director’s employment is 
terminated during a performance year, and if the 
individual is a good leaver, a pro-rata annual bonus 
payment for the period worked in that performance 
year may be payable subject to an assessment based 
on performance achieved over the period.
Unvested awards under the 2016 DSBP
Where an Executive Director’s employment is 
terminated when he holds Deferred Share bonus 
awards under the 2016 DSBP, and he is determined to 
be a good leaver for any reason other than due to his 
death, the awards will normally vest in accordance with 
the original terms of deferral. Where the Executive 
Director’s employment terminates by reason of death, 
or in such other circumstances as the Committee may 
determine, any shares so deferred will vest immediately.
Where an Executive Director’s employment terminates 
and he is determined by the Committee not to be a 
good leaver, his awards under the 2016 DSBP will  
lapse in full.
Leaver status
Good leavers are those leaving under the following 
specified conditions:
• death;
• ill-health, injury or disability;
• redundancy, sale of the employing Company, or the 
sale of the business for which he or she works, 
outside of the Group; or 
• any reason, at the absolute discretion of  
the Committee.
All other leavers are bad leavers.
The Committee has discretion to determine 
whether an Executive Director is a good leaver for 
the purposes of the annual bonus arrangements.
It is not the Committee’s intention to exercise 
this discretion unless there is a strong business 
case to do so. Where discretion is exercised,  
the Committee will provide a full explanation  
of the basis of the exercise of its discretion  
to shareholders.
The Committee may at its discretion determine 
that any non-contractual amounts in respect of 
the current year are instead paid after the end 
of the relevant year once performance for the 
year can be assessed.
Long-term 
incentive
The treatment of unvested long-term incentive awards is governed by the rules of the LTIP, to be approved 
by shareholders at the 2016 AGM. Individuals are defined as either a good or bad leaver for the purposes of 
unvested incentive awards. 
Good leavers are those leaving under the following specified conditions:
• death;
• ill-health, injury or disability;
• retirement (in the case of only the legacy PSP or ESOS awards);
• redundancy;
• sale of the individual’s employing company, or business outside of the Group; or 
• any other reason, with the approval of the Committee.
All other leavers are bad leavers. 66 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS ON REMUNERA TION CONTINUED
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
If an individual is a bad leaver then share awards will lapse in full. The following table sets out for good leavers examples of the 
potential application of the Committee’s policy in certain circumstances:
Reason for leaving Timing of vesting Calculation of Committee discretion
Resignation Awards lapse. N/A
Injury, ill-health, 
disability, redundancy, 
retirement (in the 
case of the PSP and 
ESOS only), sale of 
business or employing 
company, or other 
reason at the 
discretion of the 
Committee. 
Vesting under the 2016 LTIP
Awards will vest based on the 
performance achieved either up to the 
date of cessation or to the end of the 
performance period and pro-rated to 
reflect the proportion of the 
performance period served unless the 
Committee determines otherwise. 
Awards will normally vest at the usual 
time, unless the Committee determines 
that awards should vest following the 
individual’s departure.
Vesting under the PSP
Awards will normally vest based on the 
performance achieved up to the date of 
cessation and pro-rated to reflect the 
amount of time elapsed since the award 
date, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise in exceptional circumstances. 
PSP awards must be exercised within 12 
months of the termination date.
Vesting under the ESOS
Awards will normally vest based on the 
performance achieved up to the end of 
the performance period and pro-rated to 
reflect the amount of time elapsed since 
the award date.
ESOS awards must be exercised within 12 
months of the vesting date or later 
termination date.
Designation as good leaver
Where the specified good leaver circumstances do not 
apply and there is no contractual obligation to do so 
(see below), the Committee has discretion to determine 
whether an Executive Director is a good leaver for the 
purposes of the 2016 LTIP, PSP or ESOS. It is not the 
Committee’s intention to exercise this discretion unless 
there is a strong business case. Where discretion is 
exercised the Committee will provide a full explanation of 
the basis of the exercise of its discretion to shareholders.
Vesting under the 2016 LTIP
The Committee retains discretion to disregard time 
pro-rating when determining the level of vesting. This 
would only be considered in exceptional circumstances.
Vesting under the PSP
The Committee retains discretion to disregard 
performance and time pro-rating when determining the 
level of vesting. This would only be considered in 
exceptional circumstances.
Vesting under the ESOS
In respect of a vested ESOS award, an individual who is a 
discretionary good leaver may, at the discretion of the 
Committee, exercise the award, such discretion being 
exercised within 30 days of cessation.
In respect of an unvested ESOS award, a specific or 
discretionary good leaver may, at the discretion of the 
Committee, exercise the award after the end of the 
performance period based on the performance achieved, 
pro-rated to reflect the time in the performance period 
elapsed at the date of cessation (provided, in the case of 
retirement, that the ESOS award was made more than 12 
months prior to cessation – otherwise it will lapse). There 
is no discretion to ignore time pro-rating.
Death Immediately (with time pro-rating 
applying to unvested ESOS options).
Under the 2016 LTIP, the Committee may 
choose to apply the good leaver rules 
described above, or to deem any 
performance targets to be met in full at 
the date of death and/or to disapply any 
time pro-rating.
Under the ESOS, any performance 
targets will be deemed to have been met 
in full at the date of death.
Under the PSP, awards will be time 
pro-rated unless the Committee 
determines otherwise in exceptional 
circumstances. Performance conditions 
will be deemed to be satisfied.
The Committee retains discretion to disregard time 
pro-rating when determining the level of vesting under 
the PSP.

Other  
Information
Vested awards held by the Executive Directors which are 
outstanding under the ESOS and PSP will be exercised in 
accordance with the terms of the relevant plan rules under 
which the maximum post-termination exercise period is 12 
months from the date of vesting of the relevant award (or 
cessation of employment, if later).
Change of control
Annual bonus
On a change of control of the Company, the Executive 
Directors will be entitled to receive a bonus payment based 
on performance level achieved during the performance 
period up to the change of control and the proportion of the 
performance period that has elapsed at the relevant date.
Where an Executive Director holds any awards under the 
2016 DSBP, these will usually vest immediately on a change of 
control. However, the Committee retains absolute discretion 
to require deferred share awards to be rolled over into 
equivalent awards in the new entity.
Long-term incentive plans
In accordance with the rules of the 2016 LTIP, PSP and ESOS, 
vesting will occur immediately on a change of control or 
winding up of the Company. Performance against targets will 
be assessed by the Committee on a change of control. The 
number of shares vesting under an award will, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise, be reduced pro rata to 
reflect the amount of time elapsed at the time of the change  
of control as a proportion of the original performance period 
(or vesting period, where no performance condition applies). 
The Committee retains discretion to disregard performance 
and/or time when determining the level of vesting having 
regard to, amongst other things, the underlying performance of 
the Company. Whether, and the extent to which, any discretion 
is applied will depend on the circumstances of the change of 
control. Alternatively, the Committee may choose to convert 
awards into equivalent awards in the acquiring company.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the 
Company in developing policy
The Company’s approach to salary reviews is consistent 
across the Group, with consideration given to the level of 
responsibility, experience, individual performance, salary 
levels in comparable companies and the Company’s ability  
to pay. Remuneration surveys and meetings with sector 
specialists are used, where appropriate, to establish  
market rates.
In setting the remuneration policy for Directors, the pay and 
conditions of other employees of Huntsworth are taken into 
account, including any base salary increases awarded.
The Company did not consult with employees when drawing 
up the policy report.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee takes the views of shareholders very 
seriously. The views of major shareholders are considered 
when evaluating and setting ongoing remuneration strategy 
and the Committee commits to consulting with major 
shareholders prior to any significant changes to its 
remuneration policy.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
The Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 
2015 comprises the Corporate Governance Report on 
pages 36 to 43 together with any sections of the Annual 
Report incorporated by reference. As permitted by 
legislation, some of the matters normally included in the 
Directors’ Report have been included in the Strategic 
Report pages 1 to 31. These specifically include:
• An indication of likely future developments in the business 
of the Company, on page 9.
• Details of the Group’s financial risk management strategy, 
policies and instruments held are set out in Note 18 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
• Details of the Group’s branches are set out in the appendix 
to the consolidated financial statements.
• Details of the Group’s going concern assessment. 
• Employee matters and carbon emission disclosures are set 
out in the Responsible Business Report on pages 22 to 25.
Dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 1.25 pence per 
share for the year ended 31 December 2015. An interim 
dividend of 0.5 pence per share was paid on 6 November 
2015, making a total of ordinary dividends of 1.75 pence per 
share for the year (2014: 1.75 pence per share). The record 
date for the final dividend will be 27 May 2016 and it is payable 
on 7 July 2016. A scrip dividend alternative will be available.
From April 2016 dividend tax credits will be replaced by 
an annual £5,000 tax-free allowance on dividend income 
across an individual’s entire share portfolio. Above this 
amount, individuals will pay tax on their dividend income 
at a rate dependent on their income tax bracket and 
personal circumstances. The Company will continue 
to provide registered shareholders with a confirmation 
of the dividends paid by the Company and this should 
be included with any other dividend income received 
when calculating and reporting total dividend income 
received. It is the shareholder’s responsibility to include 
all dividend income when calculating any tax liability. 
This change was announced by the Chancellor, as part 
of the UK government Budget, in July 2015. If you have 
any tax queries, please contact a financial advisor.

Directors’ indemnities
As at the date of this report, indemnities are in force under 
which the Company has agreed to indemnify the Directors, to 
the extent permitted by law and the Company’s Articles of 
Association, in respect of all losses arising out of, or in 
connection with, the execution of their powers, duties and 
responsibilities, as Directors of the Company or any of 
its subsidiaries.
Shares
As at 31 December 2015, the Company’s issued share capital 
comprised 328,498,733 ordinary shares of 1p each, of which 
1,686,681 ordinary shares were held in treasury, and 
212,012,343 deferred shares of 49p each.
Changes in the Company’s share capital during the year are 
given in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Details of the Company’s employee share schemes are set out 
in the remuneration report.
Purchase of own shares
At the Annual General Meeting in 2015 the Directors were 
granted the authority to purchase up to 10% of the 
Company’s ordinary shares (either for cancellation or for 
placing into treasury) to support the Group’s capital 
management policies. Further details of the Group’s capital 
management policies are included in Note 18 to the 
consolidated financial statements. The authority granted 
amounted to 32,504,294 ordinary shares. The Company may 
either retain shares purchased under this authority as 
treasury shares with a possible view to reissue such shares at 
a future date, or cancel them. This authority expires after the 
AGM on 26 May 2016. No ordinary shares were purchased 
during the year or up to the date of this report.
During the year ended 31 December 2015, 585,707 shares 
were transferred out of treasury to satisfy obligations under 
employee share plans. The total number of shares held in 
treasury as at 31 December 2015 and at the date of this report 
was 1,686,681 ordinary shares. 
Employment policies
The Group operates internationally and therefore has 
developed employment policies that meet local conditions 
and requirements. Further details of these policies, including 
policies in relation to diversity and applications for 
employment made by disabled persons and provisions for 
disabled employees and employee involvement, can be found 
in the Responsible Business Report on pages 22 to 25.
Political donations
The Companies Act 2006 (‘the Companies Act’) and the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008 (‘the Regulations’) require 
disclosure of any political donation made to, or political 
expenditure incurred in relation to, any political party or other 
political organisation or any independent election candidate if 
such donation(s) or expenditure incurred in a year exceeds 
£2,000. Political parties, political organisations, political 
donation and political expenditure are all defined in the 
Companies Act.
As part of their normal work on behalf of clients and as part 
of their own marketing, certain companies in the Group need 
to attend or sponsor events which are organised by political 
parties or other political organisations, for which a charge is 
made. These companies also from time to time invite clients 
and prospective clients to attend events that fall within the 
meaning of the Companies Act’s provisions. The Companies 
Act defines ‘donations’ and ‘expenditure’ very broadly such 
that this sort of activity falls within its ambit. It similarly 
defines ‘political organisation’ widely such that it includes, for 
example, bodies concerned with policy review and law 
reform, with representation of the business community or 
with the representation of their communities or special 
interest groups, which the companies may wish to support. 70 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Political donations continued
During the year, Group companies made the following 
payments that might be deemed to fall within the definition of 
‘political donation’ or ‘political expenditure’ in the 
Companies Act: 
Political expenditure amounting to £13,000 was paid 
attending conferences and to cover function expenses, the 
majority of which was paid by the relevant client. This was 
made up of £5,800 paid to the Conservative Party, £2,000 to 
the Labour Party, £1,000 to the Liberal Democrats Party, 
£4,000 to the Scottish National Party and £200 to 
Plaid Cymru. 
Additional information for shareholders 
The following information, which summarises certain 
provisions of the current Articles of Association of the 
Company and applicable English law concerning companies 
(including the Companies Act), is required to be provided to 
shareholders as a result of the implementation of the 
European Directive on Takeover Bids (2004/25/EC) into 
English law. This is a summary only and the relevant 
provisions of the Articles and the Companies Act should be 
consulted if further information is required.
Rights and obligations attaching to ordinary shares
Subject to applicable law and to any existing shareholders’ 
rights, shares may be issued with or have attached to them 
such rights and restrictions as the Company may by ordinary 
resolution decide or, if no such resolution has been passed or 
so far as the resolution does not make specific provision, as 
the Board (as defined in the Articles) may decide. Subject to 
the Articles, the Companies Act and to any resolution passed 
by the Company and without prejudice to any rights attached 
to existing shares, the Board may offer, allot, grant options 
over or otherwise deal with or dispose of shares in the 
Company to such persons, at such times and for such 
consideration and upon such terms as the Board may decide. 
As part of the subscription agreement the Company entered 
into with BlueFocus and BlueFocus’s subsidiary BlueFocus 
International Limited (‘BlueFocus International’) (the 
‘Subscription Agreement’), BlueFocus International has the 
following rights to subscribe for ordinary shares in the capital 
of the Company:
a) to participate in any proposed issue of Company shares for 
cash consideration such that the level of shareholding 
BlueFocus International obtained at completion of the 
Subscription Agreement will not be diluted by the 
proposed issue; and
b) a right to subscribe for additional shares representing up 
to 5% of the Company’s fully diluted share capital (as at 
completion of the Subscription Agreement) where the 
Company decides to issue shares for non-cash 
consideration (other than in relation to any employee 
share scheme).
The right granted in b) above expires on 7 October 2016 and is 
limited to the number of shares such that the level of the 
shareholding BlueFocus International obtained at completion of 
the Subscription Agreement is not diluted. The price to be paid 
pursuant to this right is based on the prevailing market price at 
the time the right is exercised. This right will lapse upon any 
offer to purchase the entire issued and to be issued share capital 
of the Company becoming unconditional in all respects.
Additionally under the terms of the Subscription Agreement, 
BlueFocus International is granted the right to nominate one 
Non-Executive Director to be appointed or reappointed to the 
Board of the Company. BlueFocus International’s right to appoint 
or reappoint a Director to the Board lapses if it ceases to hold at 
least 47,250,000 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company.
Voting rights
Upon a show of hands, every member who is present in person 
at a general meeting of the Company and entitled to vote shall 
have one vote. On a poll every member who is present in 
person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share held. In 
the case of joint holders of a share the vote of the senior who 
tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be 
accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders 
and seniority shall be determined by the order in which the 
names stand in the register in respect of the joint holding. 
The notice of any general meeting of the Company shall 
specify the deadlines in relation to exercising voting rights with 
respect to each resolution to be proposed at such meeting. 
Votes are exercisable at the general meeting of the Company 
in respect of which the business being voted upon is being 
heard. Votes may be exercised in person or by proxy. The 
Articles provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms of 
not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding 
the meeting, except in the case of a poll taken subsequently to 
the date of the meeting or adjourned meeting, for which proxy 
forms must be received not less than 24 hours before the time 
appointed for the taking of the poll. 
No member shall be entitled in respect of any share held by 
him to attend or vote (either personally or by proxy) at any 
general meeting or class meeting of the Company or upon a 
poll or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in 
relation to general meetings or polls unless all calls or other 
sums presently payable by him in respect of that share have 
been paid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if 
he has been served with a restriction notice (as defined in the 
Articles) after the failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning interests in those shares required to 
be provided under the Companies Act. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the exercise of 
voting rights.
Dividends and other payments
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company 
may by ordinary resolution from time-to-time declare 
dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the 
members, but no dividend shall exceed the amount 
recommended by the Board. The Board may pay such interim 
dividends as appear to the Board to be justified by the 
financial position of the Company and may also pay any 
dividend payable at a fixed rate at intervals settled by the 
Board whenever the financial position of the Company, in the 
opinion of the Board, justifies its payment. If the Board acts in 
good faith, it shall not incur any liability to the holders of any 
shares for any loss they may suffer in consequence of the 
payment of an interim or fixed dividend on any other class of 
shares ranking pari passu with or after those shares. Strategic

Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Act, all or any of the rights 
attached to any existing class of shares may from time to time 
be varied either with the consent in writing of the holders of 
not less than 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that 
class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury 
shares) or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a 
separate general meeting of the holders of those shares. 
Restrictions on transfer of shares
The Board may permit title to shares of any class to be held in 
uncertificated form and, subject to the Articles, title to 
uncertificated shares may be transferred by means of a 
relevant system. Provisions of the Articles do not apply to any 
uncertificated shares to the extent that such provisions are 
inconsistent with the holding of shares in uncertificated form 
or with the transfer of the shares by means of a relevant 
system. Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share 
may be refused in the circumstances set out in the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations (as defined in the 
Articles) and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, 
the number of joint holders to whom the uncertificated share 
is to be transferred exceeds four.
Subject to the Articles, any member may transfer all or any of 
his certificated shares by an instrument of transfer in any 
usual form or in any other form which the Board may approve. 
The instrument of transfer of a certificated share shall be 
executed by or on behalf of the transferor and (in the case of 
a partly paid share) the transferee. The transferor of a share 
shall be deemed to remain the holder of the share concerned 
until the name of the transferee is entered in the register in 
respect of it. The Board may, in its absolute discretion and 
without giving any reason for so doing, decline to register any 
transfer of any share which is not a fully paid share. The Board 
may also decline to register any transfer of a certificated 
share unless:
(i) the instrument of transfer is duly stamped or duly certified 
or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be 
exempt from stamp duty and accompanied by the 
relevant share certificate and such other evidence of the 
right to transfer as the Board may reasonably require; 
(ii) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of 
share; and 
(iii) in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of 
joint holders to whom the share is to be transferred does 
not exceed four.
Other restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company 
may from time to time be imposed:
(i) by applicable laws and regulations (for example, insider 
trading laws and market requirements relating to close 
periods);
(ii) pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority whereby certain employees of the Company 
require the approval of the Company to deal in the 
Company’s securities; and
(iii) in relation to shares issued pursuant to acquisitions made 
by the Company. 
As at 31 December 2015 there were no shares of the Company 
subject to lock-in restrictions. The Company is not aware of 
any agreements between shareholders that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of shares. 
Rights and obligations attaching to the deferred shares
The holders of deferred shares are not entitled to receive 
dividends when declared nor the Company’s report and 
accounts. The holders of deferred shares have no right as 
such to receive notice of or to attend or vote at any general 
meeting of the Company unless a resolution to wind up the 
Company or to vary or abrogate the rights attaching to the 
deferred shares is proposed. 
The deferred shares are also subject to the following terms: 
(a) the deferred shares may not be transferred without the 
prior written consent of the Directors of the Company; 
(b) holders of deferred shares are not entitled to receive any 
share certificate in respect of their holdings; 
(c) any cancellation of the deferred shares for no consideration 
by way of reduction of capital shall not involve a variation 
or abrogation of the rights attaching thereto; 
(d) the Company has irrevocable authority at any time to 
appoint any person to execute on behalf of the holders of 
the deferred shares a transfer thereof and/or an 
agreement to transfer the same, in either case, to Numis 
Securities Limited or such other person as the Company 
may determine and to execute any other documents 
which such person may consider necessary or desirable to 
effect such transfer, in each case without obtaining the 
sanction of the holder(s) and without any payment being 
made in respect of such acquisition; and
(e) the entitlement of a holder of a deferred share on a return 
of assets on a winding up of the Company is limited to the 
repayment of the amount paid up or credited as paid up 
on such share up to a maximum of 49p per share and shall 
be paid only after the holders of any and all ordinary 
shares then in issue shall have received payment in 
respect of such amount as is paid up or credited as paid 
up on those ordinary shares held by them at that time plus 
the payment in cash or specie of £10,000,000 for every 
1p paid up or credited as paid up on those ordinary shares.
The rights attached to the deferred shares shall not be 
deemed to be varied or abrogated by the creation or issue of 
any new shares ranking in priority to or pari passu with or 
subsequent to such shares or by any amendment or variation 
to the rights of any other class of shares of the Company.
Significant direct or indirect holdings of securities and 
special rights

Employee share trust
The Huntsworth Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) holds 
approximately 2.0% of the issued share capital of the 
Company on trust for the benefit of employees of the 
Huntsworth Group and their dependants. The voting rights  
in relation to these shares are exercised by the Trustees.  
The Trustees of the EBT may vote or abstain from voting on 
shares held in the EBT in any way they think fit and in doing 
so may take into account both financial and non-financial 
interests of the beneficiaries of the EBT or their dependants. 
The EBT waived its rights to both the 2014 final dividend  
and the 2015 interim dividend.
Appointment and replacement of Directors 
Unless otherwise determined by ordinary resolution of the 
Company, the Directors (disregarding alternate Directors) 
shall be not less than two nor more than 12 in number. 
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary 
resolution or by the Board. Any Director appointed by the 
Board shall retire at the next Annual General Meeting of the 
Company and shall then be eligible for election, but shall not 
be taken into account in determining the Directors or the 
number of Directors who are to retire by rotation at 
that meeting.
At Annual General Meetings of the Company, certain 
Directors shall retire by rotation in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. The Directors to retire by 
rotation shall be: 
(i) those who held office at the time of the two preceding 
Annual General Meetings and who did not retire at either 
of them;
(ii) those who have held office for a continuous period of nine 
years or more; and 
(iii) those who have been appointed by the Board since the 
last Annual General Meeting. 
The Company may by special resolution remove any Director 
before the expiration of his term of office. The office of 
Director shall be vacated if: 
(i) he resigns or offers to resign and the Board resolves to 
accept such offer; 
(ii) his resignation is requested by all of the other Directors 
and all of the other Directors are not less than three in 
number; 
(iii) he is or has been suffering from mental ill health; 
(iv) he is absent without permission of the Board from 
meetings of the Board for six consecutive months and 
the Board resolves that his office is vacated; 
(v) he becomes bankrupt or compounds with his creditors 
generally;

Amendment to the Articles
Any amendments to the Articles may be made in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act by way of a 
special resolution.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Articles 
and to any directions given by the Company in general 
meeting by special resolution, the business of the Company 
shall be managed by the Board which may exercise all the 
powers of the Company whether relating to the management 
of the business of the Company or not. In particular, the 
Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow 
money and to mortgage or charge all or any part of the 
undertaking, property and assets (present and future) and 
uncalled capital of the Company, to issue debentures and 
other securities and to give security, whether outright or as 
collateral security, for any debt, liability or obligation of the 
Company or of any third party.
Repurchase of shares 
Subject to authorisation by shareholder resolution, the 
Company may purchase its own shares in accordance with 
the Companies Act. Any shares which have been bought back 
may be held as treasury shares or, if not so held, must be 
cancelled immediately upon completion of the purchase, 
thereby reducing the amount of the Company’s issued share 
capital. The Company has the power to buy back up to 
32,504,294 ordinary shares during the period up to the next 
Annual General Meeting. The minimum price which must be 
paid for such shares is 1 pence and the maximum price 
payable is the higher of (i) 5% above the average of the 
middle market quotations for ordinary shares (as derived 
from the London Stock Exchange Daily List) for the five 
business days immediately preceding the date of purchase 
and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade 
and the highest current independent bid on the London Stock 
Exchange Official List at the time the purchase is carried out.
Significant agreements
The following significant agreement contains provisions 
entitling the counterparties to exercise termination or other 
rights in the event of a change of control of the Company: 
• Under the £65 million credit facility agreement dated 
23 May 2014 between, amongst others, the Company, 
Lloyds Bank plc (as facility agent) and the banks named 
therein as lenders and the £5 million committed overdraft 
facility dated 23 May 2014 between, amongst others, the 
Company and Lloyds Bank plc, upon a change of control, 
the agent may, if the lenders so require, cancel the facilities 
by giving not less than 30 business days’ notice and 
declare all outstanding amounts under the facilities, 
together with accrued interest, immediately due 
and payable.

specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• state that the Group has complied with IFRS subject to  
any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and to enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm on behalf of the Board that to the best of  
our knowledge:

Overview of our audit approach
Risks of material misstatement • Recoverability of carrying value of goodwill and intangibles
• Incorrect revenue recognition, particularly relating to cut-off
• Presentation and disclosure of highlighted items
Audit scope • We performed an audit of the complete financial information of six components and 
audit procedures on specific balances for a further 11 components
• The components where we performed full or specific scope audit procedures 
accounted for 133% of the Group’s profit before tax adjusted for the non-recurring 
highlighted items, 75% of revenue and 75% of total assets
• We additionally performed review scope procedures on components which accounted 
for 11% of the Group’s revenue
Materiality • Overall Group materiality of £0.63 million represents 5% of profit before tax adjusted 
for the non-recurring highlighted items, which are detailed in ‘Our assessment of 
materiality’ section Strategic

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, 
we have performed the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, 
consequently, we do not express any opinion on these individual areas. 
Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Recoverability of carrying 
value of goodwill and 
intangibles
Refer to the Audit 
Committee Report (page 
41); Accounting policies 
(Note 2 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements) 
The Group has goodwill and 
other intangible assets of 
£178.7 million (2014: £225.7 
million), including goodwill 
of £172.7 million (2014: 
£218.7 million). At 
31 December 2015, the 
Group recognised an 
impairment charge of £48.8 
million against goodwill. 
• Management’s 
assessment of the 
recoverable amount of 
these assets requires 
estimation and 
judgement around 
various assumptions used 
in the model, including 
future cash flows, growth 
rates and discount rates. 
• Any input inaccuracies to 
the model or 
unreasonable bases used 
in the judgements could 
lead to material changes 
in the estimated 
recoverable amount.
Our work on this area was performed centrally by the 
primary audit engagement team. 
In order to assess the appropriateness and adequacy 
of the impairment charge recognised during the year, 
we: 
• reviewed the indicators of impairment identified 
by management under accounting standards, 
including assessing the market capitalisation 
against the net assets of the Group and the 
historical performance of the businesses against 
budgets and forecasts;
• assessed the methodology used by management 
to estimate the recoverable value of each cash-
generating unit (CGU) to ensure that this is 
consistent with the accounting standards;
• involved our valuation specialists to review the 
reasonableness of management’s weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC) calculation;
• discussed the assumptions underpinning the 2016 
budgets for each CGU both with the CGU senior 
management and with the Group Finance team, with 
a particular focus on the Grayling and Citigate CGUs;
• challenged the reasonableness of key assumptions 
used in management’s value in use (VIU) 
computations, in particular the accuracy and 
preparation of future budgets, future forecast 
revenue growth rates, conversion of sales pipeline, 
operating profit margins; 
• performed sensitivity analysis in relation to the 
assumptions used by the management in their 
model to assess the level to which they would 
need to move for impairment to be triggered; and
• evaluated the appropriateness of financial 
statement disclosures.
• We agreed with management’s 
identification of indicators of 
impairment and considered the 
approach to determining the 
recoverable amount for each CGU 
to be appropriate.
• We concluded that value in use 
(VIU) calculated by management 
for the CGUs was within an 
acceptable range and reasonably 
supports the carrying amount of 
goodwill and intangible assets as at 
31 December 2015 after taking into 
account the impairment charge.
• Our sensitivity analysis supports 
there being no further impairment 
arising with respect to any CGU in 
the current year. 76 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Incorrect revenue 
recognition, particularly 
relating to cut-off
Refer to the Audit 
Committee Report (page 
41); Accounting policies 
(Note 2 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements)
The Group has revenue of 
£168.4 million (2014: £165.7 
million), arising from retainer 
based fees and project 
based fees.
• As well as the divisional 
nature of the Group, the 
judgemental nature of 
assessing the stage of 
completion in respect of 
project-based revenues 
increases the risk around 
the timing of recognition 
of revenue.
• There is also a risk that 
management may 
influence any judgements 
on recognition to meet 
performance targets. 
With respect to revenue recognition for our full and 
specific scope components, our procedures included:
• walkthroughs of the process and key controls 
surrounding the revenue cycle;
• disaggregated analytical review of the full period 
by project and by month against prior year and 
budget, corroborating any unusual trends or 
patterns and lowering testing thresholds applied 
for sampling where unusual trends occurred;
• performance of cut-off procedures including 
obtaining evidence that the IAS 18 criteria for 
revenue recognition have been met;
• corroborating samples selected in a manner 
aligned to the risk profiles of individual 
components, by obtaining proof of customer 
acceptance and the stage of completion and 
reviewing post year end credit notes and invoices; 
• testing a representative sample of deferred and 
accrued revenue accounts as at the balance sheet 
dates; and 
• journal entry testing and review of consolidation 
adjustments for any unusual journals posted 
to revenue. 
The above procedures were performed by the 
primary and component teams and covered 75% of 
the Group’s revenue, consisting of 45% covered by 
full scope components, 5% covered by specific scope 
components and 25% covered by specified 
procedures components. 
We also performed review procedures on components 
which covered 11% of the Group’s revenue. 
• We conclude that revenue 
recognition in the year is 
appropriate.
Presentation and disclosure 
of highlighted items
Refer to the Audit 
Committee Report (page 
41); Accounting policies 
(Note 2 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements)
The Group has highlighted 
items before tax of £53.0 
million (2014: £75.6 million). 
• The presentation of 
highlighted items is 
judgemental and 
important given focus on 
pre-highlighted results. 
• There is a risk that certain 
items could be 
inappropriately classified 
as ‘highlighted items’ 
impacting adjusted 
reported measures. There 
is also the risk that 
one-off credit items could 
be omitted from the 
presentation. 
• It is possible that 
inappropriate prominence 
might be given to 
non-GAAP measures.
Our work on this area was performed centrally  
by the primary audit engagement team.  
Our procedures included:
• obtaining an understanding of the categories of 
items included within highlighted; 
• assessing the classification of the highlighted 
items in light of the Group’s accounting policy and 
the PN18 guidance issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council;
• obtaining evidence to support the completeness 
and appropriateness of the charges, provisions, 
credits and any movements which have arisen 
during the year; and
• assessing that sufficient prominence was provided 
to GAAP measures throughout the Annual Report 
and primary statements.
• We concluded that all of the items 
disclosed as highlighted in Note 5 
of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements are in line with the 
Group’s accounting policy.
• We do not consider that undue 
prominence has been given to 
non-GAAP measures.

The scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit 
scope for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls,  
and changes in the business environment when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure that we had adequate 
quantitative coverage of significant accounts (particularly revenue) in the financial statements, of the reporting components  
in the Group, we selected 17 components covering entities within the United States, United Kingdom, Western and Eastern 
Europe and the Middle East which represent the principal business units within the Group. Procedures in respect of all 
components except those in the United States were performed directly by the primary team. 
Of the 17 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of six components (‘full scope 
components’) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining 11 components (‘specific scope 
components’), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the 
potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these 
accounts or their risk profile. The 17 reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 75% (2014: 
68%) of the Group’s revenue and 133% (2014: 75%) of the Group’s profit before tax adjusted for certain non-recurring items. In 
the current year, due to certain immaterial cost centres that were not in full or specific scope for the Group audit, the coverage 
of the Group profit before tax adjusted for certain non-recurring items achieved from the entities was greater than 100%. 
The charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams for revenue and total assets.

For the current year, the six full scope components contributed:
• 45% of the Group’s revenue; 
• 83% of the Group’s profit before tax adjusted for the non-recurring highlighted items, representing five components with 
a positive contribution of 114% offset by one component with a negative contribution of 31%; and 
• 53% of the Group’s total assets. 
The specific scope components contributed 30% of the Group’s revenue, 50% of the Group’s profit before tax adjusted for 
non-recurring highlighted items, from 10 components with a positive contribution of 50% and one component with a small 
negative contribution. The specific scope components covered 22% of the Group’s total assets. The audit scope of these 
components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the 
coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. Of the 11 specific scope components, we instructed eight of these 
components to perform specified procedures over revenue recognition. 78 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The remaining components that are not subject to full or specific Group scoping include small, low risk components. The 
balances within each remaining component represent an average negative contribution of 1% of the total Group profit before 
tax adjusted for the non-recurring highlighted items and 0.3% of total Group revenue. For these components, we performed 
other procedures, including testing of Group-wide controls management has in place, performing overall analytical review 
including disaggregated analytical review on revenue for seven ‘review scope’ components (including some of the cost centres 
negatively contributing to the profit before tax adjusted for non-recurring items), central testing of highlighted items and 
intangible assets, consolidation journals including intercompany eliminations and foreign currency translation recalculations in 
order to detect and respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each 
of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network 
firms operating under our instruction. Of the 17 components in full or specific scope, audit procedures were performed on 11 of 
these directly by the primary audit team, including the audit of all non-US components. For the six full and specific scope 
components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to 
enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
During the current year’s audit cycle, the Senior Statutory Auditor visited component teams performing work in respect of five 
full or specific scope components and two review scope components in the United States. These visits involved discussing the 
audit approach with the component team and any issues arising from their work, meeting with local management, attending 
status meetings, and reviewing key audit working papers on risk areas. The primary team interacted regularly with the 
component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers and were responsible 
for the scope and direction of the audit process. This interaction included weekly conference calls with component teams 
during the execution stage of the audit. The Senior Statutory Auditor also attended all clearance meetings for these 
components. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements 
on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and 
extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £0.6 million (2014: £0.7 million), which is 5% (2014: 5%) of profit before tax 
adjusted for the non-recurring highlighted items. We believe that profit before tax adjusted for the non-recurring highlighted 
items provides us with consistent year-on-year basis for determining materiality and is the most relevant performance measure 
to the stakeholders of the entity. 
Starting 
basis
Adjustments
Materiality
Adjustments for the non-recurring highlighted items:
• Goodwill impairment – £48.8m (2014: £71.5m)
• Impairment of software development costs – 
 £0.6m (2014: £0.0m)
• Restructuring costs – £3.3m (2014: £1.9m)
• Acquisition and transaction related (credit)/costs – 
 £(0.4m) (2014: £0.2m)
• Facilities fees written oŒ – £0.0m (2014: £0.4m)
•  Proﬁt before tax adjusted for certain 
 non-recurring items – £12.5m (2014: £14.4m)
•  Materiality – £0.6m (2014: £0.7m) (5% of proﬁt 
 before tax adjusted for non-recurring items)
• Loss before tax – £39.8m (2014: £59.6m)
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial planning materiality to reflect the actual reported performance of the Group.

Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low 
level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement 
was that performance materiality was 75% (2014: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely £0.47 million (2014: £0.54 million). 
We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to the historically low number of audit adjustments found in prior 
years and to ensure that total detected and undetected audit differences do not exceed our materiality of £0.63 million (2014: 
£0.73 million) for the financial statements as whole.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is 
based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement 
at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £0.09 million to 
£0.34 million (2014: £0.07 million to £0.22 million). 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.03 million 
(2014: £0.04 million), which is set at 5% of materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 73, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 80 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015

• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
• otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report whether we have identified any inconsistencies

shareholders to assess the entity’s performance, business model and strategy; and 
whether the annual report appropriately addresses those matters that we 
communicated to the audit committee that we consider should have been disclosed.
We have no 
exceptions 
to report.

reporting
We are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns

• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
We have no 
exceptions 
to report.

Statement on the Directors’ Assessment of the Principal Risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the entity
ISAs (UK and 
Ireland) 
reporting
We are required to give a statement as to whether we have anything material to add or 
to draw attention to in relation to:
• the Directors’ confirmation in the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the entity, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and explain how they 
are being managed or mitigated;
• the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and 
their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to 
do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements; and
• the Directors’ explanation in the annual report as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the entity, over what period they have done so and why they consider 
that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing 
material to add 
or to draw 
attention to.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDA TED FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006. On 14 March 2016 the consolidated financial statements of the Group were authorised for issue in accordance with a 
resolution of the Directors. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the 
nearest thousand pounds (‘£000’) except where otherwise indicated.
2. Significant accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments which have 
been measured at fair value. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants 
would use when pricing the asset or liability. The Group uses valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable inputs 
and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. All assets or liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, as set out within IFRS 13.
The Group’s significant accounting policies are listed below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years 
presented unless otherwise stated.
Changes in accounting policies
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations were mandatory for the first time for the financial 
year beginning 1 January 2015, but had no significant impact on the Group:
• IAS 19 (amendment) – Employee contributions;
• Annual Improvements (2010–2012 Cycle); 
• Annual Improvements (2011–2013 Cycle); and
• IFRIC 21 – Levies.
New Standards and amendments not applied
Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards that have been published as mandatory for later accounting 
periods but are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group are as follows:
• IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018);
• Annual Improvements (2012–2014 Cycle) (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016);
• IFRS 10, IAS 28 (amendment) – Sale or Contribution of Assets (effective date postponed);
• IFRS 11 (amendment) – Accounting for Acquisition of Interests in Joint Operations (effective for accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2016);
• IAS 16 and IAS 38 (amendment) – Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016);
• IAS 16 and IAS 41 (amendment) – Bearer Plants (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016);
• IAS 27 (amendment) – Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements (effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2016);
• IAS 1 (amendment) – Disclosure Initiative (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016);
• IFRS 10, IFRS 12, IAS 28 (amendment) Investment entities: applying the consolidation exception (effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016); 
• IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018); and
• IFRS 16 – Leases (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019).
With the exception of IFRS 15 and IFRS 16, the Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards and amendments 
listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods. 
The impact that IFRS 15 will have on the financial statements is yet to be quantified. The Group has different contractual 
arrangements with each of its clients which will require detailed review in order to assess the changes the Group will need to 
make to its revenue recognition policies once the standard is implemented.
The impact that IFRS 16 will have on the financial statements is also as yet unquantified. As a result of the Group’s diverse 
geographic portfolio of businesses, the Group has a significant number of leases which will need to be assessed individually 
against the requirements of the standard.
Basis of consolidation
Huntsworth plc (‘the Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. These financial statements 
consolidate the financial statements of Huntsworth plc and all entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Control is 
achieved when the Company:
• has power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. Strategic

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company 
loses control. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income 
Statement from the date the Company gains control until the date the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. Non-
controlling interests are identified separately from the Group’s equity. Profit and loss and each component of other 
comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to any non-controlling interests. 
Business combinations
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured 
at the aggregate of the fair value of the assets given, liabilities assumed or equity instruments issued by the Group. Any 
acquisition-related transaction costs are recognised in the Income Statement within highlighted items as they are incurred. On 
acquisition of a business, all of the assets and liabilities of that business that exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at 
their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Where the consideration for the acquisition includes a deferred contingent consideration arrangement, this is measured at fair 
value at the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are adjusted against 
the cost of the acquisition if they occur within the measurement period of 12 months following the date of acquisition. Any 
subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration after the measurement period are recognised in the 
Income Statement within highlighted items. 
Goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured as the excess of 
the fair value of the consideration, the amount of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of any previously held interest in 
the acquiree over the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed. Goodwill comprises the value of expected 
synergies arising from an acquisition that do not qualify for separate recognition.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually and in any period in which events or changes in circumstances 
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combinations. 
Impairment testing is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates. 
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount of the cash-generating units, the impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill and then to other assets of the relevant cash-generating unit.
Acquired intangible assets comprise separable corporate brand names, intellectual property and customer relationships. 
Intangible assets are amortised systematically over their estimated useful lives, which vary from two to 20 years depending on 
the nature of the asset. These intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in any periods in which events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Costs associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group and that will 
probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs are recognised as intangible assets. Costs are capitalised from the point 
that the asset first meets the recognition criteria. These are reviewed for impairment until the asset is completed, after which 
point costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of two to seven years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment 
losses. Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less the estimated residual value, 
on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this 
purpose are:

Leasehold improvements are amortised over the shorter of the useful economic life or the period of the lease, from three to 
15 years. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 88 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. If the 
balance is expected to be recovered in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as 
non-current assets. Provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to 
recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the possibility of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Work in progress
Work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, and consists of third party costs incurred on behalf of 
clients which have still to be recharged.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits. Bank overdrafts are an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement.
Loans and borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the related contracts and are 
measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. If the amounts involved are material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future 
cash flows at a pre-tax rate which reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and, when appropriate, 
the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is applied to provisions, the increase in the value of the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Where a leasehold property substantially ceases to be used for the Group’s business, or a commitment is entered into which 
would cause this to occur, provision is made to the extent that the recoverable amount of the interest in the property is 
expected to be insufficient to cover the future obligations relating to the lease.
Acquisitions made by the Group typically involve an earn-out arrangement whereby the consideration payable includes a 
deferred element that is contingent on the future financial performance of the acquired entity. No material contingent 
consideration will become payable unless the acquired entity delivers revenues or profits during the earn-out period that are 
greater than those used for calculating the initial consideration. The provision for deferred contingent consideration is 
recorded at fair value, which is the present value of the amount expected to be paid in cash or shares. The provision represents 
the Directors’ best estimate of future business performance based on internal business plans.
Turnover and revenue
Turnover represents amounts received or receivable from clients, exclusive of value added tax, for the rendering of services and 
comprises charges for fees, commissions, rechargeable expenses incurred on behalf of clients and sales of marketing products.
Revenue is turnover less amounts payable on behalf of clients to external suppliers where they are retained to perform part 
of a specific client project or service, and represents fees, commissions and mark-ups on rechargeable expenses and 
marketing products.
Turnover and revenue reflect the fair value of the proportion of the work carried out in the year by recording turnover and 
related costs as service activity progresses.
Revenue derived from retainers is recognised evenly on a monthly basis over the lifetime of the retainer contract, verified to 
ensure that there are no material distortions for known periods of intense activity. Revenue for time-charge based work is 
recognised when the service is performed in accordance with the contract and is a reflection of the actual hours worked as a 
proportion of total hours expected to be required. For fixed fee projects, revenue is only recognised once the final outcome 
can be assessed with reasonable certainty. The stage of completion is determined relative to the total number of hours or 
significant milestones expected to complete the work or provision of services. Revenue in the form of commissions on media 
placements and fees for creative and production services provided is recognised as the services are performed.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Share-based payments
The Group awards equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value at the date of 
grant. Details of how the fair value of awards made in the year has been calculated are set out in Note 21. The fair value of the 
equity-settled share-based payment is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense spread straight-line over the 
relevant vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet 
date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of awards expected to vest, with the impact of any revision recognised in 
the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Employee share ownership plans
Consideration paid to acquire shares in Huntsworth plc through Employee Benefit Trusts has been deducted from equity.
Pensions
The Group operates defined contribution money purchase pension schemes and makes contributions to individual employees’ 
personal pension schemes. The Group’s contributions are charged against profits in the year in which the related employee 
services are performed.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have 
passed to the Group, and hire purchase contracts, are capitalised in the Balance Sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives. 
The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the Balance 
Sheet. The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged in the Income Statement over the periods of the finance leases 
and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Sublet income on operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
Sterling is the functional currency of Huntsworth plc and the presentational currency of the Group. Transactions denominated 
in foreign currencies are initially translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are translated into the presentational currency of the Group on consolidation. Assets 
and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date with items in the Income Statement being 
translated at the average rate for the period. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are recorded in a separate 
component of equity, but are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal of the subsidiary to which 
they relate.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of an overseas subsidiary are treated as assets and liabilities of 
the overseas subsidiary and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs and finance income
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred unless they meet the criteria to be capitalised. Finance income is 
recognised as the interest accrues (using the effective interest rate method).
Taxation
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement except where it relates to 
items taken directly to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expense or Equity. Current tax assets and 
liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates 
and laws that are enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
• In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of 
the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
• Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date. 90 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
2. Significant accounting policies continued
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes 
relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate movements. The 
Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes. Derivatives that do not qualify for 
hedge accounting are accounted for at fair value through the Income Statement. Derivative financial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value at the contract date and continue to be stated at fair value at the balance sheet date with gains and 
losses on revaluation being recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Interest rate swaps are used to hedge against fluctuations in future cash flows on the Group’s debt funding due to movements 
in interest rates. When a cash flow hedge is employed, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging 
instrument is recognised directly in equity (hedging reserve) until the gain or loss on the hedged item is realised and 
recognised in the Income Statement. Any ineffective portion is recognised in the Income Statement.
Foreign currency instruments are used to hedge against unfavourable exchange rate fluctuations that affect the results of the 
Group’s overseas operations when translated into Sterling. Hedge accounting is not applied to these instruments and the 
associated cost is recognised at fair value through the Income Statement. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value 
is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of derivatives is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements and assumptions about 
the future, based on historical experience and other factors which are considered to be relevant. The resulting accounting 
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
(a) Highlighted items
In order to ensure comparability between the Group’s results year on year, the Directors present certain large, unusual or 
one-off items separately in highlighted items, so that the reader of the accounts can better understand the underlying 
performance of the business. The decision to present an item as highlighted is a judgement of the Directors and is reserved for 
items of an unusual or non-recurring nature that are outside of the ordinary course of business, or of such significant size such 
that they would materially distort the results of any particular period. The Directors consider it appropriate to continually 
present amortisation as a highlighted item in each period because the value of intangible assets being amortised can vary 
considerably from period to period depending on the amount of acquisition activity undertaken by the Group and the 
remaining useful life of individual assets.
(b) Carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the procedures set out in Note 11. 
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations. The value in use 
calculation requires the Directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from each cash-generating unit and a 
suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Central costs are not allocated to individual CGUs.
(c) Revenue recognition
The Group recognises revenue on projects based on the proportion of work completed at the balance sheet date. 
Judgement is required in assessing the fair value of the proportion of work completed and hence the appropriate value of 
revenue to be recognised in the year. Management make this judgement using estimates of expected hours required to 
complete the project against the budget, alongside any milestones set out in the contract. 
(d) Going concern
Judgement is required in performing the Group’s going concern assessment as it requires estimates of forecast future profits 
and cash flows to be made in order to assess future covenant compliance over the forecast period. At the time of approving 
the financial statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and are forecasting to remain in compliance with 
future covenant facility requirements. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of preparation in the 
financial statements.
The Appendix on page 125 includes details of the Group’s subsidiaries and forms part of these financial statements.

Start-up revenues and costs
Start-up revenues and costs in 2014 related to the operating results of new businesses started by the Group. The profile  
of revenue and costs in start-up businesses is different to that of more mature operations within the Group and hence the 
Directors consider that separate disclosure is helpful for investors. The results of start-up operations will cease being included 
within this category once they become consistently profitable or after two years of operation, whichever is earlier. 
Amortisation of intangible assets
Intangible assets are amortised systematically over their estimated useful lives, which vary from 2 to 20 years depending on 
the nature of the asset. These are significant non-cash charges which arise as a result of acquisitions.
Goodwill impairment
Impairments totalling £48.8 million (2014: £71.5 million) were recognised in the year relating to goodwill in the Grayling and 
Citigate CGUs. Further disclosures are given in Note 11.
Impairment of software development costs 
The impairment relates to significant adverse changes in the extent to which internally developed software is expected to be 
used. The recoverable amount is value in use which was determined to be £nil.
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs comprise cost-saving and right-sizing initiatives including severance payments, compensation for loss of 
office, property and other contract termination costs.
Acquisition and transaction related costs/(credit)
Costs incurred in relation to acquisitions and any adjustments to the fair value of deferred contingent consideration liabilities.
Facility fees written off
Amounts capitalised in respect to the previous loan facility were written off when the Group refinanced in May 2014.

1. Because basic EPS results in a loss per share the diluted EPS is calculated using the undiluted weighted average number of shares.
The basic (loss)/earnings per share calculation is based on the (loss)/profit for the year attributable to the Parent Company’s 
shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted (loss)/earnings per share takes the basic (loss)/earnings per share and adjusts for the potentially dilutive impact of 
employee share option schemes and shares to be issued as part of contingent consideration on acquisitions of subsidiaries.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated in order to provide information to shareholders about underlying trading 
performance and is based on the profit attributable to the Parent Company’s shareholders excluding highlighted items.

Citigate
At 30 June 2015, before impairment testing, goodwill of £36.5 million was allocated to the Citigate CGU. The Group revised its 
cash flow forecasts for this CGU, which resulted in a reduction in the value in use. Accordingly, goodwill was impaired by £10.8 
million; this amount was recognised in highlighted items (Note 5) in the Income Statement. The Group has performed further 
impairment testing at 31 December 2015 based on the latest cash flow forecasts for this CGU and there has been no significant 
change in the value in use of this CGU.
Grayling
At 30 June 2015, before impairment testing, goodwill of £90.7 million was allocated to the Grayling CGU. The Group revised its cash 
flow forecasts for this CGU, which resulted in a reduction in the value in use. Accordingly, goodwill was impaired by £38.0 million; 
this amount was recognised in highlighted items (Note 5) in the Income Statement. The Group has performed further impairment 
testing at 31 December 2015 based on the latest cash flow forecasts for this CGU and there has been no significant change in the 
value in use of this CGU.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions used in determining 
the value in use are summarised below:
Operating cash flow forecasts
Operating cash flow forecasts for the initial five-year period are calculated as operating profit before non-cash transactions 
including depreciation and amortisation. Forecasts are based on the 2016 budgeted revenue and operating margins approved 
by the Directors adjusted based on past experience and historic trends. Growth rates in years two to five are based on 
management’s medium-term forecasted revenue and operating margins for each of the businesses.
Long-term growth rate
After the initial five-year forecast period, a long-term growth rate of between 1.1% and 2.5% (2014: 2.5%) has been applied to 
the cash flow forecasts into perpetuity. This growth rate is based on an estimate of the long-term average growth rate for the 
market that each CGU operates in.
Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate
The pre-tax discount rate applied to all CGUs is 14.8% (2014: 13.6%). The discount rates applied to the cash flows of the Group’s 
operations are based on the risk-free rate for 20-year UK government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect both the 
increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the Group’s individual CGUs. In making this adjustment, inputs 
required are the equity market risk premium (that is the increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor 
who is investing in the market as a whole) and the risk adjustment (‘beta’) applied to reflect the risk of the CGU relative to the 
market as a whole.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
In assessing the value in use of a CGU, the forecast future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could change materially over 
time due to the impact of market growth, discount rates and unexpected changes in key clients and personnel. 
The estimated value in use of the Citigate and Grayling CGUs are not materially greater than their carrying values; consequently, 
any adverse change in the key assumptions would cause further impairment losses to be recognised. The changes in the following 
table would, in isolation, give rise to an (increase)/decrease in the value in use for the year ended 31 December 2015 as follows:
Grayling Citigate
Increase 1% 
£000
Decrease 1% 
£000
Increase 1% 
£000
Decrease 1% 
£000
Pre-tax discount rate (4,442) 5,169 (2,397) 2,831
2016 budget operating profit 445 (445) 252 (252)
Medium-term growth rates 1,670 (1,632) 931 (908)
Perpetuity growth rate 4,986 (4,027) 2,841 (2,243)
The Board has considered various alternative performance scenarios for the Red and Huntsworth Health CGUs, including 
sensitising all of the key assumptions noted above, and have not identified any reasonably possible changes which would give 
rise to an impairment.

Deferred contingent consideration for acquisitions
Acquisitions made by the Group typically involve an earn-out arrangement whereby the consideration payable includes a 
deferred element, payable in either cash or a combination of cash and shares at the Company’s option, which is contingent on 
the future financial performance of the acquired entity. The Group anticipates settling the deferred contingent consideration 
provisions over the next two years. The amount utilised in the year represents the cash paid or shares issued under the 
earn-out arrangements. The amount arising or released in the year represents a change in the estimated future financial 
performance of the acquired company. Where deferred consideration is not contingent on the outcome of future events the 
amount is included in trade and other payables. 
Property provisions
Provisions for property represent amounts set aside in respect of property leases which are onerous and the unavoidable costs 
of restoring leasehold properties to the condition specified in the lease at the end of the contractual term. The quantification of 
these provisions has been determined based on external professional advice and is dependent on the Group’s ability to exit the 
leases early or to sublet the properties. In general, property costs are expected to be incurred over a range of one to 
eight years.
Reorganisation and other provisions
This provision relates principally to redundancy provisions. In addition, when acquiring businesses, provisions have been made 
to cover the best estimate of the Group’s exposure to liabilities arising due to the acquisition.

After netting off balances within countries, the following are the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet:
2015 
£000
2014 
£000
Deferred tax balances:
Deferred tax assets 1,466 116
Deferred tax liabilities (202) (396)
Net deferred tax asset/(liability) 1,264 (280)
Deferred tax has been calculated using the anticipated rates that will apply when the assets and liabilities are expected to 
reverse. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is supported by the expected level of future profits in the countries 
concerned.
Unrecognised temporary differences in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences amounting to £30.6 million 
(2014: £33.1 million) have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain. These comprise tax 
losses and other temporary differences of £18.3 million (2014: £20.8 million) and capital losses of £12.3 million (2014: £12.3 
million). Of this total, tax losses of £9.1 million (2014: £17.3 million) will expire at various dates between 2016 and 2029 and the 
remaining losses can be carried forward without restriction.
Overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 are largely exempt from UK tax but may be subject to foreign withholding 
taxes. The unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries affected by such taxes is £2.4 million (2014: £3.1 million).  
No deferred tax liability is recognised on these temporary differences as the Group is able to control the timing of reversal  
and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Finance (No.2) Act 2015 was substantively enacted on 18 November 2015 and includes legislation to reduce the main rate of 
UK corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020. The rate changes to 19% and 18% would reduce the 
Group’s deferred tax assets recognised at 31 December 2015 by less than £0.1 million. The actual impact will be dependent on 
the deferred tax position at the time. 
18. Financial instruments
Capital management policies and strategies
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management policy is to maintain appropriate capital ratios in order to support its 
business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain 
or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payments to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or 
issue new shares. The capital structure of the Group consists of its share capital, as disclosed in Note 20, and its total 
borrowings, comprising bank loans and overdrafts and obligations under finance leases, as disclosed in Note 19.
Financial risk management policies and strategies
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts and cash and short-term deposits. The main 
purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other financial 
assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.

18. Financial instruments continued
The Group enters into derivative transactions; primarily interest rate swaps and foreign currency derivatives. The purpose is to 
manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance. It is the Group’s 
policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments should be undertaken. The main risks arising from the Group’s 
financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Board reviews and agrees 
policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations 
with floating interest rates.
The Board has endorsed principles and policies to manage the Group’s interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate 
debts. To enable this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps. Where appropriate, these agreements are designated 
to hedge underlying debt obligations. As at 31 December 2015, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, 
approximately 64% (2014: 34%) of the Group’s gross borrowings was at a fixed rate of interest. The increase in the percentage 
of borrowing at fixed rates is primarily due to the purchase of an interest rate swap during 2015. The Group continually reviews 
and assesses the balance of debt held at fixed and variable rates and the need for additional instruments to meet both 
short-term and long-term requirements.
Interest rate swap contracts
The Group uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates increasing the cost of servicing its debt. By 
fixing interest rates, the Group is willing to forgo the potential economic benefit that could result from a low interest rate 
environment in order to protect its downside risks and ensure the predictability of its interest cash flows. The fair value of 
interest rate swaps at the end of the reporting period is determined by reference to a market valuation. All interest rate swaps 
are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on 
borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount accumulated 
in equity is reclassified to profit or loss over the period that the floating interest rate payments on debt affect profit or loss.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at 
the reporting date and the impact on the Group’s fixed and floating rate debt profile.

The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above table are non-interest bearing and are therefore 
not subject to interest rate risk. Floating rate surplus cash earns interest based on relevant local LIBID equivalents. Bank 
overdrafts bear interest based on the Lloyds Bank plc base rate. The bank loans payable bear interest based on LIBOR in the 
relevant country.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The interest rate sensitivity analysis below is based on the exposure arising from the Group’s borrowings and derivative 
financial instruments as at the balance sheet date. A 1% (100 basis points) movement is considered to represent a reasonably 
possible change in interest rates. All other variables have been held constant.
• If UK interest rates had been 1% higher or lower, the Group’s profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2015 would 
decrease/increase by £192,000 (2014: £400,000). If US interest rates had been 1% higher or lower, the Group’s profit before 
tax would decrease/increase by £60,000 (2014: £85,000). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to interest 
rates on its variable rate borrowings.
• If UK interest rates had been 1% higher or lower, the Group’s other comprehensive income would decrease or increase by 
£824,000 or £853,000 respectively (2014: £149,000). This is as a result of the changes to the fair value of the Group’s 
interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges.
Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is therefore affected by movements in foreign exchange rates, particularly the US 
Dollar and Euro. This is largely through the retranslation of the Group’s foreign operations’ results and balances into Sterling. 
The Group has few other transactional currency exposures apart from certain foreign currency bank accounts and 
intercompany balances that are held between companies with different functional currencies.
It is the policy of the Group to consider entering into foreign currency contracts in order to manage the risk associated with 
the impact of changes in exchange rates on the Group’s operating profit. The Group does not hedge foreign exchange risk that 
arises from the retranslation of overseas assets and liabilities. During the year, the Group took out foreign exchange contracts 
to cover a proportion of the Group’s Euro and US Dollar denominated operating profit. These contracts were not accounted 
for as a hedge.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in the US Dollar and Euro exchange rates, with 
all other variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax. Since the majority of the Group’s expenses are denominated 
in the same currency as the associated revenues, only the net profit is exposed to currency fluctuations.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in the US Dollar and Euro exchange rates, with

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the potential loss that the Group would incur if a debtor or other counterparty failed to fulfil its contractual 
obligations. The Group trades only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. Customers who wish to trade on credit terms 
are subject to credit verification procedures prior to credit being granted. In addition, receivable balances are closely monitored 
on an ongoing basis by each business with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts has not been significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and 
derivative financial instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum 
exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group has a minimal concentration of credit  
risk in relation to trade receivables as it trades with a large number of customers from a wide range of business segments  
and geographies.
Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and undrawn banking facilities and by continuously 
monitoring the forecast and actual cash flows. 
In October 2015, the Group voluntarily reduced the £90 million multi-currency facility agreement with Lloyds Bank plc, HSBC 
Bank plc and Barclays Bank plc by £25 million to £65 million. The £5 million committed overdraft facility with Lloyds Bank plc 
remained unchanged. Both facilities are due to expire in May 2019. 
The tables below summarise the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2015 and 2014 based on 
contractual undiscounted payments.

Fair values of financial liabilities and assets
All financial assets and financial liabilities have been recognised at their carrying values which are not materially different to 
their fair values.
Fair value measurement
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair 
value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities.
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Valuation techniques used to derive Level 2 fair values
Level 2 derivatives comprise foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. The foreign exchange contracts have been 
fair valued using exchange rates that are quoted in an active market. Interest rate swaps are fair valued using forward interest 
rates extracted from observable yield curves. 
Valuation techniques used to derive Level 3 fair values
Deferred contingent consideration liabilities are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology. The liability is based on the 
acquired business’ forecast average profits for the period from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2016. The significant 
unobservable inputs to this valuation include forecast average profits and the discount rate of 1%. 
The sensitivity of this liability to changes in this discount rate is immaterial. A reconciliation of the movement in this balance in 
2015 is included in Note 16.

Huntsworth Deferred Share Bonus Plan 10 years Mar 2012–Mar 2019 nil
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group within the vesting period. Any share options which remain unexercised 
after the exercise period will expire. Certain grants of share options are also subject to specific performance conditions 
relevant to an employee, such as the Group’s adjusted basic earnings per share and total shareholder return relative to a peer 
group. Specific details of the exercise conditions of options granted to Directors are set out in the Report of the Directors 
on Remuneration.
The following share options were outstanding under the Huntsworth share-based payment schemes at 31 December 2015 and

Exercisable at the end of the year 5,938,954 33.4 7,138,789 29.3
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 39.3 pence 
(2014: 56.5 pence). The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining life of 5.4 years 
(2014: 4.4 years). The estimated average fair value of the options granted during the year is 22.7 pence (2014: 55.0 pence).
Fair value of share options
The fair value of share options granted in 2015 and 2014 were calculated using a binomial option pricing model, the Monte 
Carlo model or the Black-Scholes model. The inputs to these models were:
2015 2014
Weighted average share price 39.4 pence 65.0 pence
Weighted average exercise price 16.7 pence nil
Expected volatility 46%–47% 45%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Risk-free rate 0.91%–1.2% 1.21%
Expected dividend yield 4.5%–5.7% 5.38%
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not 
necessarily be the actual outcome. The Group recognised a total charge of £0.4 million (2014: £0.1 million) related to equity-
settled share-based transactions during the year.

Share premium account
The share premium account is used to record the premium on shares issued.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve is used to record the premium on shares issued as consideration (both initial and deferred) for acquired 
businesses where the Group acquires 90% or more of the ordinary share capital of the acquired business.
Following the impairment of certain investments held by Huntsworth plc, £13.4 million (2014: £21.8 million) relating to the 
acquisition of those subsidiaries has been transferred from the merger reserve to the profit and loss reserve.
Foreign currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of financial 
statements of overseas subsidiaries.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve is used to record the effective portion of the movements in the fair value of the Group’s derivative 
financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and are deemed to be effective hedges.
Treasury shares
Pursuant to the settlement of share options, the Group transferred 585,707 shares to past employees (2014: transferred 16,666 
shares) for proceeds of £146,250 (2014: proceeds of £9,000). As at 31 December 2015 the Group held 1,686,681 shares (2014: 
2,272,388 shares) in Treasury.
Investment in own shares
Investment in own shares represents the cost of own shares acquired in the Company by the Huntsworth Employee Benefit 
Trust and other Employee Benefit Trusts (‘the Trusts’). The purpose of the Trusts is to facilitate and encourage the ownership 
of shares by employees, by acquiring shares in the Company and distributing them in accordance with employee share 
schemes. The Trusts may operate in conjunction with the Company’s existing share option schemes and other share schemes 
that may apply from time to time.
Pursuant to the settlement of share options, the Trust transferred 1,198,969 shares to past employees (2014: nil), including 
115,733 accrued dividend shares, for proceeds of £48,750 (2014: nil).
During 2015 the Trusts did not purchase any shares (2014: nil). At 31 December 2015 the Trusts held 6.4 million shares (2014:  
7.6 million shares) in the Company which had a market value at 31 December 2015 of £2.5 million (2014: £3.7 million).

Contingent liabilities
In the normal course of business, the Group is, from time to time, subjected to legal actions, contractual disputes, employment 
claims and tax assessments. In the opinion of the Directors the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material 
adverse effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company and its subsidiaries have entered into a number of indemnifications, performance and financial guarantees, in 
the normal course of business, which gives rise to obligations to pay amounts or fulfil obligations to external parties should 
certain conditions not be met or specified events occur. As at the date of this report, no matter has come to the attention 
of the Group which indicates that any material outflow will occur as a result of these indemnities and guarantees.

AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2015 116 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2015
1. Basis of preparation
The Company has transitioned to United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting

B64(q)(ii), B66 and B67of IFRS 3 Business Combinations;
• the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures;
• the requirements of paragraphs 91–99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement;

more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a 
member; and
• the requirements of paragraphs 134(d)–134(f) and 135(c)–135(e) of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Amendments to FRS 101 – 2014/2015 have been early adopted. 
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, Huntsworth plc has not presented its own profit and loss account. 
The Company’s significant accounting policies are set out below.
2. Significant accounting policies
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at their historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less the estimated residual value, on a straight-line 
basis over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
• Motor vehicles 25%
• Equipment, fixtures and fittings 15%–35%
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets
Costs associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Company and that will 
probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs are recognised as intangible assets. Costs are capitalised from the point 
that the asset first meets the recognition criteria. These are reviewed for impairment until the asset is completed, after which 
point costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
Trade and other debtors
Trade debtors are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. Provision for 
impairment is made when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to recover balances in full. Balances 
are written off when the possibility of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Provisions for liabilities 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. If the amounts involved are significant, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future 
cash flows at a pre-tax rate. 
Current tax
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Strategic

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that 
is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
• In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal 
of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
• Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the 
related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities.
Foreign currencies
Sterling is the functional currency and presentational currency of the Company. Transactions denominated in foreign 
currencies are initially translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the resulting 
gains and losses are recorded in the profit and loss account.
Investments
Investments are recognised and carried at cost less any identified impairment losses at the end of each reporting period. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such 
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company makes an estimate of the asset’s 
recoverable amount in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless 
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where 
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit and loss account. 
Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, loans and 
receivables or available for sale financial assets, as appropriate. The Company determines the classification of its financial 
assets at initial recognition. All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits. 
Loans and receivables
All Company financial assets are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest (EIR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition 
and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance revenue in the profit and loss 
account. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit and loss account in other operating expenses.
Derecognition of financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised when (i) the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or (ii) the Company  
has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in 
full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all  
the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 118 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Impairment of financial assets
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised 
cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have been incurred) discounted at the 
financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The carrying 
amount of the asset is reduced, with the amount of the loss recognised in administration costs. Central costs are not allocated 
to individual investments.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent 
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset 
does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
Operating lease commitments
Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as 
operating leases and rentals payable are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Share-based payments
The Company awards equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These are measured at fair value at the date 
of grant. The fair value of the equity-settled share-based payments is recognised in the profit and loss account as an expense 
spread straight-line over the relevant vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the number of awards that will 
eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of awards expected to vest, with 
the impact of any revision recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
Loans and borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the related contracts and are 
measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate movements. 
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes but derivatives that do not 
qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for at fair value through the profit and loss account. Derivative financial 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value at the contract date and continue to be stated at fair value at the balance sheet 
date, with gains and losses on revaluation being recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Employee share ownership plans
Shares in the Company held by the Employee Benefit Trust have been included within equity and are stated at cost.
Borrowing costs and finance income
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred. Finance income is recognised as the interest accrues (using the 
effective interest rate method).
Significant accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements and assumptions 
about the future, based on historical experience and other factors which are considered to be relevant. The resulting 
accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Carrying value of investments and other intangible assets
The Company tests annually whether investments have suffered any impairment. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating 
units have been determined based on value in use calculations. The value in use calculation requires the Directors to estimate 
the future cash flows expected to arise from each investment and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. 
Central costs are not allocated to individual investments. 
3. Profit attributable to members of Huntsworth plc
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the Parent Company is not presented 
as part of these accounts. The loss for the year amounted to £3 million (2014 loss: £16.5 million).
The auditor’s remuneration for audit services to the Company was £98,000 (2014: £95,000).

Finance (No.2) Act 2015 was substantively enacted on 18 November 2015 and includes legislation to reduce the main rate of 
UK corporation tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020. The rate changes to 19% and 18% would reduce the 
Company’s deferred tax assets recognised at 31 December 2015 by less than £0.1m. The actual impact will be dependent on 
the deferred tax position at the time.
11. Derivative financial instruments
The Company’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, bank overdraft, loan notes, and cash and short-term 
deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Company and its subsidiaries. The 
Company has various other financial assets and liabilities such as debtors and creditors, which arise directly from its 
operations. During the year the Company has financed its business through an overdraft facility and a revolving credit facility 
arranged with Lloyds Bank plc, Barclays Bank plc and HSBC Bank plc.
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. During the 
year, the Company had in place two interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate profile and one foreign exchange contract 
to manage the Group’s foreign exchange exposure. For full disclosures of the financial instruments, refer to the consolidated 
financial statements (Note 18).

14. Reserves
Called up share capital
The balance classified as called up share capital includes the total net proceeds (both nominal value and share premium) on 
issue of the Company’s equity share capital, comprising £0.01 ordinary shares.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve is used to record the premium on shares issued as consideration (both initial and deferred) for acquired 
businesses where the Group acquires 90% or more of the ordinary share capital of the acquired business. 
Following the impairment of certain investments held by the Company, £13.4 million (2014: £21.8 million) relating to the 
acquisition of those subsidiaries has been transferred from the merger reserve to the profit and loss reserve.
Treasury shares
Pursuant to the settlement of share options, the Company transferred 585,707 shares to past employees (2014: transferred 
16,666 shares) for proceeds of £146,250 (2014: proceeds of 9,000). As at 31 December 2015 the Company held 1,686,681 
shares (2014: 2,272,388 shares) in Treasury.
Investment in own shares
Investment in own shares represents the cost of own shares acquired in the Company by the Huntsworth Employee Benefit 
Trust. The purpose of the Trust is to facilitate and encourage the ownership of shares by employees, by acquiring shares in the 
Company and distributing them in accordance with employee share schemes. The Trust may operate in conjunction with the 
Company’s existing share option schemes and other share schemes that may apply from time to time.
Pursuant to the settlement of share options, the Trust transferred 1,198,969 shares to past employees (2014: nil), including 
115,733 accrued dividend shares, for proceeds of £48,750 (2014: nil).
During 2015 the Trust did not purchase any shares (2014: nil). At 31 December 2015 the Trust held 6.4 million shares (2014: 7.6 
million shares) in the Company which had a market value at 31 December 2015 of £2.5 million (2014: £3.7 million).
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve is used to record the effective portion of the movements in the fair value of the Group’s derivative 
financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting and are deemed to be effective hedges.
Other reserves
The amount held in other reserves represents the credit to equity where Huntsworth plc grants rights in its equity instruments 
to employees of a subsidiary and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated 
financial statements. The credit represents a contribution from the Parent Company to its subsidiaries.

Contingent liabilities
(i) The Company is registered with HM Revenue and Customs as a member of a Group for VAT purposes and, as a result, is 
jointly and severally liable on a continuing basis for amounts owing by any other members of that Group in respect of 
unpaid VAT. At the balance sheet date, the outstanding VAT liability in the other Group companies amounted to 
approximately £1.6 million (2014: £2 million).
(ii) In connection with the Group’s banking and borrowing facilities, the Company and certain of its subsidiary undertakings have 
entered into cross-guarantee and indemnity arrangements with Lloyds Bank plc, Barclays Bank plc and HSBC Bank plc.
(iii) In the normal course of business, the Company is, from time to time, subjected to legal actions, contractual disputes, 
employment claims and tax assessments. In the opinion of the Directors, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not 
have a material adverse effect on the Company.
(iv) The Company has entered into a number of indemnifications, performance and financial guarantees, in the normal course 
of business, which gives rise to obligations to pay amounts or fulfil obligations to external parties should certain conditions 
not be met or specified events occur. As at the date of this report, no matter has come to the attention of the Company 
which indicates that any material outflow will occur as a result of these indemnities and guarantees.
17. Transition to FRS 101
For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 December 2014, the Company prepared its financial statements in 
accordance with previously extant UK GAAP. These financial statements, for the year ended 31 December 2015, are the first 
the Company has prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
Accordingly, the Company has prepared individual financial statements which comply with FRS 101 applicable for periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in the 
relevant notes.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2014, the 
Company’s date of transition to FRS 101, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required for 
the first-time adoption of FRS 101. As such, this note explains the principal adjustments made by the Company in restating its 
balance sheet as at 1 January 2014 prepared under previously extant UK GAAP and its previously published UK GAAP financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
On transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied the requirements of paragraphs 6–33 of IFRS 1 ‘First time adoption of 
International Financial Reporting Standards’.
Exemptions applied
IFRS 1 allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from the general requirements to apply IFRSs as effective for December 
2015 year ends retrospectively. The Company has taken advantage of the following exemptions:
IFRS 2 Share-based payment has not been applied to any equity instruments that were granted on or before 7 November 
2002, nor has it been applied to equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that vested before 1 January 2005. This 
treatment is consistent with the transitional provisions taken when the Company adopted FRS 20, the UK equivalent standard.
IAS 27 Separate and individual financial statements permits investments in subsidiaries measured at cost to be measured at 
deemed cost. The elected deemed cost is the previous GAAP carrying amount.
Restatement of equity from UK GAAP to IFRS
No remeasurements have occurred restating its balance sheet as at 1 January 2014 prepared under previously extant UK GAAP 
and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014. 124 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have 
elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 and applicable law. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the 
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

1 CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
Against a very difficult economic backdrop I am pleased 
to report that for the year ending 30 June 2009 profit 
before tax and amortisation of intangible assets amounted 
to £13.1m and adjusted earnings per share
1
 to 33.24p.  
This compares with profit before tax and amortisation of 
intangible assets of £14.1m and adjusted earnings per 
share
1
 of 36.22p for the previous year.  These results 
demonstrate the robustness and diversity of ISG’s portfolio 
of businesses, and accordingly, the Board recommends a 
final dividend of 9.66p per share, making a total dividend 
for the year of 13.66p per share.  This represents an 
increase of 3.5% on last year.  Our business is cash 
generative and the balance sheet is strong with net cash 
of £32.1m.
ISG has not been immune from the impact of the 
global economic climate.  However, as these results 
demonstrate, our diversification policy has given the 
business much greater resilience.  Particularly our retail 
and regional construction businesses have adapted and 
performed well to largely offset the anticipated sharp 
decline in the London commercial office market.  We are 
a significantly more robust business compared to the 
last downturn in 2005 where our adjusted earnings per 
share fell to 11 .18p.  Selected acquisitions have raised our 
exposure to overseas growth markets and broadened our 
ability to service our international customers.  
Over the last twelve months our strategic priorities have 
been firstly to align our UK cost base to revenue, secondly 
to continue to expand our UK activities in the retail and 
public sectors and thirdly to continue to invest in higher 
growth overseas markets.
Each year my statement gives me the opportunity to 
pay tribute to the hard work and dedication of our staff.

3 This has been a particularly difficult time for them as we 
have had to downsize our resources in the UK to match 
business levels.  Despite this they have continued to 
provide the dedicated, high quality service to our clients 
which is the hallmark of our business.  Their hard work and 
commitment to the values of ISG have been especially 
appreciated in this challenging year.
In December, Steve Trotter retired as an Executive Director 
and stood down from the ISG Board at the end of the 
financial year.  Steve joined the group in 1997 to set up our 
London new build activities and joined the ISG Board in 
2005 taking responsibility for all of our London operations.  
I would like to thank him for his contribution to the group 
and on behalf of the Board wish him well in his retirement.
At the start of the current financial year the in year order 
book stood at £686m a decline of only 9% compared to 
the same date last year.  There are signs of a recovery 
in demand for office space in London, but this will not 
benefit our business until 2010.  By contrast we expect 
our retail businesses to continue to perform well as the 
supermarkets continue to add space and as banks again 
realise the importance of modernising their branch network 
in order to attract retail deposits.  Whilst UK private sector 
construction will remain subdued, we expect overseas, 
particularly Asia, to lead the recovery.  
Overall our markets remain highly competitive but the 
business continues to trade in line with our expectations.  
We have demonstrated that we have successfully 
transformed the business into one that is far more able 
to withstand an uncertain business environment.  We will 
continue to search out opportunities overseas to maintain 
that momentum.

5 CHIEF  
EXECUTIVE’S 
STATEMENT
Overview
I am pleased to announce an excellent set of results, 
delivered in a challenging global economic environment.  
Our diversification strategy over the past four years to 
reduce the group’s dependency on the London office 
sector has paid off and demonstrated the robustness of 
ISG’s businesses.
We have continued to expand our service offering and now 
offer:
fit out and project management services to •	
customers in many of the major European, Middle 
Eastern and Asian cities;
fit out, refurbishment and new build services to food •	
retail, retail banking and retail fashion clients nationally 
across the UK; and
new build and refurbishment services to public and •	
private sector clients across England and South 
Wales.
In addition, whilst maintaining our leading market position 
in the office sector, we have broadened our offering in 
the London market where we offer fit out, new build and 
refurbishment services to include both the public and 
private sectors.
This has enabled the group to offset the decline in the UK 
and Western European office sectors by our exposure to 
more resilient sectors such as food retail, retail banking, 
technology and public sector projects as well as our 
increased exposure to the Asian markets.

7 Results
For the year ended 30 June 2009, adjusted profit before 
tax
1
 declined by 7% to £13.1m (2008 - £14.1m) on revenue 
that decreased by 4% to £1,049m (2008 - £1,090m).  
Adjusted earnings per share
2
 decreased by 8% to 33.24p 
(2008 - 36.22p).
Net cash as at 30 June 2009 of £32.1m was slightly behind 
prior year (2008 - £35.3m).  In the year there was net cash 
inflow from operating activities of £6.8m (2008 - £20.4m), 
and the group repaid £5.9m of bank borrowings.  The group 
continues to trade well within its banking covenants.  In 
addition, the group retains an undrawn working capital 
revolving credit facility of £10.0m which expires in 2013.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 4.00p was paid in April 2009.  The 
Board has decided to increase by 5% the level of final 
dividend.  Hence a final dividend of 9.66p is proposed 
bringing the total to 13.66p (2008 - 13.20p), an overall 
increase of 3.5%.  Subject to shareholder approval at 
the AGM on 4 December 2009, the final dividend will 
be payable on 7 December 2009 to shareholders on the 
register on 6 November 2009.  The ex-dividend date will be 
4 November 2009.  The closing date for elections for the 
Dividend Re-Investment Plan is 12 November 2009.

 and order

The recent series of economic and political events in the 
world have had an impact on our business with many of 
our corporate clients becoming more cautious in their 
decision making in the last quarter of calendar year 2008 
and the first quarter of 2009, leading to some projects 
being delayed or cancelled.  
With group revenue decreasing in the year by 4%, adjusted 
group operating profit
1
 decreased by 8% to £13.9m (2008 
- £15.1m) resulting in an operating margin on revenue of 
1 .3% (2008 - 1 .4%).
In London, revenue declined by 33% to £380m, resulting 
in operating profits falling to £5.3m (2008 - £7 .9m).  London 
now represents 31% (2008 - 43%) of group trading 
operating profit.  The operating profit of our Regional 
Construction businesses increased to £3.0m (2008 - 
£2.3m) resulting from a 22% increase in revenue, and now 
represents 17% (2008 - 12%) of group trading operating 
profit and includes a full year’s contribution from Pearce 
Construction (2008 - seven and a half months).

9 Our Retail operations generated operating profits of £6.7m 
(2008 - £3.9m) resulting from a 52% increase in revenue 
and now represents 38% (2008 - 21%) of group trading 
operating profit and includes a full year’s contribution from 
Pearce Retail (2008 - seven and a half months). 
Our Asia operations generated operating profits of £2.1m 
(2008 - £1 .7m) resulting from a 24% increase in revenue 
and now represents 12% (2008 - 9%) of group trading 
operating profit.  Our Middle East operations generated 
an operating loss of £0.4m (2008 - nil) as we invested in 
the start up of these operations.  Our European operations 
generated operating profits of £1 .4m (2008 - £3.1m), with 
the decline due to the substantial reduction in revenue in 
the second half of the year caused by the economic crisis.
In respect of the order book of £822m at the end of June 
2009, only 26% of the activity relates to the corporate 
office sector (2008 - 36%) with 37% relating to education, 
affordable housing and government sectors (2008 - 34%) 
and 27% to the retail and leisure sector (2008 - 25%).
london
In our Annual Report for 2008, we anticipated a slow down 
in the office market and reduced the volume target for our 
London businesses in the financial year by 20%.  With the 
severity of the credit crunch particularly on commercial 
developer clients, volumes in the year declined by 24% 
to £448m (2008 - £588m) and revenue by 33% to £380m 
(2008 - £569m).  Operating profit decreased by 34% to 
£5.3m (2008 - £7 .9m) resulting in an operating margin 
on revenue of 1 .4% (2008 - 1 .4%).  With the anticipated 
decline in volumes we have been actively managing the 
level of our resources.

 have declined 29% to £218m 
(2008 - £309m).  Notable project delivery successes were 
the completion of the new London offices for Mayer Brown 
International, Reed Smith, Standard Bank and the Financial 
Services Authority, new offices for Unilever in Leatherhead, 
the third phase of the refit of Shell House on the South 
Bank and a £75m data centre fit out for EDS.  In addition, 
we have also been working on the pre-construction phase 
of the circa £60m fit out of KPMG’s new UK headquarters 
building in Canary Wharf, which started on site in May 
2009.  
The business has an order book of £159m as at June 
2009 (2008 - £174m), of which £137m is to be delivered 
in the current financial year (2008 - £102m).  Since the 
year end the business has been awarded eleven projects 
in the residential, technology and office sectors with a 
total value of £68m, of which £40m is for delivery in the 
current financial year.  In the last few months we have

11 noted tentative signs of improvement in the pipeline of 
major fit out opportunities, with the pipeline of contracts 
we expect to tender in the next six months increasing over 
the previous six months.  We have seen also some signs 
of improvement in the smaller end of the market albeit it 
continues to be highly competitive.  As such we anticipate 
volumes being maintained in the current financial year.  
london Build
As expected, revenue in London Build has declined by 13% 
to £227m (2008 - £260m) due to the reduced demand for 
new build and refurbishment of office space in Greater 
London.  In the year we completed several projects for 
commercial developers including the Stratton Street 
project for Grafton Advisors, the Fleetway House scheme 
for Tishman Speyer, 107 Cheapside for Carlyle Group and 
the Savannah House scheme for Standard Life.  Recent 
wins include the £13.5m Mechanical Engineering building 
for Imperial College, for whom we have carried out over 
30 projects since our first project in 2000.  We are making 
good progress on the Nido Spitalfields 35 storey student 
accommodation tower for Blackstone which is due for 
completion in August 2010.  In February 2009 we started 
on site on the Velodrome for the London 2012 Olympics 
and have achieved an Olympic Delivery Authority’s key 
milestone of completing the Velodrome foundations by 
May 2009.
The business has an order book of £188m (2008 - £357m), 
of which £140m is to be delivered in the current financial 
year (2008 - £200m).  With the decline in the pipeline of 
office new build and refurbishment opportunities, we 
would anticipate revenue in 2009/10 to be 33% lower than 
2008/09 levels.  
Regional Construction
Our Regional Construction businesses which include the 
activities of our offices based in Manchester, Bradford, 
Birmingham, Bristol, Ipswich and Maidstone, performed 
well despite the reduction in private sector work.  Revenue 
in the period increased by 22% to £367m (2008 - £302m).  
The results include a full year’s contribution from Pearce 
Construction (2008 - seven and a half months).  On a 
like for like basis, revenue for the Regional Construction 
businesses grew by 10%.
Operating profit increased by 31% to £3.0m (2008 - 
£2.3m), resulting in an operating margin on revenue of 
0.8% (2008 - 0.7%).
During the year, 62% of revenue related to public sector 
clients (2008 - 40%).  Across our Regional Construction 
businesses we now have the benefit of a significant 
number of public sector frameworks covering core sectors 
of affordable housing, local authorities, health and prisons.  
These frameworks delivered £66m of revenue and we have

13 already been allocated £50m of projects for the current 
financial year, including £22m under the Aspire Ministry 
of Defence framework and £13m under the North West 
Prison framework.  In May we were appointed as one of 
eleven contractors to the Construction Framework South 
West, a four year framework expected to deliver £500m 
of construction activity.  We were also successful in being 
appointed as one of three contractors on a three year 
framework for Severn Trent Water.
During the year, we worked on 45 education projects 
with a total revenue of £118m (2008 - £50m) including the 
Suffolk Sixth Form Centre in Ipswich, Gateway College in 
Leicester, St John’s School in Marlborough, St Brendan’s 
College in Bristol and Sir John Deane’s College in Cheshire.  
We have an education order book of £108m as at the end 
of June 2009 (2008 - £90m), which includes the recently 
won City Technology Centre Kingshurst Academy in Solihull 
and the motor neurone disease research centre at the 
University of Sheffield.
Work for our private sector clients included building two 
new Asda stores in South Wales, Manchester Airport 
Terminal 1 airside refurbishment, our fourth Village Hotel, 
the Toronto Square development in Leeds, the Salthouse 
Hotel on the Ipswich waterfront, and commercial offices 
for Standard Life in Guildford.
As at 30 June 2009, the total order book for the Regional 
Construction businesses stands at £286m (2008 - £305m), 
of which 62% relates to public sector works and £224m is 
to be delivered in the current financial year (2008 - £238m).  
With the likely pressure on public sector capital spending 
we are anticipating that revenues will decline by circa 10% 
in the current financial year.
Retail
Overall our Retail operations, Pearce Retail and ISG 
Cathedral, performed in line with expectations during the 
year, with revenue increasing by 52% to £208m (2008 
- £137m).  Our Retail operations are currently focused 
primarily on major food retail and bank branch roll out 
frameworks.  The results include a full year contribution 
from Pearce Retail (2008 - seven and a half months).  On a 
like for like basis the revenue for our Retail operations grew 
by 12% year on year.
Operating profit increased by 69% to £6.7m (2008 - 
£3.9m), resulting in an operating margin on revenue of 
3.2% (2008 - 2.9%).  
During the year Pearce Retail, which focuses primarily 
on major food retail customers, undertook a total of 67 
projects (2008 - 56 projects) comprising new builds, 
shell fit outs, extensions and refurbishments for Tesco, 
Asda, Sainsbury’s, Marks & Spencer and Morrisons.

15 programmes by its key customers, but this has been 
compensated for by our ability to offer a wider range of 
services with an increased allocation of new build and 
extension projects, particularly by Asda and Morrisons.  In 
addition we have just been awarded our first new build 
opportunity for Tesco and anticipate being allocated further 
opportunities shortly.  
Since acquiring Pearce Retail, we have been successful in 
expanding the geography over which we service our food 
retail customers from Pearce’s historic South West market. 
For the current financial year our customers are continuing 
to be committed to their capital spend programs to 
increase square footage and hence the business has 
already been allocated by its major food retail customers 
contracts totalling approximately £84m (2008 - £103m).  
Since the year end we have received further instructions 
from customers for projects valued in excess of £30m and 
we have been notified of increased allocations by Asda, 
Tesco and Marks & Spencer for projects starting in the 
second half of the year.
During the year ISG Cathedral focused primarily on bank 
branch roll out frameworks undertaking 195 projects for 
Barclays Bank, Lloyds Banking Group, RBS and HSBC, 
including Barclays’ flagship branch projects in Manchester 
and London Piccadilly, the latter of which won the National 
Association of Shopfitters Design Partnership Award in 
conjunction with Aukett Tytherleigh.  ISG Cathedral was 
successfully appointed to a new four year framework 
agreement with Barclays and successfully re-bid a four year 
framework agreement with the Lloyds Banking Group.
In addition ISG Cathedral undertook nine new concept 
projects for high street fashion retail clients at Westfield, 
White City including Tiffany & Co, La Senza and Monsoon, 
its 100th store for T -Mobile in the year, two projects for 
Primark and refurbishment works on two hotel projects for 
The Doyle Collection.
For the current financial year, ISG Cathedral has already 
been allocated 340 projects by Barclays Bank, Lloyds 
Banking Group, RBS and HSBC resulting in an order book 
of £51m (2008 - £70m).  Our retail banking customers 
continue to be committed to their capital spend programs 
recognising the importance of their UK depositor bases in 
the present economy and commencing implementation of 
rebranding programmes.
Overall our Retail operations have an order book as at 
30 June 2009 of £135m (2008 - £173m).  With recent 
allocations from our major food retail clients and bank 
branch roll-out framework clients, we are confident of 
maintaining activity levels throughout the current financial 
year.

17 Asia
In our Asia operations, revenue increased by 24% to £63m 
(2008 - £51m).  The business increased operating profit 
by 23% to £2.1m (2008 - £1 .7m), representing 12% (2008 
- 9%) of group trading operating profit, resulting in an 
operating margin on revenue of 3.4% (2008 - 3.4%).
The business enjoyed higher activity levels from its 
offices in China (Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai) with 
revenue up 160% and a retail refurbishment project for 
Swire Properties in Beijing contributing significantly to 
this increase.  However Hong Kong, Tokyo, Malaysia 
and particularly Singapore were impacted by the global 
economic situation and the collapse of Lehman Brothers, 
which short term led to a loss in confidence and the delay/
cancellation of a number of projects.
In the year the business provided consultancy services 
and delivered projects for a broad range of clients in 
the retail, financial and corporate sectors including 
Apple, Emporio Armani, UGG, Mandarin Oriental, Swire 
Properties, Standard Chartered Bank, Bohai Bank, Barclays, 
Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, Fidelity, Merrill Lynch, Shell, 
ExxonMobil, Ogilvy & Mather and Deloitte.
In Asia we have continued to strengthen our management 
resources for the next phase of growth and we have 
invested in larger offices in China to support the growth.
The business is carrying forward an order book of £42m 
as at June 2009 (2008 - £34m) and this includes the recent 
securing of two fit out opportunities for Marina Bay Sands 
totalling £21m in Singapore.  Since the year end we have 
secured further fit out projects totalling £15m.  With the 
improved order book and continuing improving prospects 
for the region, we are anticipating increased activity levels 
of approximately 20% in the current financial year.  
Middle East
We have continued to resource the joint venture with Al 
Habtoor Leighton Group which is to provide fit out and 
joinery services across the Middle East, and this has led to 
an operating loss of circa £0.4m in the year on revenue of 
£2.3m.  The joint venture was completed in June 2009 and 
we anticipate it making a positive contribution in the first 
half of the current financial year on the back of a current 
total order book of £12m, which includes the refurbishment 
project of the Sheikh Zayed Sports Stadium in Abu Dhabi.  
We continue to build a strong pipeline of opportunities in 
Dubai and Abu Dhabi and since year end we have been 
selected for three further projects totalling £8m.

19 Europe
Our European business, which has the shortest order 
book of all our businesses, experienced the most severe 
reaction to the global economic situation in the second half 
of the financial year.  Post Lehman Brothers, the business’s 
key customer base of international financial services and 
technology companies delayed or cancelled their strategic 
projects across Europe.  As a result of this revenue 
declined by 4% to £29m (2008 - £30m).  On a like for like 
basis  the business showed a decline in revenue in the 
year of 17%.  The business contributed an operating profit 
of £1 .4m (2008 - £3.1m), representing 8% (2008 - 17%) 
of group trading operating profit, resulting in an operating 
margin on revenue of 4.8% (2008 - 10.3%).  The lower 
margin reflects a trend towards a higher proportion of 
tendered work and increased investment in the business’s 
infrastructure as we expand our coverage in both sector 
and geographical offerings.
With offices in Paris, Frankfurt, Milan and Geneva the 
business delivered projects for RBS, the Accor Group, Iron 
Mountain, Cardinal Health, Yahoo, Ace Insurance, Adobe, 
Google and General Reinsurance.
The business has agreed a strategic partnership with a 
leading international petrochemical customer, where we 
have now completed one project and anticipate working 
on five further projects totalling £20m over the next 18 
months in Europe and the Middle East.
The business has throughout the period devoted resources 
to developing its supply chain into Eastern Europe and is 
now delivering a number of projects in Moscow, Poland 
and Bulgaria for international clients.  In addition it has 
opened an office in Amsterdam to service the Benelux 
countries.
As at June 2009, the business had an order book of £6m 
(2008 - £8m) reflecting the quieter commercial office 
market in Paris and the completion of a number of projects 
in Geneva.  Since year end we have seen an increase in 
demand for our services and we have been awarded a 
further £13m of work including a project with Rolls Royce 
in Poland, a project for Hackett in Paris and projects for our 
leading international petrochemical customer in Brussels 
and Hanover.

At the end of June 2009, our total order book was £822m 
(2008 - £1,051m), of which £686m (2008 - £756m) is for 
delivery in the current financial year and £122m (2008 - 
£283m) for the next financial year.  The business continues 
to position itself towards more resilient regions and 
sectors.
In the UK our Retail frameworks continue to give us 
visibility through the current year, where our clients are 
committed to maintaining their current capital investment 
programs in both the food and retail banking sectors.  
In London and our Regional Construction businesses we 
have already secured two thirds of our targeted revenue 
for the current financial year.
In our Asia business demand continues to be driven from 
China aided by a strong recovery in the Singapore market.  
In the Middle East from a low base we are continuing to 
build a strong pipeline that should enable the business to 
grow in profitability.  In Europe we continue to widen our 
geography and are making progress in diversifying into 
other sectors.  
We are now seeing tentative signs of improvements in 
pipelines in some of our major markets including Asia, 
Europe and London Fit out, with our core clients in the 
financial services, petrochemical and technology sectors 
once again making strategic investments.  This is giving us 
an increased level of optimism for the longer term.

FINANCIAL 
REVIEW
Revenue and Operating profit
Total revenue decreased by 4% to £1,049m (2008 - 
£1,090m).  The decrease is due to a 33% decrease 
in revenue of our London operations to £380m 
(2008 - £569m) largely reflecting the slowdown in the 
office market; a 22% increase in revenue in Regional 
Construction to £367m (2008 - £302m) due to organic 
growth of 10% and the inclusion of only seven and a 
half months of activity of Pearce Construction in the 
prior year; a 52% increase in revenue in Retail to £208m 
(2008 - £137m) due to organic growth of 12% and the 
inclusion of only seven and a half months of activity 
of Pearce Retail in the prior year; a 24% increase in 
revenue in our Asia operations to £63m (2008 - £51m) 
due to organic growth of 3% with the balance due 
to favourable foreign exchange movements; a 119% 
increase in revenue in our Middle East operations 
to £2m (2008 - £1m) due to organic growth; and 
a decrease of 4% in the revenue of our European 
operations to £29m (2008 - £30m).  
Adjusted group operating profit
1
 decreased by 8% to 
£13.9m (2008 - £15.1m).  The decrease in adjusted 
group operating profit
1
 is due to a 34% decrease 
from our London operations to £5.3m (2008 - £7 .9m); 
a 31% increase in Regional Construction to £3.0m 
(2008 - £2.3m); a 69% increase in Retail to £6.7m 
(2008 - £3.9m); a 22% increase from our Asia 
operations to £2.1m (2008 - £1 .7m), the reasons for 
these movements are described in the paragraph 
above; a decrease in our Middle East operations 
from break-even to a loss of £0.4m as a result of our 
investment in the start up of our new joint venture; and 
a decrease of 56% in our European operations to £1 .4m 
(2008 - £3.1m) as a result of increased investment in 
infrastructure to support a greater number of territories,

 of £13.1m was 7% behind last 
year’s £14.1m.  Finance income decreased to £0.9m (2008 
- £1 .3m) largely as a result of the fall in interest rates during 
the year.  Finance costs decreased to £1 .7m (2008 - £2.4m) 
as a result of the fall in interest rates during the year 
and a lower level of debt.  The finance costs include the 
unwinding of discount on deferred consideration of £0.4m 
(2008 - £0.4m).  
Profit before tax was £11 .7m (2008 - £12.6m) after 
amortisation of intangibles of £1 .4m (2008 - £1 .4m).
T axation
The group’s effective tax rate is 27 .3% (2008 - 20.8%).  
The rate was lower last year due to an adjustment relating 
to the release of a previous year’s UK corporation tax 
provision of £1 .1m, as well as the utilisation of tax losses 
brought forward.  Tax losses brought forward of £2.5m 
have been utilised this year, and we have carried forward 
tax losses of £18.4m, none of which have been treated as 
a deferred tax asset.
Earnings per Share and Dividends
Basic earnings per share has decreased by 19% from 
36.44p per share in 2008 to 29.67p per share.  The 
adjusted basic earnings per share
2
 shows a decrease of 
8% to 33.24p per share (2008  - 36.22p).  The final dividend 
is proposed at 9.66p (2008 - 9.20p) giving a total dividend 
for the year of 13.66p up 3.5% on last year (2008 - 13.20p).  
At this level the dividend is covered 2.4 times (2008 - 2.7 
times) based upon adjusted earnings per share.
Shareholders’ Funds
During the year, shareholders’ funds increased by £8.3m to 
£45.3m (2008 - £37 .0m).  The group generated a profit for 
the period of £8.5m (2008 - £10.0m).  Dividend payments 
of £3.8m (2008 - £3.4m) were made during the year.  
The issue of shares in the year accounted for £2.4m of 
the increase in shareholders’ funds (2008 - £5.0m).  The 
foreign currency reserve movement for the year was 
£1 .2m (2008 - £2.7m) and represented the translation gain 
on the revaluation of the assets and liabilities of foreign 
subsidiaries and related goodwill using rates of exchange 
at the balance sheet date.  
The number of shares in issue at 30 June 2009 was 31 .1m 
(2008 - 29.5m).  The increase of 1 .6m shares (2008 - 1 .8m) 
is largely due to the issue of 1,381,104 shares as part of 
the consideration for the acquisition of ISG Pearce Holdings 
Ltd and 186,756 shares as part of the consideration for the

27 acquisition of ISG Europe SAS, resulting in an increase in 
the share premium reserve of £2.4m (2008 - £5.0m).
During the year a further 147 ,970 of shares were acquired 
by our Jersey Trust company linked to Long Term Incentive 
Plans for senior management.  The total number of shares 
held by the Jersey Trust company at 30 June 2009 is 
1,614,487 .  Shareholders’ funds are stated after deducting 
the group’s investment in its own shares of £3.9m (2008 
- £3.6m).  The weighted average number of ordinary 
shares after deduction of the company’s investment in 
its own shares as at 30 June 2009 is 28,709,387 (2008 - 
27 ,398,773).
Acquisitions
During the year, the group finalised its fair value accounting 
and paid deferred consideration on the prior year 
acquisitions of ISG Pearce Holdings Ltd and ISG Europe 
SAS.
On the ISG Pearce Holdings Ltd acquisition, the group 
paid cash of £2.0m and issued shares with a value of 
£2.0m.  At the year end, deferred consideration of £4.5m 
was outstanding and payable in September 2009, of 
which £2.5m will be payable in shares and £2.0m in cash.
On the ISG Europe SAS acquisition, the group paid cash 
of £1 .6m and issued shares with a value of £0.4m.  There 
is no further deferred consideration to be paid on this 
acquisition.  
At 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2008 the carrying amounts 
of goodwill allocated to the cash generating units (London, 
Regional Construction, Retail, Asia and Europe) were 
tested for impairment and deemed not to be impaired.  
Sensitivity analysis was performed on the discount and 
growth rates in the calculations with the conclusion that 
no reasonably probable changes in key assumptions would 
cause the recoverable amount to be less than the carrying 
value.
Cash flow and T reasury
At the end of the year, the group had a gross cash position 
of £51 .2m (2008 - £60.3m).  After repayments of £6.0m in 
the year (2008 - £3.5m), the group had drawn down bank 
loan facilities and hire purchase outstandings totalling 
£18.0m at the year end (2008 - £24.0m), and loan notes 
totalling £1 .0m (2008 - £1 .0m).  Hence the group’s net 
cash position decreased during the year to £32.1m (2008 
- £35.3m).  The group’s average gross cash balance during 
the year was £33.0m (2008 - £33.7m).  
Net cash inflow from operating activities decreased to 
£6.8m (2008 - £20.4m).  EBITDA was £17 .1m in the year 
(2008 - £17 .0m).  Tax payments increased to £2.5m in 
2009 (2008 - £1 .2m).  The movement in working capital 
in the year was a decrease of £7 .8m (2008 - increase of 
£4.6m).  The cash position in 2008 improved partly from 
the beneficial timing of receipts and payments on certain

29 contracts.  These timing differences have effectively 
reversed this year.  Lower volumes, particularly in London, 
have also affected the level of working capital.  
The net cash outflow from investing activities increased 
to £7 .4m (2008 - £3.2m).  Net interest paid decreased to 
£0.2m (2008 - £0.4m), whilst capital expenditure decreased 
to £2.4m (2008 - £2.9m).  Further cash consideration was 
paid on last year’s acquisitions of £2.0m relating to the ISG 
Pearce Holdings Ltd and £1 .6m relating to ISG Europe SAS.  
Finally, the group invested £1 .2m (2008 - nil) in its joint 
venture with Al Habtoor in the Middle East, including a loan 
of £1 .0m.   
The net cash outflow from financial activities was £10.0m 
(2008 - inflow of £2.0m).  Payments for own shares 
decreased to £0.2m (£1 .0m), whilst dividend payments 
were £3.8m (2008 - £3.4m).  
In prior years the group entered into bank loan facilities 
totalling £29.7m to fund the acquisitions of Propencity 
Group Ltd, ISG Cathedral Holdings Ltd and ISG Europe 
SAS.  At 30 June 2009, a balance of £18.4m was 
outstanding on these facilities (2008 - £24.3m) as a result 
of repayments in the year of £5.9m (2008 - £3.4m).  In 
addition, in a prior year the group entered into a £10m 
revolving credit facility for working capital purposes which 
was not drawn on during the year or at year end.  The 
facility expires in May 2013.
The group continues to have bonding facilities lines with 
Euler Hermes, HCC International, Liberty Mutual, Norwich 
Union, Standard Chartered Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, 
Société Générale and United Overseas Bank.

33 The directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2009.
pRINCIpAl ACTIVITIES
The principal activity of the company and its subsidiaries is to provide construction and project management services 
to its customers in the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia.  The group has European operations in France, Germany, 
Switzerland, Italy, Netherlands and Russia, and Asian operations in Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, 
Korea, Australia and the Middle East.
REVIEw OF BuSINESS
A fair review of the group’s activities during the year, trends and factors likely to affect the business and its future 
prospects are set out in the Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 6 to 22, the Financial Review on pages 24 to 30, the 
Directors’ Report on pages 34 to 39 and the Corporate Governance report on pages 46 to 49, and the key performance 
indicators are set out in Group Financial Highlights on page 1, which are incorporated by reference in to this report and 
should be deemed to form part of it.
The Directors’ Report is prepared for the members of the group and should not be relied upon by any other party for any 
other purpose.  The Directors’ Report (including the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Statement, the Financial 
Review and the Corporate Governance report) contain certain forward-looking information and statements in relation to 
the group’s operations, economic performance and financial conditions.  These statements are made by the directors 
in good faith based on the information available to them at the time of their approval of this report and, although they 
believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, they should be treated with 
caution due to the inherent uncertainties, including both economic and business risk factors, underlying such forward-
looking statements or information.
BASIS FOR pREpARATION OF FINANCIAl STATEMENTS ON A GOING CONCERN 
BASIS
Information on the business environment in which the group operates, including the factors that are likely to impact 
the future prospects of the group, are included in the Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 6 to 22.  The principal risks 
and uncertainties that the group faces are set out below on page 36.  The financial position of the group, its cash flows, 
liquidity position and debt facilities are described in the Financial Review on pages 24 and 30.  In addition, Notes 3 and 
24 to the consolidated financial statements set out the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital, financial risks, financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the group for a period in excess of twelve months from the date of 
approval of these consolidated financial statements.  These forecasts are based on the group’s existing order book and 
reflect an assessment of current and future market conditions, their impact on the group’s trading performance and the 
actions taken by management in response to the challenging market conditions.  The forecasts completed on this basis 
demonstrate that the group will be able to operate within the current committed debt facilities and show continued 
compliance with the financial covenants.  In addition, management has considered various mitigating actions that could 
be taken in the event that future market conditions deteriorate beyond their current assessment.  Such measures 
include further improvements in working capital within management’s control, further reductions in costs and capital 
expenditure and use of the group’s undrawn credit facilities.
On the basis of the exercise described above, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group and company 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.  Accordingly, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the group and the company.
DIVIDENDS
The Board paid an interim dividend of 4.00p per share (2008 - 4.00p) on 17 April 2009 to shareholders on the register on 
20 March 2009.  The directors propose the payment of a final dividend of 9.66p per share (2008 - 9.20p) to shareholders 
on the register on 6 November 2009, giving a total dividend for the year of 13.66p per share (2008 - 13.20p).  The 
ex-dividend date will be 4 November 2009.  The closing date for elections for the Dividend Re-Investment Plan is 12 
November 2009.

35 pRINCIpAl RISkS AND uNCERTAINTIES
The key risks and uncertainties facing the group are considered as part of the group’s well established process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing risk.  Impacts of significant risks and their mitigation are monitored at both group 
and subsidiary Board meetings throughout the year and are subject to annual review by the Audit Committee.  The key 
risks facing the business and the processes in place to manage those risks are:
Risks arising from economic downturn •	
The weaknesses emerging in some of the world’s major economies during the last year have increased 
uncertainties and have affected some of the group’s businesses.  These macro economic trends, together with 
liquidity issues arising from the “credit crunch” have increased pressure on some of the group’s clients and its 
supply chain.  This causes some clients to delay their capital investment which impacts on the group’s order book.  
The group is continually reviewing economic prospects for each of its activities including order book levels and 
market data and is positioning its activities to maximise shareholder value.  Headcount and discretionary spending 
have been reduced where appropriate.  Due to the current economic climate the group is also experiencing an 
increase in competition in tenders for work in some of its markets.  Our ongoing strategy of diversification across a 
broad geographical and sector spread helps to mitigate risks associated with the economic downturn. 
Counterparty risk •	 
In the current economic climate there is an increased risk of clients or key subcontractors defaulting.  The group 
performs a credit risk assessment of all new clients before a contract is signed to minimise the risk of bad debts.  
Where possible, credit insurance is taken out on the group’s clients or suitable alternative arrangements, such 
as the use of escrow accounts or reduced credit terms, are put in place.  There are extensive vetting procedures 
in place for all subcontractors before a contract is signed.  Subcontractors’ performance and financial stability is 
continually monitored once they have been accepted to minimise the risk of default or bankruptcy.  Contracts are 
spread between subcontractors to the extent possible to reduce dependence on any one subcontractor. 
Financial risk management •	
As detailed in Note 24, the Board considers the group’s key elements of financial risk to be interest rate risk, 
currency rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.  The Board reviewed and agreed the policy for managing interest 
rate risk and foreign currency risk.  The company does not speculate with derivative instruments.  As the group 
has a positive net cash position, it reviews its treasury position daily, placing surplus cash on short-term deposits.  
The group publishes its financial statements in pounds Sterling and conducts most of its business in Sterling.  The 
level of foreign business is approximately 16% of the group’s trading operating profit.  The credit and liquidity risks 
are diminished by the creditworthiness of the group’s customers and the strength of its cash position.  In addition 
the group is reliant on its supply chain in particular the financial stability of each sub-contractor which is monitored 
on a regular basis.  The group treasury function ensures that there are sufficient levels of committed facilities and 
cash and cash equivalents to enable the group to meet its financial commitments and operate within its financial 
covenants at all times. 
Market risk •	
The profitability of our business is dependent on the level of demand for construction services by both the private 
and public sectors.  Macro-economic indicators are maintained by the group and subsidiary Boards and, as 
appropriate, changes are made to flex activity levels within our businesses on a pro-active basis. 
project risk •	
The group enters into many contracts annually and the risks to which the group is exposed are dependant on 
the nature of the work, the duration of the contract, and the legal form of the contract.  Tenders for contracts are 
subject to approval by the Board or the management of the company submitting the tender, depending on the 
value and nature of the contract.  Contracts in progress are controlled and managed through the group’s operating 
structure and procedures, including detailed and regular reviews of forecast revenue and costs to complete. 
Attracting and retaining key staff •	
Attracting and retaining high-calibre staff is key to achieving the group’s aims.  This is achieved through a 
remuneration system that is firmly linked to performance, a continuous formal performance appraisal system to 
provide regular assessment of individual performance and the active encouragement of skill development and 
training through strongly embedded training schemes throughout the group.
Directors’ report (continued)
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 pAyMENTS TO CREDITORS
The group’s policy is to fix payment terms when agreeing the terms of each transaction.  It is the group’s general policy 
to pay suppliers according to the agreed terms and conditions, provided that the supplier has complied with those 
terms.  Trade creditors include retention amounts held over defect liability periods.  The creditor days for the group at 30 
June 2009 are 48 days (2008 - 48 days).
DONATIONS
During the year the company made no political donations (2008 - nil).  Charitable donations of £6,000 to St John’s 
Ambulance, £2,676 to St Elizabeth Hospice, £1,650 to the Children Hospice South West, £1,300 to Sparks, £1,244 to 
Down’s Syndrome (2008 - £1,463), £4,575 (2008 - £8,717) to various cancer organisations and £18,833 (2008 - £17 ,794) 
to other charitable organisations were made by the group.  In 2008, there were also charitable donations made of £5,000 
to the Starlight Children’s Foundation, £4,279 to the Wisma Harapan & Apar School, and £1,000 to Help for Heroes.
EMpl OyMENT pOlICIES
We support the principle of equal opportunities in employment and oppose all forms of unlawful or unfair discrimination 
on the grounds of colour, race, religion or belief, age, nationality, ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital status 
or disability.  The group’s policy provides equality of opportunity for employment and advancement on the basis of an 
individual’s suitability for the work.  As an equal opportunities employer our benefits and training are accessible to every 
staff member and we encourage and support personal and professional development.  
Several of our UK businesses have been audited and reaccredited by Investors in People this year and consequently 
we have 100% coverage.  At ISG we pride ourselves not only on the projects that we deliver but also the training 
opportunities we provide to our staff.  We are continuously improving our benefits and development opportunities and 
our desire for continuous improvement is underpinned by our Performance Management and Performance Feedback 
Processes.  These ensure that employees receive structured feedback and have the opportunity to agree personal 
development plans with their managers.  Additionally we have commenced the rollout of a new browser based HR 
system which allows employees to access their personal training records and agree future development needs with 
their managers.
During this year we have worked closely with the Olympic Delivery Authority to develop an Equality and Inclusion 
programme.
We have maintained a strong commitment to Health & Safety training with over 200 UK employees and key suppliers 
now having completed the 5 day Site Managers Safety Training Scheme.
The group has well-established structures to communicate with employees at every level and to encourage their 
involvement regarding the group’s performance and future activities.  Information on matters of concern to employees is 
given through information bulletins and reports which seek to achieve a common awareness on the part of all employees 
of the financial and economic factors affecting the group’s performance.
Following an extensive review of policies and procedures, we have established a number of group wide people 
policies covering areas such as Ethical business practice, Disciplinary and Grievance as well as the Equality & Inclusion 
programme referred to above.
HEAl TH & SAFETy 
The Board continues to consider health & safety a key priority and has maintained this focus throughout the year.  It 
is essential that we take all reasonable measures to conduct our business to ensure the health, safety and welfare of 
all our employees and all other persons who may be affected by our activities.  This includes members of the public, 
clients, designers and the trade contractors that we employ.  In the UK we support this with our certifications to 
OHSAS 18001:2007 Occupational Health & Safety Management Systems and our dedicated teams of health & safety 
professionals achieving industry leading safety performance.  This is demonstrated by ISG’s Accident Incident Rate 
(calculated on the number of reportable accidents per 1,000 employees) of 3.12 (2008 - 5.38) (industry average 9.05 
for the period April 2008 to March 2009).  We endeavour to ensure that the same high standards of health & safety are 
applied by our overseas operations.
37 One of the best ways to raise standards is to recognise and reward those that lead the field and to encourage others to 
follow.  That is why every year The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (“RoSPA ”) and the British Safety Council 
(BSC), two of the world’s leading health & safety organisations, invite companies of all sizes from the full spectrum of 
work activities and from all over the world to enter the RoSPA and BSC safety awards.  During May 2009 the group 
received twelve RoSPA Gold Medals, six Gold Awards, and one Silver Award (2008 - one RoSPA Gold Medal and 15 Gold 
Awards) and 15 BSC International safety awards (2008 - five BSC International safety awards).
SuSTAINABIlIT y
Construction services are our core business, and as such our influence is far reaching.  We oversee the changing of 
landscapes, performing work throughout communities across the world for clients within varying industry sectors.  
Through our supply chain we acquire and dispose of vast quantities of materials on a daily basis.  As an employer we 
are responsible for the wellbeing and development of a large workforce and we are responsible to our shareholders for 
financial performance.  In short our work affects people, the planet and the prosperity of many on a daily basis and this, 
more than anything has formed the basis of our sustainability policy and strategy.
Our group-wide sustainability strategy encompasses areas where we have a direct influence.  It also addresses our 
responsibilities and capabilities where we have the opportunity to influence others, for example the design and operation 
of the buildings we deliver.  Our strategy also extends to communicating with our supply chain, offering training and 
encouragement for sustainable practices within their own organisations.
Our strategy covers the three pillars of sustainability: People, Planet and Prosperity.
people (social issues)
Our main objectives are to develop the skills of our staff; to be socially responsible treating all of our stakeholders fairly 
and with respect; create a safe and healthy built environment and to manage our supply chain responsibly.
In the last year we have won further health & safety awards as detailed above and were finalists in national sustainability 
awards.  We have held sustainability training workshops around the UK to raise the profile and increase the knowledge 
and understanding of our staff.  We continue to recognise our supply chain development with the continuation of our 
annual ISG sustainability award.
planet (environmental issues)
We aim to enhance and protect the natural environment and minimise the consumption of natural resources and non-
renewable energy sources.  We also aim to minimise waste and maximise the opportunities for recycling.  We also 
ensure that we comply with local laws and regulations relating to the environment.  To demonstrate this commitment, 
all of our UK-based operations have management systems which are certified to the requirements of ISO14001:2000 
Environmental Management Systems.
In the last year we have employed carbon consultants to calculate our carbon footprint of our London head office 
activities and to advise on opportunities for reduction.  In the UK we have renewed our partnership with EDF to supply 
renewable electricity on our construction projects when we are responsible for the supply.
Recycling rates continue to improve across the business and our exemplar projects have achieved recycling rates of up 
to 98% (2008 - 92%).  Across our UK businesses the recycling rate is 81% (2008 - 79%).
prosperity (economic issues)
Our main objective is to be a good corporate citizen and engage with the local communities in which we work.  We also 
aim to improve the capability of ISG and to communicate with our shareholders.
Our projects continue to participate with the voluntary Considerate Constructors schemes and in 2009 we won one 
gold, three silver and five bronze national awards.  Our project teams have participated in a number of initiatives 
including working with local schools and charities.
We have improved the group’s capability by investing in innovation and development to ensure that we remain efficient, 
effective and competitive to ensure our marketplace position.

Act 2006.
AuDITORS
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as the group’s auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting.
The notice of the Annual General Meeting is set out on page 107 .
Approved by the Board of directors and signed on behalf of the Board.

39 This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and has 
been approved by the Board and adopted for submission to the shareholders.  This report is unaudited, except where 
specified.  A resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held 
on 4 December 2009.
REMuNERATION COMMITTEE
The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were J L Jeremy (Chairman), M J Barnes and J R 
Stevenson.  The Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within existing terms of reference, on 
remuneration policy and determines, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for each of the executive 
directors.
REMuNERATION pOlIC y
The group’s policy is to provide executive remuneration packages which are designed to attract, motivate and retain 
directors of the high calibre required and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders without encouraging 
inappropriate risk taking.  The performance measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their 
annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Remuneration Committee consisting solely of non-executive 
directors.  The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the full Board.
In framing remuneration policy the Remuneration Committee has given full consideration to the requirements of the 
Combined Code appended to the Listing Rules of the London Stock Exchange.  
COMpONENTS OF REMuNERATION
The components of remuneration are:
basic salary and benefits determined by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed annually; (a) 
performance related bonuses; and (b) 
share option incentives. (c) 
The company operates an optional salary waiver arrangement which can result in pension contributions being made.
BASIC SAlAR y
An executive director’s basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial 
year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.  Following review it was agreed that there should be no 
increases in salaries for the executive and non-executive directors in July 2009.
BONuS pAyMENTS
In the year ended 30 June 2009, the directors received bonuses which reflected performance relating to the financial 
year ended 30 June 2008.  
For J C B Houlton and S D Lawther the performance criteria for the financial year ended 30 June 2008 included group 
profit based targets, completion of strategic objectives and non-financial elements such as a satisfactory health & 
safety record.  These targets were achieved.  Bonuses paid to J C B Houlton and S D Lawther represented 75% of their 
respective basic salaries.  Similar performance criteria applied for the financial year ended 30 June 2009, the maximum 
bonus payable again being up to 75% of basic salary.  Not all of the targets were achieved and therefore an accrual of 
50% of basic salary has been included in the accounts for the financial year ended 30 June 2009.
For G V Aldridge, who received a pro-rata bonus, the performance criteria for the six month period ended 30 June 2008 
included group profit based targets and completion of strategic objectives.  These targets were achieved.   The bonus 
paid represented 25% of basic salary.  Similar performance criteria applied for the financial year ended 30 June 2009, the 
maximum bonus payable being up to 50% of basic salary.  Not all of the targets were achieved and therefore an accrual 
of 20% of basic salary has been included in the accounts for the financial year ended 30 June 2009.
For I S Trotter the performance criteria for the financial year ended 30 June 2008 were based on profit targets for ISG 
InteriorExterior plc.  The targets were achieved.  The bonus paid represented 75% of basic salary.  
Report of the board to the shareholders on directors’ remuneration
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 SHARE OpTIONS
The Remuneration Committee approves the grant of options to executive directors under the group’s discretionary share 
option schemes.  In respect of share options, the following audited information also applies:
details of directors’ share options are included in the Directors’ Report on pages 34 to 39.  (a) 
all options granted to directors under the Unapproved Plan are subject to performance criteria relating (b) 
to growth in adjusted earnings per share which is calculated from the earnings attributable to ordinary 
shareholders after adjusting for amortisation of goodwill and the profit or loss on disposal of associates and 
subsidiaries.
In the year ended 30 June 2009, the performance criteria were set as follows:
In the Remuneration Committee’s opinion any share-based incentives should be linked to the interests of the 
shareholders and the principal measure of those interests is shareholder return.  The Remuneration Committee believes 
that an improvement in earnings per share should be reflected in future enhanced shareholder return.
Executive directors are also entitled to participate in the SAYE Scheme.

43 DIRECTORS’ CONTRACTS
None of the service contracts of executive directors includes provision for specific payment in the event of early 
termination, nor do they provide for extended notice periods in the event of a change in control.  It is not the 
Remuneration Committee’s intention to introduce such provisions.  If any existing contract of employment is breached 
by the company in the event of termination, the company would be liable to pay, as damages, an amount approximating 
to the net loss of salary and contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period.  The Remuneration Committee will 
seek to ensure that the director fulfils his obligation to mitigate his losses and will also give consideration to phased 
payments where appropriate.
Details of the service contracts of the executive directors are shown in the table below.
I S Trotter is not included in the above table as, since retiring on 30 June 2009 as a director of ISG plc, he has provided a 
supporting role to the group on a part time basis under revised terms and conditions.  The revised notice period is three 
months.  
With the approval of the Remuneration Committee, executive directors are entitled, under their service agreements, to 
perform duties outside the group and to receive fees for those duties.  Other than G V Aldridge, none of the directors 
received fees for duties performed outside the group during the year.  
NON-ExECuTIVE DIRECTORS
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board within the limits set out in the Articles of 
Association, and is based upon independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies.  The 
remuneration paid to each non-executive director in the year to 30 June 2009, shown below, was subject to Board 
approval.  Non-executive directors may be paid for professional services provided to the group, but cannot participate 
in the company’s share option schemes.  Non-executive directors do not have service contracts and are not eligible 
to join in any pension scheme operated by the group.  The letters of appointment for J L Jeremy, M J Barnes and J R 
Stevenson are for a one-year term and subject to prior termination on notice of three months either way, while the letter 
of appointment for R M Dantzic is for a one-year term with twelve months’ notice.

under the Restricted Share Scheme.  The number of shares awarded was based on a price of 223p per share being the 
average share price for the three business days preceding the date of the award.  Vesting of the award was subject to 
ISG InteriorExterior plc achieving a prescribed profit target.  I S Trotter was not required to pay for the award.  The market 
price on the date of vesting was 184p per share.

45 While the group is not subject to the provisions of the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance – June 2008 
(The Combined Code), the directors have decided to provide corporate governance disclosures.  The directors have also 
considered the guidance set out in Guidance on Audit Committees (The Smith Guidance).
Section 1 of the Combined Code, as appended to the Listing Rules, sets out Principles of Good Corporate Governance 
and Code provisions which are applicable to listed companies incorporated in Great Britain.
A narrative statement on how the company has applied the Principles and a statement explaining the extent to which 
the provisions in the Code have been complied with appear below.
NARRATIVE STATEMENT
Section 1 of the Code establishes 14 Principles of Good Governance which are split into the four areas described below.
DIRECTORS
The company is controlled through the Board of directors which comprises three executive (four during the financial 
year ended 30 June 2009) and four independent non-executive directors.  There is a separation of the roles and 
responsibilities of the Chairman and the Chief Executive.  As the Non-Executive Chairman is mainly responsible for the 
running of the Board, he has to ensure that all directors receive sufficient relevant information on financial, business and 
corporate issues prior to meetings.  The Chief Executive’s responsibilities focus on running the group’s businesses and 
implementing group strategy.  All directors are able to take independent professional advice in furtherance of their duties 
if necessary.
The Board has considered and confirmed the independence of its non-executive directors.  Although J L Jeremy has 
been a director of the company since 1995, the Board believes that he continues to be independent in character and 
judgement; he has extensive experience as a non-executive director in sectors other than construction and, furthermore, 
during his directorship the management team of the company has changed and, therefore, he is not considered to be 
too closely connected with the incumbent executive directors.
During the year there were eleven Board meetings, two Audit Committee meetings and five Remuneration Committee 
meetings.  Attendance by the directors was as follows:
The Chairman also regularly meets with the non-executive directors without the executive directors present to discuss 
the performance of the group and any other matters as they arise.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it which includes:
approval of annual budgets and corporate business plans •	
approval of contracts exceeding prescribed thresholds •	
acquisitions and disposals •	
approval of all capital expenditure projects not covered by budget •

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 It is responsible for overall group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital expenditure 
projects and consideration of significant financing matters.  It monitors the exposure to key business risks and 
reviews the strategic direction of individual trading subsidiaries, their codes of conduct, their annual budgets, their 
progress towards achievement of those budgets and their capital expenditure programmes.  The Board also considers 
environmental and employee issues and key appointments.  It ensures that all directors receive appropriate training on 
appointment and then subsequently as appropriate.  All directors, in accordance with the Code, will submit themselves 
for re-election at least once every three years.
The Board has two committees, the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee.  Details of the Remuneration 
Committee can be found in the Report of the Board to the Shareholders on Directors’ Remuneration on pages 40 to 
45.  The members of the Audit Committee are R M Dantzic (Chairman), J L Jeremy and J R Stevenson.  R M Dantzic 
is a qualified accountant, he has been a finance director of two public companies and he is considered to be the 
non-executive member of the Board with the most recent experience necessary for the role of Chairman of the Audit 
Committee.  
During the year, the Audit Committee of the Board:
meets regularly with the external auditors and executive directors attending by invitation to review the  (a) 
financial statements, the suitability of the accounting policies and financial reporting of the company, its 
internal management and financial controls and matters arising from the external auditors’ work;
approves the nature and extent of non-audit work undertaken by the external auditors; and (b) 
makes recommendations to the Board on these matters. (c) 
In forming their opinion of the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, the Audit Committee takes into 
account the safeguards operating within the external auditors and ensures that the level of audit fee is sufficient to 
enable them to fulfil their obligations in accordance with the audit Letter of Engagement.  Fees for non-audit work are 
reviewed by the Group Finance Director and then passed to the Audit Committee for approval.
The chairman of the Audit Committee makes a report to the Board following each Committee meeting and the Board 
receives the minutes of all Audit Committee meetings.
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference are available from the Secretary and will be available for inspection at the 
Annual General Meeting.
An evaluation of the Board, the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the individual directors was 
conducted during the year by the Chairman and the Secretary (and by the Senior Independent Director and the Secretary 
in the case of the Chairman’s evaluation) by means of questionnaires followed by meetings on a one to one basis to 
review the results.  The results of the evaluation were considered satisfactory and provided evidence of a healthy culture 
that encourages candid discussion and rigorous decision-making.
DIRECTORS’ REMuNERATION
The Remuneration Committee measures the performance of the executive directors and key members of senior 
management as a prelude to recommending their annual remuneration, bonus awards and awards of share options to 
the Board for final determination.  The report of the Board to the shareholders on directors’ remuneration is set out on 
pages 40 to 45.  The Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference are available from the Secretary and will be available 
for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
RElATIONS wITH SHAREHOlDERS
The Board encourages two way communication with both its institutional and private investors and responds quickly to 
all queries received.  The executive directors have met with analysts and institutional shareholders on a regular basis in 
the year ended 30 June 2009.  Non-executive directors are fully briefed by the executive directors on the views of major 
shareholders about the company and are available for meetings with major shareholders.  All shareholders have at least 
twenty working days’ notice of the Annual General Meeting at which all directors and Committee chairs are introduced 
and available for questions.
47 ACCOuNTABIlIT y AND AuDIT
Financial reporting
A review of the performance and financial position of the group is included in the Financial Review.  The Board uses 
this, together with the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Statement and the Directors’ Report on pages 34 to 
39, to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the company’s position and prospects.  The statement of 
directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements is described on page 50.
Internal control
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the group has been 
established and that process is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the revised version of Internal Control 
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code produced by the Turnbull working party.  Following the latest review, the 
significant risks faced by the group now total twenty nine, of which six are considered principal risks as described on 
page 36.  Steps continue to be taken to embed internal control and risk management further into the operations of the 
business and deal with areas of improvement coming to management and Board attention.  As part of this process, a 
Corporate Governance Manual setting out the principle business policies and procedures operating within the group has 
been produced and adopted by all businesses across the group.  Furthermore, a series of risk management seminars 
have been held for the group’s senior management.
The reporting systems include formal consideration of all significant business risks at the monthly Board meetings and 
are still subject to continuous review by the Board throughout the year.  The monthly management information includes 
key risk indicators with the emphasis on early warning systems.  Risk management principles are embedded within all 
significant projects.
The directors are responsible for the system of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness.  Such a system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide only 
reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key risk management activities are described under the following headings:
Strategic control •	
The Board reviews the group’s strategic plans each year and monitors progress throughout the year.  On a regular 
basis, the group’s significant risks are updated and appropriate control strategies and accountabilities are agreed. 
Allocation of responsibilities and control environment •	
The Board has set clear terms of reference for each of its committees and the group has an organisational structure 
with clearly defined and documented delegation of authority to executive management and reporting systems for 
financial results, risk exposure and control assessment.   
quality and integrity of personnel •	
The group is committed to competence and integrity of management and staff at all levels, through its values 
statement, comprehensive recruitment, training and appraisal programmes. 
Role of the executive directors •	
Day-to-day management of the group’s activities is delegated by the Board to the executive directors.  They monitor 
the effectiveness of the operating units in meeting group objectives and controlling major business risks and make 
recommendations to the Board. 
Risk management reporting and Board review •	
The Board has overall responsibility for identifying, evaluating and managing major business risks facing the group.  
It regularly reviews all operating unit assessments of business risk exposure and control, including compliance 
assessments, and determines appropriate action, taking into account the recommendations of the executive 
directors. 
Operating unit controls •	
Key controls over major business risks include reviews against performance indicators and exception reporting.  
Each operating unit’s senior management is responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing major business 
risks.  They make regular assessments of their exposure to major business risks and the extent to which these 
Corporate governance (continued)
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 risks are controlled, which are reported to the Board on a monthly basis. 
Financial control •	
The group has a comprehensive system for reporting financial results to the Board; each operating unit prepares 
monthly results with a comparison against budget.  The Board reviews these for the group as a whole and 
determines appropriate action. 
Internal audit •	 
While there is no dedicated internal audit function, internal audit resources are provided by the central functions 
which are considered sufficient by the group.  They support the risk management activities and help to identify key 
risk areas across the group.  Any significant issues are reported to the Board via monthly reports.  In particular, the 
Group Commercial Director’s role includes the implementation of, and the monitoring of adherence to, the group’s 
policies on key commercial issues, assisting in the validation of key commercial judgements taken, and ensuring 
that relevant training is provided for all key commercial staff as appropriate.   
Controls over central functions •	
A number of the group’s key functions, including treasury and taxation, are dealt with centrally.  Each function is 
required to report to the Board on a regular basis. 
IT systems •	
The group has established controls and procedures over the security of data held on computer systems and has 
put in place suitable disaster recovery arrangements.
An ongoing review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control for the year ended 30 June 2009 has been 
maintained and has taken account of any material developments since the year end.
COMplIANCE STATEMENT
Although not required to, the Board reports on compliance with the forty eight code provisions throughout the 
accounting period.  Save for the exception outlined below, the company has complied throughout the accounting period 
ended 30 June 2009 with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Code.  The exception to the Code was as follows:
A.4.1 The directors have not constituted a Nomination Committee because they consider that it is preferable for  
 elections to the Board to be dealt with by the Board as a whole.
49 DIRECTORS’ RESpONSIBIlITIES STATEMENT
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.  Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulations and have elected to prepare the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).  Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss 
of the company for that period.  
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; •	
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; •	
follow all applicable UK Accounting Standards; and •	
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company •	
will continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
properly select and apply accounting policies; •	
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and •	
understandable information; 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable •	
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
make an assessment of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. •	
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.  They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on 
the company’s website.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
RESpONSIBIl ITy STATEMENT 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and •	
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
the management report, which is incorporated into the directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development •	
and performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
By order of the Board

applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with sections 495 and 496 of the Companies Act 
2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume

the opinions we have formed.
RESpECTIVE RESpONSIBIlITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AuDITORS

financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  Our responsibility is to audit the group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
SCOpE OF THE AuDIT OF THE FINANCIAl STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  This includes 
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.

give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 30 June 2009 and of its profit for the year then ended; •

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or •	
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. •	
Although not required to do so, the directors have voluntarily chosen to make a corporate governance statement detailing the 
extent of their compliance with the June 2008 FRC Combined Code.  We reviewed: 
the directors’ statement in relation to going concern; and •	
the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June •

55 GENERAl INFORMATION 1. 
 
Interior Services Group plc is a company incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act 1985 and domiciled in the 
United Kingdom.  The address of the registered office is given on page 33.  The nature of the group’s operations and its 
principal activities are set out in the Principle Activities section of the Directors’ Report on pages 34 to 39. 
 
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling (GBP) because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the group operates.  Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 3. 
ADOpTION OF NEw AND REVISED STANDARDS 2. 
 
During the financial year, the following accounting standards and guidance were adopted by the group: 
 
IFRS 7  Financial Instruments: Disclosures (Amendment) – Reclassification of  Financial Instruments 
IAS 39  Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (Amendment) –  Reclassification of   
   Financial Instruments 
IFRIC 12  Service Concession Arrangements 
IFRIC 13  Customer Loyalty Programmes 
IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction 
 
The adoption of these Standards and Interpretations either had no impact on the financial statements or resulted in 
changes to presentation and disclosure only. 
 
IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’, was early adopted in 2009.  IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 ‘Segment reporting’ and requires a 
‘management approach’, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal 
reporting purposes.  This has resulted in an increase in the number of reportable segments presented.  In addition, the 
segments are reported in a manner that is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Board. 
 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations relevant to the 
group, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective.  In some cases 
these standards and guidance had not been endorsed by the European Union: 
 
IFRS 2  Share-based payment; effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
At 30 June 2009
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 ACCOuNTING pOlICIES 3. 
 
Basis of accounting 
The annual consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) adopted by the European Union, International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (“IFRIC”) Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.  
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.  This is discussed in the Director’s Report on 
page 34.   
 
The financial information set out in this report has been prepared under the historical cost convention.  The principal 
accounting policies adopted, all of which have been consistently applied, are set out below.  Areas involving a higher 
degree of judgement or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated 
financial statements are disclosed in Note 4. 
 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiaries 
and joint ventures.  Subsidiaries are entities over which the group has the power to control the financial and 
operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its activities and are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date on which control is transferred to the group and cease to be consolidated from the date 
on which control is transferred out of the group. 
 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies 
used into line with those used by other members of the group. 
 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided to 
external customers, net of trade discounts and excluding value added tax and similar sales based taxes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Construction and service contracts 
Margin on long term contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion and the final estimated margin, 
provided that the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.  The stage of completion is measured 
with reference to the proportion of the value of the contract at the reporting date against the total estimated value 
of the contract.   
 
Where the outcome of the construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the 
extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable.  Contract costs are recognised as 
expenses in the period in which they are incurred.   
 
Full provision is made for all known or expected losses on individual contracts immediately once such losses are 
foreseen.   
Revenue from construction contracts includes the amount initially agreed in the contract plus any variations in contract •	
work to the extent that it is probable that the variation will result in revenue that can be reliably measured (usually 
when instructions have been received from the client).  The revenue recognised reflects the value of the contract 
at the reporting date, with reference to a survey of work performed.  The value of work carried out during the year 
includes amounts which have not been invoiced;
Revenue from construction related service contracts is recognised in the income statement in the same proportion •	
as the stage of completion of the contract at the reporting date, the stage of completion having been assessed with 
reference to a survey of the work performed;
Interest income is accrued, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable; •	
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. •	
57 pensions 
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme.  The assets of the scheme are invested and managed 
independently of the finances of the company.  Contributions to the defined contribution pension schemes are charged to 
the profit and loss account as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the schemes. 
 
Business combinations 
Acquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the purchase method.  The cost of an acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and 
equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the 
business combination.  The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for 
recognition under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for 
non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Assets 
Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.   
 
The cost of business combinations include, where applicable, deferred consideration discounted at an appropriate rate of 
interest to its fair value at the effective date of combination. 
 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised. 
 
Under UK GAAP , goodwill was capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful economic life.  Under IFRS 3, goodwill 
has been assigned an indefinite life as at the date of transition and it is no longer amortised.  The group has elected to 
apply the exemption related to business combinations and has fixed its goodwill at its carrying value as at 1 July 2006 
when IFRS was adopted by the group.  All accumulated amortisation at this point in time has been reclassified against the 
cost of the goodwill.   
 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired.  Any impairment is recognised immediately in the profit or loss and is not subsequently 
reversed. 
 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated 
to each of the group’s cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the group are assigned to those units or 
groups of units. 
 
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or group of 
cash-generating units, to which the goodwill related.  Where an impairment test is performed a discounted cash flow 
analysis is carried out based on the cash flows of the cash-generating unit compared with the carrying value of that 
goodwill.  Management estimate the discount rates as the risk effected cost of capital for the particular cash-generating 
units.  If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment 
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of 
the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.   
 
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on 
disposal. 
3.   ACCOuNTING pOlICIES (continued)
represents the lowest level within the group at which the goodwill is monitored for •	
internal management purposes; and
is not larger than a segment based on either the group’s reporting format determined •	
in accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Intangible assets 
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is recognised separately from goodwill if the asset is 
separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and is based on its fair values as at the date of acquisition.  
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost and amortised over the estimated useful lives on a straight 
line basis.  Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be 
impaired.  The categories of intangible assets (all of which were acquired on acquisition of subsidiaries) and their estimated 
useful lives are as follows:  
 
Customer relationships  4-10 years 
Customer contracts  1-2 years 
 
property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost net of accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment 
loss.  Cost includes expenditure associated with bringing the asset into use. 
 
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of assets in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful economic 
lives of its assets.  The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
 
Short-leasehold property  Life of the lease 
Motor vehicles   4 years 
IT and office equipment  3-5 years 
 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, 
where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.  The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of 
property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and is recognised in profit or loss. 
 
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.  If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).  Where the 
asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use.  In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows 
have not been adjusted. 
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is 
recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the 
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. 
 
Investments in associates and joint ventures 
An associate is an entity over which the group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a 
joint venture.  Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee 
but is not control or joint control over those policies. 
 
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is 
subject to joint control that is when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities of the 
joint venture require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.  The arrangements the group has entered into 
involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest.    
 
Investment in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting; initially stated at cost 
and adjusted thereafter for subsequent changes in the group’s share of net assets less any impairment in the value of 
individual investments.  The group’s share of associates’ and joint ventures’ post-tax results are reported in the 
consolidated income statement and the net investments disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet. 
59 Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the associate and joint venture recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.   
 
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the 
investment.  Any excess of the group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
 
Inventories 
Inventories comprise stocks and property developments, which are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  
Cost, where appropriate, is determined using the first-in first-out method.  Net realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price less all estimated costs of completion.  Provision is made for foreseeable losses.   
 
leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee.  All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
 
Assets held under finance leases or hire purchase contracts are initially recognised as assets of the group at their fair 
value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.  The present value of 
future rentals is shown as a liability.  The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account 
over the period of the lease in proportion to the balance sheet repayments outstanding. 
 
Rentals under operating leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.   
 
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.  
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis. 
 
Own shares 
Own shares deducted in arriving at shareholders’ funds represent the cost of the company’s ordinary shares acquired by 
Interior Services Group Employee Trustees Limited in connection with the group’s employee share schemes. 
 
Share-based payments  
Charges for employee services received in exchange for share-based payments have been made for all options that were 
granted after 7 November 2002 and had not yet vested at 1 January 2005 in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based 
Payments’. 
 
Options granted under the group’s employee share schemes are equity settled and measured at fair value at the date of 
grant.  The fair value of such options has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model, based upon publicly available 
market data and based on the group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-
market based vesting conditions, and is expensed over the vesting period. 
 
T axation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
 
Current tax 
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.  Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.  The group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
 
Deferred tax 
Under IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’, deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.  Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 utilised.  Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit. 
 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  Deferred tax assets 
arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary 
differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability 
is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.  The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would 
follow from the manner in which the group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its 
assets and liabilities. 
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
 
Current and deferred tax for the period 
Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items 
credited or debited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where they arise from 
the initial accounting for a business combination.  In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into 
account in calculating goodwill or in determining the excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost. 
 
Financial assets 
Financial assets are recognised on the group’s balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised 
cost, less any impairment.   
 
In relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence that the group will not 
be able to collect all of the amounts due in accordance with the original terms of those receivables.  The carrying amount 
of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.  Impaired debts are derecognised when they are 
assessed as uncollectible. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and at hand and short-term highly-liquid investments that are readily 
convertible (with a maturity of three months or less) to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.   
 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the group’s cash management are included as a 
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement. 
 
Impairment of financial assets 
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.  Financial assets are impaired where 
there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial 
asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted. 
 
 
61 For financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include: 
 
 
 
 
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the 
exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision account. 
 
Derecognition of financial assets 
The group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets have expired 
or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.   If the group 
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred 
asset, the group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.  If 
the group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the group continues 
to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. 
 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into.   
 
Equity instruments 
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its 
liabilities.  Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
 
Financial guarantee contract liabilities 
Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured at the amount of the obligation under the contract, as determined in 
accordance with IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’. 
 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. 
 
Borrowings 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.  After initial 
recognition interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.  Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are 
accounted for on an accrual basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the 
carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
 
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the 
amortisation process. 
 
Finance costs  
Finance costs of debts are capitalised against the debt value on first drawdown of the debt and are recognised in the 
Income Statement using the effective interest rate method. 
 
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
A financial liability is derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. 
 
provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that the group will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. 
 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at 
the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.  Where a provision is

significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or •	
default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or •	
it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation. •	
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those 
cash flows. 
 
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, 
the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the 
receivable can be measured reliably. 
 
Onerous property contracts 
Provision for onerous lease commitments on property contracts is based on an estimate of the net unavoidable lease and 
other payments in respect of these properties.  These comprise rental and other property costs payable, plus any 
termination costs, less any income expected to be derived from the properties being sublet.  The provisions are discounted 
at an appropriate rate to take into account the time value of money. 
 
Foreign currencies  
The individual financial statements of each group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency).  For the purpose of the consolidated financial 
statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pound Sterling, which is the 
functional currency of the company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. 
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the group company’s functional currency (‘Sterling’) at the exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction.  Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.  Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value was determined. 
 
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different 
from those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they arise.  
Exchange differences on non-monetary items are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expenses to the 
extent that they relate to a gain or loss on that non-monetary item taken to the statement of recognised income and 
expenses, otherwise such gains and losses are recognised in the income statement. 
 
The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and related goodwill are translated into Sterling 
at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  Income and expenses are translated at the actual rate.  The 
exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries are taken directly to the 
“foreign currency translation reserve” in equity.  On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences 
(including, if applicable, gains and losses on related hedges) are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or 
loss on disposal.
CRITICAl ACCOu NTING Ju DGEMENTS AND k Ey SOu RCES OF ESTIMATION 4. 
u NCERTAINTy  
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the amount of income and revenue recognised in 
the period.  Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are discussed below.   
 
Revenue and profit/margin recognition 
The group’s revenue recognition and long term contracts policies are set out in Note 3 above.  These policies are central to 
the way in which the group values the work it has carried out at each reporting date and the estimation of the percentage 
completion of the contract.  These policies require forecasts to be made of the outcome of long-term construction and 
service contracts and require assessments and judgements to be made on the recovery of pre-contract costs, changes in 
work scopes, expected contract costs to complete and the progress on contract programmes.  The group has appropriate 
control procedures in place to ensure estimates are calculated on a consistent basis. 
 
 
63 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated.  The value in use calculation requires the directors to estimate the future cash flows expected 
to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.  Note 3 above and 
Note 14 details the assumptions that have been applied in assessing impairment of goodwill. 
 
T axation 
The group is subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions and judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision 
for income taxes.  The group provides for future liabilities in respect of uncertain tax positions where additional tax may 
become payable in future periods, and such provisions are based upon management’s assessment of exposures.   
 
As set out in Note 3 above, deferred tax is accounted for on temporary differences using the liability method, with 
deferred tax liabilities generally being provided for in full and deferred tax assets being recognised to the extent that it 
is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.  Note 27 
details the unused tax losses for which deferred tax assets have not been recognised and the undistributed reserves of 
subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been provided, together with the judgements which the group has 
made in respect of these matters.  These judgements may change in the future and they will be reviewed at each balance 
sheet date. 
 
Regulatory investigations 
Note 32 explains the risk in relation to ongoing investigations by the Office of Fair Trading into potential breaches of 
competition law in respect of certain group companies which occurred prior to ISG’s ownership.   
SEGMENTAl INFORMATION 5. 
 
Management have determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board that are used to make 
strategic decisions. 
 
The Board considers the business from both a geographic and a product perspective.  Geographically, management 
considers the performance of UK, Asia, Middle East and Europe.  The UK is further segregated by product into London, 
Regional Construction and Retail. 
 
Although the Asia, Europe and the Middle East segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by IFRS 8, 
management has concluded that this segment should be reported.  All are closely monitored by the Board as potential 
growth regions and are expected to materially contribute to group revenue in the future. 
 
The principal activities of each of these divisions are as follows: 
 
 
 
London - provision of new build, refurbishment and fit out services in London.
Regional Construction - provision of new build, refurbishment and fit out services in UK outside London.
Retail - provision of retail and leisure fit out and refurbishment services in UK.
Asia - provision of fit out, refurbishment, project management and commissioning management 
services in Asia.
Middle East - provision of fit out, refurbishment and project management services in the Middle East, 
including Al Habtoor-ISG joint venture.
Europe - provision of fit out services in Europe, mainly France, Switzerland and Germany.
Other
-
consists of the group’s discontinued activity in property development.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 The segmental information provided to the Board for the reportable segments for the years ended 30 June 2009 and 30 
June 2008 is as follows: 
 
a.  Volumes and revenue analysis 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Volumes includes revenue of the group plus the value of work undertaken on construction management contracts 
undertaken by the group and the group’s share of associates’ and joint ventures’ revenue.   
 
The revenue disclosed is from external customers and is reported to the Board in a manner consistent with that in the 
income statement. 
 
The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on an operating profit margin and profit before tax 
measure.  This measurement basis excludes the effects of the cost of acquisition finance, the amortisation of intangible 
assets and group activities.  Group activities specifically relate to head office and holding company costs.  The operating 
profit margin has been calculated as operating profit over revenue.

73 In accordance with IAS 10, dividends are accounted for in the period in which they are paid and approved by the 
shareholders.  Accordingly the final dividend proposed in respect of the year ended 30 June 2009 has not been included 
as a liability as at 30 June 2009.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares during the year, determined in accordance with the provisions of IAS 33 ‘Earnings 
per share’.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the 
assumption of conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.   The group has only one category of dilutive potential 
ordinary shares, being share options granted where the exercise price is less than the average price of the company’s 
ordinary shares during the year.
Adjusted basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributed to ordinary shareholders,  
pre-amortisation of intangible assets and before significant non-recurring items such as the profit/loss on disposal of 
associates and subsidiaries and one off releases of tax provisions, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
during the year.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to five groups of cash-generating units (“CGUs”) identified 
according to operating segments, being London, Regional Construction, Retail, Asia and Europe.  The allocation of 
goodwill is dependent on the CGU that is expected to benefit from the business combination.  Details on the split of the 
goodwill balance across these CGUs are given in Note 5.
The group tests goodwill bi-annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be 
impaired.  The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.  The key assumptions 
for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates for the period.  Management 
estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the business, giving a discount rate of 10.07%.  The group discount rate is applied to all CGUs.  The 
growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and long-term growth in gross domestic product.  
The group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for 
the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of 2.25%.  The 
rate used in the calculation does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.  
At 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2008, the carrying amounts of goodwill for CGUs were tested for impairment and deemed 
not to be impaired.  Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the discount rate (varying between 10% and 15%) and 
growth rate (0% to 2.25%) with the conclusion that no reasonably probable changes in key assumptions would cause 
the recoverable amount to be less than the carrying amount.   
Acquisitions
In the year ended 30 June 2008 the group completed the acquisitions of ISG Europe SAS and ISG Pearce Holdings Ltd.  
Fair value adjustments have been finalised in accordance with IFRS 3.  The final acquisition balance sheet and related fair 
value adjustments are consolidated in the balance sheet of these financial statements.  
ISG Pearce Holdings Ltd has had fair value adjustments made to property, plant and equipment, trade and other 
receivables, trade and other payables and deferred tax due to revaluations of initially determined amounts, 
reclassifications and the tax effects of these adjustments.  Deferred consideration balances have crystallised in the 
period and as a result of ISG Pearce Holdings Ltd meeting their performance conditions specified in the purchase 
agreement further amounts were payable.  This has had the effect of increasing the goodwill on acquisition.
The deferred consideration has crystallised in ISG Europe SAS as at 30 June 2009.  Performance conditions set within 
the purchase agreement have not been met and thus the level of deferred consideration has been reduced accordingly.  
This has resulted in a decrease in the value of goodwill for the acquisition.  
There is £4,555,000 of deferred consideration payable on the acquisitions as at 30 June 2009 to be fulfilled in cash of 
£2,055,000 and shares worth £2,500,000.  The amounts are payable in September 2009.

The group has different provision policies for its various divisions which have been determined by references to past 
default experience and specific provisions are raised after taking an individual view to debts recoverability.  
Due to the nature of the group’s operations, it is normal practise for customers to hold retentions in respect to contracts 
completed.  Retentions held by customers as at 30 June 2009 were £46,811,000 (2008 - £50,760,000).

24.   FINANCIAl INSTRuMENTS
 
The group has two principal bank loans: 
 
(a) a loan of £2.4m (2008 - £4.4m).  The loan was taken out on 28 September 2005.  Repayments commenced on 28 December 2005 and will continue until 28 
September 2010.  The loan carries a variable interest rate of 1 .91% as at 30 June 2009. 
 
(b) a loan of £16.0m (2008 - £20.0m), which was drawn down between May 2007 and May 2008.  Repayments commenced on 22 February 2009 and are scheduled 
to continue until 24 May 2013.  The loan carries a variable interest rate of 1 .91% as at 30 June 2009. 
 
Bank covenants include total interest cover, net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and total debtors to total utilisation.  There have 
been no breaches of bank covenants during all periods.  The bank loans are guaranteed by material subsidiaries of the group by way of a debenture.  The group does 
not have any of its property and equipment pledged as security over bank loans. 
The £950,000 of loan notes (2008 - £950,000) were payable to the vendors of ISG Cathedral and were redeemable semi-annually at the company’s option, up to July 
2009 when the remaining balance was paid.  Interest was payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 7%.  The £18,000 loan notes included in the prior year balance 
were settled during the year and were payable to certain vendors of ISG Pearce Holdings Ltd.  
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Capital risk management 
The Board is responsible for overall group strategy, acquisition and divestment policy, approval of major capital 
expenditure projects and consideration of significant financing matters.  The Board manages its capital to ensure that 
entities in the group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders as well as 
sustaining the future development of the business.
The capital structure of the group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 23, cash and 
cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of ISG plc, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained 
earnings as disclosed in Note 29.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.  
The group’s overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from 2008.
Categories of financial instruments
Fair value of financial instruments
The directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost 
in the financial statements approximate to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments or because they 
bear interest at rates approximate to the market.

83 Financial risk management
The group’s activities expose it to a variety of risks, the key risks identified being:
Market risk •	
Credit risk •	
Foreign currency risk •	
Liquidity risk •	
Interest rate risk •	
This note presents information about the group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the group’s objectives, policies 
and procedures for measuring and managing risk.  Please refer also to the principal business risks in the Directors’ 
Report on pages 34 to 39 and also the Corporate Governance statement on page 46.      
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect 
the group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.  The objective of market risk management is to 
manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes 
in interest rates.  The Board reviewed and agreed the policy for managing interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
and the potential impact of any significant economic changes are discussed at monthly Board meetings.  Refer to both 
foreign currency risk and interest rate risk headings below.
The group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the 
group.  The group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk 
of financial loss from defaults.  
The group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, prepayments and 
accrued income, which represent the group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.  The amounts presented in the 
consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the group’s management based 
on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. 
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by 
international credit-rating agencies such as Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch.  No credit exposure is permitted 
to a financial institution with a rating lower then A+ or equivalent.  The group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its 
counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst 
approved financial institutions.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas and the group’s 
exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.  The demographics of the 
group’s customer base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate, has less of an 
influence on credit risk.
The group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties 
having similar characteristics.  The group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related 
entities.  
The group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of 
trade and other receivables and investments when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.  The main 
components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a 
24.   FINANCIAl INSTRuMENTS (continued)
  
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not 
yet identified.  The collective loss allowance is determined by references to past default experience and historical data of 
payment statistics for similar financial assets.  
Before accepting any new customer, the group runs credit checks to assess the potential customer’s credit quality.  The 
company monitors exposure to individual clients and all customers are subject to standard terms of payment for each 
division.  
Ageing of trade receivables:
Trade receivables that are less than three months past due for payment are generally not considered impaired.  Included 
in the group’s trade receivables are debtors with a carrying amount of £9,180,000 (2008 - £4,401,000) which are past 
due at the reporting date for which the group has not made provision as there has not been a significant change in the 
credit quality and the amounts are considered recoverable.  The group does not hold any collateral over these balances.  
Movement in the provision for impairment:
Foreign currency risk
The group has international operations and is exposed primarily to the Euro (“EUR”) and Singapore Dollars (“SGD”), 
hence exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.  The main risk is from net investments in foreign operations, 
recognised assets and liabilities and future trading transactions.  
 
The current level of foreign business is approximately 16% (2008 - 26%) of the group’s trading operating profit before 
group activities as presented in Note 5.  
The group monitors the net balance sheet exposure to foreign currency movements and would consider hedging against 
any material exposure arising.  
During the year hedging instruments of €7 .5m were entered into to cover exchange rate fluctuations on the group’s 
European earnings.  All instruments were repaid before 30 June 2009 and as such none existed at the balance sheet 
date.  The accounting treatment of exchange gains and losses relating to foreign activities is described in Note 3.
During the year the group made a decision not to hedge any exposure to fluctuations in the value of the Singapore Dollar 
against the British Pound since it believed that it would not be in the interests of the business.

Foreign currency risk (continued)
Foreign exchange risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the Finance Department and the Board and if considered 
necessary a strategy to minimise any potential risk will be discussed and implemented.  Significant foreign exchange 
movements are also reviewed by the Board and the process of reviewing different options is undertaken on a quarterly 
basis.  Hedging arrangements are being put in place for the next financial year.  
The carrying amounts of the group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the 
reporting date are as follows: 
The group is mainly exposed to the Euro and Singapore dollars.  A 10% increase/decrease in the GBP against the SGD 
has a circa £119,000 (2008 - £177 ,000) impact on trading operating profits and a 10% increase/decrease in the GBP 
against the EUR has a circa £228,000 (2008 - £308,000) impact on trading operating profits.  This analysis assumes all 
other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.  
 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.  Responsibility for 
liquidity risk management rests with the Board of directors.  The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate 
reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring bank covenant compliance, 
forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.  Included in Note 23 is 
a description of the additional undrawn facility that the group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.   
Further details relevant to the group’s liquidity position and its status as a going concern are included within the 
Directors’ Report on page 34.
The group reviews its treasury position daily, placing surplus cash on short-term deposits.  A daily cash flow forecast for 
the next ten working days and a weekly cash flow forecast for the next twelve weeks are prepared on a weekly basis 
and reviewed at company and group level.  At each month end a twelve month cash flow is prepared by each company 
and submitted to group.  Minimum cleared cash levels have been imposed on each company and actual balances are 
monitored against the minimum levels on a daily basis.  In addition the top and bottom ten cash contracts by company 
are reviewed at company and group level on a monthly basis.

Under IFRS 7 contractual cash flows are undiscounted and include any related future interest payments and therefore may not 
agree with the carrying amounts in the balance sheet. 
Assumed no further issue of debt and interest rates based on conditions existing at reporting date.
87 Liquidity risk (continued)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument, will 
fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.  The group’s only interest-bearing asset is cash, which is invested in 
short-term deposits.
The group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowing funds at floating interest rates.  Borrowings issued 
at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.  The group manages interest rate risk on borrowings by 
ensuring access to diverse funding and through monitoring interest rate movements with weekly reports.  
Interest rate risk is reviewed on a regular basis and if considered necessary a strategy to minimise any potential risk 
through interest rate swaps is discussed and implemented.  Currently the effect of interest rate changes on net interest 
income and expense is immaterial to the group.  Risk arises on the variance between the Bank of England Base Rate 
and the LIBOR rate.  The group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed below.  
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the group’s profit 
for the year would increase or decrease by £110,992 (2008 - £226,141) in respect to exposure to the group’s borrowings.  
However this exposure is largely mitigated by cash balances held by the group throughout the year.

Under IFRS 7 contractual cash flows are undiscounted and include any related future interest payments and therefore may not 
agree with the carrying amounts in the balance sheet. 
Assumed no further issue of debt and interest rates based on conditions existing at reporting date.
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Included with accruals and deferred income is £433,000 (2008 - £383,000) of accruals for annual leave entitlements 
which were disclosed in the prior year as a provision.  See Note 26 for further details.
An analysis of the maturity of debt is given in Note 24.  
The group’s policy is to fix payment terms when agreeing the terms of each transaction.  It is the group’s general policy 
to pay suppliers according to the agreed terms and conditions, provided that the supplier has complied with those 
terms.  The group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit 
timeframe.  Therefore, under the normal course of business, the group is not charged interest on overdue payables
There are no suppliers who represent more than 10% of the total balance of trade creditors in either 2009 or 2008.
Deferred consideration of £4,555,000 is payable on the acquisitions as at 30 June 2009 to be fulfilled in cash of 
£2,055,000 and shares worth £2,500,000.  The amounts are payable in September 2009.

this better reflects the nature of the balance.  
Onerous lease provisions comprise the net present value of the estimated future costs of vacant properties.  The 
provision is expected to be utilised in the next two years.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.  The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances 
(after offset) for financial reporting purposes:
At the balance sheet date, there were unused tax losses of approximately £18.5m (2008 - £21 .3m) which are available 
for offset against future profits.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £5,506,000 (2008 - £4,676,000) in respect of tax losses in certain 
companies, which has not been recognised in these accounts as the timing of the recoverability of this is considered 
uncertain, these may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been 
recognised was £4.4m (2008 - £3.6m).  No liability has been recognised in respect of these earnings because either 
the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  Where it is probable that they will reverse no additional UK tax is 
expected.
The total authorised number of ordinary shares is 100 million shares (2008 - 100 million) with a par value of 1p per share 
(2008 - 1p per share).  All issued shares are fully paid.  The company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no 
right to fixed income.
The number of shares in issue at the balance sheet date included 1,614,487 shares held by the Interior Services Group 
Employee Share Trust (2008 - 1,466,517), see Note 29.

1p shares in the company at a cost of £3,854,000 (2008 - £3,634,000) and a market value of £2,163,410 (2008 -

been waived.  The Board does not consider the decrease in value of the shares to be a permanent diminution in value 
and as such they have not been written down.
At 30 June 2009, the group owns 5.2% (2008 - 4.9%) of its own called up share capital.
The foreign currency reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the goodwill and other intangibles

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 The Black-Scholes model has been used to estimate the fair value of the options with the following assumptions:
The expected volatility was assumed to be equal to historic volatility of the company’s share price over the period prior 
to grant.
There are group cross guarantees from the company for all monies due to certain of the group’s banks and surety 
lenders.  No monies were outstanding at 30 June 2009 (2008 - nil).  In the normal course of business there are 
contingent liabilities including the provision of bonds in respect of completed and uncompleted contracts.
As reported in last year’s financial statements, in March 2006 the Office of Fair Trading (“OFT”) visited the offices of 
Totty Construction, a subsidiary of the Propencity Group, along with many other construction companies, in relation 
to potential breaches of competition law in earlier years prior to ISG’s ownership.  As reported in the prior year the 
Propencity Group entered into a leniency agreement with the OFT in respect of the alleged infringements and has 
submitted a response to the OFT’s Statement of Objections.  Similarly Pearce Construction (Midlands) Limited, a 
subsidiary of the Pearce Group, was issued with a Statement of Objections by the OFT .  The business is defending its 
position and the group has received an indemnity from the vendors of the Pearce Group, which will serve to mitigate 
risk in this matter.  The group remains unable to estimate the size of any potential liability and as a result no provision has 
been made in these accounts.
Transactions between the company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation 
and are not disclosed in this note.  There have been no material transactions between the group and its associates or 
joint ventures during the year, other than disclosed in Note 18.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Independent auditors’ report to the members of Interior Services Group plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Interior Services Group plc for the year ended 30 June 
2009 which comprise the Company Balance Sheet and the related Notes 36 to 44.  The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with sections 495, 496 and 497 of the 
Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  Our responsibility 
is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland).  Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error.  This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June 2009; •	
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and •	
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. •	
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the •	
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 that would have applied were the company a quoted company; and
the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared •	
is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not •	
been received from branches not visited by us; or
the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or •	
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or •	
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. •	
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Interior Services Group plc for the year ended 30 June 
2009.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Notes to the company financial statements
 
The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.  As permitted 
by that Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom accounting 
standards.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.  Whilst the consolidated financial statements 
are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, the principal accounting policies adopted 
are the same as those set out in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements insofar as they are material to the 
parent company financial statements.  
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
The company is included within the consolidated financial statements of Interior Services Group plc, which are publicly 
available.  Consequently, the company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement 
under the terms of FRS 1 (revised 1996) ‘Cash Flow Statements’.
The company has taken advantage of section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006 and has not presented its own profit 
and loss account.  The profit for the year included within the financial statements of the parent company is £1,281,000 
(2008 - £4,017 ,000).
The company does not have any of its property and equipment pledged as security over bank loans.

105 As at 30 June 2009, the parent company held 513,634 (2008 - 290,000) ordinary 1p shares in the company at a cost of 
£1,143,000 (2008 - £786,000) and a market value of £688,270 (2008 - £478,500).  These shares have not been allocated 
to individuals and accordingly, dividends on these shares have been waived.  The company does not consider the 
decrease in the value of the shares to be a permanent diminution in value and as such they have not been written down.  
Other reserves are unrealised.  Of the opening balance, £49,500,000 arose from the sale of ISG InteriorExterior plc to 
Interior Services Group (UK Holdings) Ltd.  
 
During the year a loan restructuring exercise was undertaken to rationalise the inter-company loans with the UK tax 
resident group in order to ensure that the group’s cash is managed effectively and funding is available where required.  
Further to a payment of £20,000,000 from Interior Services Group (UK Holdings) Ltd, this amount of previously 
unrealised reserves has been realised in the current year and transferred to the profit and loss account.
All amounts within the profit and loss account are distributable reserves.

Notes to the notice of the meeting 
A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy to 1 . 
exercise all or any of his rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting on his behalf.  A shareholder may

a shareholder of the Company.  A proxy form which may be used to make such appointment and give proxy 
instructions accompanies this notice. 
To be effective, the instrument appointing a proxy and any authority under which it is executed (or a notarially 2. 
certified copy of such authority) must be deposited at the office of the registrars, Capita IRG plc (Proxies), 
PO Box 25, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the meeting or 
any adjournment thereof.  Completion and return of the form of proxy will not preclude shareholders from 
attending and voting in person at the meeting. 
Copies of all directors’ service contracts, or where any such contract is not reduced to writing, a memorandum 3. 
of the terms thereof are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal 
business hours (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excluded).

register made after this time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and/or vote 
at the Annual General Meeting. 
the Articles of Association of the Company be amended by deleting all the provisions of the (a) 
Company’s Memorandum of Association which, by virtue of section 28 Companies Act 2006, are to 
be treated as provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association; and
the amendments to the Articles of Association as shown in the document produced to the meeting (b) 
(for the purpose of identification marked “ A ” and signed by the Chairman of the meeting) be 
approved and the Articles of Association be so amended with effect from the termination of this 
meeting. 
109 Explanatory notes on the resolutions
Resolutions 1 to 10 are ordinary resolutions.  These resolutions will be passed if more than 50% of the votes cast 
for or against the resolution are in favour.
Resolutions 1 and 2 - Receiving the audited accounts and associated reports
The Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) requires that for each financial year, the directors present the Company’s accounts, 
the directors’ report and the auditors’ report before the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders of the Company.  
The directors are also seeking approval of the directors’ report to the shareholders on directors’ remuneration. 
Resolutions 3 and 4 - Reappointment of auditors and authority to determine auditors’ remuneration 
The Act requires that the Company shall, at each general meeting at which accounts are presented, appoint an auditor 
or auditors to hold office from the conclusion of that meeting until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which 
accounts are presented.  Accordingly, the directors propose to reappoint the Company’s auditors, Deloitte LLP , as the 
auditors of the Company and the directors are also seeking shareholder approval to fix the amount of their fees.  
Resolution 5 – Declaration of a Final Dividend
The directors are recommending a final dividend of 9.66 pence per ordinary share of 1 pence, payable on 7 December 
2009 to holders on the register as at 6.00pm on 6 November 2009.  The final dividend will not be paid without 
shareholder approval and its amount may not exceed the amount recommended by the directors.
Resolutions 6 and 7 - Reappointment of directors
Article 95 of the Company’s articles of association requires that directors shall retire from office at the Annual General 
Meeting unless they have been reappointed as a director at either of the last two annual general meetings.  Article 96 
states that directors retiring in accordance with Article 96 shall be eligible for re-election.  Accordingly, J C B Houlton is 
retiring and is seeking re-election.  
J L Jeremy is retiring (due to his length of service he retires at each annual general meeting) and is also seeking re-
election.   
Directors seeking re-election
J C B Houlton joined ISG as Group Financial Director in 2006 taking responsibility for all areas of finance, strategy and 
investor relations, whilst leading and providing direction for the finance, accounting and IT functions of ISG across 
the UK, Europe and Asia.  He also oversees all financial procedures, group reporting, performance and analysis.  After 
six years spent with Arthur Anderson where he qualified as a Chartered Accountant, he has held a number of senior 
financial positions in the construction and building material industries, most recently at Wates Group Limited.  He is 
Treasurer and a trustee of St.  Christopher’s Hospice.  
J L Jeremy has been a non-executive director of the Company since 1995.  He is a former merchant banker and he is an 
Associate of the Institute of Financial Services.  He has run his own consultancy business since 1993.  He is Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee, a member of the Audit Committee and is also the Senior Independent Director.  Due to 
his length of service with the Company the Board agreed that he should submit himself for re-election every year from 
2007 onwards.
Resolution 8 - Authority to allot shares and securities
The Act provides that the directors may only allot shares if authorised by shareholders to do so.  At the Annual General 
Meeting, shareholders will be asked to renew the directors’ authority to allot new shares, to grant options to subscribe 
for new shares and to issue securities that are convertible into new shares under section 551 of the Act.  This authority 
will be limited to an aggregate nominal amount of £207 ,004, which represents approximately two thirds of the current 
issued ordinary share capital.  As provided in paragraph (a) of the resolution, up to half of this authority (equal to one-
third of the issued share capital of the Company) will enable directors to allot and issue new shares, to grant options 
to subscribe for new shares and to issue securities that are convertible into new shares, in whatever manner they see 
fit (subject to relevant pre-emption rights).  Paragraph (b) of the resolution provides that the remainder of the authority 
(equal to a further one-third) may only be used in connection with a rights issue or other pre-emptive offer or issue in 
favour of ordinary shareholders.  As paragraph (a) imposes no restrictions on the way the authority may be exercised, it 
could be used in conjunction with paragraph (b) so as to enable the whole two-thirds authority to be used in connection 
with a rights issue.  This accords with guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers in December 2008.
Notice of annual general meeting (continued)
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 The authority will expire at the earlier of the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company and the date 
falling 15 months after the passing of this resolution.  
Passing this resolution will give the directors flexibility to act in the best interests of shareholders, when opportunities 
arise, by issuing new shares.  The directors have no present intention of exercising this authority except in connection 
with the employee share schemes of the Company.
Resolution 9 – Adoption of New RSS
The Company adopted a long-term incentive plan, the Interior Services Group Restricted Share Scheme (the “Existing 
Scheme”) on 25 February 2000.  No further awards may be granted under the Existing Scheme after 24 February 2010 
and, as the Board wishes to continue making long-term incentive awards to key executives, the Board wishes to adopt 
the New RSS as a replacement for the Existing Scheme.  The New RSS remains designed to aid in the retention and 
incentivisation of key employees, which is critical to the success of the Company.   
The rules of the New RSS are broadly in line with the Existing RSS except where amendments have been made to 
take account of changes in best practice and to reflect an increase from 10 per cent to 15 per cent in the maximum 
number of shares which may be issued under the Company’s employee share schemes in any ten year period.  While 
recognising that this departs from standard quoted company practice, the Board considers that the existing 10 per cent 
limit is insufficient for the Company’s incentivisation requirements.  The Company is currently very close to the present 
limit of 10 per cent for the issue of new shares over a ten year period.  The Other Employee Share Plans (referred to in 
the Notes to Resolution 10) together with the Existing Scheme, have made a valuable contribution to the commitment 
and motivation of the Group’s employees and the directors consider that it would be beneficial to the continued 
operation of all the share plans to allow further shares to be issued to meet the exercise of share options under the 
Other Employee Share Plans and vesting of awards under the Existing Scheme and New RSS.
 
As a company listed on AIM, the Company is not required to follow the ABI guidelines, which recommend a limit of 10 
per cent of the issued share capital, but seeks to do so where practicable.  Whilst the proposed increase of the limit to 
15 per cent would not be consistent with such requirements, the Board considers that the recruitment, retention and 
incentivisation of suitable staff is of significant importance and, therefore, considers the proposals to be in the best 
interests of shareholders.  While seeking a 15 per cent limit, the Board will monitor the potential share dilution caused 
by its employee share schemes carefully over the life of the schemes to ensure that dilution in excess of 10 per cent 
remains justified. 
A summary of the rules of the New RSS is set out in the Appendix to these Notes.
 
A copy of the draft rules of the New RSS will be available for inspection as noted on page 109 of this document.
Resolution 10 – Amendments to Other Employee Share Schemes
The rules of the Interior Services Group plc Approved Company Share Option Plan (the “CSOP”), the Interior Services 
Group plc Unapproved Company Share Option Plan (the “Unapproved Option Plan”) and the Interior Services Group plc 
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (the “SAYE Plan”) (together the “Other Employee Share Plans”) each provide 
that no more than ten per cent. (10%) of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital may be issued or issuable under 
employee share awards over any ten year period.
 
For the same reasons as set out in the Note to Resolution 9, it is intended to increase this limit to fifteen per cent.  
(15%).
A copy of the amended rules of the CSOP , Unapproved Option Plan and SAYE Plan will be available for inspection as 
noted on page 109 of this document.
 
Resolutions 11 to 13 are special resolutions.  These resolutions will be passed if more than 75% of the votes cast 
for or against the resolution are in favour.
Resolution 11 - Disapplication of pre-emptive rights
The Act requires that, if the Company issues new shares for cash or sells any treasury shares, it must first offer them 
to existing shareholders in proportion to their current holdings.  Shareholders will be asked to allow the directors, within 
limits, to allot equity securities and/or to sell equity securities held “in treasury” (if any) (see below for explanation of 
111 equity securities held “in treasury”) in the Company for cash without application of the pre-emptive rights provided 
by the Act up to a maximum aggregate nominal value of £31,051, which represents approximately 10 per cent.  of the 
current issued ordinary share capital of the Company.  The authority will expire at the same time as the authority to allot 
shares given under resolution 8.  There are no current plans to allot any shares except in connection with the employee 
share schemes of the Company.
Since 1 December 2003, companies have been allowed to purchase their own shares and hold them “in treasury” , rather 
than having to cancel them.  Treasury shares carry no right to attend or vote at meetings, or to receive dividends.  Nor 
will the shares confer any right to participate pre-emptively in new issues by the Company.  It is possible to hold treasury 
shares for later cash sale or for transfer for the purposes of, or pursuant to, an employees’ share scheme, or to cancel 
them at any time. 
The Company does not at present hold any shares in treasury.
Resolution 12 - Authority to purchase own shares
Resolution 12 is to authorise the Company to purchase (in accordance with its articles of association and within 
recommended best practice) its own shares in the market.  The authority prescribes the maximum and minimum prices 
to be paid, and, if passed, would expire at the same time as the authority to allot shares given under Resolution 8.
The authority would only be exercised if the directors were satisfied that such purchases might be expected to result 
in an increase in earnings per share for the remaining shareholders and were in the best interests of shareholders 
generally.
Shares purchased under the authority would be treated as cancelled (and the number of shares in issue reduced 
accordingly) or would be held as treasury shares, which may be re-sold, cancelled or transferred for the purposes of an 
employee share scheme.
As at the date of this Notice, the Company had 31,050,559 shares in issue.  Resolution 12 seeks authority to purchase a 
maximum of 3,105,056 shares, representing approximately 10 per cent. of its current issued share capital.
Resolution 13 – Amendments to the Articles of Association
(a) Deleting provisions of the Memorandum of Association (the “Memorandum”) from the Company’s Articles of 
Association (the “ Articles”)
The provisions regulating the operations of the Company are currently set out in the Company’s Memorandum and 
Articles.  The Company’s Memorandum contains, among other things, the objects clause which sets out the scope of 
the activities the Company is authorised to undertake.  This is drafted to give a wide scope.
The Act significantly reduces the constitutional significance of a company’s memorandum.  The Act provides that a 
memorandum will record only the names of subscribers and the number of shares each subscriber has agreed to 
take in the company.  Under the Act, the objects clause and all other provisions which are contained in a company’s 
memorandum, for companies existing at 1 October 2009, are deemed to be contained in the company’s articles but the 
company can remove these provisions by special resolution.  
Further, the Act states that, unless a company’s articles provide otherwise, a company’s objects are unrestricted.  This 
abolishes the need for companies to have objects clauses.  For this reason, the Company is proposing to remove its 
objects clause together with all other provisions of its Memorandum which, by virtue of the Act, are treated as forming 
part of the Company’s Articles as of 1 October 2009.  Resolution 13 (a) confirms the removal of these provisions for 
the Company.  As the effect of this resolution will be to remove the statement currently in the Memorandum regarding 
limited liability, it is proposed that the Articles should now also contain an express statement regarding the limited 
liability of shareholders (see below).
(b) Amending the Articles 
 
Adding a statement of limited liability in the Articles - article 2
 
As mentioned above, this statement will automatically be deleted from the Memorandum and be deemed added to 
the Articles from 1 October.  Since the clause will not appear in the actual Articles (unless amended), there is a risk 
Notice of annual general meeting (continued)
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 it may get left out of any future amendments to the Articles which would in effect remove it from the constitution 
of the Company and therefore many companies are expressly adding it to their articles now to prevent the omission 
happening. 
Authorised share capital and unissued shares - article 5
The Act abolishes the requirement for a company to have an authorised share capital and the Articles are to be updated 
to reflect this.   Directors will still be limited as to the number of shares they can at any time allot because allotment 
authority continues to be required under the Act, save in respect of employee share schemes.
Increase, consolidation, sub division and cancellation of shares - (deleted article 45); Reduction of capital - (deleted 
article 47); Purchase of own shares - article 47 
Under the law currently in force, a company requires specific enabling provisions in its articles to purchase its own 
shares, to consolidate or sub-divide its shares and to increase or reduce its share capital or other undistributable 
reserves, as well as shareholder authority to undertake the relevant action.  The Articles currently include these enabling 
provisions.  Under the Act, a company will only require shareholder authority to do any of these things and it will no 
longer be necessary for articles to contain enabling provisions.  Accordingly, the relevant enabling provisions have been 
removed from the Articles.  
Voting by proxies on a show of hands - article 77.4
 
The Shareholders’ Rights Regulations have amended the Act so that it now provides that each proxy appointed by a 
member has one vote on a show of hands unless the proxy is appointed by more than one member in which case the 
proxy has one vote for and one vote against if the proxy has been instructed by one or more members to vote for the 
resolution and by one or more members to vote against the resolution.  The Articles have been amended to reflect these 
changes.  
Change of name - article 92
 
Under the Companies Act 1985, a company could only change its name by special resolution; however, under the Act, a 
company will be able to change its name by other means provided for by its articles.  To take advantage of this provision, 
the Articles have been amended to enable the directors to pass a resolution to change the Company’s name.
 
Amending the terms on which directors retire when ill - article 101
The Articles currently specify the circumstances in which a director must vacate office.  These provisions have been 
updated to treat physical illness in the same manner as mental illness.    
 
Amending the terms on which notice of board meetings may be waived - article 106
 
Due to recent additions to the legislation, the terms on which notice of board meetings may be waived has been 
amended so as to conform with the language used in the “model” articles for public companies.
Abolition of the official seal for use abroad and alternative option for execution of documents -  article 116
Under the Companies Act 1985, a company required authority in its articles to have an official seal for use abroad; 
however, under the Act, such authority will no longer be required.  Accordingly, the relevant authorisation has been 
removed from the Articles.
The Articles now provide an alternative option for execution of documents (other than share certificates).  Under the 
Articles, when the seal is affixed to a document it may be signed by one authorised person in the presence of a witness, 
whereas previously the requirement was for signature by either a director and the Secretary or two directors or such 
other person or persons as the directors may approve.
113 AppENDIx
Summary of the principal T erms of the Interior Services Group Restricted Share Scheme 2009
Operation
The Remuneration Committee of the board of directors of the Company will supervise the operation of the New RSS.
The New RSS will allow the Remuneration Committee to:
allocate a given number of shares to an eligible employee (a “ (a) Fixed Share Allocation”);
allocate a variable number of shares which has a pre-set cash value (a “ (b) Cash-linked Share Allocation”); 
allocate a pre-set cash value (a “ (c) Cash Allocation”); or
allocate a combination of a Fixed Share Allocation, Cash-linked Share Allocation and/ or Cash Allocation in such  (d) 
 proportion as the Remuneration Committee determines to eligible employees (together “Allocations”).   
Eligibility
Any employee (including an executive director) of the Company or any subsidiary will be eligible to participate in the New 
RSS at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
Grant of Allocations
The Remuneration Committee may grant Allocations within 42 days following the Company’s announcement of results 
for any period.  The Remuneration Committee may also grant Allocations within 42 days of shareholder approval of the 
New RSS or at any other time when the Remuneration Committee considers there are circumstances which justify 
making an Allocation at that time.  
Allocations may not be granted more than ten years after the New RSS is adopted.   
Individual participation
An employee may not normally receive a Fixed Share Allocation in any financial year over newly-issued shares which 
has a value – determined by reference to the market value of the shares over which the Allocation has been made (as 
at the date of grant of the Allocation) when aggregated with the value of shares over which he holds subsisting options 
(apart from under a Revenue-approved savings-related share option or share incentive plan) – which exceeds two times 
his salary and other relevant earnings in that financial year or the previous financial year (whichever gives the greater 
amount).  However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to make grants above this level.
Overall limit
The New RSS may operate over newly issued shares or shares purchased in the market.
In any ten calendar year period, the Company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) more than 15 per cent.  of the 
issued ordinary share capital of the Company under the New RSS and any other employee share plan adopted by the 
Company.  The use of treasury shares will count as an issue of shares unless and until institutional guidelines treat them 
otherwise.
performance conditions 
Participants do not, other than in the circumstances described below, have any rights over the shares or cash comprising 
their Allocation unless and until, at the end of a restricted period of at least three years, the relevant performance 
conditions have been satisfied.  These performance conditions are fixed by the Remuneration Committee prior to 
the Allocation being made and communicated to participants at the date of grant of the Allocation.  Only upon these 
performance conditions being satisfied at the end of the restricted period do the shares or cash represented by a 
participant’s Allocation actually become vested in the participant.   
Subject only to any possible restrictions described under “Retention Period” below, the participant will become the 
beneficial owner of the shares, or become entitled to a cash equivalent upon vesting.
Notice of annual general meeting (continued)
Annual Report and Accounts 2009 The Remuneration Committee may vary the performance conditions applying to existing Allocations if: 
 an event has occurred which, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, causes the performance (a) 
condition to cease to be appropriate in which case the Remuneration Committee may vary or waive the 
performance condition so that any new condition is, in its opinion fair and reasonable and no more difficult to 
satisfy than the previous performance condition;
the Remuneration Committee considers that the Allocation to which the amended performance condition (b) 
applies will or is likely to become a fairer and more effective incentive for the participant; and/or
 the New RSS will or is likely to become fairer and more effective in its aim to reward participants by reference (c) 
to their respective contributions to the Company’s prosperity. 
Retention period
Some or all of a participant’s shares or the cash value of their Allocation may be held by the trustees of an employee 
benefit trust established by the Company for a further period of two years after vesting, until he ceases to be employed 
by the Company or there is a change of control of the Company, whichever is the earlier.  
leaving employment
Following a participant’s death, retirement, termination of employment due to accidental injury, disability or sickness 
or other special circumstances (at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee), the Remuneration Committee may 
allow participants either to retain their Allocations for the remainder of the restricted period or to have a vested right to 
some or all of the shares over which an Allocation was made to the participant (in such number as is just and equitable, 
having regard to the length of restricted period which remains and the Company’s then progress toward achieving the 
performance conditions set).  
Corporate events
Where a change of control of the Company occurs during the restricted period, Allocations will vest immediately as to 
33.3% of the shares or cash over which the Allocation has been made or such different proportion as the Remuneration 
Committee may determine.  Any remaining proportion of the Allocation will be forfeited.     
Where there is a change of control of the Company, the acquiring company and the participant may agree that the 
existing Allocation be released in consideration for a new Allocation granted by the acquiring company on such terms 
as are agreed with the acquiring company.  If an internal reorganisation occurs, the Remuneration Committee may 
determine that existing Allocations are automatically exchanged for new Allocations granted by the acquiring company.
 
If a demerger occurs, Allocations will not automatically vest and the extent to which (if any) they do vest and the future 
terms of the Allocations (including any voluntary or compulsory exchange of Allocations) will be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee.
Variation of share capital
If a variation of share capital, special dividend or other similar event is proposed, the Remuneration Committee may 
adjust an Allocation as it considers appropriate.
participants’ rights
An allocation is personal to the participant and may not be transferred, except to his personal representatives on his 
death.  No payment is required for an Allocation.   
Allocations will not confer any shareholder rights until the Allocation (assuming it is a Fixed Share Allocation or Cash-
linked Share Allocation which is satisfied in shares) has vested and the participant has received his shares.
Dividends
The Remuneration Committee may decide that participants will receive a payment (in cash and/or shares) on or shortly 
following the vesting of a Fixed Share Allocation or Cash-linked Share Allocation, of an amount relating to the dividends 
which would have been paid on those shares between the time when the Allocations were granted and the time when 
they vest.
115 Rights attaching to shares
Any shares issued when an Allocation vests will rank equally with shares then in issue (except for rights arising by 
reference to a record date prior to their allotment).
Alterations to the New RSS
The Board may amend the New RSS at any time in any way, which does not affect adversely existing Allocations 
(although majority participant approval is required for amendments which are to the disadvantage of participants).  An 
amendment of the New RSS to the advantage of participants may not occur without the prior approval of shareholders 
in general meeting (except for minor amendments to take account of a change in legislation or to maintain or obtain 
favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for any participant, the Company or its subsidiaries).
The Company may terminate the New RSS at any time but without prejudice to the terms of outstanding Allocations.
Overseas plans
The shareholder resolution to approve the New RSS will allow the Board to establish further plans for overseas 
territories, any such plan to be similar to the New RSS, but modified to take account of local tax, exchange control or 
securities laws, provided that any shares and awards made available under such further plans are treated as counting 
against the limits on individual and overall participation in the New RSS.

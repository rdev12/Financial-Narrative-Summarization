our s Tr aTegy
THE TOPPS’ STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING OUTSTANDING 
VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO ENSURE THEY ALWAYS “RETURN AND 
RECOMMEND”. THIS HAS ENABLED US TO INCREASE OUR COMPETITIVE 
ADVANTAGE, BY FURTHER INCREASING MARKET SHARE; BUILT UPON 
THE STRONG FOUNDATIONS OF CusTo Mer serViCe, Produ CT 
offer AND lo CaTional C o n Venien Ce. 
ou TsTanding Value
When these three key elements of our business are combined we believe we offer outstanding  
value. Our existing customers satisfaction surveys are the best possible validation of this and their 
recommendations are an important source of future growth for the business. Over the past year, 88.1% 
of our customers have told us that they would recommend us to friends and family, something we are 
incredibly proud of.
Produ CT offer
As a specialist we are able to offer  
a huge range of products with many 
of them in stock and available to  
take away. Many of our key lines  
are imported directly from factories 
all over the world which ensures  
that we can offer the very latest 
tastes and trends to our customers, 
often on an exclusive basis.
lo CaTional 
Co n Venien Ce
We have over 300 locations 
nationwide in easily accessible, 
highly visible locations, all with 
customer parking; thereby ensuring 
that the majority of the UK population 
have a store near them. In addition 
our website allows customers to 
review our range in advance, either 
purchasing directly online or visiting 
a store to discuss their project and 
benefit from our exceptional 
customer service.
CusTo Mer serViCe 
Customer service remains our 
number one priority and it is our 
policy to be honest, helpful and 
knowledgeable but never pushy.  
We invest extensively in training  
to ensure our staff have the best 
product knowledge in the industry. 
We mystery shop the customer 
experience in all our stores every 
month and encourage all customers 
to complete a satisfaction survey.

Chair Man’s sTaTeMenT
Our Business
Our expectation for the year was that it would again be 
tough for retailers in our sector and that proved to be the 
case. Nevertheless, we were encouraged by our first 
half performance, which saw overall revenues grow by 
1.8% on a like-for-like basis. However, as we progressed 
through the second half the combined effects of a 
deteriorating economic outlook, stagnation in the housing 
market and falls in domestic purchasing power further 
undermined consumer confidence. Inevitably this has 
had a negative impact on our business and like-for-like 
revenues were down 2.0%. Total revenue for the 
financial period was £175.5 million with adjusted profit 
before tax
2
 of £13.9 million, down from £16.3 million in 
the prior period. Notwithstanding this difficult trading 
backdrop our gross margin remained robust at 59.6% 
(2010: 58.7%).
In our previous Annual Report we committed ourselves 
to prudent cost management, further investment in key 
infrastructure and a targeted growth in our store estate. 
Good progress has been made against all of these 
objectives, enabling the Group to:
 a Grow the store estate to 320 by the period end, 
up from 312
 a Convert five Tile Clearing House sites to the more 
profitable Topps format
 a Complete our new warehouse, enabling a longer term 
shift towards more direct sourcing, thereby enhancing 
margins
 a Commence the implementation of a new IT system
 a Build greater awareness of the Topps brand through 
national TV campaigns
Our Pe OPl e and their c On tri Buti On
A keen focus on the demands of the customer is at the 
heart of any successful retail business. Feedback from 
our rigorous “mystery shop” monitoring has confirmed 
that Topps is now in the top 10% of retailers in Europe 
when it comes to levels of customer service. This result 
validates our policy of continuous “on the job” staff 
training. Such a result could not have been achieved 
without the hard work and commitment of everyone who 
works at Topps, either in store or as part of our support 
functions. Our staff have also demonstrated their 
community spirit through their unerring support of the 
Help for Heroes campaign. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank them all for their remarkable 
contribution to the business, and the wider community, 
across the entire year.
cO r POr ate g Ov ernance
This year Barry Bester, our Chairman since 2003, and 
co-founder of the business, brought his time with Topps to 
a close. After 26 years of dedicated commitment to the 
business, he announced in May that he wished to pursue 
his other business interests. Stuart Williams, co-founder 
and Company President has also announced his 
intention to conclude his formal involvement with the 
Group. Together Stuart and Barry formed a partnership 
which helped to take Topps from a private business, with 
just a few stores, to today’s publicly quoted enterprise 
with 321 outlets nationally. We owe both of them a 
deep debt of gratitude for all they have done to help 
develop Topps into Britain’s number one tile retailer. 
The Board recognises the need to recruit additional 
independent Non-Executive Directors to bring the Board 
into line with corporate governance best practice. 
This process is well advanced and we expect to be 
in a position to make an announcement early in 2012.

Divi Den D
Last year we announced the resumption of dividend 
payments. Although trading has been tough in this 
financial period, prudent financial management has 
enabled the Board to recommend to shareholders a final 
dividend of 0.6p per share. This will cost £1.1 million. 
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting the 
dividend will be payable on 31 January 2012 to all 
shareholders on the register as at 30 December 201 1. 
This brings the total dividend for the year to 1.1p per 
share (2010: 1.0p per share), an increase of 10%.
Our Future
Looking ahead, we recognise that economic conditions 
will remain difficult in 2012, with consumer budgets 
again under pressure. However, we will remain focused 
on maintaining our market leading position safeguarding 
our margins and looking at further ways in which cost 
can be taken out of the business.
At store level our product presentation will be enhanced 
to enable us to continue the theme of inspiring customers’ 
home improvement plans. We will also invest in staff 
training and development to ensure a continuity of well 
qualified staff, trained to deliver Topps’ outstanding 
customer service. Our online presence will be developed 
so that customers can more easily choose the tile that is 
just right for them. We will also continue to look for 
opportunities to open a limited number of new stores 
in those parts of the country where we are under-
represented. All of these initiatives will be supported by 
sustained marketing spend, with improved targeting, 
to ensure that our message of great prices, unparalleled 
product ranges, and superb service is communicated 
to both our retail and trade customers alike.

Our focus during the period has been on strengthening 
our market leading position by continuing to deliver 
outstanding service and excellent value, high quality 
products to our customers. We further upgraded and 
expanded our store estate, continued the evolution of 
the Topps Tiles offer and supported this with new 
marketing initiatives in-store, on television and online. 
In addition, we made some significant infrastructure 
investments across the business, which will benefit 
our future performance.
Prudent management of all costs remained a key focus. 
In addition we also reviewed a number of our retail 
processes to both further improve our proposition to 
customers and enhance financial performance.
The economic environment has continued to be 
challenging and, in particular, we saw a slowing in 
customer numbers during the second half of our financial 
period. That said, the business remains financially well 
positioned and the strong operational progress made 
during the year will enable us to continue to progress 
our growth plans.
t he Market 
Topps has seen its position as the UK’s leading tile 
retailer strengthen further during the period, with our 
share of the non-contract tile market growing to 26% 
(2010: 25%) (source: MBD). Our unwavering focus 
on offering our customers outstanding service and 
value enabled the Group to, once again, outperform 
the market.
Tile consumption in the UK continues to be low in 
comparison to the rest of Europe (roughly one third of the 
demand experienced in Northern Europe, source: MBD). 
However long-term growth, based on projections of an 
increase in housing stock and consumer usage of tiles, 
remains attractive. Against this background we believe 
there is potential for up to 400 Topps Tiles stores in 
the UK.
st Or e devel OPMent and exPansi On
With a continuing backdrop of challenging trading 
conditions our focus has been on optimising returns from 
the existing store estate by adding new stores selectively 
and targeting tactical re-sites of individual stores where 
this is supported by the local market opportunity.
Over recent years our store expansion strategy was 
realigned to reflect the deterioration in the economic 
environment. In the 2009/10 financial period we 
returned to growth in store numbers and this activity 
accelerated in the period under review. In the last 
12 months we opened 15 new stores and closed 
seven stores (of which three were relocations), resulting 
in a net increase of eight stores and completing the 
financial period with 320 stores. New store openings 
have performed well and we are very satisfied with the 
return on investment. In the year ahead we have plans 
in place to increase the size of the business by 
approximately five new stores.
We have continued with our programme of converting 
Tile Clearing House stores into the more profitable 
Topps Tiles format and have completed five in the 
financial period. Trading results from these conversions 
have been pleasing and a further 15 are planned for the 
year ahead. This will leave 16 Tile Clearing House stores 
which will function as clearance units for the Topps stores.
Our improved and expanded website was relaunched 
during the period. The response has been very 
encouraging, with record numbers of people visiting the 
site and staying online for longer periods than ever 
before. Our online presence is now an increasingly 
important factor in driving store footfall as a growing 
number of customers undertake the research phase of 
their project online before visiting our stores. To help them 
with this process we have introduced more inspirational 
room set photography, a greater variety of design ideas 
and a completely new market-leading interactive 
“visualiser”. This enables customers to choose from our 
extensive range of wall and floor tiles and model them 
into a variety of different room settings.

We have also improved the site navigation and 
checkout procedures as well as updating the visual 
presentation to mirror the latest in-store experience. 
While we expect the primary role of the website to 
remain as a customer research tool, it is also playing 
a growing role as a direct sales channel, with online 
revenues now representing around 1.5% of sales 
(2010: 1%). We expect this to continue to grow and 
play an ever increasing role in our customer offer.
in Fr astructure
During the period we completed the construction of 
our second warehousing facility at our Leicestershire 
headquarters at a cost of c.£3 million. This warehouse 
is now fully operational and will form a key part of our 
logistics strategy over the coming years, giving us the 
operational capacity for up to 400 stores. In particular, 
the additional capacity will allow us to source more 
products direct from the manufacturer, decreasing the 
proportion sourced via third party distributors and 
delivering a gross margin benefit.
During the next financial period we will be implementing 
a new enterprise-wide information technology system 
of which the majority of the implementation will occur 
in the second half. This new system, which will add 
much greater functionality across a range of disciplines, 
will be a key enabler for a number of new processes 
and customer initiatives. The total cost of the system 
implementation will be approximately £1 million, the 
majority of which has been spent in this financial period.
c ust OMer service
As the UK’s leading tile specialist, the provision 
of exceptional levels of customer service is a key 
differentiator of the Topps Tiles brand.
Over the course of the last year we have changed the 
way we measure customer satisfaction and adopted the 
Net Promoter Scoring system. The score is calculated 
based on customers’ feedback to the question of how 
likely they are to recommend Topps Tiles to friends or 
colleagues. The scores are based on a numerical scale 
from 0–10 which allows customers to be split into 
promoters (9–10), passives (7–8) and detractors (0–6). 
The final score is based on the percentage of promoters 
less the percentage of detractors, thereby creating 
a possible range of –100% to +100%. Over the 
financial period we have scored 88.1% against this 
measure and consider this a very clear endorsement 
of our customer service ethic. The measure used 
for 2010 is not directly comparable.
Marketing, advertising 
and  sPOn sOr shi P
The evolution of the Topps Tiles brand continued during 
the period, in line with our greater emphasis on inspiring 
customers and reaching beyond our traditional customer 
base. Our product brochures and in-store merchandising 
have been repositioned to reflect customers’ increased 
focus on style as the principal driver in their purchase 
decision. This approach also provides consistency 
with our improved consumer website. Greater emphasis 
has also been given to the breadth of our ranges, 
with a greater focus on being able to attract high end 
customers, as well as retaining those attracted by our 
traditional value message.

st aFF devel OPMent
Our people are fundamental to fulfilling our key objective 
of delivering excellent customer service and this remains 
as important as ever. We continue to invest in their 
professional development through a sophisticated in-store 
e-learning system, which is developed and administered 
in-house, providing new courses and regular updates. 
During the year we rolled-out new programmes to equip 
all store staff with the product and technical knowledge 
to support our “customer inspiration” agenda, as well as 
specialist sales skills training. The initial results from this 
programme have been encouraging, with a greater 
consistency of standards already evident across the 
store estate.
All our staff are incentivised with competitive benefit 
packages and performance based rewards, and we 
encourage internal promotion. We anticipate that staffing 
levels will increase in line with the progressive expansion 
of the store base.
c u rrent t r ading and Outl OOk
In the first seven weeks of the new financial period, 
Group revenues, which are on a like-for-like basis, 
decreased by 6.9%.
Looking ahead, we expect economic conditions will 
remain difficult in 2012, with domestic budgets again 
under pressure. Our response will be to take further cost 
out of the business, grow margin and maximise sales 
opportunities, while making operational improvements 
that will position the business for future growth as 
economic conditions improve.

Marketing, advertising 
and  sPOn sOr shi P (c On tinued)
Over the course of the last financial period we increased 
our level of marketing expenditure by approximately 
£1 million in order to drive footfall and increase our 
market share. Television advertising and sponsorship has 
proved to be the most effective way to build consumer 
awareness of the Topps brand. In the early part of the 
period we ran a national weather sponsorship 
campaign with ITV and subsequent TV campaigns 
across a variety of national terrestrial and digital 
channels have also been successful in driving store 
footfall. To complement this we will continue to 
communicate the inspirational range through home 
interest magazines and PR. We are planning to sustain 
a similar level of marketing expenditure in the year 
ahead. A trade-focused campaign will run in parallel 
with the consumer campaign, in line with our strategy 
of securing a greater proportion of trade project spend. 
cOMM u nity
Topp’s commitment to its local communities through 
sponsorship and charitable activity remains strong. We 
aim to make positive contributions to those communities 
served by our stores, working closely with them to 
promote our primary aim of being a “good neighbour”.
We currently sponsor over 300 youth football teams 
nationwide, providing the teams with support, new kits 
and equipment.
Our work for the charity, Help for Heroes, which we 
have been supporting since 2008, has gone from 
strength to strength and we have already helped to raise 
over £160,000 for this very worthy cause. We also 
work with the British Association of Modern Mosaic 
(“BAMM”), sponsoring two national competitions and 
supporting the promotion of mosaic art in schools and 
community groups countrywide.

“OUR PRIMARY OBjECTIVES CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON OPTIMISING RETURNS 
FROM THE ExISTING ESTATE, CAREFUL MANAGEMENT OF OUR COST BASE AND 
IMPROVING OUR FINANCIAL FLExIBILITY. OUR MOST RECENT TRADING PERIOD 
DEMONSTRATED THE FRAGILITY OF UK CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND PROVIDES 
FURTHER RE-ENFORCEMENT THAT OUR CURRENT STRATEGY AND OBjECTIVES ARE 
APPROPRIATE FOR THE BUSINESS AT THE PRESENT TIME.”
Key financial objectives:
 a Primary focus on increasing revenues and cash 
generation, maintaining tight cost control and 
optimising gross margins
 a Maximising earnings per share and shareholder 
returns, including bi-annual review of our 
dividend policy
 a Ongoing supplier tendering and benchmarking 
of non-stock suppliers
 a Managing the Group’s exposure to fluctuations 
in foreign exchange rates
 a Maintaining a capital structure which enables 
an appropriate balance of financial flexibility 
and capital efficiency
Progress against these objectives is discussed throughout 
this report and, where appropriate measures are 
utilised, these are included in the Key Performance 
Indicators section.
OPerati On al review
Our primary objectives continue to be focused on 
optimising returns from the existing estate, careful 
management of our cost base and improving our 
financial flexibility. Our most recent trading period 
demonstrated the fragility of UK consumer confidence 
and provides further reinforcement that our current 
strategy and objectives are appropriate for the business 
at the present time.
Over the financial period we have maintained our 
focus on cost control and have only seen increases 
in costs resulting from inflationary factors, one-off items 
or where we have decided that additional investment 
was appropriate, such as increased marketing 
expenditure. Further detail of expenditure is 
provided within the Financial Review.

Note – Net Promoter Score is a new measure we have adopted 
in favour of customer satisfaction ratings. The score is calculated 
based on customers’ feedback to the question of how likely they are 
to recommend Topps Tiles to friends or colleagues. The scores are 
based on a numerical scale from 0–10 which allows customers to 
be split into promoters (9–10), passives (7–8) and detractors (0–6). 
The final score is based on the percentage of promoters less the 
percentage of detractors.
The Directors receive regular information on these 
and other metrics for the Group as a whole. 
This information is reviewed and updated as the 
Directors feel appropriate.
r isks and u n certainties
The Board conducts a continuing review of key risks 
and uncertainties. The Board’s primary focus when 
reviewing these risks and uncertainties over the last 
12 months has included:
 a The continuing challenges of the UK economy 
and the subsequent business impact
 a Balancing our longer term investment needs 
against the uncertain economic outlook
 a Ensuring that the Group’s capital structure remains 
appropriate and that future funding requirements 
are accessible
uK economy
The most recent trading period demonstrated the fragility 
of UK consumer confidence, which in turn has had a 
direct impact on our sales performance. Over the first 
half of our financial period we demonstrated an 
encouraging trend of steady growth in like-for-like sales. 
During the second half, and in particular the final quarter, 
we saw a significant reduction in revenues when 
compared to the prior period. Over the financial period 
as a whole we have seen a sales decline of 2.0% on 
a like-for-like basis. During the current trading period, 
reflecting the first seven weeks of our new financial 
period, we have seen like-for-like sales decline by 6.9%, 
providing clear evidence of the current economic climate 
and the weakness in consumer confidence. The Board 
believes the business is well positioned to deal with these 
challenges, continuing to generate healthy profits and 
remaining cash generative. Furthermore we believe the 
business is well positioned to take advantage of the 
likely retraction in the competitive base across our 
core markets.

k
balancing our longer term investment needs 
against the uncertain economic outlook
During the financial period the Board monitored both 
the Group performance and the macro economy closely 
and considered that a return to investing in key areas of 
growth for the business was appropriate. This strategy 
has resulted in an overall increase in the number of stores 
and the completion of a new warehousing facility which 
is key to our future plans. The Board intends to continue 
with the cautious expansionary approach we outlined to 
shareholders over the last two years and intends to target 
approximately five new store openings over the next 
12 months. We will also continue to invest in older parts 
of the store estate through a programme of minor store 
improvements and plan to convert a further 15 TCH 
stores to the Topps brand, a strategy which has 
demonstrated positive results over the last 12 months.
appropriate capital structure
During the period the Group successfully refinanced 
its loan facilities and now has in place a £75.0 million 
committed revolving credit facility, expiring in May 2015. 
As at the financial period end £60.0 million of this 
facility was drawn, with a further £15.0 million of 
undrawn financing available. The loan facility 
contains financial covenants which are tested on a 
bi-annual basis. 
o ther key risks
In addition to the above, the Board considers other 
key risks including its relationship with key suppliers, 
the potential threat of new competitors, the risk of 
failure of key information technology systems, possible 
impacts on costs of sourcing due to the weakness of 
Sterling in comparison to the Euro and US dollar 
currencies, loss of key personnel and the development of 
substitute products. The Board’s response to these risks is 
articulated throughout this report and includes:
 a Continuing improvement in our existing retail 
operations, including regular review of our product 
offer and customer service to ensure that we are 
maximising the opportunity to deliver sales
 a Careful management of costs across all areas of the 
business with increases in expenditure only in areas 
that the Board decides are appropriate in order to 
either drive short-term gains or generate longer term 
strategic benefits
 a Tight management of cash and continued reduction 
in net debt to improve financial flexibility
 a Continuing review of the Group’s global sourcing 
strategy to enable us to deliver greater value for 
money whilst maintaining returns and minimise the 
risk of over reliance on any individual supplier
The Directors will continue to monitor all of the key 
risks and uncertainties and the Board will take 
appropriate actions to mitigate these risks and 
their potential outcomes.
gO ing c On cern
Based on a detailed review of the above risks and 
uncertainties and management’s current expectations 
the Board believes that the Group will continue to meet 
all of its financial commitments as they fall due and will 
be able to continue as a going concern. 
The current economic climate and most recent trading 
period creates a degree of uncertainty in the outlook 
and our forecasts are sensitive to relatively small changes 
in sales and margin assumptions. This uncertainty, 
combined with the financial covenants included in our 
loan facilities, has led the Board to conduct a detailed 
review of a number of different trading scenarios and 
possible mitigating actions, should they be required. 
Mitigating actions would include further cost reductions, 
working capital management, reduced investment, 
freehold property disposal and possible review of 
dividend policy.
Based on this analysis the Board has concluded that 
in the event that the level of like-for-like sales highlighted 
in the current trading section of the CEO’s report were 
to continue for the whole of the financial period ending 
29 September 2012, some form of mitigating action 
would be required but once taken into account the 
Group would fully meet all of its future financial 
commitments. The Board, therefore, considers it 
appropriate to prepare the financial statements 
on the going concern basis.

Financial review Profit and loss account
Please note this report has been prepared for the 
52 weeks ended 1 October 201 1 and the comparative 
period was prepared for the 53 weeks ended 
2 October 2010. With the exception of the Group 
like-for-like revenue measure, which is comparable, 
the reported figures are presented on this basis and are 
not entirely comparable. The impact of the additional 
week in the prior period was to increase revenue by 
£3.6 million and operating profit by £0.4 million.
r evenue
Revenue for the period ended 1 October 201 1 
decreased by 3.8% to £175.5 million (2010: £182.4 
million). Like-for-like store sales decreased by 2.0% in the 
period, which consisted of a 1.8% increase in the first 
half of the financial period and a 5.8% decrease in the 
second half.
Gross margin
Overall gross margin was 59.6% compared with 58.7% 
in the previous financial period. At the interim stage of 
this period gross margin was 59.7%, and we have 
recorded a gross margin of 59.5% in the second half 
of the period. The second half includes an exceptional 
charge against inventory of £1.3 million relating to a 
change in our in-store practices which means we no 
longer consider display inventory to be suitable for sale. 
Adjusting for this, the underlying margin in the second 
half period would be 61.0% and 60.3% for the period 
as a whole, demonstrating an encouraging level of 
improvement. The environment we operate in continues 
to be a highly competitive one and we are able to 
utilise our scale to ensure that we can offer customers 
outstanding value and also generate increasing levels of 
returns. Continued improvement in the efficiency of our 
supply chain and further vertical integration have been 
the key drivers of the improvements over the financial 
period. We will continue to invest margin in a controlled 
way to drive transaction volume where we consider it 
appropriate to do so.

Operating expenses
Total operating costs have increased from £87 .3 million 
to £90.6 million, an increase of 3.8%. Costs as a 
percentage of sales were 51.6% compared to 47 .8% 
in the previous period. When adjusted for exceptional 
items, detailed below, operating costs were £87 .7 million 
(2010: £86.1 million), equivalent to 50.0% of sales 
(2010: 47 .2% of sales).
The movement in adjusted operating costs is explained 
by the following key items:
 a This financial period was one week shorter than the 
previous financial period, which is equivalent to a 
saving of approximately £1.7 million
 a Inflation at an average of approximately 2% has 
increased our cost base by around £1.8 million 
 a The average number of UK stores trading during the 
financial period was 313 (2010: 310), which would 
imply a 1.0% increase in store costs, generating 
approximately £0.7 million of additional costs
 a We have made additional investments in marketing, 
increasing spend by approximately £1.0 million
 a Business performance has been below the level of 
internal targets which has meant a reduced level 
of rewards for staff. Employee profit share costs 
have decreased by £0.3 million
 a The remaining elements of the cost base are broadly 
flat when compared to the prior year
During the period we have incurred several charges 
which we have categorised as exceptional due 
to their nature. These charges relate to impairments 
of plant, property and equipment of £1.1 million 
(2010: £0.8 million), an inventory charge of £1.3 million 
(2010: £nil), and an increase in property related 
provisions of £1.9 million (2010: £0.4 million).
Operating profit
Operating profit for the period was £14.0 million 
(2010: £19.9 million).
Operating profit as a percentage of sales was 8.0% 
(2010: 10.9%).
When adjusted for the exceptional items detailed 
on page 1 operating profit was £18.2 million 
(2010: £21.1 million).
Other gains and losses
There were no other gains and losses during the 
period (2010: £0.1 million gain relating to disposal 
of freehold property).
Financing
The net cash interest charge for the year was 
£4.4 million (2010: £4.8 million), excluding the impact 
of revaluations of derivative instruments. Whilst the interest 
charge has fallen compared to the prior period we have 
only seen limited benefit from the very low interest rates 
that prevail in the market. This is due to a series of interest 
rate derivatives we have in place which negate the 
majority of any impact from interest rate movements.
The interest rate derivatives give rise to a “marked 
to market” revaluation as required by IAS 39 
“Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” . 
This revaluation has generated a fair value (non cash) 
charge of £ 1.6 million (2010: £2.8 million). Due to the 
nature of the underlying financial instruments, IAS39 does 
not allow hedge accounting to be applied to these losses 
and hence this charge is being applied direct to the 
income statement rather than offset against balance 
sheet reserves.
Following the financial period end the Board has 
decided to close out 50% of the interest rate derivatives. 
This will have the effect of reducing the Group’s annual 
interest charge moving forwards by approximately 
£1.25 million (at current LIBOR rates) but will increase 
net debt by £6.2 million from April 2012.
Net interest cover was 4.3 times (2010: 5.1 times) 
based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and the impairment of plant, property and equipment, 
excluding the impact of IAS 39 in finance charges.

balance sheet
c apital expenditure
Capital expenditure in the period amounted to 
£10.8 million (2010: £4.9 million), an increase of 
123%, reflecting the increased level of investment 
in infrastructure that we highlighted in our previous 
Annual Report. Capital expenditure includes the cost 
of 12 new openings, five conversions, three relocations 
and 12 refits at a cost of £5.3 million. In addition 
to this we purchased the freehold on one existing 
store at a cost of £1.6 million. Other capital expenditure 
includes the building of a new warehousing facility 
at a cost of £3.1 million and £0.8 million on a new 
IT system, which will go live in 2012.
At the period end the Group held eight freehold or long 
leasehold sites including three warehouse and distribution 
facilities with a total net book value of £17 .8 million 
(2010: six freehold or long leasehold valued at 
£13.4 million).

Reported profit before tax is £7 .9 million

Group profit before tax margin was 4.5% (2010: 6.8%).
When adjusted for the exceptional and non-cash items 
detailed on page 1 the profit before tax is £13.9 million 
(2010: £16.3 million).
tax
The effective rate of Corporation Tax for the period was 
27 .7% (2010: 31.5% (continuing operations)). 
The effective rate of Corporation Tax has been increased 
from the basic rate by non-deductible expenditure and 
depreciation on assets not qualifying for capital 
allowances. This has been offset by a prior year credit 
reflecting the release of certain provisions held against 
known tax risks as they have been reduced or settled. 
earnings per share
Basic earnings per share were 3.04p (2010: 5.37p 
– continued and discontinued operations).
Diluted earnings per share were 2.97p (2010: 5.26p 
– continued and discontinued operations).
dividend and dividend policy
Last year we announced the resumption of dividend 
payments. Although trading has been tough in this 
financial period, prudent financial management has 
enabled the Board to recommend to shareholders a final 
dividend of 0.6p per share. This will cost £1.1 million. 
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting the 
dividend will be payable on 31 January 2012 to all 
shareholders on the register as at 30 December 201 1.

Inventory at the period end was £23.8 million (2010:

improving working capital efficiencies and have also

Co r Po ra Te so Cial res Po nsibili Ty
Taking responsibility for our impact on society is 
important to us as a business and we have been 
developing our Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”)
agenda since 2004. Over the past eight years we have 
evolved and enhanced our programme to ensure we are 
an active member within the communities we work, that 
we work in an environmentally conscious manner, and 
we ensure our employees feel supported, developed 
and engaged.
We are proud of our achievements in this area and 
focus our attention across three primary areas:
 a Community and Charity
 a Environment
 a Our People
cOMM u nity and c harity
An important part of being a “good neighbour” for 
Topps Tiles is ensuring we are active in the communities 
local to our stores and places where we work.  
We have a strong CSR ethic at Topps and this is 
reflected in the work we do within our community 
and charity programmes.
In its eighth year, our CSR programme has grown and 
enhanced over the years providing the framework and 
impetus for stores to support local activities that are a 
“perfect fit” for the values and culture of our Group. 
Topps in the Community
Mosaic art is fast becoming a growing craft across the 
UK and Topps is proud to lead the way in promoting 
and supporting mosaic as both a public art and an 
educational craft skill for children and adults. 
Our mosaic programme is broken down into two 
key areas:
 a supporting the educational needs of adults and 
children in our local community. We provide Topps 
Tiles Community Vouchers for mosaic materials to 
community artists and neighbourhood craft groups 
and provide expertise and materials to schools, 
educational workshops and further education 
centres. Our support assists these individuals and 
groups to develop their self-esteem, self-ability, 
educational needs, empowerment, inclusion and 
communication skills; and
 a sponsoring two major competitions designed to 
showcase the work of novice mosaic artists. Mega 
Mosaic Makers, is a primary school competition 
organised by The British Association for Modern 
Mosaic and our own landmark competition for adults 
learning mosaic in community workshops and further 
education centres, the Topps Tiles Award for 
Achievements in Mosaics.
youth football
Sponsorship of youth football is the cornerstone of our 
community relations programme and an exciting way for 
us as a business to get involved in the helping of children 
in our local communities get outdoors and get active.
We are one of the biggest supporters of youth football 
in the UK and whenever we open a new store we 
encourage them to look for sponsorship opportunities. 
Our stores are encouraged to build close relationships 
with teams and not only support them emotionally but 
also with the equipment needed to ensure they can 
get active without worry – kit, footballs and kitbags. 
We have been so successful in our youth football 
sponsorship that the kit our stores donate to junior teams 
is now arguably the most famous strip in the grassroots 
game! Teams are also encouraged to support our charity 
partner Help for Heroes. 
We currently support over 300 youth teams nationwide 
and are very proud of this association. All the activity 
culminates in an annual tournament where teams across 
the country are invited to come together at the King 
Power Stadium, Leicester City FC.
‘‘WE ARE SO HONOURED THAT TOPPS TILES HAVE CONTINUED TO SUPPORT 
H4H IN 2011. THEIR SUPPORT SINCE 2008 HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. THEY ARE 
ALWAYS ENTHUSIASTIC AND NEVER SEEM TO TIRE OF DOING jUST ABOUT 
ANYTHING TO RAISE MONEY FOR OUR HEROES! THE MONEY REALLY HAS 
MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING

Charity
During 2008 we adopted “Help for Heroes” as our 
Group charity and have taken their cause to our hearts in 
a big way. Founded in 2007 , the charity funds specialist 
rehabilitation projects for members of the armed forces 
wounded in front-line conflicts including Afghanistan. 
Undoubtedly, one of Britain’s most high-profile charities, 
Help for Heroes enjoys phenomenal support from the 
British public, as it does with the workforce at Topps Tiles. 
The last year has seen a phenomenal fundraising drive 
by our employees with individuals arranging events in 
their local communities (fun runs, football tournaments etc) 
as well as participating in companywide fundraisers 
such as our “Be a Christmas Hero” day.
All the hard work and commitment that our employees 
put into our partnership was recently recognised at the 
Help for Heroes Awards ceremony where the Group 
received an award for “Outstanding Support”. With over 
£160,000 already raised for Help for Heroes, Topps 
are looking forward to continuing the successful 
partnership in 2012.
“We are so honoured that Topps Tiles have continued to 
support H4H in 201 1. Their support since 2008 has 
been incredible. They are always enthusiastic and never 
seem to tire of doing just about anything to raise money 
for our heroes! The money really has made a huge 
difference and we are very grateful for everything they 
have done. They are a pleasure to work with and we 
are looking forward to seeing what you have planned 
for next year!” Bryn Parry H4H November 201 1.

energy
Energy is a major driver of cost for the business and also 
forms a significant part of our environmental impact. 
Energy efficient technology including low energy lighting 
helps to reduce our environmental impact and we 
continually review opportunities to adopt new technology 
on a cost efficient basis wherever possible.
In 2010, in liaison with the Carbon Trust, we commenced 
a pilot scheme for the replacement of old inefficient lighting 
installations with new efficient systems at 1 1 of our sites. 
This scheme proved successful, achieving our objectives 
of an improved environment for our customers and staff, 
cost savings from lower electricity consumption and 
maintenance costs and a reduction in our carbon 
footprint. As a result of this success we have now 
completed a further 21 locations and plan to continue 
the upgrade programme in the year ahead.
Waste
Waste management remains an important area for our 
business and recent initiatives, specifically at our main 
warehouses, have reduced waste going to landfill by up 
to 40%. All cardboard and plastic generated at the 
centre is now baled and sold on to recycling companies 
with all waste wood crushed in to small pieces and 
similarly sold on. Using our proactive approach to 
continuously minimise waste, the plan is to further 
broaden and increase our commitment by reviewing 
areas such as polystyrene, metal and canteen waste 
more closely.
With the continuing need for us to actively manage our 
store waste in conjunction with our chosen refuse partner 
our stores now use Dry Mixed Recycling which means 
that cardboard, paper, newspapers, plastic films, bottles, 
steel and aluminium cans can all be put into one bin. 
As well as controlling our costs, we are also reducing our 
environmental impact by diverting store waste away from 
landfill and into established recycling channels.
Transport
Topps has taken delivery of a further five “Euro 5” low 
emission vehicles during 201 1 and have specified 
manufacturers’ telematic systems as standard on these 
vehicles. This brings in line all of Topps’ own fleet to 
Euro 5 specification. Total CO2 emissions on our own 
fleet for 201 1 was 2,460 tonnes, a reduction of 8% 
year-on-year, despite additional activity, with new fleet 
efficiencies expected to reduce this number further during 
2012. We are continuing to review our trailer 
replacement programme with a focus on a lightweight 
fleet to reduce mileage and subsequent emmisions. We 
already have one double-deck trailer in daily use and we 
are considering options including more double-deck 
urban trailers, drawbar combinations and more 
aerodynamic designs. We are also committed to 
collaborating with other retailers where possible to share 
empty fleet space, maximising efficiencies.
supply chain
We source our goods for resale from around the world. 
Labour standards, factory conditions and human rights 
are issues we take seriously. To address any possible 
concerns our buyers conduct regular supplier visits and 
factory tours and also ensure that all contracts for supply 
of goods include our requirements in relation to each of 
the above issues. We have a policy on timber products 
and have adopted the principles and criteria of the 
Forest Stewardship Council as our benchmark.
Our Pe OPl e
Our employees are a central focus for us and we want 
them to feel engaged and proud of their Company.  
We want to ensure that not only do we give our 
customers an inspiring place to shop but we also 
give our employees an inspiring place to work.
employee wellbeing
We provide an employee helpline service for all 
employees to have a channel for expressing concerns 
and seeking advice. Over the last year we have 
launched a new employee assistance programme, 
a store manager health plan, employee private health 
cover and extended our paternity policy to ensure 
our employees’ wellbeing is fully supported.

Communication and engagement
Communication with our employees is vital and we 
have initiatives in place to ensure regular and effective 
dialogue with staff. We have introduced a three year 
communication and engagement plan to support the 
business plan for the future.
 a We have a number of existing communication 
channels including a newly designed internal 
magazine and a weekly stores bulletin. We also have 
an intranet that is being redesigned and which we 
expect to play an increasingly important part in our 
communication plans as we move forward. As part of 
our communication commitment we have conducted a 
series of management road shows, taking over 400 
of our senior managers through our strategic plans for 
the next three years and ensuring all employees 
understand and are part of our vision.
 a This year saw the launch and rollout of our employee 
representative forum (“TEAM Talk”) across the entire 
business and the first full employee engagement 
survey. These initiatives will help to create a 
framework for employees to participate in a 
two way engagement process with those that 
will drive decision making within the Group.
 a We are developing our internal employee brand in a 
drive to attract and retain the talent needed to support 
our growth plans. We actively encourage our staff to 
apply for internal vacancies and promotions.
 a Rewarding our employees for all their hard work 
is part of the Topps ethos and every employee has 
the opportunity to enhance their basic pay through 
additional performance related incentives. This year 
has also seen us review and enhance our complete 
reward programme to ensure we are competitive and 
recognise all our employees for their hard work  
and loyalty.
employee development
As a Group we actively encourage employee 
development. We have a strong culture and history 
of growing and developing our people within the 
organisation and it is important to us that our employees 
fulfil their potential whilst they are working with us. 
 a 201 1 has seen over 300 of our retail employees 
gain Level Two Qualifications in Retail Skills and 
45 employees have begun studying for their 
Level Three Qualification.
 a This year has also seen the launch of the Topps Tiles 
Young Apprenticeships programme. We have 12 
young men and women working with us across the 
UK and it is a programme we hope to develop and 
grow over the coming year.
In April 201 1 the Group retained its Investors in People 
award for a further three years.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the

of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve 
the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
 a select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 a make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 a state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the

In preparing the Group Financial Statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 a properly select and apply accounting policies;
 a present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
 a provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 a make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 a the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
 a the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description

Dear shareholder, 
The Company is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council (“the Code”) for which the Board is accountable to shareholders. 
statement of compliance with the code 
The Company has complied throughout the period with the Provisions of the Code except for provision B.6.1, as the Board does not currently 
undertake formal appraisal of its own performance and that of its committees on the basis that it considers an informal rolling programme of 
review appropriate. 
The Company complies with all other provisions of the Code.
In addition, the Company recognises the need to increase the number of independent Non-Executive Directors on the Board and a process to 
identify and appoint two suitable candidates is well advanced. The Company hopes to be in a position to make a further announcement on these 
appointments early in 2012.
The Board of Directors comprises five members, of which two are considered independent including the Company’s Non-Executive Chairman, 
Rt. Hon. Michael Jack. The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director is Alan White, who also chairs the Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee. Brief biographical details of all Directors are given on page 26. The Board meets at least ten times a year. Certain defined issues are 
reserved for the Board including approval of Financial Statements and circulars, annual budgets, strategy, Directors’ appointments, internal control 
and risk management, corporate governance, key external and internal appointments and pensions and employee incentives.
In advance of Board Meetings Directors are supplied with up-to-date information about trading performance, the Group’s overall financial position 
and its achievement against prior period, budgets and forecasts.
Where required, a Director may seek independent professional advice at the expense of the Company. All Directors have access to the Company 
Secretary and they may also address specific issues to the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
In line with the updated UK Corporate Governance Code all Directors will be subject to annual re-election from the next Annual General Meeting. 
Directors are elected at the first AGM after appointment. All Non-Executive Directors have written letters of appointment. The Board acknowledges 
the Code’s position with respect to the potential loss of independence for any Non-Executive Director who has served for nine years or more. 
Although the Rt. Hon. Michael Jack has exceeded this term the Board regards him to be independent and considers his broad based commercial 
experience and extensive business specific knowledge to be extremely beneficial.
The Board considers that the Rt. Hon. Michael Jack and Alan White are independent for the purposes of the Code. The terms and conditions 
for the appointment of Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection on request.
The Board will review the independence of Non-Executive Directors on an ongoing basis.
The Board operates three committees. These are the Nomination Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee. 
All of these committees meet regularly and have formal written terms of reference which are available for inspection on request.

14887_TT_AR11_p26-37.indd   31 07/12/2011   21:54 statement about applying the principles of the code
The Company has applied the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code as reported above. Further explanation of how the principles 
of the Code have been applied in connection with Directors’ remuneration is set out in the Remuneration Report.
Audit committee
The Audit Committee consists of the Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman is Alan White, the other member is the Rt. Hon. Michael Jack. 
The qualifications of the Audit Committee members are detailed on page 26.
The Audit Committee considers the nature and scope of the audit process (both internal and external) and its effectiveness. The Committee 
reviews and approves the internal audit programme, meets with the external auditor and considers the Annual and Interim Financial Statements 
before submission to the Board. The Committee reviews the arrangements by which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible 
improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters. The Committee also reviews the Group’s system of internal control and reports 
its findings twice a year to the Board. The Committee meets with the external auditor and the rest of the Board attend at the invitation of 
the Audit Committee Chairman.
Part of the role of the Audit Committee is to review the independence of the Company’s auditor. The Company’s external auditor, Deloitte LLP 
(“Deloitte”), have provided non-audit services to the Company in the form of tax advice. The Audit Committee is satisfied that Deloitte LLP has 
adequate policies and safeguards in place to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence is maintained. The Audit Committee is aware 
that providing audit and non audit advice could lead to a potential conflict of interest. The level of fees paid to Deloitte LLP for non audit services 
has been considered by the Audit Committee and is not perceived to be in conflict with auditor independence. In order to ensure the continued 
independence and objectivity of the external auditor, there is an established policy regarding the provision of non audit services. The Audit 
Committee has concluded that the auditor, Deloitte, is independent.
Deloitte has been auditor for the Group since September 2003. The current audit partner’s first period as signing partner is the current period 
ended 1 October 201 1. The Audit Committee considers the work of Deloitte and their independence in deciding whether an audit tender is 
required and, at this point in time, is satisfied by the work of Deloitte and their independence, and so has proposed their re-appointment.
Nomination committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by The Rt. Hon. Michael Jack. The other member is Alan White. The formal terms of reference 
for this Committee require it to make recommendations to the Board for appointments of Directors and other senior executive staff.
Appointments to the Board are made on merit, against objective criteria, taking into account the skills and experience 
required. Where appropriate, external search consultants are enlisted.
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The Directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its institutional shareholders by making annual 
presentations and communicating regularly throughout the year. The Company also posts financial information on its website www.toppstiles.co.uk.
Maintenance of a sound system of internal control
The Board has applied Principle C.2 of the Code by establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant 
risks the Group faces. The Board regularly reviews the process, which has been put in place from the start of the period to the date of the approval 
of this report and which is in accordance with the revised guidance on internal control published in October 2005 (The Turnbull Guidance). 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
In compliance with Provision C.2.1 of the Code, the Board continuously reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control. 
The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management. It is based principally 
on reviewing reports from management to consider whether significant risks are identified, evaluated, managed and controlled and whether any 
significant weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The Board has also performed a specific 
assessment for the purposes of this Annual Report. This assessment considers all significant aspects of internal control arising during the period 
covered by the report including the work of internal audit. The Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities.
During the course of its review of the system of internal control, the Board has not identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses 
which it has determined to be significant. Therefore a confirmation in respect of necessary actions has not been considered necessary.

Chairman of the Board

This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006. The report also 
meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles 
relating to the Directors’ remuneration in the Code. As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting of the Company at which the Financial Statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditor to report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report and to state whether in 
their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations. The report has therefore been 
divided into separate sections for the audited and unaudited information.
Un AUDite D inform At ion
Remuneration committee
The Company has a Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”), which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Code. 
The members of the Committee are the Rt. Hon. Michael Jack and Alan White. The Committee is chaired by Alan White and has met three times 
during the financial period to discuss the remuneration of the senior management team and the Non-Executive Directors. None of the Committee 
has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in 
running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the individual remuneration packages of each Executive Director. 
No Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration. The terms of reference for the Committee are available on written request 
from the Company Secretary.
During the financial period the main areas reviewed by the Committee have been executive annual pay award, non-executive fees, chairman 
remuneration, board sub-committee fees and executive salary benchmarking.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibre needed to maintain the 
Group’s position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the Executive 
Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee. 
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors:
 a basic annual salary and benefits;
 a annual cash based bonus payments;
 a deferred share-based long-term incentives; and
 a pension arrangements.
Basic salary
An Executive Director’s basic salary is reviewed and determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each financial period and when 
an individual changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole, including levels 
of increases appropriate to other employees in the Group, and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparator 
Group of companies. In line with the general pay award for all staff, basic salaries were reviewed in June 201 1 and were increased by 2.5%, 
effective from that date, in consideration of general inflation. Executive Directors’ contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be 
available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting. Executive Directors’ pay and the employment conditions of the Group are taken into 
account when determining the Directors’ remuneration for the financial period. In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain 
benefits-in-kind, principally a car and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus payments
A discretionary annual cash bonus scheme represents the short-term incentive element of the overall remuneration package for Mr. Williams, 
Mr. Parker and Mr. Ounstead. The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met in the financial period if a cash bonus is to be paid. 
The maximum bonus achievable in the period was 125% of basic salary based on Group outperformance against budgeted EBITDA. 
For the period ending 1 October 201 1 the performance criteria were not met and no bonus payment was due.
Deferred bonus long-term incentive plan
At the AGM in January 2010 a new deferred bonus long-term incentive plan was approved by shareholders. Under this long-term incentive 
plan 25% of the annual bonus (net of tax) is deferred in the form of shares for a two-year period, with a matching share award (on a gross basis) 
that vests at the end of two years subject to the achievement of performance conditions relating to continuing employment within the business and 
EBITDA earnings growth measured over the two-year period. For the period ended 1 October 201 1 the performance criteria were not met and 
no bonus payment was due. The bonus structure will remain the same for the coming financial period.
Pension arrangements
Mr. Bester, Mr. Ounstead and Mr. Parker received contributions into their own personal pension schemes as disclosed in the table on page 35.

executive Directors
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors are offered permanent contracts of employment with a range of six to twelve months’ notice 
period. Under an event of contract termination any severance payment would be subject to negotiation but would be with regard to length of 
service and the prevailing notice period.
Non-executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles 
of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of similar companies. The basic fee paid to each 
Non-Executive Director in the period was £34,000 (2010: £34,000). In addition to the basic fee there is an additional allowance paid 
to the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director of £3,026 (2010: £2,836). With respect to the sub-committees of the Board there is a fee paid 
for the additional role of sub-committee Chairman of £3,000 (2010: £nil), and £2,000 for being a member of each sub-committee (2010: £nil). 
It is the Company’s policy that Non-Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of six months’ notice. 
Independent Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Company’s share option schemes and are not eligible to join the Company’s 
pension scheme.
The role of Chairman is also non-executive, with an indefinite term contract and a maximum six months’ notice. During the period we announced 
a change in Chairman. The outgoing Chairman, Barry Bester, retired from the Board on 17 May 201 1 and his contract entitled him to six months’ 
notice from that date. The total remuneration received by Mr. Bester for the period was £131,000 (2010: £1 15,000) including a contribution to 
the Company pension scheme of £6,000 (2010: £6,000). Mr. Bester also participated in the 2009 Save As You Earn Scheme. Effective from 
17 May 201 1 The Rt. Hon. Michael Jack was promoted to the role of Chairman and has received total remuneration for the period of £66,000 
(2010: £37 ,000).
The details of the Non-Executive Directors’ contracts are summarised in the table below:

14887_TT_AR11_p26-37.indd   36 07/12/2011   21:54 We have audited the Group financial statements of Topps Tiles Plc for the 52 week period ended 1 October 201 1 which comprise the 
consolidated statement of financial performance, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of financial 
position, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 34. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and 
the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
 a give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 1 October 201 1 and of its profit for the 52 week period then ended;
 a have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 a have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 2 to the Group financial statements, the Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 a certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 a we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 a the directors’ statement contained within the Business Review in relation to going concern; 
 a the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and
 a certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on Directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Topps Tiles Plc for the period ended 1 October 201 1 and on the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

notes to the C o nsolidated finan Cial statements 
For the 52 week period ended 1 October 201 1
1 General information
Topps Tiles Plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is given 
on page 27 . The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activity are set out in the Directors’ Report on page 28.
These financial statements are presented in Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group 
operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 21.
adoption of new and revised standards 
In the current period, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted and have affected or may affect in the 
future the amounts reported in the financial statements.
IFRS 3 (revised 2008) “Business Combinations”. Following an amendment to IFRS 3 all acquisition costs are charged to the statement of financial 
performance for all business combinations acquired after 1 July 2009.
IFRIC 17 “Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Users”. The interpretation provides guidance on when an entity should recognise a non-cash dividend 
payable, how to measure the dividend payable and how to account for any difference between the carrying amount of the assets distributed and 
the carrying amount of the dividend payable when the payable is settled.
The following amendments were made as part of Improvements to IFRSs (2009):
Amendments to IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments”. IFRS 2 has been amended following the issue of IFRS 3 (2008). This has clarified the accounting 
for share-based payment transactions between group entities.
Amendments to IAS 17 “Leases”. IAS 17 has been amended such that it may be possible to clarify a lease of land as a finance lease if it meets 
the criteria for that classification under IAS 17 .
Amendments to IAS 39 “Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement”. IAS 39 has been amended to state that option contracts between 
an acquirer and a selling shareholder to buy or sell an acquiree that will result in a business combination at a future acquisition date are not 
excluded from the scope of this standard.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in these 
financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
IAS 24 (revised 2009) Related Party Disclosures
IFRS 7 (revised 2010) Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets
Improvements to IFRSs (2010)
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group. 
2 ac countin G policies
a) Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards “IFRSs”. The financial statements have 
also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 
of the EU IAS regulation. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of derivative financial 
instruments. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
b) Going concern
Based on a detailed review of the risks and uncertainties discussed within the Business Review, and management’s current expectations, the Board 
has a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to meet all of its financial commitments as they fall due and will be able to continue as 
a going concern. 
The current economic climate and most recent trading period creates a degree of uncertainty in the outlook and our forecasts are sensitive to 
relatively small changes in sales and margin assumptions. This uncertainty, combined with the financial covenants included in our loan facilities, 
has led the Board to conduct a detailed review of a number of different trading scenarios and possible mitigating actions, should they be 
required. Mitigating actions would include further cost reductions, working capital management, reduced investment, freehold property disposal 
and possible review of dividend policy.
Based on this analysis the Board have concluded that in the event that the level of like-for-like sales highlighted in the current trading section 
of the CEO’s Report were to continue for the whole of the financial period ending 29 September 2012, some form of mitigating actions would 
be required but once taken into account the Group would fully meet all of its future financial commitments. The Board, therefore, considers 
it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.

2 ac countin G policies (continued) 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
c) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). 
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated statement of financial performance from 
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
d) financial period
The accounting period ends on the Saturday which falls closest to 30 September, resulting in financial periods of either 52 or 53 weeks.
Throughout the financial statements, Directors’ Report and Business Review, references to 201 1 mean at 1 October 201 1 or the 52 weeks then 
ended; references to 2010 mean at 2 October 2010 or the 53 weeks then ended. 
e) Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is 
measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value 
of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired 
and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, 
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), 
the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of 
the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been 
allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount 
of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested 
for impairment at that date. Goodwill of £15,080,000 written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not 
included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
f) r evenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions are satisfied: 
 a the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods;
 a the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the 
goods sold;
 a the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
 a it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and
 a the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Revenue for the Tesco Clubcard scheme is recognised on a gross profit basis as services are provided on an agency basis.
Sales returns are provided for based on past experience and deducted from income.
Interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured 
reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount 
on initial recognition.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established (provided that 
it is probable that the economic benefit will flow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured reliably).

2 ac countin G policies (continued)
g) exceptional items
The Group has identified certain items as exceptional where they relate to one-off costs incurred in the period that they do not expect to be 
repeated on an annual basis, or where Directors consider the separate disclosure to be necessary to understand the Group’s performance. 
The principles applied in identifying exceptional costs are consistent between periods.
h) property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives, on the following bases:
Freehold buildings    2% per annum on cost on a straight-line basis
Short leasehold land and buildings  over the period of the lease, up to 25 years on a straight-line basis
Fixtures and fittings    over 10 years or at 25% per annum on a reducing balance basis as appropriate
Motor vehicles    25% per annum on a reducing balance basis
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Residual value is calculated on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition.
Assets held in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes, or for purposes not yet determined, are carried at cost, 
less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the 
Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for 
their intended use.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of financial performance.
i) impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each period end, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets 
have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment 
at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset 
(cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset 
is carried at a re-valued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of 
its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had 
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income 
immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a re-valued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a 
revaluation increase.
j) inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and relate solely to finished goods for resale. Cost comprises purchase price of 
materials and an attributable proportion of distribution overheads based on normal levels of activity and is valued at standard cost. Net realisable 
value represents the estimated selling price, less costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for those items of 
inventory where the net realisable value is estimated to be lower than cost. The net replacement value of inventories is not considered materially 
different from that stated in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Inventories written down and expensed in the year amounted to £2,292,000 (2010: £2,493,000). Additionally £1,281,000 has been written 
off in relation to display inventories.

2 ac countin G policies (continued) 
k) taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of financial 
performance because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, and interests in jointly controlled 
entities, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax 
laws and rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of financial performance, 
except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities 
on a net basis.
l) foreign currency
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group 
company are expressed in Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated 
financial statements.
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the 
dates of transactions. At each period end, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing on that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the statement 
of financial performance for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in statement of financial performance 
for the period.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:
 a exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are included 
in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings;
 a exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see below under financial instruments/hedge 
accounting); and
 a exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely 
to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognised initially in other comprehensive income 
and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operation are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing at period end dates. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, 
unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of transactions are used. 
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, in the Group’s foreign exchange 
reserve. Such differences are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control 
over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, loss of joint control over a jointly controlled entity that includes a foreign operation, or loss of 
significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that operation 
attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss.

m) l eases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another 
more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed. Contingent rentals 
arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit 
of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative 
of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
n) investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
o) r etirement benefit costs
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the statement of financial performance in respect of pension costs is the contributions 
payable in the period. Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals 
or prepayments in the balance sheet.
p) finance costs
Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction of tangible fixed assets are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets. 
The commencement of capitalisation begins when both finance costs and expenditures for the asset are being incurred and activities that are 
necessary to get the asset ready for use are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to get the 
asset ready for use are complete.
All other finance costs of debt are recognised in the statement of financial performance over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the 
carrying amount.
q) financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose 
terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, plus 
transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value. 
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets “at fair value through profit or loss” (FVTPL), “held-to-maturity” 
investments, “available-for-sale” (AFS) financial assets and “loans and receivables”. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the 
financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
f inancial assets at f Vt pl
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL where the financial asset is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. The Group has 
no designated FVTPL financial assets.
A financial asset is classified as held for trading if:
 a it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future; or
 a it is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term 
profit-taking; or
 a it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. Fair value is determined in the manner 
described in note 2v.
loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified 
as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest 
income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant 
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees on points paid or received that 
form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the debt instrument, 
or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets and liabilities classified as at FVTPL.

impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired 
where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the 
estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 39 days, 
as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the differences between the asset’s carrying amount and the present 
value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, 
where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written 
off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes 
in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after 
the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount 
of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not 
been recognised.
c ash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash within three months and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire; or it transfers the financial 
asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and 
an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred 
financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
f inancial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued 
by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. The Group does 
not have any designated FVTPL liabilities.
A financial liability is classified as held for trading if:
 a it has been incurred principally for the purpose of disposal in the near future; or 
 a it is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit 
taking; or
 a it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. Fair value is determined in the 
manner described in note 2v.

o ther financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. 
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
derivative financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to manage these exposures. The Group does not hold or 
issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value 
at each period end date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is 
not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics 
are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised 
in profit or loss.
An embedded derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hybrid instrument to which 
the embedded derivative relates is more than 12 months and is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are 
presented as current assets or current liabilities.
r) share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied 
to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 October 2005.
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value 
(excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the share-based 
payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value 
is measured by use of the Black Scholes model. 
The Group provides employees with the ability to purchase the Group’s ordinary shares at 80% of the current market value through the operation 
of its share save scheme. The Group records an expense, based on its estimate of the 20% discount related to shares expected to vest on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
s) trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
t) o perating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs but before property disposals, investment income and finance costs.
u) provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of that obligation. Provisions are measured 
at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value 
where the effect is material.

v) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods.
The critical judgement, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the Directors have made in the process 
of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements is the 
detailed criteria for the recognition of revenue from the sale of goods set out in IAS 18 Revenue and, in particular, whether the Group has 
transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods. The Group only recognises revenue where this is the case.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the period end date, that have a significant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period, are discussed below:
impairment of property, plant and equipment
During the period, the Group has closed four stores in the UK, including some before their lease end dates. As the fixtures and fittings within these 
stores cannot be re-used in other locations within the Group, the carrying value of these assets has been fully provided for in the period. Additional 
impairments have been made for stores which are identified for conversion during the next financial period and for loss-making stores.
o nerous lease provisions
During the period the Group has continued to review the performance of its store portfolio, which has resulted in no further stores being exited 
before their lease term has expired (2010: eight stores). In respect of the leases in relation to stores exited before lease end dates in prior periods 
that are still vacant, the Group has provided for what it considers to be the unavoidable costs prior to lease termination or sublease. The Group 
has further reviewed any trading loss making stores and provided for those leases considered to be onerous. These estimates are based upon 
available information and knowledge of the property market. The ultimate costs to be incurred in this regard may vary from the estimates. 
dilapidations provision
The Group has estimated its likely dilapidation charges for its store portfolio and provided accordingly. This estimate involves an assessment of 
average costs per store and the expected exit period for the current portfolio, and is based on management’s best estimate, taking into account 
knowledge of the property market and historical trends. The ultimate costs to be incurred may vary from the estimates.
f air value of derivatives and other financial instruments
As described above, the Directors use their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an 
active market. Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied, such as discounted cash flows and assumptions regarding 
market volatility.
tax
The Directors are aware of the material impact that corporation tax has on the Group accounts and therefore they ensure that the Group continues 
to provide at a sufficient level for both current and deferred tax liabilities.

IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed 
by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. These segments comprise (a) Topps Tiles retail 
operations in the UK; (b) TCH retail operations in the UK; and (c) the Topps Floorstore operation in Holland, which was disposed of on 
22 December 2009.
Segment result represents the profit/(loss) earned by each segment without allocation of the central administration costs including Directors’ salaries, 
other gains and losses, investment income, finance costs, fair value loss on interest rate derivatives and income tax expense.
r evenues from major products and services and information about major customers
The Group’s principal activity, being a “specialist tile and woodflooring retailer”, is reported in the segments shown below and due to its wide 
product offering the disclosure of revenues from major products is not appropriate. As the Group’s revenue is derived from sales to the general 
public, it has no reliance on any individual major customer.
Geographical segments
The Group’s reporting format is by business segment. Although the Group operated in two geographic segments, the UK and Holland, during 
the previous period, neither the revenue from sales to external customers nor the value of net assets within Holland represented more than 10% 
of Group totals.
The following is an analysis of the Group’s revenue and results by reportable segment:

During 201 1, nine stores (2010: nine) were closed or converted and the Group conducted an impairment review of the fixed assets held by 
its loss-making stores resulting in an impairment of property, plant and equipment totalling £1,051,000. The Group also reviewed its potential 
exposure to future lease commitments pertaining to closed stores and the provision held for future dilapidation costs resulting in a charge of 
£1,862,000 (2010: £401,000). Additionally an assessment of the carrying value of display inventories has been performed leading to 
a write off of £1,281,000.

14 Goodwill
£’000
Cost and carrying amount at 26 September 2009 and 2 October 2010 and 1 October 201 1 245
The balance of goodwill remaining is the carrying value that arose on the acquisition of Surface Coatings Ltd in 1998.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill acquired 
in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units that are expecting to benefit from that business combination. 
Before recognition of any impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the TCH segment.
The recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding 
the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to, selling prices and direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount rates 
based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and 
direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. Discounted cash flows are calculated using a pre-tax 
rate of 7 .0% (2010: 7 .2%).

14 Goodwill (continued)
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and 
extrapolates cash flows for the following five years. The growth rate applied does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant 
markets. The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests of TCH’s carrying value. There are no reasonable changes that 
would result in the carrying value of goodwill being reduced to its recoverable amount. 
The accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty involved in assessing any impairment loss are referred to in note 2 to the 
financial statements.
As a result of the annual test of impairment of goodwill, no impairment has been identified for the current period.

Cumulative finance costs capitalised in the cost of tangible fixed assets amount to £nil (2010: £nil).
Contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment are detailed in note 31.
During the period, the Group has closed nine stores in the UK. As the fixtures and fittings within these stores cannot be re-used in other locations 
within the Group, the carrying value of these assets has been fully provided for in the period, with the associated impairment charge included 
within other operating expenses.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables at 1 October 201 1 and 2 October 2010 approximates to their fair 
value on the basis of discounted cash flow analysis.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade receivables.
The Group considers that it has no significant concentration of credit risk. The majority of sales in the business are cash based sales in the stores.
Total trade receivables (net of allowances) held by the Group at 1 October 201 1 amounted to £0.6 million (2010: £0.4 million). These amounts 
mainly relate to insurance generated sales, sundry trade accounts and Tesco Clubcard Scheme generated sales. In relation to these sales, the 
average credit period taken is 41 days (2010: 39 days) and no interest is charged on the receivables. Trade receivables between 60 days and 
120 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference to past default experience.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines 
credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers are reviewed periodically. Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the 
year, £105,000 (2010: £100,000) is due from Independent Inspections and £105,000 (2010: £104,000) is due from Tesco PLC, the Group’s 
two largest customers. 
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £131,000 (2010: £1 10,000) which are past due at 
the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still 
considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average age of these receivables is 168 days 
(2010: 124 days), however this ageing is distorted by four accounts totalling £1 1,000 (2010: £19,000) which are overdue by 299 days 
(2010: 202 days).
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables:
2011  
£’000
2010  
£’000
60 – 120 days 63 91
121 – 202 days 68 19
The allowance for doubtful debts was £104,000 by the end of the period (2010: £103,000). Given the minimal receivable balance, 
the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The allowance for doubtful debts includes £104,000 relating to individually impaired trade receivables (2010: £103,000) which are due from 
companies that have been placed into liquidation. 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately equal to their fair value.
18 c ash and cash equi Valents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits (with associated right of set off) net of bank overdrafts, 
with an original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value. A breakdown of significant 
bank and cash balances by currency is as follows:

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of the bank loan at 1 October 201 1 and 2 October 2010 approximates to its fair value since the 
amounts relate to floating rate debt.
The average weighted interest rates paid on the loan were as follows:
2011  
%
2010  
%
Loans 3.11 2.67
The Group borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Whilst the interest charge on the loan has fallen compared to the prior period, the Group has seen limited benefit due to the interest rate 
derivatives which negate the majority of any impact on the interest rate movement.
During the period the Group successfully re-financed its loan facilities and now has in place a £75.0 million committed revolving credit facility, 
expiring in May 2015. As at the financial period end £60.0 million of this facility was drawn, with a further £15.0 million of undrawn financing 
available. The loan facility contains financial covenants which are tested on a bi-annual basis.
At 1 October 201 1, the Group had available £15 million (2010: £5 million) of undrawn committed banking facilities.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2010. The capital 
structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 20, cash and cash equivalents disclosed in note 18 and 
equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 23 to 30.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis 
on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed

The Group considers itself to be exposed to risks on financial instruments, including market risk (including currency risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and 
cash flow interest rate risk. 
The Group seeks to mitigate the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures economically. The use 
of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign 
exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess 
liquidity. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. 
market risks
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group enters 
into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: 
 a forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the import of goods from South America and China; and 
 a interest rate swaps and collars to mitigate the risk of movements in interest rates.
foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Exchange rate 
exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:

foreign currency sensitivity analysis 
The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of China and Brazil (US dollar currency) and from various European countries (Euro) as a result of 
inventory purchases. The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in Sterling against the relevant foreign 
currencies. 10% represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis 
includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign 
currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of 
the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and other 
equity where Sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency.

Currency derivatives
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows. The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts 
in the management of its exchange rate exposures. The contracts are denominated in US dollars and Euros.
At the balance sheet date, the total notional amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed to are 
as below:
2011  
£’000
2010  
£’000
Forward foreign exchange contracts 4,778 4,356
These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the first half of 2012 and are renewed on a revolving basis 
as required.
At 1 October 201 1 the fair value of the Group’s currency derivatives is a £70,000 asset within other debtors and prepayments (note 17) 
(2010: an asset of £22,000). These amounts are based on market value of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Gains of £40,000 are included in investment revenues (note 9) (2010: losses of £4,000).
interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates. The risk is managed by the Group by 
maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and collars. The Group’s 
exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments at 
the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date 
was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis points increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management 
personnel and represents management’s assessment of the possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit would be impacted 
as follows:

interest rate derivatives
The Group uses interest rate derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings. 
The Group’s interest rate derivatives comprise:
 a 5 year interest rate cap with a notional value of £20 million (2010: £20 million) with interest capped at 6%
 a 5 year interest rate swap with a notional value of £20 million (2010: £20 million) paying interest at a fixed rate of 5.63%
 a 10 year cancellable collar with a notional value of £20 million (2010: £60 million) with a cap of 5.6% and a floor of 4.49%, the interest rate 
within this range is LIBOR less 0.4%. Where LIBOR falls below the floor the interest rate resets to a fixed level of 5.55% 
The fair value liability of the swaps entered into at 1 October 201 1 is estimated at £12,186,000 (2010: £10,557 ,000). Amounts of £1,630,000 
have been charged to the statement of financial performance in the period (2010: £2,780,000).
On 27 October 201 1 the Group settled the 5 year interest rate swap for a consideration of £476,000, additionally on 1 November 201 1 the 
Group entered into a legally binding agreement committing it to a partial trade termination amounting to 50% of the 10 year cancellable collar, 
which will be settled on 2 April 201 1 for a consideration of £6,240,000. 
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Management has 
considered the counterparty risk associated with the cash and derivative balances and do not consider there to be a material risk. The Group has 
a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. The Group’s exposure to its counterparties is reviewed periodically. Trade receivables 
are minimal consisting of a number of insurance companies and sundry trade accounts, further information is provided in note 17 . 
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained.
l iquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate 
reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity 
profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in note 20 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal 
to reduce liquidity risk further.
l iquidity and interest risk tables
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables have been drawn up 
based on the undiscounted cash flows (and on the assumption that the variable interest rate remains constant at the latest fixing level of 3.42009% 
(2010: 2.7 4665%)) of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both interest 
and principal cash flows.

The following table details the Group’s liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments. The table has been drawn up based on the 
undiscounted net cash inflows/(outflows) on the derivative instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows and (outflows) 
on those derivatives that require gross settlement. When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined

fair value of financial instruments
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:
 a Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates 
matching maturities of the contracts.
 a Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves 
derived from quoted interest rates.
 a Interest rate collars are measured using applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and market volatilities.
The fair values are therefore categorised as Level 2, based on the degree to which the fair value is observable. Level 2 fair value measurements 
are those derived from inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (level 1 categorisation) that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

The onerous lease provision relates to estimated future unavoidable lease costs in respect of closed, non-trading and loss making stores. 
The provision is expected to be utilised over the following four financial periods. The dilapidations provision represents management’s best 
estimate of the Group’s liability under its property lease arrangements based on past experience and is expected to be utilised over the 
following seven financial periods.

The Government announced in March 201 1 that it intended to reduce the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 23% by 1 April 2014, and the 
Finance Act 201 1, which was substantively enacted in July 201 1, included provisions to reduce the rate of corporation tax to 25% with effect from 
1 April 2012. Accordingly, deferred tax balances have been revalued to the lower rate of 25% in these accounts, which has resulted in a debit to 
the income statement of £23,000.

In the previous period the Group issued 17 ,109,302 shares as part of a placing and open offer on 27 November 2009. The issue increased the 
number of shares from 171,093,021 to 188,202,323. Under the arrangements of the placing, the Company issued shares in exchange for shares 
in Tail Finance Jersey Limited. No share premium was ultimately recorded in the Company’s financial statements through the operation of the 
merger relief provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The subsequent redemption of these shares gave rise to distributable profits of £14.3 million 
which were transferred to retained earnings. 
During the period the Group issued 163,479 (2010: none) ordinary shares with a nominal value of £5,449 (2010: £nil) under share option 
schemes for an aggregate cash consideration of £26,694 (2010: £nil).
*During the period 122,000 (£4,000) shares were purchased by Topps Tiles Employee Benefit Trust on behalf of the Directors and Senior Management Team. These have not been 
paid for at the balance sheet date.

The transfer from the share premium account in the previous period arose from the firm placing and open offer in November 2009. Within these 
arrangements, the Company issued shares in exchange for ordinary shares and redeemable preference shares in Tail Finance Jersey Limited. 
No share premium was ultimately recorded in the Company financial statements through the operation of the merger relief provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The realised gain was taken after the deduction of transaction costs of £0.5 million, principally as a result of commissions and professional charges.
The subsequent redemption of these shares gave rise to distributable profits of £14.3 million which were transferred to retained earnings.
31 f inancial commitments
a) Capital commitments
At the end of the period there were capital commitments contracted of £300,000 (2010: £nil).

32 share- Based payments
The Group operates three share option schemes in relation to Group employees. 
equity-settled share option scheme
Options are exercisable at the middle market closing price for the working day prior to the date of grant and are exercisable three years from the 
date of grant if the employee is still employed by the Group at that date.

contractual life of one year (2010: one year).
o ther share-based payment plans
Employee share purchase plans are open to almost all employees and provide for a purchase price equal to the daily average market price 
on the date of grant, less 20%. The shares can be purchased during a two-week period each financial period. The shares so purchased are 
generally placed in the employee share savings plan for a three or five year period.

32 share- Based payments (continued)
The inputs to the Black-Scholes Model for the above two schemes are as follows:
2011 2010
Weighted average share price – pence 31.5 22.6
Weighted average exercise price – pence 25.2 18.1
Expected volatility – % 74.1 and 67.9 32.4
Expected life – years 3 or 5 3 or 5
Risk – free rate of interest – % 0.7 0.8
Dividend Yield – % 5.37 5.04
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three or five years (2010: 
same). The expected risk used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural forces.
deferred bonus long-term incentive plan
At the AGM in January 2010 a new deferred bonus long-term incentive plan (LTIP) was approved by shareholders. Under this long-term incentive 
plan a proportion of the annual bonus is deferred in the form of shares for a two year period with a matching share award that vests at the end 
of two years subject to the achievement of performance conditions. 25% of the annual bonus has been deferred into shares, on a net basis, 
for a two year period, with a further match on a gross basis which vests two years later subject to the achievement of performance conditions 
relating to continued employment in the business and EBITDA earnings growth measured over the two year period.
For the period ended 2 October 2010 it was determined that a bonus be paid equivalent to 50% of basic salary for Executive Directors and 
the members of the Senior Management Team. 25% of the annual bonus was deferred under the deferred bonus long-term incentive plan. 
The total number of shares due to be awarded was 121,959, and the fair value of these deferred shares as at 1 October 201 1 was £73,000 
(2010: £79,000).
The total number of matching shares that are expected to be awarded, subject to fulfilment of the performance conditions is 229,378, and the 
fair value of these matching shares as at 1 October 201 1 was £131,000. No options were granted or exercised during the period (2010: 
351,337). The options outstanding at 1 October 201 1 had a weighted average exercise price of £0.69 and a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of one year. During the period, matching shares concerning the 2010 bonus award were recognised as an expense. This 
amounted to £66,000 (2010: £nil).
The inputs to the Black-Scholes Model are as follows:
2011 2010
Weighted average share price – pence 65.8 60.0
Weighted average exercise price – pence – –
Expected volatility – % 45.3 81.6
Expected life – years 2 2
Risk – free rate of interest – % 0.6 0.8
Dividend Yield – % – –
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the 2009/10 and 2010/1 1 financial 
periods (2010: 2008/09 and 2009/10 financial periods). The expected risk used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural forces.
In total, the Group recognised a total expense of £176,000 (2010: £127 ,000 expense) relating to share-based payments.

On 27 October 201 1 the Group settled the five-year interest rate swap for a consideration of £476,000. Additionally on 1 November 201 1 
the Group entered into a legally binding agreement committing it to a partial trade termination amounting to 50% of the 10-year cancellable collar, 
which will be settled on 2 April 2012 for a consideration of £6,240,000. 
This will have the effect of reducing the Group’s annual interest charge moving forwards by approximately £1.25 million (at current LIBOR rates).

notes to the Company finan Cial statements 
For the 52 week period ended 1 October 201 1
1 Basis of accountin G
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention and in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
Based on a detailed review of the risks and uncertainties discussed within the Business Review, and management’s current expectations, the Board 
has a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue to meet all of its financial commitments as they fall due and will be able to continue 
as a going concern. 
The current economic climate and most recent trading period creates a degree of uncertainty in the outlook and our forecasts are sensitive to 
relatively small changes in sales and margin assumptions. This uncertainty, combined with the financial covenants included in our loan facilities, 
has led the Board to conduct a detailed review of a number of different trading scenarios and possible mitigating actions, should they be 
required. Mitigating actions would include further cost reductions, working capital management, reduced investment, freehold property disposal 
and possible review of dividend policy.
Based on this analysis the Board have concluded that in the event that the level of like-for-like sales highlighted in the current trading section 
of the CEO’s Report were to continue for the whole of the financial period ending 29 September 2012, some form of mitigating actions would 
be required but once taken into account the Group would fully meet all of its future financial commitments. The Board, therefore, considers 
it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the period and the preceding period.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value 
at the date of grant. The credit added to the cost of investment in those subsidiaries whose employees receive the benefit of the share options 
is £127 ,000 (2010: £38,000). In respect of the deferred long-term bonus incentive plan, the share-based payment charge within the Company 
is £32,000 in respect of the matching share award (2010: £79,000 in respect of the deferred share award).
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 8 from disclosing transactions with other members of the Group and the exemption 
in FRS 29 for making disclosures relating to financial instruments. 
2 pr ofit for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the

n o tes
1. The right to vote at the meeting is determined by reference to the register of members. Only those members registered in the register of 
members of the Company as at 10.00am on 8 January 2012 (being 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting) or, in the event 
that the meeting is adjourned, in the register of members 48 hours before the time of any adjourned meeting, shall be entitled to attend 
or vote at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to entries in the register of members 
after 10.00am on 8 January 2012 or, in the event that the meeting is adjourned, after 48 hours before the time of any adjourned meeting, 
shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
2. A member is entitled to appoint one or more persons as proxies to exercise all or any of his rights to attend, speak and vote at the meeting. 
A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A form of proxy is enclosed and notes for completion can be found on the form and 
should be read carefully before it is completed. To be valid, the form of proxy must be completed, signed and sent to the offices of the 
Company’s registrars, Capita Registrars, PXS, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU together with the power of 
attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a notarially certified or office copy of the same, so as to arrive no later than 
10.00am on 8 January 2012 (or, in the event that the meeting is adjourned, no later than 48 hours before the time of any adjourned meeting).
3. A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached 
to a different share or shares held by him. To appoint more than one proxy, you will need to complete a separate proxy form in relation 
to each appointment. You may photocopy the enclosed proxy form, indicating clearly on each proxy form the name of the proxy you wish 
to appoint and the number of shares in relation to which the proxy is appointed. All forms must be signed and should be returned together 
in the same envelope. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the proxy form. The right 
of a member under section 324 of the Companies Act 2006 (“2006 Act”) to appoint a proxy does not apply to a person nominated 
to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the 2006 Act.
4. The appointment of a proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting in person at the meeting if he or she so wishes.
5. As at the close of business on the date of this notice, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 188,365,802 Ordinary Shares 
of 3
1
⁄3p each. Each Ordinary Share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company.
6. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. 
If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) 
as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the meeting. The notes to the proxy form explain how to direct your 
proxy to vote on each resolution or withhold their vote.
7 . In the case of joint holders, where more than one joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment submitted by the most 
senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register 
of members in respect of the joint holding (the first named being the most senior).
8. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the 
procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members and those CREST members who 
have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) who will be able to take the 
appropriate action on their behalf.

9. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy 
Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited (formerly CRESTCo’s) specifications and must 
contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the 
appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so 
as to be received by the issuers’ agent (ID RA10) by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments specified in this notice. For this purpose, 
the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from 
which the registrars are able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of 
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. CREST members and, where 
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special 
procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST 
Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or 
sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such 
action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the 
CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
10. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001.
1 1. Where a copy of this notice is being received by a person who has been nominated to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the 
2006 Act (“nominee”):
(a) the nominee may have a right under an agreement between the nominee and the member by whom he was appointed, 
to be appointed, or to have someone else appointed, as a proxy for the meeting; or
(b) if the nominee does not have any such right or does not wish to exercise such right, the nominee may have a right under any such 
agreement to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights.
12. Capita Registrars maintain the Company’s share register. They also provide a telephone helpline service on 0871 664 0300 (calls cost 10p 
a minute plus network extras. Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday). If you have any queries about voting or about your 
shareholding, please contact Capita Registrars.
13. Members have the right to ask questions at the meeting in accordance with section 319A of the 2006 Act.
14. The following documents are available for inspection by members at the registered office of the Company (except Bank Holidays) during the 
normal business hours and at the place of the meeting not less than 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting:
(a) the register of Directors’ interests required to be kept under section 809 of the 2006 Act; and

THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING of the Company will be held at the Company’s premises at Thorpe Way, Grove Park, Enderby, 
Leicestershire LE19 1SU on 10 January 2012 at 10.00am.
Four of the resolutions are to be taken at this year’s Annual General Meeting as special business. By way of explanation of these and certain 
other resolutions:
o r dinary Business
r esolution 2
declaration of f inal dividend
A final dividend of 0.6p per Ordinary Share is recommended by the Directors for payment to shareholders on the register of members of the 
Company at the close of business on 30 December 201 1. Subject to approval by the Ordinary Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, 
the dividend will be paid on 31 January 2012. An interim dividend of 0.5p was declared on 8 July 201 1 which means the total dividend level 
will be 1.1p per Ordinary Share for the 52 weeks prior to 1 October 201 1.
r esolutions 3 to 8
r e-election of directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require that all members of the Board of Directors submit themselves for re-election at least every three 
years with the exception of the Rt. Hon. J.M. Jack who has served for at least nine years and therefore retires and offers himself for re-election 
annually. Although not required by the Company’s articles, each of the remaining Directors will, in the interests of good corporate governance, 
retire voluntarily and offer himself for re-election. Brief biographical details about all the Directors appear on page 26 of the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements, with the exception of Claire Tiney, whose details can be found on our website at www.toppstiles.co.uk.
special Business
r esolution 11
appointment of authority to issue shares
The right of the Directors to allot further shares in the capital of the Company requires in most cases the prior authorisation of the shareholders 
in general meeting under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”). Resolution 1 1 will be put to members as special business 
to authorise the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares with a nominal value of £2,090,651 out of the Company’s unissued share capital representing 
approximately 33.3% of the Company’s current issued share capital (excluding shares held in treasury). The Company currently holds nil Ordinary 
Shares in treasury. The Directors have no current intention of exercising the authority contained in Resolution 1 1 to allot further shares. The authority 
shall expire immediately following the Annual General Meeting next following the resolution or, if earlier, 15 months following the resolution 
being passed.
Relevant Securities means:
 a Shares in the Company other than shares allotted pursuant to an employee share scheme (as defined by section 1 166 of the 2006 Act); 
a right to subscribe for shares in the Company where the grant of the right itself constituted a Relevant Security; or a right to convert securities 
into shares in the Company where the grant of the right itself constituted a Relevant Security.
 a Any right to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in the Company other than rights to subscribe for or convert any security into 
shares allotted pursuant to an employee share scheme (as defined by section 1 166 of the 2006 Act). References to the allotment of Relevant 
Securities in the resolution include the grant of such rights.
r esolution 12
disapplication of statutory rights of pre-emption
This proposed resolution seeks to obtain power under section 571 of the 2006 Act to enable the Directors to allot, for cash, shares with an 
aggregate nominal value of £313,629 equal to approximately 5% of the Company’s current issued share capital without being required first 
to offer such securities to existing shareholders. The Company will thereby be given greater flexibility when considering future opportunities 
but the interests of existing shareholders will be protected as, except in the case of a rights issue or the allotment of shares under the Company’s 
share option schemes, the Directors have no present intention to exercise its authority under this resolution to allot any part of the unissued share 
capital of the Company or, without the prior approval of the Company in general meeting, to make any issue which would effectively alter the 
control of the Company or the nature of its business. This authority will expire immediately following the Annual General Meeting next following 
the resolution or, if earlier, 15 months following the resolution being passed.

r esolution 13
authority to purchase o rdinary shares
At the Annual General Meeting, Ordinary Shareholders are being invited under Resolution 13 to grant authority to the Company to make market 
purchases of its Ordinary Shares. It is proposed such authority shall expire on the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2013 
or 12 months from the date of this resolution, if earlier. This authority will be limited to the purchase of not more than 14.9% of the Ordinary Shares 
currently in issue. This represents the maximum amount of Ordinary Share capital in issue which is permitted before tender or partial offer to 
all shareholders is required to be made to perform any share buy-back. The maximum price payable under this authority will be 105% of the 
average of the middle market quotations of an Ordinary Share for the five business days before the relevant purchase and the minimum price 
will be 3
1
⁄3p per Ordinary Share. In considering whether or not to purchase Ordinary Shares under the market purchase authority, the Directors 
will take into account cash resources, the effect on gearing and other investment opportunities before exercising the authority. In addition, the 
Company will only exercise the authority to make such a purchase in the market when the Directors consider it is in the best interests of the 
shareholders generally to do so and it should result in an increase in Earnings per Ordinary Share. As at 30 November 201 1, there were 
options to subscribe for 6,080,346 equity shares outstanding under various schemes representing approximately 3.2% of the current issued 
share capital of the Company. If the authority sought by Resolution 13 was exercised in full, the number of outstanding options would represent 
approximately 3.8% of the issued share capital following the repurchase of shares.
r esolution 14
n otice period for general meetings
This resolution is required to reflect the implementation in August 2009 of the Shareholder Rights Directive. The regulation implementing this 
Directive increased the notice period for general meetings of the Company to 21 days. Previously the Company was able to call general 
meetings (other than an AGM) on 14 clear days’ notice and would like to preserve this ability going forward. In order to be able to do so 
shareholders must approve the calling of meetings on 14 days’ notice. Resolution 14 seeks such approval. The approval will be effective 
until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed. The Company will also 
need to meet the requirements for electronic voting under the Directive before it can call a general meeting on 14 days’ notice.

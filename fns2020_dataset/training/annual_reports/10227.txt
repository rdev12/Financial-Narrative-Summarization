Highlights
Microsaic_pp01_07  26/03/2015  15:49  Page 1 I am pleased to present the Company’s
Annual Report & Financial Statements for
the year ended 31 December 2014. 
Delivering on our strategic aims
We established a number of business objectives for 2014 to
underpin our ambitions and I am pleased to announce
progress in all areas as follows.
An increased investment in marketing and communications
has been undertaken to promote your Company, its
products, technologies and core brand values. This has led
to an increasing amount of in-bound interest in our
products from potential partners and customers. We
anticipate this continuing as we move forward.
In 2014 we signed two further OEM agreements. One is
with Gilson Inc. for our single quadruple unit (the 4000
MiD®) and a second with a leading global scientific
Company for our triple quadrupole mass spectrometry
technology.
In addition, we signed an important agreement with Plexus
Corp. for the manufacture of the 4000 MiD
®
. This will
facilitate the scaling up of our production capabilities to
meet increasing demand. It will enable your Company to
optimise its potential now and in the future.
Our R&D programmes remain key areas in which we
continue to invest, and we were pleased to announce early
in 2014 the launch of the MiDas™, a compact interface
module. This new product is intended to extend the use of
the 4000 MiD
®
more widely throughout the scientific
research community. Further exciting R&D programmes are
in various stages of planning and development to ensure
your Company remains at the forefront of its chosen fields.
Financial results 
Microsaic generated revenues of £1.20 million in 2014, an
increase of 32% over 2013 revenues (£0.91 million). The
growth in consumable revenue is particularly noteworthy.
The loss before tax of £3.16 million (2013: loss of
£2.40 million), is a result of a larger cost base and is a
reflection of our continued investment in the future of your
Company as we lay the foundations and structures for a
successful commercial enterprise.
Shareholders 
The board is grateful for the ongoing support of
shareholders which allowed your board to raise further
funds of £4.1 million (after expenses) in October. These will
provide the essential working capital required by your
Company to finance its continuing growth and evolution.
Staff
On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my gratitude
to our staff for their hard work, loyalty and for continuing to
innovate, which is vital to the future success of the
Company.
In addition, I am pleased to announce the appointment of
Glenn Tracey as Chief Operating Officer. This is a new and
important role given the increasing number of opportunities
now available to your Company. Glenn will join the
management team and report directly to Colin Jump.
The Board
As previously announced, Andrew Darby joined as our
Finance Director in April, taking over from Malcolm
Bateman. Peter Edwards, Technical Director, retired from the
Board and Company in July. We thank both Malcolm and
Peter for their important contributions to the business and
wish them every success in the future.
Outlook
With the progress that the Company made in 2014 and the
new announcements in 2015, the Board remains confident
that Microsaic is well-positioned to capitalise on its
leadership in its chosen fields and grow the business over
the coming years.

Chairman’s statement
for the year ended 31 December 2014
Microsaic_pp01_07  26/03/2015  15:49  Page 2 Microsaic Systems plc develops
microengineered analytical instruments that
are based on the scientific technique of
mass spectrometry (MS). MS is widely
accepted as one of the most reliable
methods for identifying the chemical
make-up of substances, and Microsaic is
the first and only company to have
commercialised and patented chip-based
MS technology using silicon
microengineering (MEMS).
The analysis method of choice
Mass spectrometry is an established analytical technique
used in many laboratories which enables the accurate
identification and quantification of trace levels of chemical
or biological compounds by recording their unique
molecular weight. Today, MS is the standard means of
measuring the composition of samples during
pharmaceutical development, and is also widely used in
other industries including healthcare, environmental safety,
food and drink, security, petrochemicals and mining. By
miniaturising MS to desk-top size, Microsaic has made it
practical for a much wider range of users and applications
within these fields and opens up new opportunities to
capture value from the growing $3.9 billion MS market.
A step change in laboratory capability
The Company’s first product, the Microsaic 3500 MiD
®
,
was launched in January 2011 and became the world’s
smallest MS system. Users are particularly impressed by the
self-contained nature of the system – no other mass
spectrometer for liquid analysis has eliminated external
pumps and computers – and this gives the MiD
®
a
revolutionary advantage in deployability, ease of use and
cost of ownership. These advantages have been recognised
within the wider industry too. The 3500 MiD
®
gained the
New Product Award from the US Society of Laboratory
Automation and Screening in 2011 and a prestigious R&D
100 award in 2012 as one of the most technologically
significant products to enter the marketplace globally.
Several articles have been published in scientific journals
citing new discoveries made using the MiD
®
.
Continuing evolution
The successor to the 3500 MiD
®
, the 4000 MiD
®
was
launched in March 2013 at Pittcon, the world’s largest
annual conference and exposition on laboratory science
and scientific instrumentation. The 4000 MiD
®
has an even
smaller footprint than the 3500 MiD
®
and fits even more
comfortably into a standard laboratory fume hood. Its ‘plug
& play’ components also enable users to maintain the
system themselves, resulting in less down-time and greater
flexibility within the laboratory. 
To further expand the marketplace for the 4000 MiD
®
, in
January 2014 the Company launched the MiDas™
compact interface module to extend the use of MS in the
laboratory from specialist analytical chemists to the wider
research community. The MiDas™ connects to the 4000
MiD
®
and offers automated sample preparation and
handling for direct MS analysis in real time at the lab bench
or in the fume hood.
The Company has an on-going R&D programme building
on the achievements already made and focused on
increasing the reach of its core Ionchip
®
technology, which
underpins the MiD
®
. The product pipeline includes more
sophisticated MS systems that will allow the Company to
address more technically demanding market areas, such as
food and drink, and environmental safety. 
Tapping into established sales channels through
value-added partnerships
The Company’s strategy is to generate revenue streams by
introducing compact, deployable MS products, based on its
patented chip technologies, into a series of markets and
applications by selling through partnerships with existing
sales channels. Typically these sales channels will be
international suppliers of complementary equipment. 
Current partnerships are explained elsewhere in this report.
Further similar relationships are planned with other leading
suppliers of scientific equipment, which will enable the
Company to build up volume sales. Direct sales to end
users in niche application areas will also continue in
parallel, and since the year-end an agreement with Kinesis,
a leading international supplier of analytical consumables
and equipment, has been signed for distribution of
Microsaic-branded 4000 MiD
®
instruments in the UK,
Europe and India.
Manufacture of the non-chip based components of the
4000 MiD
®
has been out-sourced to Plexus, a leading
manufacturer to technology companies, in preparation for
production scale up. 
History of the Company
Microsaic Systems was established in 2001 from the highly
regarded Optical and Semiconductor Devices Group at
Imperial College London. It has been based at
headquarters in Woking, UK since September 2004 and
was admitted to AIM, a market of the London Stock
Exchange, in April 2011 (ticker: MSYS).

Strategic report – Company overview and business model
for the year ended 31 December 2014
Microsaic_pp01_07  26/03/2015  15:49  Page 3 4 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
Microsaic has enjoyed another highly
productive year in 2014, making good
progress in our on-going evolution into a
successful commercial business. We
continued to execute our strategy of
developing commercial partnerships with
international suppliers of complementary
equipment so that we can sell our products
through their existing sales channels. In
parallel, we made significant technological
advances that will in time give us the
capability needed for our next generation
of products. These will further broaden the
range of applications that our miniaturised
mass spectrometry (MS) instruments can
address.
Our technology and our products
Microsaic’s chip-based technology has allowed us to
miniaturise the mass spectrometer – the gold standard for
chemical analysis – far beyond any other product on the
market. This miniaturisation greatly simplifies deployment,
drastically reducing the overall cost of ownership and
makes MS much more accessible to lab scientists than it
has ever been before. 
Today we market two products. Our lead MS instrument is
the Microsaic 4000 MiD
®
, officially launched in March
2013. Sales of this product increased during the year,
mainly through our OEM partner, Biotage AB, which
features the 4000 MiD
®
as a core component of its
Isolera™ Dalton instrument. In January 2014, we launched
the MiDas™ compact interface module. This unit has been
designed to extend the use of MS in the laboratory from
specialist analytical chemists to the wider research
community. The MiDas™ unit connects to the 4000 MiD
®
and offers automated sample preparation and handling for
direct MS analysis in real-time at the lab bench or in the
fume hood
Commercial strategy
The main route to market for our product is as an original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) through partnerships with
companies that have established global sales channels.
These companies also have complementary products that
when combined with our product can deliver synergistic
benefits for the end users. 
We signed additional agreements during 2014 with Gilson
Inc. and with a leading global scientific company.
Our agreement with Gilson is for our 4000 MiD
®
to be
combined with Gilson’s high performance liquid
chromatography instruments. I am pleased to report that
initial units were shipped during January 2015 to Gilson
where further development of the final combined product is
being conducted.
Our agreement with a leading global scientific company is
for our triple quadrupole technology for use in applied
markets. Triple quadrupole technology provides us with an
opportunity to extend the application of MS to the analysis
of more complex materials, such as food, medical or
environmental samples.
Since the year-end we have signed a further OEM
agreement with GE Healthcare for a customised version of
our 4000 MiD
®
to be deployed, together with the MiDas™,
in combination with GE Healthcare’s instruments as an
innovative new analytical instrument for use in research and
healthcare applications.
Strategic report – Chief Executive’s review
for the year ended 31 December 2014
Microsaic_pp01_07  26/03/2015  15:49  Page 4 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 5
While commercial sensitivities prevent us disclosing more
detail on the agreements we have signed or specific
applications being targeted, we can state that we are
delighted with the high quality of our partners and the
strong working relationships we have established. This gives
us confidence that resulting products have the best
opportunity to fulfil their commercial potential. 
Outsourcing the manufacture of the non-chip based
components of the 4000 MiD
®
in preparation for
production scale up was a key strategic aim during 2014.
We were delighted therefore to sign an agreement in
September 2014 with Plexus, a leading manufacturer to
technology companies. The handover process is complete
and the first finished units were delivered to us in early
2015.
Furthermore, since the year-end we have signed a
distributor agreement with Kinesis, a leading international
supplier of analytical consumables and equipment, for the
distribution of the Microsaic-branded 4000 MiD
®
in the UK,
Europe and India. Demonstration units have already been
ordered and delivered.
We will continue to develop relationships with new potential
commercial partners in the pharma, biotech and other
targeted sectors.
Finally, to support our commercial strategy, we achieved
ISO 9001 accreditation during 2014.
R&D
Our marketing plan for 2014 continued to be directed
towards positioning Microsaic as a solution provider for
chemical analysis, rather than simply as a mass
spectrometer vendor. 
In line with this plan, we have been leveraging our technical
expertise to develop next-generation products that we
believe will significantly expand the range of applications
that our innovative MS instruments can address and that
end-users will increasingly demand.
In January 2014, we launched the MiDas™ compact
interface module, described earlier.
Our R&D in 2015 will be directed towards achieving
technical milestones in our OEM partnership opportunities,
as well as developing next-generation products to expand
our range of applications.
Microsaic maintains a large portfolio of patents, of which
52 are granted.
People
We have made significant investment in our business
development, customer services and engineering teams
over the last 18 months to position the Company for future
commercial growth. The emphasis over the next 12 months
will be to apply these teams in the execution of the business
we have already won. We will continue to recruit new talent
where it will complement the existing team in order to
maintain a market-leading position.
The Company’s Scientific Advisory Group, formed in 2013,
met a number of times during the year and has made
valuable contributions to the product marketing plan going
forward.
Performance Measurement
The ongoing performance of the Company is managed and
monitored using a number of key performance indicators. 
The Company’s revenues are monitored as follows:
Year to Year to 
31 December 31 December 
2014 2013 Inc/(Dec)
Revenue metrics £ £%

The growth in consumables income reflects the growing
user base.
The Company’s profit and cash are monitored as follows:
Year to Year to 
31 December 31 December 
2014 2013 Inc/(Dec)
Profit & cash metrics £ ££
Loss before share 
based payments,

investing activities (2,878,993) (2,552,302) –13%
Cash and cash 
equivalents 4,548,545 3,239,283 40%
The Company’s profitability is monitored through monthly
forecasting, which tracks where the business is and where it
is forecast to be at a certain date. The cash position is
monitored on a daily basis and re-forecast monthly.
The progress of the Company’s research and development
programmes is reviewed on a monthly basis by the senior
management team. Progress is summarised for the board.
Microsaic_pp01_07  26/03/2015  15:49  Page 5 Financial Results
In line with the Company’s transition from grant-generated
revenues to product sales, an accounting policy change
has been made to make the financial information more
relevant. This will also make it easier for users to
understand the financial statements. Accordingly,
non-product sales are now presented under ‘Other
operating income’ and cost of sales and operating
expenses have been re-categorised so that cost of sales
now includes only the raw materials cost of products sold.
Operating expenses represents the cost base of the
business. As a result of this accounting policy change,
comparative figures have been restated. 
Revenues increased 32% to £1,203,636 (2013:
£908,442). Product sales increased by 21%, with a full in
year contribution from Biotage, and consumables increased
by 73%, reflecting the growing user base. In line with the
Company’s transition from being reliant on income from
EU grants and prototype sales, other operating income was
lower at £102,145 (2013: £256,793). Gross margins were
42% (2013: 36%) and, accordingly gross profit was
£503,456 (2013: £326,919). 
We have noted that one distribution channel has delivered
softer than expected product sales in early 2015. The
causes of this issue have been identified and management
is taking steps to address this. The recently signed OEM
agreements will begin contributing to sales growth as
further new products are launched, anticipated in H2 2015
and 2016.
Operating expenses (excluding share-based payments) were
£3,713,881 (2013: £2,923,226). The increase in
operating expenses was mainly due to the Company’s
investment in the building of OEM partnerships, all of which
are located overseas, and the investment in the
manufacturing process to make it capable of being
outsourced and ready for mass production. 
Therefore, the loss for the period, before share-based
payments, tax and interest, was £3,108,280 (2013:
£2,339,514). 
In October, the Company placed 10,500,000 ordinary
shares with new and existing shareholders. This represented
a 20% increase in the Company’s issued share capital. The
gross proceeds raised from the issue amounted to
£4.4 million. The cash position at 31 December 2014 was
£4.55 million (2013 £3.24 million).
As with previous years, the going concern basis has
continued to be adopted in preparing the financial
statements. Following the progress made by the Company
to date and the progress anticipated in the near term, the
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company
will have access to adequate funds to continue operations
for at least 12 months. Further details are provided in the
notes to the financial statements.
Outlook 
The Board is pleased with the progress that Microsaic has
made across all areas of its business in 2014. We have
signed a further three OEM agreements targeting specific
applications, a manufacturing agreement that provides
capacity to meet expected commercial demand and a
distributor agreement for our own branded instruments in
key markets. Together, this provides Microsaic with a strong
base for the business to move forward and is a significant
step forward from our position 12 months ago. 
We are continuing to gain increasing recognition for the
potential of our innovative MS technologies and new
products within the scientific analytical instrumentation
market, where we believe we have an opportunity to make
MS accessible across a broader range of applications and
to a much larger number of lab scientists than ever before.
We are focused on three business objectives that underpin
our ambitions for 2015 and beyond:
• Executing on our existing OEM agreements and
distributor agreement
• Developing further OEM partnerships with synergistic
companies, which can provide Microsaic with access to
enhanced sales distribution channels alongside our
own direct sales channel, and
• Furthering innovation and maintaining a leadership
position in the field of miniaturised MS, which
continues to be a core driver of our ongoing
commercial strategy
All our activities are aligned to these priorities. Our ‘plug &
play’ usability designs remain unique and the increasing
market acceptance of our chip-based technology will
provide the platform for further growth and differentiation
from competitors. We remain intent on broadening the
application base and enhancing user experience of the
MiD
®
in order to make it the benchtop analytical tool of
choice for chemists. It is my belief that these strengths and
focused strategy continue to put Microsaic Systems in a
strong position to capitalise in an evolving market.

Employees
The Company regards the expertise and contributions of its employees as crucial to the future success of the business. The
Company engages its employees to understand all aspects of the business and seeks to remunerate its employees fairly. The
Company gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment received regardless of age, gender, colour,
ethnicity, disability, nationality, religious beliefs or sexual orientation. The Board takes account of employees’ interests when
making decisions and suggestions from employees aimed at improving the Company’s performance are encouraged.
Company share ownership plans
The Company operates two Share Ownership Plans for the benefit of its employees and Directors, an Employee Share
Option Scheme (ESOS) and a Share Incentive Plan (SIP), which has now been withdrawn for new entrants.
The ESOS was formed in 2006 to enable the incentivisation of key employees to be aligned to the performance of the
Company. Under the ESOS the Company grants to employees options to acquire the Company’s ordinary shares subject
to:
— vesting periods (normally 3 years for new grants)
— a total exercise period of 10 years from date of grant
— the exercise price normally being the market price of the ordinary shares at the date of grant
— performance conditions, as appropriate 
Options are granted up to the maximum amount allowed under the limits of the Enterprise Management Incentive (‘EMI’)
Scheme – these options are called ‘Approved Options’. The EMI scheme is subject to the provisions of Schedule 5 of the
Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. Any options granted above EMI limits are ‘Unapproved Options’.
The SIP has been withdrawn for new entrants during 2014 and an alternative plan is under consideration. There is
currently one remaining employee within the plan. It enabled all employees (subject to minimum service criteria) the
opportunity to take a continuing stake in the Company. It was approved by HMRC in November 2012 and operated for
the first time in 2013. A Plan Trust was established for the purposes of acquiring the Company’s shares. In accordance
with SIP regulation employees could invest up to £1,500 from gross pay in any one year which was used to acquire shares
known as ‘Partnership Shares’ and held within the Plan Trust. The Company was able to issue ‘Matching Shares’ in
proportion to the Partnership Shares and also award employees with ‘Free Shares’. Matching Shares and Free Shares
vested on the completion by the participating employee of a further three years’ service (and certain other events), and
could be withdrawn from the plan tax-free after five years’ service.
The option pool is defined as the amount of options available to be granted under the Company’s existing shareholder
mandate.
Microsaic_pp08_19  26/03/2015  15:51  Page 10 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 11
The Company received approval at its 2011 AGM to issue equity securities to employees and Directors on conversion
of their options up to a maximum of 10% of the Company’s issued share capital over a rolling ten year period. At
31 December 2014 63,253,376 shares were in issue, and so the maximum option pool was, therefore, 6,325,338.
3,155,391 unexercised options had been granted to employees and 11,977 shares had been issued to the SIP . During the
last 10 years 1,958,900 equity securities had been issued in respect of converted options. Thus the remaining option pool
was 1,199,070.
Management of risk
The management of operational risk is covered in the Risk Management Report. Financial risk is managed as follows:
Liquidity risk
The Company finances its operations from equity funding provided by shareholders and revenues generated by the
business. The Company seeks to manage liquidity risk to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet requirements. 
The Company invests its cash reserves in bank and money market deposits as a liquid resource to fund its operations. The
Company’s strategy for managing cash is to maximise interest income at low risk whilst ensuring availability to match the
profile of the Company’s cash flows.
Interest rate risk
The Company does not face any significant interest rate risk as it has no borrowings.
Surplus funds are invested to maintain a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return whilst
investing funds safely.
Credit risk
The Company manages its credit risk in cash and cash equivalents by spreading surplus funds between creditworthy
financial institutions. 
The Company is also exposed to credit risk attributable to trade and other receivables. The maximum credit risk in respect
of the financial assets at each period end is represented by the balance outstanding on trade and other receivables. The
Company has limited exposure to credit risk, as the majority of its trade and other receivables are due from major
international corporations and institutions. 
Foreign currency risk
The Company is based in the United Kingdom and the majority of its transactions are denominated in pounds sterling.
The Company has no long term commitments to purchase goods or services in foreign currencies. Purchases denominated
in foreign currency are expensed at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction, and comprise an
immaterial proportion of the Company’s total expenditure. 
The only assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies relate to trade receivables and trade payables with
overseas counterparties together with small balances of US dollar and Euro currencies to settle these liabilities. The risks
and sums involved are considered to be immaterial.
Where a significant transaction in a foreign currency is anticipated with a high degree of certainty, the Company takes out
a forward exchange contract to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuation. No such instruments were held at 31 December
2014.
Health and safety and the environment
The Company is committed to providing a safe environment for its staff and other parties for whom it has a responsibility.
It has set up systems and processes to ensure compliance with health and safety legislation and the Board considers health
and safety matters at its regular monthly meetings.
The Company is also mindful of its corporate responsibilities concerning the impact of its activities on the environment and
seeks to minimise this impact wherever possible.
Microsaic_pp08_19  26/03/2015  15:51  Page 11 Directors’ indemnity and insurance
The Company has granted an indemnity to its Directors under which the Company will indemnify them, subject to the terms
of the deed of indemnity, against all costs, charges, losses, damages and liabilities incurred by them in the performance of
their duties.
The Company also maintains insurance for its Directors and Officers against the consequences of actions brought against
them in relation to their duties for the Company.
Related party transactions
The interests of the Directors are shown above and their remuneration is detailed in the Directors’ remuneration report.
There were no other related party transactions.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors
have prepared the company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union and applicable law. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the profit or
loss of the company for that period. 
In preparing the financial statements the Directors are required to:
— select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
— make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
— state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Statement of disclosure to auditors
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware.
Additionally the Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
Saffery Champness have expressed their willingness to remain in office as auditors of the Company, and a resolution for
their re-appointment will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
This Directors’ Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 20 March 2015 and signed on its behalf.

for the year ended 31 December 2014
Microsaic_pp08_19  26/03/2015  15:51  Page 12 This report on the Directors’ remuneration sets out the Company’s policy on the remuneration of Executive and
non-executive Directors, together with details of Directors’ remuneration packages and service contracts. 
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy for executive Directors, determination of their individual remuneration packages and their
performance appraisals have been delegated to the Board’s Remuneration Committee comprising three non-executive
Directors.
Remuneration of the executive Directors
In setting remuneration for executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee considers a number of factors including:
— the basic salaries and benefits available to executive Directors of comparable companies;
— the need to pay executive Directors a competitive salary in line with the nature and complexity of their work;
— the need to attract and retain executive Directors of an appropriate calibre;
— the need to ensure executive Directors’ commitment to the continued success of the Company by means of incentive
schemes; and
— the need for the remuneration awarded to reflect performance.
Remuneration of the non-executive Directors
The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is agreed by the Board following recommendation by the Remuneration
Committee, having a view to rates paid in comparable organisations and appointments. The non-executive Directors do
not receive any pension, bonus or other benefits from the Company. Since becoming a public limited company, no share
options have been issued to non-executive Directors and non-executive Directors are not entitled to participate in any
Company share option schemes. 
Remuneration of the Directors
The Remuneration of the executive Directors consists of a basic salary, a contributory personal pension and life assurance. 
The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is an annual fee, paid monthly. Non-executive Directors are engaged on
service contracts and are not employees.
Share options
It is the normal practice of the Company to award share options to executive Directors on joining the Company. The award
of additional options to executive Directors, as well as to other employees, is reviewed annually.

Directors’ remuneration report (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 2014
Microsaic_pp08_19  26/03/2015  15:51  Page 14 As an AIM-listed company, Microsaic Systems plc is not required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code
(2010), a set of recommended corporate governance principles for UK public companies issued by the Financial Reporting
Council. However, the Directors support high standards of corporate governance and have established a set of corporate
governance principles which they regard as appropriate for the size, nature and stage of development of the Company
based on the QCA Guidelines. 
The Board
The Board currently comprises six Directors consisting of the Chairman, two executive Directors (the CEO and Finance
Director), and three non-executive Directors.
The Chairman is a non-executive Director.
Directors appointed by the Board are subject to re-election by shareholders at the following Annual General Meeting and
thereafter Directors are subject to re-election at least every three years.
Independence of the non-executive Directors
The Board believes that its non-executive Directors are independent. While some of these Directors have significant
shareholdings in the Company, the Board believe that the advice and behaviour of its non-executive Directors is
independent and at all times in the best interest of all shareholders equally. In addition, the skills and business judgement
which they possess and exercise contribute to ensuring that the Company is managed in an efficient, effective and
entrepreneurial manner. 
The Board keeps under review the relevance and appropriateness of the non-executives’ skills in light of the continuing
evolution of the marketplace, technology and business strategy.
Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Company is managed in an efficient, effective and entrepreneurial manner.
These responsibilities include oversight of and approval of (in line with agreed authority limits) corporate strategy, financial
budgets, corporate performance, approval of major capital expenditure, executive performance and the framework of
internal controls.
Role of the Management Team
The Management team is composed of the Executive Directors and a number of senior managers. This team is responsible
for the day to day execution of the strategy of the business. Within agreed authority limits they run the operations of the
business and work towards defined goals and KPIs that are embedded within the Company’s strategy, budget and
performance goals.
The team meets once per month. 
Engagement with staff
The Senior Management team holds a quarterly meeting with all the staff within the Company, to communicate progress
and to receive feedback on improvements to operations in line with the achievement of Company goals.
Board processes
The Board has an established Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee with formally delegated responsibilities to
assist with the execution of its responsibilities.
The full Board holds regular meetings on a monthly basis and additional meetings at any other times as may be necessary
to deal with any urgent matters that arise. The agenda for Board meetings is prepared by the Executive Directors (following
an established framework) and agreed with the Chairman. All submissions are circulated in advance to allow due
consideration of matters therein. 
The Executive Directors prepare regular reports which allow the Board to assess the Company’s activities and review its
performance and the Board has clearly specified the levels of authority delegated to management. Members of the
Company’s management team are involved in Board discussions, as required, and non-executive Directors are able to
have discussions with other employees where they feel it is appropriate. Non-executive Directors also have the authority to
seek external independent advice as they think fit at the expense of the Company.

Corporate governance report
for the year ended 31 December 2014 
Microsaic_pp08_19  26/03/2015  15:51  Page 15 The Board is ultimately responsible for the Company’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. This
includes financial, operational and compliance controls and risk-management systems. Internal control systems are
designed to meet the Company’s particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed. The internal control systems are
designed to minimise rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and by their nature can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against misstatement and loss.
Conflicts of interest
Directors must keep the Board advised of any interest that could potentially conflict with those of the Company. Where a
material conflict exists, the Director concerned is not present at the meeting whilst the relevant matter is considered.

Audit Committee
The remit of the Audit Committee is documented in its terms of reference which were adopted by the Board of Directors on
31 March 2011.
The purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for corporate
governance, financial reporting, corporate control and risk management. The Audit Committee normally meets at least
twice a year and, amongst other things, reviews the annual report and accounts and interim statements with the external
auditors. The Committee also approves external auditors’ fees and ensures auditors’ independence as well as focusing on
compliance with legal requirements and accounting standards. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the
annual financial statements and interim statements remains with the Board.
The members of the Audit Committee for 2014 were E M Yeatman (Committee Chairman), C J Nicholl, J C Ramage and
A S Holmes. The external auditors, the Chief Executive Officer, Finance Director and other executives may be invited to the
Audit Committee meetings at the discretion of the Committee. 
The Audit Committee met twice in 2014.
Remuneration Committee
The remit of the Remuneration Committee is documented in its terms of reference which were adopted by the Board of
Directors on 31 March 2011.
The Remuneration Committee meets as required and at least once a year. Its responsibilities include reviewing the
performance of the executive Directors, setting their remuneration levels, determining the payment of bonuses and other
benefits and considering the grant of options under the Company share option schemes.
The members of the Remuneration Committee for 2014 were J C Ramage (Committee Chairman), A S Holmes and
EM Yeatman. 
The Remuneration Committee met six times in 2014.

Microsaic_pp08_19  26/03/2015  15:51  Page 16 Board nominations
The appointment of replacement or additional Directors is the responsibility of the Board as a whole. 
At this stage, it is not considered appropriate for the Company to have a formally constituted Nominations Committee,
however this will be kept under review.
Communications with shareholders
The Board aims to keep shareholders informed of all major developments concerning the Company. Information is
communicated through the following channels:
— The release of announcements, trading updates and interim financial statements through the Regulatory News Service
of the London Stock Exchange and on the Company’s website,
— The annual report and financial statements are sent to all registered shareholders,
— Face to face meetings with major shareholders following the release of interim and preliminary results
Notices of all meetings of shareholders are also sent to all registered shareholders.

Microsaic_pp08_19  26/03/2015  15:51  Page 17 18 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014
We have audited the financial statements of Microsaic Systems plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 on pages 20 to
41. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of
the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 12, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to
audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by
the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
— give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 December 2014 and of its loss for the year
then ended; and 
— have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
— have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic report and Directors’ report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

if, in our opinion:
— adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or
— the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
— certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
— we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

The principal activity of the Company continued to be the research, development and commercialisation of scientific
instruments. It is incorporated in England and its registered address is GMS House, Boundary Road, Woking, Surrey
GU21 5BX.
1. Accounting policies
The following principal accounting policies have been used consistently in the preparation of these financial
statements. 
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
and the interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) as adopted by the
European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
These financial statements have been prepared on the historic cost basis except where financial instruments are
required to be carried at fair value under IFRS. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts receivable from the sale of goods and services and from development contracts, net of
value added tax and trade discounts. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of
ownership of the goods passes to the customer, which is normally upon delivery. Revenue from rendering services is
recognised in the period in which the service is provided. Revenue from development contracts is recognised under
the percentage-of-completion method.
Change in accounting policy for non-product income
In line with the Company’s transition from grant-generated revenues to product sales, an accounting policy change
has been made to make the financial information more relevant. This will also make it easier for users to understand
the financial statements. Accordingly, non-product sales are now presented under ‘Other operating income’ and cost
of sales and operating expenses have been re-categorised so that cost of sales now includes only the raw materials
cost of products sold. Operating expenses represents the cost base of the business. As a result of this accounting
policy change, comparative figures have been restated as follows: £256,793 of ‘Revenue’ has been reclassified as
‘Other operating income’. £1,460,831 of ‘Cost of sales’ has been reclassified in ‘Operating Expenses’. 
Segmental reporting
The Company currently has one business segment, being the research, development and commercialisation of
scientific instruments. This is undertaken wholly within the United Kingdom. Revenue by geography is analysed
between the UK and non-UK. 
Intangible assets
Trademarks and patents are stated at historic cost of registration less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated
impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to operating expenses and calculated to write off the cost in equal annual
instalments over five years, which is considered to be a prudent estimate of their useful economic lives.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or production costs less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis to write-off the carrying
value of each asset to residual value over its estimated useful economic life as follows:
Plant and equipment – 20% to 33.3% on a straight line basis
Fixtures and fittings – 33.3% on a straight line basis

Microsaic_pp20_46  26/03/2015  15:49  Page 24 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 25
Pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for its employees. Contributions are charged
to the statement of comprehensive income in the period they are payable.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and
includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them into their present locations and
condition. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour and other direct
costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable selling
expenses.
Provisions
Provisions are established where the Directors have identified an obligation which is probable and where the amount
can be estimated reliably.
Taxation
Current taxes are based on the results of the Company and are calculated according to local tax rules, using the tax
rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date. 
The Company recognises research and development tax credits receivable in cash as a current asset under the
heading corporation tax receivable. Any difference with amounts actually received are dealt with as adjustments to
prior period tax.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method for all taxable temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax
is measured using currently enacted or substantially enacted tax rates. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and that
it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Foreign currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of
transaction, or forward contract rate, if applicable. All differences are taken to the statement of comprehensive
income.
Government grants
Grants towards revenue expenditure are released to the statement of comprehensive income as the related
expenditure is incurred.
Financial instruments
The Company has adopted both IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s statement of financial position when the
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is considered to be their carrying amount due to their short term maturity.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for
estimated irrecoverable amounts.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 2014
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Financial instruments (continued)
Financial liability and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after
deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an
accrual basis to the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method and are added to the
carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the value of the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Leases
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their useful
lives. Obligations under such agreements are included in liabilities net of the finance charges allocated to future
periods.
All other leases are considered operating leases, the costs of which are expensed on a straight line basis over the
lease term. Rent free periods and other incentives are spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Research and development
Expenditure on research is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale
• the Company intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it
• the Company has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset
• the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, this requires that there
is a market for the output from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used internally,
the asset will be used in generating such benefits
• there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
intangible asset, and
• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably
Costs incurred which do not meet the above criteria are expensed as incurred. No development costs have been
capitalised to date.
Share based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based payments”, the Company reflects the economic cost of awarding shares and
share options to Directors, employees and advisors by recording an expense in the statement of comprehensive
income equal to the fair value of the benefit awarded, fair value being determined by reference to option pricing
models. The expense is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period of the award.

2. Application of new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments to existing EU endorsed
standards and interpretations
New standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2014 and relevant to the Company’s results:
None.
New standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2014 not relevant to the Company’s results or
that do not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements, other than additional
disclosures:
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 
Consequential amendments resulting from the issue of IFRS 10, 11 and 12.
Requirement to account for interests in ‘Investment Entities’ at fair value under IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, or
IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, in the separate financial statements of a parent.
IAS 28 Investments in Associates
Consequential amendments resulting from the issue of IFRS 10, 11 and 12.
IAS 32 Financial instruments: presentation (revised)
Amendments require entities to disclose gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts set off in accordance with
the accounting standards followed, and the related net credit exposure. This information will help investors understand
the extent to which an entity has set off in its balance sheet and the effects of rights of set-off on the entity’s rights and
obligations. 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
New standard that replaces the consolidation requirements in SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities and
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. Standard builds on existing principles by identifying the
concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial
statements of the parent company and provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where
this is difficult to assess. 
Amendments to the transition guidance of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, thus limiting the requirements to provide adjusted comparative
information.
IFRS 10 exception to the principle that all subsidiaries must be consolidated. Entities meeting the definition of
‘Investment Entities’ must be accounted for at fair value under IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, or IAS 39, Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
New standard that deals with the accounting for joint arrangements and focuses on the rights and obligations of the
arrangement, rather than its legal form. Standard requires a single method for accounting for interests in jointly
controlled entities. 
Amendments to the transition guidance of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, thus limiting the requirements to provide adjusted comparative
information.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities
New and comprehensive standard on disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint
arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles. 
Amendments to the transition guidance of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, thus limiting the requirements to provide adjusted comparative
information.
New disclosures required for Investment Entities (as defined in IFRS 10).

2. Application of new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments to existing EU endorsed
standards and interpretations (continued)
IAS 36 Impairment of Assets
Amendments to the disclosure requirements regarding the measurement of the recoverable amount for impaired
assets.
IAS 39 Financial Instruments
Amendments to provide an exception to the requirement for discontinuation of hedge accounting in circumstances
where a hedging instrument is required to be novated to a central counterparty as a result of laws or regulations.
New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and relevant to the Company’s results:
None.
New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not relevant to the Company’s
results or do not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements, other than additional

recognition of employee contributions.
IAS 40 Investment Property 
Effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014 – Annual Improvements 2011-2013 Cycle: Amendments to
clarify the interaction between IAS 40 and IFRS 3.
IFRIC Interpretation 21 
Clarifies the identification and recognition of obligating events relating to the payment of levies.
New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective and not yet endorsed by the EU:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
New standard setting out the recognition and measurement of financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts
to buy or sell non-financial items.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
New standard specifying how and when revenue should be recognised and guidance for more informative and
relevant disclosures.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards above will have a material impact on the financial
statements of the Company in future periods beyond additional disclosure, this will be subject to a more detailed
review once the standards have been endorsed by the EU.
3. Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that sufficient funds will be
available for the Company to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of signing.
Microsaic_pp20_46  26/03/2015  15:49  Page 28 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 29
The Company’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and
position are set out in the strategic review sections within the annual report. 
The Company has been developing its technologies for the market place and as such has been absorbing funds. The
Company is now in the commercialisation phase of its development, and the financing of operations in the future will
be from employment of existing cash reserves and revenue from product sales. 
The Directors have prepared trading and cash flow projections that extend beyond 12 months from the date of this
report. These include increasing revenue levels which the Directors believe will be derived from the sale of its products
and are supported by market feedback that has been received. There is no certainty that the expected level of sales
will be achieved and if there were a significant shortfall it may be necessary for the Company to secure alternative
sources of funding to enable it to remain a going concern. Whilst the Company has been successful securing funding
in the past, this is no guarantee that it will be possible in the future. However, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Company will have access to sufficient funding to continue operations for at least 12 months from
the signing of this report and therefore they continue to adopt the going concern basis for the preparation of the
financial statements. 
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Accounting estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on past experience and other factors,
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates could, by
definition, differ from the actual outcome. 
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities within the next financial year are summarised below:
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that sufficient funds will be
available for the Company to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months. More details are provided in
note 3.
Revenue recognition 
The revenue recognised from development contracts reflects management’s best estimate about the contract’s
outcome and stage of completion. The Company’s management assesses the contracts at each balance sheet date,
including the costs to completion, which are subject to estimation uncertainty. 
Amortisation of trademarks and patents 
Capitalised costs relating to trademarks and patents are amortised over their estimated useful lives. As the product
development programme is still ongoing and the lifetime of the Company’s intellectual property is difficult to
determine, the Directors have applied a prudent estimate of five years. This assumption is reviewed at each balance
sheet date and amended if required.
Share based payments 
The calculation of the share based payments expense utilises assumptions and estimates (for example volatility, future
exercise rates) which may differ from actual results. Details of the assumptions are set out in note 23.
Research and development tax credits
The Company recognises research and development tax credits receivable in cash as a current asset under the
heading corporation tax receivable. These credits are subject to acceptance by HM Revenue & Customs and the
resulting cash receipt from HM Revenue & Customs may be greater or less than this amount.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)

5. Revenue
Throughout 2014 the Company operated in one business segment, that of research, development and commercialisation
of scientific instruments. All of the Company’s assets are held in the UK and all of its capital expenditure arises in the UK.
The geographical analysis of revenue was as follows:
Year to Year to
31 December 31 December

UK 145,465 69,377
Non-UK 1,058,171 839,065
1,203,636 908,442
Further attribution of the non-UK revenue is not possible due to the nature of the sales via OEM agreements which are
then distributed globally. 
One customer represented 74% of total revenue (2013: 84%).
6. Government grants
Included within the Company’s other operating income for the year ended 31 December 2014 is £98,637 (2013:
£157,841) from UK Government grants and European grant funded projects.
In 2013 the Company was awarded a grant of up to €308,000 under the European Commission’s 7th Framework
Programme as part of a consortium for a research project. Revenue of £95,233 has been recognised to date as the
Company believes it has fulfilled its practical and administrative obligations under this project and is committed to fulfilling
its future obligations, which are subject to European Commission reviews annually and final project sign-off in 2015.
In 2010 the Company was awarded a grant of up to €964,000 under the European Commission’s 7th Framework
Programme as part of a consortium for a research project. The project was completed during the year together with final
project sign-off by the European Commission. Revenue of £734,932 was recognised over the duration of the project.

The estimated fair values of the share options were calculated by applying the Black Scholes model. The period of
exercise for all options granted is between 1 and 10 years from date of grant and the vesting periods last up to
five years from the date of grant. The expected volatility has been determined by calculating the historical volatility
of the share price over the previous year. The model inputs were:

Share Incentive plan (SIP)
The SIP has been withdrawn for new entrants during 2014 and an alternative plan is under consideration. There is
currently one remaining employee within the plan. It enabled all employees (subject to minimum service criteria) the
opportunity to take a continuing stake in the Company. It was approved by HMRC in November 2012 and operated for
the first time in 2013. A Plan Trust was established for the purposes of acquiring the Company’s shares. In accordance
with SIP regulation employees could invest up to £1,500 from gross pay in any one year which was used to acquire shares
known as ‘Partnership Shares’ and held within the Plan Trust. The Company was able to issue ‘Matching Shares’ in
proportion to the Partnership Shares and also award employees with ‘Free Shares’. Matching Shares and Free Shares
vested on the completion by the participating employee of a further three years’ service (and certain other events), and
could be withdrawn from the plan tax-free after five years’ service.
At the year end the SIP held 11,977 ordinary shares (2013: 17,185) on behalf of the scheme participants. The fair value
of the Matching Shares is taken as the Company share price at the time of the granting, and this is charged to the
statement of income over the three year vesting period. The charge for 2014 was £458 (2013: £458).
Microsaic_pp20_46  26/03/2015  15:49  Page 39 24. Financial instruments
The Company’s financial instruments comprise cash and various trade receivables and trade payables that arise
directly from its operations. No trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are liquidity, currency and interest rate. The Board
oversees the management of these risks, which are summarised below.
Liquidity risk
The Company is financing its operations from equity funding provided by shareholders and revenues generated by the
business. The Company seeks to manage liquidity risk to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet requirements. 
The Company invests its cash reserves in bank and money market deposits as a liquid resource to fund its operations.
The Company’s strategy for managing cash is to maximise interest income at low risk whilst ensuring availability to
match the profile of the Company’s cash flows.
Interest rate risk
The Company does not face any significant interest rate risk as it has no borrowings.
Surplus funds are invested to maintain a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return whilst
investing funds safely.
Credit risk
The Company manages its credit risk in cash and cash equivalents by spreading surplus funds between creditworthy
financial institutions. 
The Company is also exposed to credit risk attributable to trade and other receivables. The maximum credit risk in
respect of the financial assets at each period end is represented by the balance outstanding on trade and other
receivables. The Company has limited exposure to credit risk, as the majority of its trade and other receivables are
due from major international corporations and institutions. 
Year to Year to

£ £
Trade receivables 183,529 178,132
Other receivables 307,207 126,988
490,736 305,120
Foreign currency risk
The Company is based in the United Kingdom and the majority of its transactions are denominated in pounds sterling.
The Company has no long term commitments to purchase goods or services in foreign currencies. Purchases
denominated in foreign currency are expensed at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction, and
comprise an immaterial proportion of the Company’s total expenditure. 
The only assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies relate to trade receivables and trade payables with
overseas counterparties together with small balances of US dollar and Euro currencies to settle these liabilities. The
risks and sums involved are considered to be immaterial.
Where a significant transaction in a foreign currency is anticipated with a high degree of certainty, the Company
takes out a forward exchange contract to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuation. No such instruments were held
at 31 December 2014.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 2014
Microsaic_pp20_46  26/03/2015  15:49  Page 40 Fair values
The Directors consider that there is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the financial
instruments at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013.
Capital management
The Company’s capital base comprises equity attributable to shareholders, particularly as represented by cash. As the
Company’s focus has been on establishing itself as a successful supplier of scientific instruments, the primary objective
in managing cash spend has been to achieve progress on product development and commercialisation in a cost
efficient manner and in managing liquidity risk to ensure the Company continues as a going concern.
25. Related party transactions
The remuneration paid to the Directors is shown in the Directors’ remuneration report.
There were no other related party transactions.
26. Control
As at 31 December 2014, no individual shareholder had a controlling interest in the Company.
27. Subsequent events
There have been no significant events after the balance sheet date, other than those disclosed in the Chairman’s
Statement and the Strategic Report.

3. Only those holders of ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the capital of the Company (“Shares”) registered on the
Company’s register of members at 6 p.m. on 15 May 2015 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting.
Appointment of proxies
4. Members entitled to attend, speak and vote at the Meeting (in accordance with Note 3 above) are entitled to appoint
one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote in their place. If you wish to appoint a proxy please use the form of proxy
enclosed with this document (the “Form of Proxy”). In the case of joint members, only one need sign the Form of Proxy.
The vote of the senior joint member will be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint members. For this
purpose, seniority will be determined by the order in which the names of the members appear in the register of members
in respect of the joint shareholding. The completion and return of the Form of Proxy will not stop you attending and
voting in person at the Meeting should you wish to do so. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. You may
appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or
shares held by you. If you choose to appoint multiple proxies use a separate copy of this form (which you may
photocopy) for each proxy, and indicate after the proxy’s name the number of shares in relation to which they are
authorised to act (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of Shares held by you). Please also indicate if the
proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and returned in the same envelope.
5. You can appoint the Chairman of the Meeting, or any other person, as your proxy. If you wish to appoint someone other
than the Chairman, cross out the words “the Chairman of the Meeting” on the Form of Proxy and insert the full name of
your appointee.
6. You can instruct your proxy how to vote on each resolution by ticking the “For” and “Against” boxes as appropriate (or
entering the number of shares which you are entitled to vote). If you wish to abstain from voting on any resolution please
tick the box which is marked “Vote Withheld”. It should be noted that a vote withheld is not a vote in law and will not be
counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes “For” and “Against” a resolution. 
If you do not indicate on the Form of Proxy how your proxy should vote, he/she can exercise his/her discretion as to
whether, and if how so how, he/she votes on each resolution, as he/she will do in respect of any other business (including
amendments to resolutions) which may properly be conducted at the Meeting.
A member that is a company or other organisation not having a physical presence cannot attend in person but can
appoint someone to represent it. This can be done in one of two ways: either by the appointment of a proxy (described in
Notes 4 to 6 above) or of a corporate representative. Members considering the appointment of a corporate
representative should check their own legal position, the Company’s articles of association and the relevant provision of
the Companies Act 2006.
A company incorporated in England and Wales or Northern Ireland should execute the Form of Proxy under its common
seal or otherwise in accordance with Section 44 of the Companies Act 2006 or by signature on its behalf by a duly
authorised officer or attorney whose power of attorney or other authority should be enclosed with the Form of Proxy.

7. The Form of Proxy and any power of attorney (or a notarially certified copy or office copy thereof) under which it is
executed must be received by Capita Asset Services at PXS1, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham BR3 4ZF , United
Kingdom at 11 a.m. on 15 May 2015 in respect of the Meeting. Any Forms of Proxy received before such time will
be deemed to have been received at such time. In the case of an adjournment, the Form of Proxy must be received
by Capita Asset Services no later than 48 hours before the rescheduled Meeting.
On completing the Form of Proxy, sign it and return it to Capita Asset Services at the address shown on the reverse of the
Form of Proxy. As postage has been prepaid no stamp is required. You may, if you prefer, return the Form of Proxy in a
sealed envelope to the following address: FREEPOST CAPITA PXS (this is all that is required on the envelope).
Termination of proxy appointments
8. In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company. Please send a signed hard copy notice clearly
stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment to Capita Asset Services at PXS1, 34 Beckenham Road,
Beckenham BR3 4ZF , United Kingdom.
In the case of a member which is a company incorporated in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, the revocation
notice must be executed under its common seal or otherwise in accordance with section 44 of the Companies Act 2006
or by signature on its behalf by an officer or attorney whose power of attorney or other authority should be included with
the revocation notice. 
If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received after the time of the Meeting or the taking
of the vote at which the proxy is used, then, subject to the paragraph directly below, your proxy will remain valid.
If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment in respect of the same Shares, the appointment received last before
the latest time for receipt of proxies will take precedence.
Completion of a Form of Proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting in person. If you have appointed a
proxy and attend the Meeting in person, your proxy appointment will be automatically terminated.
Issued shares and total voting rights
9. The total number of Shares in issue in the capital of the Company at the date of this notice is 63,385,376 ordinary
shares of 0.25p each. 
On a vote by a show of hands, every holder of Shares who (being an individual) is present in person, by proxy or (being
a corporation) is present by a duly authorised representative, not being himself a member, shall have one vote. On a poll
every holder of Shares who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every complete Share held by him
and such proportion of a vote that represents the number of fractions of a Share so held.

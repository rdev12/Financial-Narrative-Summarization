Coline McConville and Marc Watson.
My early priorities have been to ensure a smooth transition in the corporate governance of Shed and to
give leadership and support to the direction of the Group. I believe the Board is now working effectively
with a focus on Shed’s business strategy, creative ambition and financial performance.
A number of changes have been implemented and are worthy of comment. By appointing Claire Hungate
as Commercial Director, this vitally important part of the business now has a new focus and drive that will
ensure that the Group fully exploits its intellectual property. Jonathon Kemp assumed the role of Chief
Financial Officer in July 2009 and has continued to strengthen the financial discipline in the Group’s
companies.
The Chief Executive’s report highlights some of the Group’s achievements in a broadcast market which
continues to be nervous. We have sought to build on our reputation of delivering outstanding quality
programmes across a number of genres: from having long running drama in Waterloo Road and New Tricks
and now the award winning Garrow’s Law; to outstanding documentaries like Born to be Different; and
thought provoking factual entertainment like World’s Strictest Parents and Blood Sweat and Luxuries.
Significantly, we have had increasing success in the US market with the making of Who Do You Think You
Are? US and The Marriage Ref. Creating a successful and sustainable US operation is now well underway and
the investment made to date is delivering demonstrable results.
Outright, the Group’s wholly owned distributor, has performed well in the year. Overall, IP accounted for
42% of gross profit in 2009 and the Board has given further support to Outright by agreeing investment
capital to secure more third party rights going forward.
In the period, the Group has begun to make and develop content in the digital space. Twenty Twenty
made a highly successful fashion magazine show, The Closet, for the social network site Bebo, and Shed is in
production of an internet drama, Being Victor, for CTVC and Scottish Screen.
I am pleased to propose a maintained dividend of 1.25p (2008: 1.25p). This dividend will also be available to
shareholders as a scrip issue of ordinary shares.
On 30 July 2009, Shed announced that executive directors were holding preliminary talks with a number of
private equity houses with a view to exploring the possibility of making an offer for Shed. These
discussions continue to advance.
Finally, on behalf of myself and my non executive colleagues I would like to thank the CEO and all the
executives of the Group for their tireless work and their continual striving for creative excellence and for
all those who have worked for the Group whose endeavours have enabled Shed to achieve this good set of
results.

Chairman’s Statement
131165 Shed Productions Pt1  21/5/10  7:18 pm  Page 02 OVERVIEW FOR THE 12 MONTHS
I am pleased to announce Shed’s final results covering the 12 months to 31 December 2009.
During the period, turnover increased to £92.6m from £81.9m, up 13%. Gross profit is up by 4% to £32.1m
(2008: £31.0m) and adjusted operating profit
1
is up 1% to £14.7m (2008: £14.5m).
Gross margins have been under pressure this year at 35% (2008: 38%) due to a combination of tighter
production budgets, lower margins on high value US commissions and a slight fall in intellectual property
gross profit. At an adjusted operating level
1
, our margins have dropped from 18% to 16%, mainly due to the
investment we have made in our US business. This remains significantly above the industry average
operating margin of 8.2%*.
The Group delivered 250 hours of programming, up from 215 hours in 2008. 35 hours were drama and 215
were factual. Programmes included Waterloo Road series 5, New Tricks series 6, Who Do You Think You Are?
series 7 and Supernanny US series 6.
The Group is now working with 23 different broadcasters including, for the first time, two webcasters.
Shed continues to be known for the quality of its output and in the period the Group won many awards
including: an Oscar, 2 BAFTAS, 1 RTS, 1 Broadcast Award, 1 BANFF, 2 TV Quick Awards, and Wall to Wall
was voted Best Indie by its peers.
Business in the US has again grown strongly with 100 hours delivered (2008: 64). Current brands continue
to perform and there have been significant new business wins for US home-grown product.
Shed’s in-house distribution arm, Outright, has performed well, successfully distributing Shed content and
growing its third party business. The Group’s IP exploitation accounted for 42% of the Group’s gross
profit (2008: 44%).
UK Business
The UK commissioning environment continued to be challenging in 2009.
Against a backdrop of the worst advertising recession in a generation and, in the BBC, a public broadcaster
looking for across the board savings in programme costs, Shed performed extremely well. UK programme
revenue was £40.2m (2008: £43.1m) and we delivered 151 hours (2008: 151 hours).
Shed Productions’ stand-out drama, Waterloo Road, went from strength to strength with 26 hours delivered
in the period for BBC One.
Ricochet’s output included Blood Sweat and Takeaways (4 x 60’ BBC3), The Real Swiss Family Robinson (4 x 60’
BBC One), Born To Be Different (2 x 60’ Channel 4) and Cowboy Builders (12 x 60’ Five).
Twenty Twenty produced the drama Garrow’s Law (4 x 60’ BBC One), the award winning The Choir:
Unsung Town (4 x 60’ BBC2), World’s Strictest Parents 2 (10 x 60’ BBC3) and the Sorcerer’s Apprentice 2
(20 x 60’ BBC One).
Wall to Wall delivered New Tricks series six (8 x 60’) and series seven of the celebrity genealogy show, Who
Do You Think You Are? (5 x 60’) both for BBC One. Amongst the other highlights were Electric Dreams
(3 x 60’ BBC Four) and Sea Patrol (6 x 60’ Five and National Geographic).
Since the year end, major commissions and re-commissions for delivery in 2010 included a seventh series of
Shed Productions’ Waterloo Road (20 x 60’).

SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2009
Chief Executive’s Statement
131165 Shed Productions Pt1  21/5/10  5:26 pm  Page 03 Ricochet’s commissions include MasterCrafts (6 x 60’ BBC2), Britain’s Empty Homes (20 x 30’ BBC One),
MegaCities (4 x 60’ BBC One) and Blood Sweat and Luxury (6 x 60’ BBC3).
Twenty Twenty’s World’s Strictest Parents (11 x 60’ BBC3) has been picked up for a third series, Garrow’s Law
(4 x 60’ BBC One) for a second series and new programmes include Titanic (5 x 60’ Channel 4) and School
for Boys (3 x 60’ BBC2).
Wall to Wall will deliver New Tricks series seven (10 x 60’ BBC One) and series eight of Who Do You Think You
Are? (10 x 60’ BBC One) this year. In addition The Genius of Design (5 x 60’ BBC2), People’s Supermarket
(4 x 60’ Channel 4), Sea Patrol 2 (8 x 60’ Five and National Geographic) and new brand, High Street Dreams
(6 x 60’ BBC One), are all due in 2010.
US Business
During 2009, we consolidated all our production assets in the US under one brand, Shed Media US. The
company produced 100 hours of programming (up 56% on 2008) for eight different broadcasters.
Returning brands included a sixth series of Supernanny US (13 x 60’ ABC), the third season of Real
Housewives of New York City (12 x 60’ Bravo), season 2 of It’s Me or the Dog (30 x 60’ Animal Planet) and
World’s Strictest Parents US 2 (10 x 60’ CMT).
New programmes commissioned or made in the period include Who Do You Think You Are? (7 x 60’ NBC),
The Marriage Ref (8 x 60’ NBC), and Thintervention (8 x 60’).
Since the year end, production has begun on Bethenny’s Getting Married (8 x 60’ Bravo) and NBA Wives
(8 x 30’ VH1).
Outlook
Three months into our current financial year and the Group has secured 64% of its production revenue
target (72% in the UK and 50% in the US) and 68% of its IP gross profit target.
Last year, we continued to invest in the expansion of our US operation and we expect that investment will
continue to fuel the growth in America. In the UK, we have made a substantial commitment to our Scottish
office which will begin to provide a return in 2010.
Revenue from the Group’s intellectual property will continue to grow as our library of content expands
and in 2010 we expect to see some recovery in the market for drama sales. We have made a commitment
to grow Outright’s third party content in 2010, which will require investment that will see returns in 2011
and beyond.
The Group had a good 2009 and we have had a good start to 2010. As ever, our talented and experienced
team will be working hard to create, produce and distribute the new brands of the future.

Chief Executive’s Statement (continued)
131165 Shed Productions Pt1  21/5/10  6:18 pm  Page 04 Revenue and Profits
The year ended 31 December 2009 saw revenue increase to £92.6m (2008: £81.9m).
Geographically, 27% of Group gross profit in 2009 was from customers in the UK (2008: 26%), 31% from
the US (2008: 30%) and 42% from intellectual property sales from the rest of the world (2008: 44%).
During the year the Group was commissioned directly by 23 broadcasters in both the UK and US and sold
production rights to over 200 territories worldwide.
Statutory reported operating profits are £12.3m (2008: £12.3m) with a reported profit before tax of £9.8m
(2008: £7.9m). Adjusted operating profits
1
are £14.7m (2008: £14.5m) with an adjusted profit before tax
2
of
£12.0m (2008: £11.9m).
Adjusted operating margin
1
was 16% (2008: 18%) and gross margin was 35% (2008: 38%). Gross margins
have reduced due to a combination of tighter production budgets, lower margins on high value US
commissions and a slight fall in intellectual property gross profit. Adjusted operating margins
1
have
dropped from 18% to 16%, mainly due to the investment we have made in our US business. Margins
remain strong when compared to the industry average of 8.2%*; bolstered by strong ancillary sales, tight
control of production costs and continuing tight control of overheads.
Capital Structure and Treasury Policy
During the year Shed increased its issued ordinary shares to 85,966,967 (2008: 79,716,561 ordinary shares
of 0.1p each). The increase in issued ordinary shares financed the final earn-out for Wall to Wall Holdings
Limited and from the issue of a scrip dividend.
In 2007, a five year debt facility of £32m was set up with Barclays and the Bank of Ireland to fund the
acquisitions of Twenty Twenty Productions Limited and Wall to Wall (Holdings) Limited and to refinance
the existing debt facility taken out to finance the purchase of Ricochet Limited and Outright Distribution
Limited. The terms of this agreement were extended on 6 February 2009, extending the facility to
November 2011.
During the year, loan notes totalling £500,000 were issued as part of the earn out of Wall to Wall which
are redeemable in April 2010.
At 31 December 2009, Facility A had a loan balance of £21.7m (2008: £28.6m). The movement from the
prior year is explained by repayments of £6.9m.
At 31 December 2009, the Group also had an £8m working capital facility (Facility B). The loan balance at
31 December 2009 was £4.5m (2008: £2.9m). The movement from the prior year of £1.6m was a result of
loan extension fees (£0.6m) and a draw down of £1m in working capital due to substantial increases in
amounts of cash lent to productions on a short term basis.
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share in the year was 8.25p (2008: 6.85p) based on earnings of £6.8m (2008: £5.4m)
divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year of 82,431,039 (2008:
78,886,358). Diluted earnings per share in the year was 7.87p (2008: 6.77p) based on the potential weighted
average number of shares in issue of 86,340,654 (2008: 79,754,822).
Adjusted basic earnings per share
2
was 10.36p (2008: 10.69p) and adjusted diluted earnings per share
2
was
9.89p (2008: 10.58p).

Financial Review
131165 Shed Productions Pt1  21/5/10  5:26 pm  Page 05 Cash flow
Net cash inflow from operating activities was £27.5m (2008: £23.5m). Overall cash and cash equivalents
increased by £8.6m (2008: £2.4m) to £17.5m (2008: £9.0m).
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.25p per share (2008: 1.25p). Subject to approval by
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 30 June 2010, the final dividend will be paid on
9 July 2010 to shareholders on the register on 21 May 2010. Subject also to approval of shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting, the Group is proposing a scrip dividend alternative which will give shareholders
the opportunity to elect whether they wish to receive the dividend in cash or in the form of ordinary
shares in the Group. Details of the scrip dividend alternative will be sent to shareholders in due course to
enable them to make their choice.
Covenants
Under the terms of the five year debt facility the Group is tested quarterly on two loan covenants.
• Interest Cover: 12 month rolling adjusted EBITDA
3
needs to cover interest by a multiple of 4; and
• Leverage: Total non production debt as a ratio of 12 month adjusted EBITDA
3
, which for the period
1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009 needed to be less than 2.5 (2008: 2.75)
Interest cover for the year ended 31 December 2009 was 5.5 times (2008: 4.5 times) and the leverage
based non-production debt was 1.66 (2008: 2.0). During the year all covenants were comfortably passed.
Hedging
During 2008, at the bank’s request, we put into place an interest hedge to manage our interest rate
exposure. The Board is currently reviewing its hedging policy. At the year end, £21m (2008: £27m) of the
Group’s facility was protected by the structured interest rate collar.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year was £3.0m (2008: £2.5m) at an effective rate of 30.5% (2008: 31.2%). The
effective rate is higher than the 28% tax rate in the period due to tax paid at a higher rate on overseas
earnings and non-deductible expenditure arising from the aborted management buy out and an IFRS
accounting charge relating to deferred consideration.
Balance Sheet
Receivables The decrease in receivables in the year is mainly due to timing of production funding. Of the
£16.9m (2008: £18.7m), £9.7m (2008: £9.7m) were trade receivables and £6.7m (2008: £8.2m) represented
prepayments and accrued income.
Current liabilities The increase in current liabilities in the year to £39.9m (2008: £34.5m) has been mainly
due to the timing of production activity and the issue of loan notes relating to the Wall to Wall earn out.
This has been offset by the payment of deferred consideration of £4.3m.
Non-current liabilities During the year, non-current liabilities decreased to £20.0m (2008: £27.8m) as
payments were made on the five year loan facility. There was also a reduction in fair valuation of the
interest rate collar to £1.3m (2008: £1.6m) and movements in deferred tax.

131165 Shed Productions Pt1  21/5/10  5:26 pm  Page 06 Goodwill During the year goodwill increased to £62.3m (2008: £61.3m). This was due to the additional
consideration of £1m as a result of Wall to Wall Holdings Limited meeting the terms of the “super” earn
out.
Intangible Assets Intangible assets increased to £25.7m (2008: £24.5m). This was mainly due to the increase
in film assets. In the current year, the Group capitalised on average 12% (2008: 13%) of film costs arising
from new drama productions and 12% (2008: 13%) on film costs arising on new factual entertainment
productions. The film assets will be amortised over their remaining lives to match against future sales.
Intangible assets arising from acquisitions decreased £2.0m to £8.9m (2008: £10.9m) due to amortisation.

Directors’ Report
The directors have pleasure in presenting their report on the Company and the Group together with the
audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Principal activity
Shed Media plc (the “Group”) is an independent television production company. The Group specialises in
contemporary, original drama and factual programming and content and in distribution of subsequent
rights from these programmes.
Results and dividends
The results for the Group show a pre-tax profit of £9.8 million (2008: £7.9 million) for the year and
revenue of £92.6 million (2008: £81.9 million). Net cash flow from operating activities for 2009 was
£27.5 million (2008: £23.5 million).
The final dividend proposed at 31 December 2009 was 1.25p per share (2008:1.25p per share).
Business Review
Business environment
The independent production sector has traditionally been fragmented with hundreds of companies
producing a limited number of programmes and owning few, if any, of the rights to those programmes.
The favourable changes to market conditions have enabled the emergence of a few dominant players
strong enough to buy out smaller competitors. This has led to the creation of the “Super Indie” which
benefits from diversification into different production genres thus mitigating the risks associated with
creative businesses.
Within this competitive environment the Group has differentiated itself as follows:
• Business Model – Focussed on multiple profit streams rather than turnover.
• Brands – Creating powerful brands that sell internationally and across new platforms.
• Operating Margins – Consistently delivering strong operating margins.
• Visibility of Revenue – Strong brands and a good reputation with broadcasters who re-commission
existing brands and are open to new programme developments.
• UK Growth – Organically through an expanding in-house talent pool and strategically through
acquisition of brand – owning, brand-creating companies.
• US Growth – Created a significant US business by leveraging UK formats into the lucrative US TV
market. Now organically growing the business with locally sourced and produced product.
The emergence of new media is also an important development in the television market. Technology such
as streaming and internet downloading give independent producers more opportunities to exploit their
content. The companies which own attractive, recognisable brands, which platform owners need benefit
most from these market developments. The Group is now engaged in producing content directly for the
internet and expects this area of the business to grow.

SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2009
Strategy
The Group’s overriding objective is to achieve attractive and sustainable rates of growth and returns
through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions.
• Strong organic growth through:
• Maintaining and securing key production talent
• Building on success and reputation with broadcasters
• Successful exploitation of programming rights
• Building new broadcaster relationships in the UK and internationally and in particular the US
• Selective acquisition of companies meeting strict criteria:
• Production companies in valuable new genres
• Brand owning and brand creating capabilities
• Talent tied in by ownership
• Right price
• New media
Key performance indicators (“KPIs”)
The board monitors progress on the overall Group strategy and the individual strategic elements by
reference to seven KPIs.
1. Liquidity
The board monitors cashflow on a continual basis which is reviewed monthly at the board meetings
prior to submission to the bank. Loan and interest payments are made quarterly and the group
ensures it is sufficiently liquid to make the loan repayments for the forthcoming year.
2. Growth in sales (%)
Year on year sales growth expressed as a percentage. The increase in sales for 2009 came from
organic growth in US production. The Group continues to look for organic growth through increased
production both in the UK and the US as well as growth in IP exploitation. The Group also continues
to look for growth through acquisitions and integration of both UK and US independent production
companies.
3. Gross margin (%)
Gross margin is the ratio of gross profit to sales expressed as a percentage. Gross margins have been
under pressure this year at 35% (2008: 38%) due to a combination of tighter production budgets,
lower margins on high value US commissions and a slight fall in intellectual property gross profit.
4. Operating profit margin (%)
Operating profit margin is the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items and intangibles
amortisation to sales expressed as a percentage. Gross margin is important to maintain to ensure
productions are profitable, but it is essential the Group keeps overheads under control and maintains
a strong operating profit margin. The margin has dropped from 18% to 16%, due to the drop in gross
profit margin and the investment we have made in our US business.

SHED MEDIA ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2009
Directors’ Report (continued)
5. EBITDA
The Group monitors its ability to pay loans on a monthly basis by reviewing interest to EBITDA and
loan amount to EBITDA. The Group ensures it is clearly able to meet the terms set out in its loan
agreements.
6. Programming Hours
The Group monitors commissioned programming hours per annum as a KPI. The Group produced
250 programme hours, 35 drama hours and 215 factual hours. (2008: 215 programme hours).
7. International Sales
In order to grow as a business it is important for the Group to continue to exploit its programmes in
the international market. This performance target is reviewed quarterly and the Group anticipates
growth through expanding the programme library both from internal productions and investment in
3rd party programmes.
Principal Risks
Risks are formally reviewed by the board and appropriate processes put in place to monitor and mitigate
them. If more than one event occurs, it is possible that the overall effect of such events would compound
the possible adverse effects on the Group.
The directors consider the following to be the principal risks faced by the Group.
1. Competition
The Group operates in a highly competitive market with many companies, small and large, competing
for broadcasters’ commissions. For the Group to grow it needs to secure re-commissions of existing
brands and have new programme brands ready to be commissioned when more mature ones fade. To
mitigate the risk of a slow-down in the overall rate of growth our creative teams are constantly
developing new programme brands to ensure a healthy pipeline of new productions.
A reputation for consistently delivering high quality programmes is a prime asset in the market and
this reputation is dependent on maintaining a pool of high quality creative staff.
2 Key Creative Staff
The Group’s performance depends largely on the retention of key creative staff. The loss of key
individuals or failure to recruit sufficient talent with the right experience and skills can adversely
impact the Group’s results. The Group has also successfully trained up younger staff members to take
on creative roles and has been successful in retaining them over the long term. When acquiring
companies the Group ensures that the talent is tied in through share ownership and performance-
based schemes.
3. Control of Productions Costs
Once the executive producers have negotiated programme prices with the broadcasters, an internal
budget is agreed and it is up to the production departments to ensure programmes are made within
or below that budget. There is a risk that productions go over budget at some point during the
production process. To control this risk the Group employ skilled production accountants who submit
cost reports into Group finance department on a monthly basis. Any drift over budget can be dealt
131165 Shed Productions Pt1  21/5/10  5:26 pm  Page 14 15
SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2009
with quickly to ensure the overall production budget is adhered to. There is also adequate insurance
in place for each production to cover any unforeseen problems that may affect the cost of
production such as key cast illnesses or major equipment failure.
4. Financial Risk Management
The board regularly reviews the financial requirements of the Group and the risks associated
therewith. The Group does not use complicated financial instruments and where financial instruments
are used it is for reduced interest or exchange rate risk. The Group does not trade in financial
instruments. Group operations are primarily financed from equity funds raised, retained earnings and
bank borrowings (including overdraft facilities). In addition to the primary financial instruments, the
Group also has other financial instruments such as receivables, payables and accruals that arise directly
from the Group’s operations. Further information is provided in note 17 to the financial statements.

Chief Financial Officer
Directors’ Report (continued)
131165 Shed Productions Pt1  21/5/10  5:26 pm  Page 17 The directors support high standards of Corporate Governance and confirm that they intend to comply
with the requirements of the new “Combined Code” on Corporate Governance (“the code”) published in
June 2008, so far as practicable given the size, nature and current stage of the development of the Group.
The key Group objective is to enhance and protect shareholder value.
The Board of Directors
During the year the Board increased from ten to eleven directors, whose names and details appear on
pages 8 to 11. The three non-executive directors are considered to be independent of management and
free of any relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
A formal schedule of matters is considered by the Board, which meets at least 10 times per year and keeps
under constant review the need to hold additional meetings. The Board is responsible for:
• Overall Group strategy.
• Acquisitions.
• Monitoring the operating and financial results against plans and budgets.
• Ensuring that the necessary financial and human resources are in place for the Group to meet its
objectives.
• Ensuring that the Group’s obligations to its shareholders and others are understood and met.
The following committees, which have written terms of reference, deal with specific aspects of the
Group’s affairs:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of two non-executive directors and two executive directors and meets at
least twice a year. It is responsible for ensuring that the financial activities of the Group are properly
monitored, controlled and reported on. It reviews reports from the auditors and meets the external
auditors without executive directors being present.
The Audit Committee recommends the appointment of the external auditors, reviews the audit fee and
audit plan and pre-approves all work in excess of pre-agreed limits in respect of external auditors, prior to
commitment by the Group.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of three non-executive directors and one executive director. It
reviews the performance of the executive directors and sets the scale and structure of their remuneration
and that of senior management and the basis of their service agreements with due regard to the interests
of shareholders. In determining the remuneration of the executive directors and senior management the
committee seeks to ensure that the Group will be able to attract and retain executives of the highest
calibre. It makes recommendations to the full board concerning the allocation of incentive schemes to
employees. No director participates in discussions or decisions concerning his own remuneration.
Further details of the Group’s policies on remuneration including details of director’s share options are
given in the report of the Remuneration Committee report on pages 20 to 23.

Corporate Governance Report
131165 Shed Productions Pt1  21/5/10  5:26 pm  Page 18 Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee consists of three Non-executive Directors and one executive director and
meets at least once a year. It is responsible for reviewing the structure, size and composition (including the
skills, knowledge and experience) of the Board. Its role is to lead the process for identifying and making
recommendations to the Board on candidates as directors of the Company and to consider succession
planning for directors and other senior executives.
Internal Controls
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal controls and for
reviewing their effectiveness. These internal controls are designed to safeguard the assets of the Group
and to ensure the reliability of financial information for both internal and external publication. The
effectiveness of the system of internal controls has been reviewed by the directors and they are satisfied
the controls are effective with regard to the size of the Group and the stage of its development. Any
system of internal control can only be designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives and can provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
Given the size of the Group, there is currently not an internal audit function; this will be reviewed as the
Group grows.
Relationship with Shareholders
The directors attach great importance to maintaining good relationships with shareholders.
Communications with shareholders are given high priority. The directors meet and discuss the
performance of the Group with shareholders during the year. Queries raised by shareholders are promptly
answered by whoever on the board is best placed to do so. Investors are encouraged to participate in the
Annual General Meeting at which the Chairman will present a review of the results and comment on
current business activity. The board will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer shareholder
questions.
Going Concern
After making enquiries the directors have reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and that it is therefore
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. In forming this view,
the directors have reviewed the 2010 budget and the five year strategic business plan. The directors have
satisfied themselves that the Group is in a sound financial position and sufficient borrowing facilities will be
available to meet the Group’s foreseeable cash requirements.

Corporate Governance Report (continued)
131165 Shed Productions Pt1  21/5/10  5:26 pm  Page 19 The following report outlines the Group’s policy on the remuneration of executive directors and gives
details of the remuneration packages of executive directors and of the fees paid to non-executive
directors for the year ended 31 December 2009. A resolution to approve the Report will be proposed at
the Annual General Meeting of the Company. The directors have applied the principles of good
governance related to director’s remuneration as described below:
Remuneration Committee
The committee comprises Nicholas Southgate (Executive Director) and the following independent Non-
Executive Directors: Heather Rabbatts (chair), Coline McConville and Marc Watson.
Remuneration Policy
The remuneration policy of the Committee and of the Board is to provide remuneration packages for the
Executive Directors and other senior executives in the Group which are appropriate to the size and nature
of the Group’s business and which will attract and retain high calibre executives. It is the Group’s policy
that a substantial proportion of the executive directors’ remuneration should be performance related in
order to encourage and reward superior business performance and shareholder return and that
remuneration should be linked to both individual and Group performance.
Accordingly, executive directors may earn up to an additional 50% of their basic salaries as a performance
bonus and have benefitted from participation in the Group’s share option scheme, as set out on the
following page.
It is the policy of the Committee and the board to maintain the above approach to remuneration packages
for executive directors and other senior executives of the Group for the current financial year and future
financial years, subject to review in the light of any changes in relevant legislation, regulations or market
practice. The Committee will continue to review base salaries and performance targets to ensure that they
align with the remuneration policy of the Committee and the board and with the Group’s strategic
objectives. The individual salary, bonus and benefit levels of the executive directors are, and will continue
to be, reviewed annually by the committee.
It is the Group’s policy to employ executive directors under contracts with an indefinite term subject to
the termination by notice by either party of 12 months. Any compensation payable by the Group would be
subject to normal legal principles of mitigation of loss. No compensation would be payable if the service
contracts were to be terminated by notice from the executive director or for lawful termination by the
Group. There are no provisions for payment of pre-determined compensation under the service contracts.
In relation to future appointments of executive directors, the Committee’s and Board’s policy will remain
one of restricting notice periods to 12 months.
Details of individual director’s remuneration are set out on in note 6, details of directors share options are
on page 22 of this report. The main components of the remuneration for executive directors are:
Basic Salary
The Group’s policy is that basic salaries for executive directors should take into account the individual’s
role and responsibilities, performance and experience. For an executive director who is experienced and
fully effective in his role, basic salary is targeted at the retail market median for comparable roles.
Annual bonus
Executive directors are eligible to receive an annual performance bonus up to a maximum of 50% of their
annual basic salaries at the time the bonus scheme is announced. The amount of bonus is based on the
20
SHED MEDIA ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2009
Directors’ Remuneration Report
131165 Shed Productions Pt1  21/5/10  5:26 pm  Page 20 achievement of profit targets specified and agreed at the beginning of the year. The performance targets
for bonus entitlements are intended by the Remuneration Committee to create keen incentives to
perform at the highest levels.
Share Option Schemes
The Group has in place an EMI Scheme under which certain Group employees (including executive
directors) are eligible for the grant of options to acquire ordinary shares in the Group. Further details are in
note 19.
Share Plan
A key element of the Group’s retention and reward strategy is to encourage employee share ownership
and facilitate the retention of key staff and talent. The Group operates a Share Plan (SP) to provide
additional share awards to certain employees to reward and motivate existing staff and attract key new
hires. The SP will allow participants to acquire shares subject to and to the extent that performance
conditions are satisfied. Awards in the year are detailed in note 19.
Other benefits
Executive directors are entitled to be provided with private healthcare insurance. Alexander Graham and
Claire Hungate received contributions to their pension schemes in the year.
Non-executive Directors
The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the executive members of the board and are
based on market surveys. The Group’s practice is to appoint non-executive directors under letters of
engagement rather than under service contracts. These letters of engagement set out fixed terms of
appointment of three years, which may be extended with the agreement of the board.
Executive Directors’ Service Contracts
Details of the executive directors’ service contracts are as follows:
Date of service
Agreement
Eileen Gallagher 18 February 2005
Jonathon Kemp 18 February 2005
Nicholas Powell 24 November 2005
Nicholas Southgate 24 November 2005
Chris Bonney 28 September 2006
Alexander Graham 29 November 2007
Claire Hungate 22 July 2009
Tim Carter 22 July 2009
In concluding the service contracts, for the directors, the Group took into account the provisions of the
Combined Code regarding notice periods for service contracts. In relation to future appointments of
executive directors, the committee’s and board’s policy will remain one of restricting notice periods of
termination service contracts to twelve months.

SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2009
Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued)
131165 Shed Productions Pt1  21/5/10  7:19 pm  Page 23 The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and company financial statements for each financial
year. The directors are required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange to prepare group
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by
the European Union (“EU”) and have elected to prepare the company financial statements in accordance
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and
applicable law).
The group financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the
financial position and performance of the group; the Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such
financial statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true
and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the company and of the profit or loss
of the group for that period.
In preparing each of the group and company financial statements, the directors are required to:
(a) select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
(b) make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
(c) for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs
adopted by the EU; and
(d) prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the group and the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and
explain the group’s and the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the group and the company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group
and the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information
included on the Shed Media plc website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company
financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16

company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As more fully explained in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 24 the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the
Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the APB’s website at
www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/UKNP.
Opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent
company’s affairs as at 31 December 2009 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

Consolidated Cash Flow Statement
For the year ended 31 December 2009
131165 Shed Productions Pt2  21/5/10  5:31 pm  Page 30 Nature of operations and general information
The principal activity of Shed Media Plc and its subsidiaries (the Group) is the production of programmes
for the television industry in the United Kingdom and the United States and the worldwide acquisition and
distribution of rights in programmes produced by the Group companies as well as programmes produced
by third party clients.
Shed Media Plc is the Group’s ultimate parent company. It is incorporated and domiciled in England and
Wales. The address of Shed Media Plc’s registered office, which is also its principal place of business,
is 2 Holford Yard, London, WC1X 9HD. Shed Media Plc’s shares are listed on the Alternative Investment
Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange.
Going concern
An assessment of going concern is made by the directors at the date that the directors approve the annual
accounts taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances at that date including:
• Review of profit and cashflow forecasts for the next five years
• Review of loan covenants compliance for the next year and ability to make loan repayments
• Review of production commissions and contracted distribution revenue against forecast
• Timing of cashflows
• Any financial or operational risks
Based on the above analysis, the directors have concluded that the Group is a going concern.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention as modified by the
revaluation of derivative financial instruments, and as required by EU law, the Group’s accounts have been
prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the EU (“IFRS”).
The parent company’s profit after dividends received of £4,400,000 (2008: £nil) for the year ending
31 December 2009 is £802,000 (2008: £6,538,000). The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption
available under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented the profit and loss account for
the Company alone. The company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in
accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
During the year the following standards have now been adopted in these financial statements:
• IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures – Amendment; Improving Disclosures About Financial
Instruments.
• IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Comprehensive revision including requiring a
statement of comprehensive income.
The above standards have not led to a material adjustment in the presentation of the financial statements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations
relevant to the Group operations that have been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not
yet effective or endorsed (unless otherwise stated)
• IFRS 2 Share Based Payments – Amendment; Cash-settled Share –based payment transactions

• IAS 31 Interest in Joint Ventures – Consequential amendments arising from amendments to IFRS 3

hedged items. (endorsed)
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations as appropriate in future
periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The principal accounting policies of the Group are set out below and have been applied consistently in
presenting the consolidated financial information.
Basis of consolidation
Consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Shed Media plc and all its subsidiary
undertakings. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are accounted
for through the profit or loss from or up to the date that control passes.
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control exists where the
Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits
from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible
are taken into account.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and
liabilities incurred at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets
acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the
subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss.
All intra-Group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Principal Accounting Policies
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn
up to 31 December 2009. The following policies have been applied consistently across the Group.
Business combinations completed prior to the date of transition of IFRS
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations
prior to 1 September 2006.
32
SHED MEDIA ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2009
Principal Accounting Policies (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2009
131165 Shed Productions Pt2  21/5/10  5:31 pm  Page 32 Accordingly the classification of the acquisition of Ricochet Limited remains unchanged from that used
under UK GAAP. Assets and liabilities are recognised at the date of transition and are measured using their
UK GAAP carrying amount immediately post-acquisition as deemed cost under IFRS. Deferred tax is
adjusted for the impact of any consequential adjustments after taking advantage of the transitional
provisions.
Revenue
Revenue represents amounts receivable for work carried out in producing television programmes and is
recognised on the basis of the value of costs related to production activity. The value of costs is
determined by reviewing each individual production and calculating the costs incurred to date. The
production costs to date are compared to the total expected production costs. The production revenue
from the broadcaster is recognised in proportion to the cost incurred.
Revenue also includes sums receivable from the exploitation of programmes in which the Group owns
rights. Gross profit on production activity is recognised based upon the stage of completion of the
production and in accordance with the underlying contract.
For distribution income the amount recognised represents the value of the licence fees including
withholding tax but excluding Value Added Tax.
Distribution income is recognised when
– An agreement is contracted;
– The arrangement is fixed and determinable; and
– The programme is delivered.
Operating Profit
Operating profit is derived as profit from operations before finance income, finance costs and income tax
expense.
Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property plant and equipment at rates calculated to write each asset down
to its estimated residual value evenly over its expected useful life as follows:
Fixtures, fittings & equipment 25% straight line
Computer equipment 33% straight line
Edit suites 20% straight line
Leasehold improvements Over the life of the lease
These assets are collectively shown as fixtures and fittings in note 11.
Intangible assets
Goodwill and business combinations
Goodwill arising from business combinations is capitalised and subject to an annual impairment review in
accordance with IAS36.
33
SHED MEDIA ANNUA L REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2009
Principal Accounting Policies (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2009
131165 Shed Productions Pt2  21/5/10  5:31 pm  Page 33 The fair value of intangible assets acquired as a result of business combinations is capitalised and amortised
on a straight line basis through the profit or loss. The rates applicable which represent the best estimate of
the useful economic life are:
Customer Relationships: 10 years
Trademarks: 15 years
Format rights backlog: 2 years
Format rights recommissions: 2 years
Other intangible assets
For programme assets, amortisation is provided in accordance with the income forecast method whereby
amortisation is taken to the profit or loss on a pro rata basis calculated as the income received in the
accounting period as a portion of the expected revenue over the life of the programme.
Development expenditure
Development expenditure has been written off as incurred, unless the Directors are satisfied as to the
technical, commercial and financial viability of individual projects. In this situation, the development
expenditure is capitalised and amortised in line with the revenue generated.
Impairment of assets
For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are
separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). As a result, some assets are tested individually for
impairment and some are tested at the cash-generating unit level. Goodwill is allocated to those cash-
generating units that have arisen from business combinations and represent the lowest level within the
Group at which management monitors the related cashflows.
Goodwill, other individual assets or cash-generating units that include goodwill, other intangible assets with
an indefinite useful life, and those tangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at
least annually. All other individual assets or cash-generating units are tested for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets’ or cash-generating units’ carrying
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting
market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use based on internal discounted cashflow evaluation.
Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which goodwill has been allocated, are credited
initially to the carrying amount of goodwill. Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other
assets in the cash generating unit. With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for
indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks and other short-term
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at their amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment. Trade receivables due in more than
one year are discounted to their present value.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

Principal Accounting Policies (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2009
131165 Shed Productions Pt2  21/5/10  5:31 pm  Page 34 Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct
issue costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Finance
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for
on an effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Current and deferred taxation
Current tax is the tax currently payable on taxable profit for the year.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation
of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that
it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial
recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other
assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in
subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in
the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based upon tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited through the profit or
loss, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is
also dealt with in equity.
Leased assets
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are
classified as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the profit or loss on a
straight line basis over the lease term.
Equity
Equity comprises the following:
• Share capital represents the nominal value of equity shares.
• Share premium represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received
for equity shares, net of the expenses of the share issue.
• Share option reserve represents the cumulative balance of IFRS 2 share based payments.
• Own shares held in trust represent Shed Media Plc shares which are held in trust.
• Retained earnings represent cumulative retained profit and losses.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provision
of the instrument.

Principal Accounting Policies (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2009
131165 Shed Productions Pt2  21/5/10  5:31 pm  Page 35 Equity Instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Government Grants
Government grants are received for revenue expenditure and are netted against the cost incurred by the
group in general administrative expenses. The retention of the grant is dependent on the group satisfying
certain criteria. When the criteria for retention have been satisfied, the income is recognised in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income through profit or loss.
Share Based Payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based
payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the
date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that
will eventually vest.
The fair value of the share options is measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected life
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The fair value of the share plan has
been calculated based on the market value of the shares at the date of issue.
Provisions and contingent liabilities
Where the deferred consideration is dependent upon future trading performance, an estimate of the
present value of the likely consideration payable is made. This contingent deferred consideration is re-
assessed annually and a corresponding adjustment is made to the goodwill arising on acquisition. The
difference between the present value and the total amount payable at a future date gives rise to a finance
charge which is charged through the profit or loss and credited to the liability over the period in which the
consideration is deferred. The discount used is the Company’s weighted average cost of capital.
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional
currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in ‘Sterling’ (£), which is the
Company’s functional and the Group’s presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the
translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are recognised through the profit or loss, except when deferred in equity as qualifying
cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are
presented in profit or loss within ‘finance income or cost’. All other foreign exchange gains and
losses are presented in administrative expenses.

The Group changed its treatment of accounting for foreign exchange translation of the US
subsidiaries as of 1 January 2009. Previously the functional currency of the US operations had been
sterling which resulted in the difference being recognised through the profit or loss of the
individual entity accounts and also through profit or loss in the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income. From 1 January 2009 the functional currency of the US operations has been
US dollars. The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the
currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the
date of that balance sheet;
(ii) income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at
average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and
expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate movement in other
comprehensive income.
In the prior year, management considered the functional currency across the Group to be sterling
as all US operations were deemed to be an extension of the UK since they only produced UK
formats and were managed and controlled by the UK parent. During 2009, the increased level of
autonomy and independence of activities undertaken in the US resulted in a change in the
functional currency of the US operations from sterling to US dollar. Consequently, management has
approximated the change to have occurred from the start of the accounting period and has
reflected the change prospectively in the financial statements with no prior year adjustment.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as
assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends
on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being
hedged. Where derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of any
of these derivative instruments are recognised immediately through profit or loss.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items represent items of income and expense, which based on their materiality, frequency or
non-operating nature, have been separately disclosed to facilitate the assessment of the Group’s
underlying operating profitability.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition of programme assets are capitalised when they are
incurred. All other borrowing costs are recognised in income in the period in which they are incurred.
Significant Judgements and Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements
are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations

For the year ended 31 December 2009
131165 Shed Productions Pt2  21/5/10  5:31 pm  Page 37 of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing material
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below:
Intangible assets
The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the date
of acquisition. The determination of these fair values is based upon management’s judgement and includes
assumptions of the timing and the amount of future incremental cashflows generated by the assets and
selection of an appropriate cost of capital. Furthermore, management must estimate the useful lives of
intangible assets and charge amortisation on these assets accordingly.
Internally generated intangibles
The recognition of revenue and film assets is based on judgemental budgeting and forecasting techniques
which are adopted by the Group. The film assets are capitalised on completion inline with the revenue
recognition policy (see revenue recognition accounting policies for further detail).
Internally generated intangibles are capitalised when the future economic benefit of the project is probable
and recognised only if the following conditions are met:
– an intangible asset is created that can be separately identified;
– it is probable that the intangible asset created will generate economic benefits; and
– the cost of the intangible asset can be measured reliably.
The future revenues to be generated for each film asset are estimated so as to recognise the revenue and
the contribution across the useful economic life of the programs. The assets are stated at cost net of
amortisation and any provision for impairment. Amortisation on these assets is recognised within cost of
sales.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to test, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. The
recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations. The use of this method requires the
estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present
value of these cash flows. Actual outcomes could vary.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is provided so as to write down the assets to the residual values over their estimated useful
life as set out above. The selection of these estimated lives requires the exercise of management
judgement.
Deferred Consideration
Where deferred consideration is payable in cash and discount would have a material effect the liability is
discounted to its present value. Where the deferred consideration is contingent and dependent upon
future trading performance, an estimate of the present value of the likely consideration payable is made.
Where a business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost that is contingent on
future events, contingent consideration is included in the cost of an acquisition if the adjustments are
probable (that is more likely than not) and can be measured reliably.

Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board that are
used to make strategic decisions.
The Board considers the business by type of revenue and geographic location. The Group primarily
operates through its offices in London and Brighton, UK and in Los Angeles, USA but sells the rights to its
programmes worldwide. The Group differentiates between newly commissioned production revenue both
in the UK and the US and revenue arising from the sale of the rights of the Group’s library including third
party rights (Intellectual Property (IP) Revenue).
The central costs segment represents the cost of the head office function. This operates as an
independent function to the trading businesses.
The board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted EBITDA.

8. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. The weighted average number of
shares has been adjusted for the issue of shares during the year and for own shares held in trust.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to
assume conversion for all dilutive potential ordinary shares. These represent shares issued to satisfy
deferred consideration and share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the
average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares.
The table below sets out the adjustments in respect of diluted potential ordinary shares:

Goodwill arising on acquisition after the date of transition to IFRS is attributable to operational synergies
and earnings potential expected to be enjoyed over the longer term. The main changes in carrying
amounts of goodwill result from the revisions to deferred consideration as shown below:

An impairment review has been conducted by management in the year. The recoverable amount of each
of the cash generating units was determined based on value-in-use calculations, using actual operating
results and a one year’s detailed forecast, followed by an extrapolation of expected cash flows at a growth
rate of 2.25% at a pre-tax discount rate of 10.1% for 25 years. Detailed forecasts are generally appropriate
for one year due to the short term nature of the commissioning market. The 25 year period is deemed to
be appropriate given it relates to the infinite life of the companies. The Directors believe that a reasonable
change in the estimates would not result in an impairment.
During the year Wall to Wall Holdings Limited achieved higher than expected EBITDA leading to the
recognition of the super earn out of £1 million. This was paid on 21 October 2009 based on results for the
year ending 30 June 2009.

The year end balance of the interest rate collar is split over the life of the trade in the proportions as
follows: £966,000 less than one year (2008: £785,000), £250,000 between 1 to 2 years (2008: £469,000),
and the balance of £111,000 in 2 to 5 years (2008: £341,000).
The full fair value of the interest rate collar is classified as a non-current liability as the remaining maturity
of the hedged item is more than twelve months.
The Group is exposed to market risk through its use of financial instruments and specifically to currency
risk, interest rate risk and certain other price risks, which result from both its operating and investing
activities. The Group’s risk management is coordinated at its headquarters, in close co-operation with the
Board, and focuses on actively securing the Group’s short to medium term cash flows by minimising the
exposure to financial markets. Long term financial investments are managed to generate lasting returns.
The Group does not actively engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes nor does it
write options. The most significant financial risks to which the Group is exposed are described below.
The table below analyses the Group’s non derivative financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted
cash flows as at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008.

The bank loans and overdraft are secured by a fixed and floating charge over the Group’s assets.
Facility A of £32m was drawn on 29 November 2007 and is repayable over 5 years. The terms of the
arrangement were renegotiated on 6 February 2009. Interest is payable at 2.75% over Libor and additional
interest payments are due from the structured interest rate collar in place over the facility up to a
maximum of 5.75%. For the 12 months ended 31 December 2009 interest was paid at an effective rate
5.75% (2008: 5.71%). Facility B was also renegotiated on 6 February 2009 and is renegotiable on an annual
basis. Interest is payable at 2.5% over Libor.
The Loan Notes were issued on 2 Oct 2009 and they are redeemable six months after issue date up to a
final maturity date two years after issue.
Treasury policy and financial risk management
The Group Treasury department operates within risk management policies approved by the Board and its
procedures are reviewed regularly. Major transactions are authorised outside the department at the
requisite level, and there is an appropriate segregation of duties. Frequent reports are made to the
Commercial and Financial Director and regular reports are prepared for the Board.
The Group’s financial instruments, in addition to derivatives, are made up of borrowings, cash and liquid
resources and other items such as receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
In order to manage the interest rate and currency risk arising from the Group’s operations and financing,
the Group Treasury department also enters into derivative transactions. These are mainly interest rate
collars and forward currency contracts. Currently all the open derivatives at the 31 December 2009 do not
meet the IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ criteria to be effective hedges.
Consequently variations in value are reflected through profit or loss of the Group’s policy not to engage in
speculative transactions.
The main risks are liquidity/funding risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
Liquidity/funding risk
The Group finances it operations through a mixture of advances from broadcasters, retained profit and
bank borrowings, The Group has a working capital facility to finance production costs where broadcasters
do not provide advances.
The Group’s objective is to secure continuity of funding at a reasonable cost. The Group seeks to manage
financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets
safely and profitably. The Group manages liquidity risk by a combination of controls:
– Regular reviews at Board level of cash flow projections, headroom position in respect of banking
facilities and adherence to parameters within the loan covenants;
– Maintaining reasonable gearing levels across the Group; and
– Ensuring short term borrowing facilities are readily accessible for short term flexibility.
The Group will continue to use a range of ratios to monitor and manage its finances. These include
interest cover of EBITDA, net debt to operating profit and cash flow to debt measures. At 31 December
2009 the total facility available amounted to £29.7m, £21.7m on facility A and £8m on facility B, (2008:
£36.6m, £28.6m on facility A and £8m on facility B).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2009
131165 Shed Productions Pt2  21/5/10  5:31 pm  Page 56 17. Financial instruments (continued)
Interest rate risk
Bank borrowings are mostly held at variable interest rates based on relevant London Interbank Offered
Rate (LIBOR) to the reference drawdown period. Borrowings to finance production costs are held at either
variable interest rates based on Barclay’s bank rate or as a fixed fee as part of a co-producer agreement.
Interest income and costs are dependent upon the funding requirements of the Group and the prevailing
market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings is managed by
entering into structured collar agreements offsetting borrowings on a floating rate basis.
This caps the highest level of LIBOR interest at 5.75%. If LIBOR falls below 3.99% interest is payable at
double the difference between LIBOR and 3.99% up to a maximum of 5.75%.
As the group hedges interest with an interest collar it is not significantly sensitive to changes in interest
rates from the perspective of interest payments to the bank. However the fair value of the interest rate
collar is sensitive to changes in interest rate. A 1% decrease in LIBOR would lead to a £390,000 decrease in
the fair value of the interest rate collar liability. A 1% increase in LIBOR would lead to a £360,000 increase
in the fair value of the interest rate collar liability. As the interest rate collar does not meet the criteria in
IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ to be an effective hedge, these movements
will be recognised through profit or loss.
Financial assets
The Group’s financial assets comprise cash held in current accounts on which interest is receivable at a rate
of 0.1%
The other financial assets are not interest bearing.
Currency risk
The Group is based in the UK and has investments in overseas operations. The most significant currencies
for the Group are the US dollar and the Euro.
The Group has overseas subsidiaries operating in the USA whose revenue and expenses are denominated
in US dollars. On occasions where the Group is anticipating receipts in excess of expenses, forward
contracts are put into place.
In addition about 78% of the Group’s sales from exploitation of programme rights are to customers in
continental Europe and other foreign markets. These sales are priced and invoiced either in the currencies
of the customers involved or in US Dollars. Where the Group has receivables denominated in US Dollars
from the exploitation of programme rights, forward contracts are set up as far as it is practicable in respect
of timing of receipts. The Group’s policy on routine transactional conversions between currencies (for
example, the collection of receivables, and the settlement of payables or interest) is that these should be
completed at the relevant spot exchange rate. The majority of our operations are domestic within the
country of operation. No unremitted profits are hedged with foreign exchange contracts, as the Group
judges it inappropriate to hedge non-cash flow translational exposure with cash flow instruments.
Interest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities
The table on the following page shows the extent to which the Group has monetary assets and liabilities in
currencies other than pounds sterling. Foreign exchange rate differences on retranslation of these assets
and liabilities are taken to through profit or loss for the Group unless they relate to a foreign subsidiary, in
which case the retranslation is taken to other comprehensive income of the Group. See accounting policy
(b) and (c) on foreign currency translation.

The amounts shown in the table above take into account the effect of any forward contracts entered into
to manage these currency exposures. The fair value of open foreign exchange contracts are not material at
31 December 2009 (2008: immaterial) and have therefore not been disclosed separately on the balance
sheet.
The Group’s balance sheet and net profit is sensitive to the year end foreign exchange rates as a result of
the UK operations within the above assets being denominated in currencies other than sterling. Sensitivity
analysis on the retranslation of the year end monetary assets within the balance sheets of the UK
subsidiaries shows that a 10% increase or decrease in the year end foreign exchange rates would lead to a
£872,000 increase or decrease in the net profit. There are foreign currency transactions which took place
during the year both in the US subsidiaries as well as the rest of the Group. Whilst the above sensitivity has
ignored the impact of these transactions through the year, the foreign exchange movements are carefully
monitored and where appropriate foreign exchange contracts are entered in to in order to mitigate the
risk.
Counterparty risk
The Group’s risk of loss on deposits or derivative contracts is limited to the lender bank and it is managed
by use of counterparty limits. These limits are approved by the Chief Financial Officer guidelines approved
by the Board.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with bank and
financial institutions and accounts receivable. The Group does not have exposure to a high concentration
of credit risk from any single customer. The Group’s exposure to credit related losses, in the event of non-
performance by counterparties to financial instruments, is mitigated by limiting exposure to any one party
of instrument and ensuring only counterparties with defined credit risk parameters are used.
Capital Risk Management
The Group monitors capital on the basis of net debt to capital which comprises all components of equity
(i.e. share capital, share premium, own shares held in trust, retained earnings, and share options). Net debt
is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
The Group’s objectives when maintaining capital are:
• to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and
• to provide an adequate return to shareholders by managing an optimum capital structure to reduce
the cost of capital whilst taking into account the level of risk.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic
conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. The Group places funds which are not
required in the short term on deposit at the best interest rates it is able to secure from its bankers.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to
shareholders, issue new shares, or review the loan facilities that are in place.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2009
131165 Shed Productions Pt2  21/5/10  5:31 pm  Page 60 The exercise price of options outstanding at the end of the year ranged between 0.1p and 155p (2008: 0.1p
and 125.5p) and their remaining weighted average contractual life was 6.2 years (2008: 7.1 years)
A charge has been made in the year of £12,000 (2008: £42,000) to reflect the fair value to the Group of
issuing employee share options. This charge has been calculated by applying a fair value to the options
issued and spreading the charge equally over the vesting period, which is typically 3 years from issue. The
fair value has been calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the weighted average inputs.
The charge for the year was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following
inputs:
31 December 31 December
2009 2008
Expected volatility 23.9% 23.9%
Expected Life (years) 5 5
Risk Free Rate 5.4% 5.4%
Expected dividends £Nil £Nil
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price from
listing on 29 March 2005 to the date of grant of the options. The expected life used in the model has been
adjusted based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions
and behavioural considerations.
A risk free rate of 5.4 per cent was used, which reflects the interest rate that it is assumed can be obtained
by investing in financial instruments with no default risk.
Own shares held in trust
On 17 August 2008 the Group purchased £450,000 of its own shares. This equated to 456,496 shares with
a purchase value of 98.5p.
Share Plan (SP)
At 31 December 2009 the following shares were granted through the Share Plan.

1 September 2008 0p 495,082
1 January 2009 0p 1,032,942
The fair value of the share plan shares is equal to the market value of the shares at the date of issue.
Shares are available from 3 years from the date of grant at the option of the holder, and the charge for the
year was also calculated based on the Black-Scholes pricing model.

The Group has entered into various sale and leaseback transactions on television programmes. Amounts
are held on deposit accounts as a result of these transactions and comprise money to provide for the
discharge of future leasing liabilities. The banks with which these sums are deposited have given guarantees
to the lessors in respect of lease liabilities. A liability would only crystallise upon the failure of the bank
holding the deposit. This is considered remote and therefore these balances have not been included with
in the Group’s balance sheet. The amounts involved are as follows:

Company Balance Sheet
As at 31 December 2009
131165 Shed Productions Pt2  21/5/10  6:20 pm  Page 64 Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied in the Company’s financial
information throughout the period under review, are as follows:
Basis of accounting
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Development Expenditure
Development expenditure has been written off as incurred, unless the Directors are satisfied as to the
technical, commercial and financial viability of individual projects. In this situation, the development
expenditure is deferred.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write each asset down to its
estimated residual value evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:
Fixtures, fittings & equipment 25% straight line
Computer equipment 33% straight line
These assets are collectively shown as fixtures and fittings in note 3 to the Company financial statements.
Operating Leases
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis
over the period of the lease.
Going Concern
The Directors regularly review that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future, and that it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern basis
in preparing the Financial Statements. See corporate governance statement for additional information.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for diminution in value.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss
account for the year.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future
or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are
differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that
arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they
are recognised in the financial statements.

Company Accounting Policies
For the year ended 31 December 2009
131165 Shed Productions Pt2  21/5/10  5:31 pm  Page 65 Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing
differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Deferred Consideration
Where the deferred consideration is dependent upon future trading performance, an estimate of the
present value of the likely consideration payable is made. This contingent deferred consideration is re-
assessed annually and a corresponding adjustment is made to investment arising on acquisition. The
difference between the present value and the total amount payable at a future date gives rise to a finance
charge which is charged to the profit and loss account and credited to the liability over the period in which
the consideration is deferred.
Deferred financing costs
Bank arrangement fees and associated legal costs are amortised over the term of the debt facility.
Share-based payment
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value
determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The fair value
is measured by use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected life used in the model has
been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise
restrictions and behavioural considerations.

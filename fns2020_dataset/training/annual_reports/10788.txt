2014 has been a big year for N Brown. Not just  in 
terms of figures, sales and brands, but in terms  of 
our customers. The last twelve months have seen 
us deliver the goods to more than four million happy 
customers, putting us in the top five for customer 
satisfaction in the UK’s retail industry. By putting   
our customers at the heart of our business we’ve 
been able to give them more of what they want, 
when and where they want it.
Technology has played a massive part in this. As the digital world continues 
to open up even more new and exciting opportunities, we’ve been setting 
new standards (as well as fashions) for people to follow. By embracing   
the technology available to us we’ve been able to deliver an even faster   
and more flexible service – and our customers have responded to this, 
 helping to make it our most profitable year to date. 
We’ve also focused a lot of our efforts on understanding how we can use 
 our portfolio of brands to appeal to a greater cross section of the population. 
For young women we have Simply Be, which has become our brand with 
 the most potential; for older women we have JD Williams – now our biggest 
brand; and for men we have Jacamo, which is our fastest growing brand. 
House of Bath has also achieved excellent results, with growth  up 25%,  
and is definitely one to watch.
Together these brands have helped us deliver fast fashion to a massive 
percentage of the UK and take our place in the top quartile of the FTSE 250. 
Combined with new dual-fascia Simply Be and Jacamo stores opening, 
optimised mobile sites, click & collect, and next day delivery, we’re proud  to 
say it’s been the biggest year in our history. And that deserves a big  thanks  
to everyone involved.
A big year for 
our customers

The power 
of four
It might only seem like a 
small change, but dividing 
our business into four distinct 
customer groups – younger 
women, older women, men  
and specialist –  has made a 
massive difference.  
Four brands in particular, Simply 
Be, JD Williams, Jacamo and 
Figleaves stand out in these 
categories, helping us deliver  
the goods to customers all  
over the country.
Over 4m

online 07 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Online has been a great source 
 of success for us, but this has 
 been complemented by new 
 stores taking the high street by 
storm. We now have eight dual 
fascia Simply Be and Jacamo 
stores in major cities around  
the UK, with plans for more on 
the  way. If we’re going to put  
our customers at the heart of our 
business, we need to keep our 
brands fresh in their minds.
Hitting the
high street
Simply Be now has the biggest 
selection of clothing for size 
20+  in the UK fashion market, 
and that hasn’t gone unnoticed 
by its fans. They now have over 
170,000 Facebook followers – an 
increase  of 150% from last year, 
and Twitter followers are up a 
huge 213% to 48,000; more than 
any other UK plus size brand.

Whoever, wherever,

People are busier than ever these days – so much to do, 
so little time. By optimizing all our sites for mobile and 
tablet devices, we can let them order whatever they like, 
wherever they are. On the train, in a restaurant, at the 
football – they’ll always be in touch with the latest trends.
Our celebrity designers have continued to raise the profile 
of our brands through their range of fresh ideas and 
cutting-edge designs. Freddie Flintoff continues to stand 
tall for Jacamo, Danii Minogue’s exclusive ‘Project D’ 
range attracted new fans for Simply Be, as did Gok Wan’s 
shapewear range, which raised eyebrows all over the UK.

Bigger, better,
faster
Giving our customers more ways to 
 shop has been one of the key factors 
 in this year’s success, but giving them 
more ways to receive is equally as 
important. Next day delivery has given 
them more freedom, especially in 
the run-up to Christmas, and Click & 
Collect outlets give them the flexibility 
to fit in with their working lives.

 Chairman’s statement
The mature female segment continued 
to improve with 3% growth in the year.
Revenue grew in all our major product 
categories as we continued to broaden 
our ranges. The fastest growth came 
from our increasingly differentiated 
home offer where sales grew by 
12%, despite the reduced electrical 
sales arising out of the credit policy 
changes introduced in the second 
half of the year. This category is now 
focused on our “Famous Five” ranges 
which include bedding, home décor, 
homewares, outdoor living and family 
gifts, and accounts for 31% of group 
revenue. Footwear and menswear 
grew by 10% and 5% respectively. 
Ladieswear, which is a major part 
of our future growth strategy, and a 
significant opportunity for the business 
going forward, grew by 3% during  
the year.
The continued investment in our 
websites has driven online penetration 
to 58% of revenue. Online remains 
our priority channel and 40% of our 
sessions are now on mobile devices 
marking a significant change in the  
way our customers shop.
As reported at the interim results, 
we elected to pause our expansion 
into the US market during the third 
quarter. We have now resumed a 
faster rate of customer recruitment 
and we are applying what we’ve 
learned so far to the next stage of 
expansion. We have strengthened the 
team, taken the decision to focus on 
the Simply Be opportunity exclusively 
and based on the strength of our 
gross margin, begun to invest more in 
digital marketing, tailored ranges and 
website and service developments. 
The revenue for the full year grew by 
21% to £10m and customer numbers 
We are pleased to report that the group delivered a robust performance in 
2013/14 and has made a good start to the new financial year. We have grown 
profits during a period of major transition in the business as we begin to 
implement our new strategy for growth, including accelerating our investment 
in new markets and maintaining high levels of customer recruitment across 
our existing customer segments and brands.
We are encouraged by the early 
performance we are seeing in our  
US business and with our programme 
of new store openings in the UK as 
part of the development of our multi-
channel offering and we are confident 
in the renewed growth from the actions 
we are taking in our core JD Williams 
business. We are now applying what 
we learned in the early stages of our 
entry into the US market and resumed 
a faster rate of expansion there during 
the second half of the year. The roll-out 
of Simply Be/Jacamo stores has also 
gone well as we move towards our 
target of 25 stores nationally across 
the UK. We believe these new activities 
can be significant growth drivers for the 
group in the medium term.
Financial Results
  £m £m 
 2014 2013 %
Revenue 834.9 784.7 +6.4
Operating profit 107.0 102.2 +4.7
Adjusted profit  
before taxation 100.1 95.1 +5.3
Statutory profit  
before taxation 97.3 96.4 +0.9
Adjusted earnings  
per share (p) 27.88 28.15 -1.0
Total group revenue increased by 6.4% 
to £834.9m and 6.3% on a like-for-like 
basis, excluding the non-comparable 
periods for newly opened stores. 
Gross margin reduced by 0.3% for the 
year as a whole despite a second half 
improvement in overall margin which 
came from the reduced bad debt ratio 
of 7 .5% of sales. This was achieved 
largely following the introduction of 
new fraud elimination processes and 
credit policy rule changes on high value 
electrical products, introduced in the 
third quarter.
Operating profit was up by 4.7% to 
£107 .0m, after accounting for losses 
of £6.2m (2013, £6. 1m) from the 
investment in international trading  
and the Simply Be/Jacamo stores.
Excluding the impact of fair value 
adjustment to financial instruments, 
profit before taxation was up 5.3% 
to £100. 1m (2013, £95. 1m). Including 
these adjustments, profit before 
taxation was £97 .3m (2013, £96.4m), 
up 0.9%.
Adjusted earnings per share were 
down at 27 .88p (2013, 28. 15p), due  
to a higher tax charge of 22.0% (2013, 
17 .6%). The board is proposing a final 
dividend of 8.56 pence per share, 
up 4.0% on last year, giving a total 
dividend for the year of 14.23 pence  
up by 4.0%, and covered 1.96 times.
Net borrowings at 1 March 2014 
increased to £213.7m (2013, £188.7m) 
due to further investment in the 
receivables book, which generates  
our financial services revenue.
Net finance costs fell from £7 . 1m to 
£6.9m, covered 15.5 times by operating 
profit. Gearing has increased from 42% 
to 44% on net assets which have risen 
by 8.8% to £485.3m (2013, £446.0m).
Trading Highlights
During the year all of our consumer 
facing segments performed in line with 
our expectations and we continued to 
improve our customer service levels. 
The focus on consumer segments has 
enabled us to reinvigorate our offer and 
optimise more effectively our marketing 
investment. The fastest growth was 
seen within the male segment, which 
grew by 13% and the younger female 
segment which grew by 9%. are up 28%. Losses were up £1.7m to 
£4.7m as we continue to invest in this 
key geography.
During September 2013 we opened 
two Simply Be/Jacamo stores in Leeds 
and Derby to bring our number of 
stores to nine, eight of which are dual 
facia. The like-for-like sales from these 
stores were up 35% in the year, and 
they are now contributing positively to 
trading profit before central overheads.
It is our intention to roll-out a further 
seven stores by October this year, and 
we have already found a site on Oxford 
Street, which opens in September. 
These stores are helping to build brand 
awareness and we believe are ahead 
of our competitors in terms of multi-
channel services offered in store.  
They are responsible for an online 
“halo” sales benefit in the 45 minute 
drive time radius around each store of 
7% and 3% for Simply Be and Jacamo 
respectively, compared to those areas 
without a store.
In February 2014 we changed our 
check-out processes across the 
business to make it easier for new 
customers to pay by cash at the point 
of sale if they wished to do so. Our 
testing highlighted that we would 
achieve additional sales and improve 
cashflow from this initiative, and whilst 
it is early in the process the signs of 
success in this area are positive with 
30% of new orderers to date on all 
channels completing their transaction 
on a cash basis at higher gross 
margins. Most of these orders relate  
to fashion items.
In February we described our 
systems infrastructure development 
programme, which is designed to 
simplify our business and to create 
the foundations for our multi-national, 
multi-channel expansion plans. We 
have signed agreements with our 
chosen partners and have now moved 
on to the systems design phase. It 
is likely that we will achieve some 
reporting benefits later in the current 
year, but the positive financial impacts 
on our growth will be seen in the year 
ended 2016 and beyond.
Board Composition
In July 2013 Angela Spindler joined  
N Brown Group as Chief Executive  
and has already made a very positive 
contribution to the group. Her vision  
for the future of the business was laid 
out in February this year and I am 
delighted with the progress she has 
made in such a short time in shaping 
and pursuing the group’s new  
strategy. She is already driving the 
many changes required to achieve  
our objectives.
John McGuire retired in March 2014 
having been a non-executive director 
since 2005, and Anna Ford will retire 
from the board in July 2014 after  
5 years’ service as a non-executive 
director. I would like to thank them for 
their contribution to N Brown’s success 
over the years and wish them well for 
the future.
Financial Reporting Calendar
We have reviewed our approach to 
financial reporting and consequently 
made some changes in line with what 
is now best practice in the listed retail 
sector. Going forward, we will report 
our financial results in the normal way 
and with similar timings to our current 
approach. Additionally, we will issue 
pre-close trading updates at the end 
of each half year and also Interim 
Management statements covering  
the first and third quarters shortly  
after the end of those trading periods.  
One consequence of these changes  
is that we will cease the issue of  
current trading statements covering 
short periods at our financial results 
– an approach which is now routine 
across our industry. Consistent with 
this new approach, these results 
therefore do not include a current 
trading statement. Our first quarter  
IMS will now be issued in June,  
some weeks earlier than previously.
Outlook
We are stepping up the pace of 
change in the business in pursuit of  
our strategic ambitions. I am pleased 
to report that the team has made  
good early progress with the 
implementation of our plans to 
accelerate growth by building on  
the core strengths of the group.
Consequently the board remains 
confident in the outlook for the 
business, and we believe that the 
strategy in place will enable us to 
achieve our expectations in the year 
ahead and beyond. I would like to 
thank all stakeholders in the business 
and in particular the staff for all of their 
hard work and dedication throughout 
the year.

Delivering Growth 
across all our Customer 
Segments & Product 
Categories 
Our consistent performance in terms of revenue growth 
has been delivered again this year with like-for-like sales 
up 6.3% and total group turnover up 6.4% to £834.9m. 
Our strategic initiatives of Simply Be and Jacamo store 
roll-out and our expansion into the USA have added to 
our momentum. However, in absolute terms the biggest 
drivers of growth were our young female and male 
consumer segments which delivered £23m and £16m  
of revenue growth respectively.
bought for the Autumn/Winter season. 
Sales for the full year were diluted by 
a flat performance from some large 
categories in mid-life ladies fashion 
– casuals, knitwear and outerwear. 
That said, we grew share in our key 
categories of mens and ladies plus  
size clothing.
In the mature female segment we saw 
good growth in our main in-house 
ladieswear brand Joanna Hope (+7%). 
In younger female clothing, Fast 
Fashion ranges sold extremely well 
(+46%). The brand Joe Browns was 
also a strong performer up 20%.

Menswear 108 13 +5
Home & Gift 263 31 +12

In traditional menswear, which 
accounts for over 50% of sales, 
performance was diluted with the 
category only up 4% on the year. 
Younger ranges were stronger, up 8%.
It is pleasing to report that all consumer 
segments delivered growth in the year.
In the mature segment classic fashion 
brand Julipa was the star performer 
up nearly 30% vs. last year. House 
of Bath was also strong at over 25% 
ahead year on year. It is encouraging 
to see a return to growth in JD 
Williams, however, at just 1% ahead 
we see this as an opportunity.
In the younger female segment Simply 
Be performed strongly, up 9% year on 
year and in the male segment Jacamo 
was a stand-out performer, up 21%.

Attracting and Delighting  
More Customers
Our active customer file has increased 
to seven million, which is up 3.7%  
year on year and reflects sustained 
investment in recruitment with  
24% of demand coming from new 
customers. Our investment is also 
reflected in customer retention noting 
that the most effective recruitment 
channel is online marketing, including 
paid search.
We actively track the long term value 
of all our customers and take this  
back to the type of recruitment activity 
that first enticed them to order – this 
allows us to optimise spend for long 
term profitability.
Continued development of a tailored, 
segmental marketing strategy is 
clearly enabling growth through more 
targeted and relevant communications, 
and this will develop further as we 
combine analytics with online tools  
to deliver real time personalisation.
Improving the shopping experience 
for our customers is a key focus for 
the business as it correlates so closely 
with commercial success. In the 
multi-channel world this requires us 
to measure ourselves and track our 
performance across many dimensions 
including the web experience, in-store 
service, size availability, the speed  
and reliability of our delivery service 
and overall value for money.  
Our latest aggregate score from the 
UK Institute of Customer Service gives 
us a satisfaction index of 84.1 which 
puts us in the top five of UK multi-
channel retailers and well above the 
overall index of 77 .9.
During the year we have made 
numerous improvements to our overall 
service proposition for customers.  
For example: we have virtually halved 
our web page load speeds, making us 
industry leading in this regard; we have 
simplified and improved the check-
out process; we have introduced a 
“Click and Collect” service from 3,000 
parcel shops across the country; we 
have provided mobile tablet devices 
to store colleagues in our new stores 
allowing them to better serve our in-
store customers; we have significantly 
improved our next day service which 
now offers an 8pm cut-off and 
accounts for over 28% of demand, 
at the same time standard delivery 
service has improved to 3.2 days on 
average. We will continue to drive 
service improvements and track our 
progress on customer satisfaction.
Developing our Multichannel 
Capabilities
Online sales now account for 58% of 
overall demand. This is up from 55% 
last year. The shift in our marketing 
spend reflects the growing appeal 
and influence of digital marketing 
techniques with customers across  
all our consumer segments. In the  
year we have reduced spend on  
paper from 33% to 25% of our  
overall marketing budget and diverted 
investment into online recruitment and 
retention activities. We have increased 
our emails by 70% year on year and 
the open rate of promotional emails 
has increased by 8%.
These are targeted emails based 
on customer product preferences 
and lifestyles. These highly targeted 
campaigns are driven from analytics 
Home and gift sales have been 
bolstered by improvements in the 
housing market with Homewares 
and Furniture being strong growth 
categories, as was gifting, where 
demand was up 27% year on year. 
The House of Bath brand within 
Home also performed well in the year, 
up 25%. As a result of credit policy 
changes, Home & Gift sales though 
strong, were £9 million lower as a 
consequence. 
In ladies footwear younger styles  
were strongest, up 20% year on year.  
We were particularly successful in 
wide calf fitting boots. Men’s footwear 
grew by 16%, with most growth 
coming from Jacamo customers.
Gross Margin and Credit
The overall gross margin rate for the 
year was down 30bps year on year. 
This is a marked improvement on 
the first half where margin was down 
80bps. Product margin was down 
20bps, impacted by the sales mix in 
favour of Home & Gift and diluted in 
the second half by a higher rate of 
markdown and promotional activity 
to support sales and sell-through 
following a weather related poor  
start to the autumn/winter season.
The ratio of bad debt to sales was 
8.1% for the year, which was in line 
with last year. However, this reduced 
from 8.8% in the first half to 7 .5% in 
the second half. This reflected our 
product related credit policy changes 
impacting high risk, low margin home 
& gift categories such as high value 
electricals and electronics. We expect 
future sales and margin benefits to 
flow from these changes.

improved customer response.
The migration of our business to the online channel is  
being fuelled by the growth in traffic from mobile devices. 
This now accounts for 40% of web traffic with over half of 
that coming from tablets. During the year we optimised our 
websites for tablet devices and smartphones. As a result 
of improvements our conversion levels by device have 
increased year on year. 
Device % of traffic converting to demand

Smartphone 3.5 3.6
We have also improved search and navigation across 
sites and increased our online selling capabilities through 
product sequencing flexibility, improved affinity selling and 
extended personalised recommendation capabilities.  
We have also enhanced the online user experience with 
more frequent and relevant content changes and richer 
images, making our sites more interesting and inspiring  
for customers to browse. 
Ahead of our systems upgrade which is discussed  
further below, we continue to invest in improving our  
web proposition. In 2014 we plan to further improve copy 
and images, develop our product recommendation and 
personalisation tools plus make the customer checkout 
journey even simpler. 
Implementing our Strategy
The fourth quarter has seen us begin to implement 
elements of our strategy which underpin our ambition to be: 
“The leading global retailer famous for making shopping for 
fashion easy and enjoyable regardless of size.”
Pay by Debit/Credit Card
In February we introduced the option for customers to 
pay at point of order by debit or credit card, an important 
step in broadening our customer appeal and making our 
proposition more contemporary. It is too soon to conclude 
on the impact of this however early evidence reinforces 
expectations that this will introduce incremental customers 
to the business.

“Famous Five” in Home & Gift
Since last October we have been implementing our 
“Famous Five” strategy in our Home & Gift categories 
focusing our marketing efforts on categories which are 
differentiated and most relevant to our target customers: 
Homewares, Bedding, Home Decor, Outdoor Living and 
Gifts. These actions have driven additional sales of the 
Famous Five categories. Over the course of the next 
financial year we are confident that sales will be further 
fuelled by these target categories. We are seeing 
particularly strong momentum in homewares and

Delivering growth from our core brand of JD Williams, and 
its sister titles in the mature customer segment, is key to 
achieving our future growth ambitions. This is particularly 
dependent on our mature female fashion offer, which is the 
biggest segment of our business. All consumer dynamics 
emphasise this strategic opportunity – an aging population, 
increasing dress sizes and a growing propensity for fashion 
home shopping. During the second half we have reduced 
the line-up of titles from seven to three with further migration 
to come in the first half of 2014. This should ensure that 
when we re-launch the JD Williams brand in the autumn, 
we can focus our advertising on one key brand with a 
primary objective to attract new customers, whilst retaining 
the loyalty of our existing large base.
The project to make the brand more contemporary in terms 
of the product range and presentation is well underway. 
The improvements will also reflect in adjusted stock phasing 
to improve the percentage of newness throughout the 
season. For launch we will also be adjusting the range/price 
mix to improve value for money for customers. The initiative 
will be supported by an investment in marketing, both direct 
response to drive increases in new customer numbers, and 
also in brand awareness to establish longer term health of 
JD Williams and attract a broader range of customers.
International – USA
In terms of the year’s performance, customer numbers 
grew by 28% in spite of a reduction in recruitment activity 
between August and November. This was due to poor 
second order rates in the first half which we addressed by 
making service improvements, including tracked shipping, 
which launched in November. Since then second order 
rates have improved by 10% and are rising and we have 
resumed a faster rate of customer recruitment. Full year 
sales were up 21% year on year.
We have adjusted our strategy to exclusively focus on the 
“fashion focused larger sized female” in the US market 
using our Simply Be brand. We estimate that this market 
is worth $6bn and is currently poorly served. Our Simply 
Be plan for the USA is to tailor our ranges to that target 
audience, invest some of our strong product margin in 
better pricing and promotions and deliver on-going  
service and web experience improvements. 
Our marketing focus is also shifting to “digital first” and we 
are also planning above the line campaigns to drive brand 
awareness. Customer retention will be underpinned by 
introducing a credit offer which also has an in-built loyalty 
scheme offering unique savings. This will be delivered via 
a third party, and will launch later in the summer. The new 
team to drive this key strategic initiative is now largely in 
place and operational.
Due to unfavourable economics associated with returns 
levels in Germany in the second half we took the decision 
to close the German website. German customers can still 
shop from the UK website. The sales impact was small, 
around £1.2m for the year, as we have not been marketing 
in Germany for over 12 months. As a result, Germany broke 
even for the year. 
Simply Be & Jacamo Stores as Multi-channel Hubs
Our aim is to have 25 stores across the UK giving 85%  
of the population physical access to our Jacamo and 
Simply Be brands. We now have nine stores having opened 
a further two this year, in Leeds and Derby, both of which 
are performing in line with model expectations.
Our stores have a rich set of multi-channel capabilities 
including Click & Collect, in-store kiosks, and tablet- 
enabled service support from our colleagues. We are  
also successfully signing up customers for credit accounts,  
data capture shows that store customers go on to be  
multi-channel customers and are our most profitable group.  
The halo effect on online sales in store catchments is 5%.
We plan to open a further seven stores by October which 
includes a flagship store on Oxford Street in September.
Systems Infrastructure Development
Over the past year we have been scoping a business-wide 
project to redesign our processes and supporting systems 
infrastructure to ensure we can deliver industry leading 
services and operational efficiencies both now and in the 
future. We have selected products and partners to facilitate 
this and have now moved into high level design phase.  
We are simplifying our business and creating the 
foundations for omni-channel, multi-national expansion 
whilst retaining our product and brand propositions which 
we believe are relevant and scalable. We have identified 
significant benefits from both increased revenues and 
reduced costs and expect those to flow from 2016.
Angela Spindler N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 16
 Financial Review
Group sales increased by 6.4% to £834.9m (2013, 
£784.7m) with operating profit rising by 4.7% to £107 .0m 
(2013, £102.2m). Operating margins have fallen by 
20bps from 13.0% to 12.8% analysed as follows:
Net operating margin last year 13.0%
Impact of gross margin –  
Product -20bps
Impact of gross margin –  
Financial Income Yield/ 
Bad Debt -10bps
Decrease in operating costs +10bps
Net operating margin this year 12.8%
The rate of gross margin was 52.7% 
compared with 53.0% in the previous 
financial year. Product gross margin 
rose by 40 bps in the first half but 
ended 20 bps down for the year. 
This was due to the impact of sales 
mix towards lower margin product 
in Home & Gift and a higher rate of 
markdown and promotional activity 
than expected to support sales 
during the autumn/winter season. 
The ratio of bad debts to sales of 
8.1% remained flat against last year 
but there was a slight reduction in 
financial income yield. Distribution 
costs increased by 7 .2% to £71.1m 
(2013, £66.3m) which was slightly 
above sales growth due to higher 
costs associated with improvements 
in customer service levels such as 
increases in next day delivery volumes. 
Sales and Administration costs rose 
from £247 .6m to £262.1m, an increase 
of 5.9% which was below the rate of 
sales growth as we made variable  
cost savings through improved  
contact optimisation, internet 
penetration and reduced paper. 
The net finance charge was £6.9m 
compared to £7 .1m last year. This 
reduction was a result of a lower 
pension finance charge of £0.2m in 
respect of the group’s defined benefit 
pension scheme. The financial costs 
relating to the group’s borrowings 
were flat year on year and were 
covered 15.5 times by operating 
profit. Therefore, profit before 
taxation and fair value adjustments 
to financial instruments was up by 
5.3% to £100.1m (2013, £95.1m). 
The movement in the fair value of 
the group’s forward foreign currency 
contracts contributed a loss of £2.8m 
(2013, gain of £1.3m). The fair value of 
these forward contracts is based on 
external factors which are beyond the 
control of management. Profit before 
taxation was up 0.9% to £97 .3m  
(2013, £96.4m).
Taxation
The effective rate of corporation tax  
for the year is 22.0% (2013, 17 .6%). 
The increase year on year is more 
aligned with the statutory rate, with  
the prior year being impacted by the 
tax effect of an adjustment in respect 
of previous periods which did not 
occur in the current year. The tax 
charge for the year is £21.4m (2013, 
£17 .0m) which meant that profit  
after taxation and attributable to 
shareholders was down by 4.4% to 
£75.9m (£79.4m). The effective tax rate 
for the year ahead is expected to be 
aligned with the UK statutory rate.
Balance Sheet and Cashflow
The balance sheet continues to grow 
in strength. Net assets increased by 
8.8% to £485.3m at the year-end 
(2013, £446.0m).
Capitalised expenditure for the year 
was £20.8m (2013, £25.0m) which 
included £1.8m (2013, £5.0m) on 
stores. The majority of the remaining 
expenditure relates to our continuous 
investment in our online systems 
and infrastructure. As reported in 
the Chief Executive’s Review we 
have undertaken a business-wide 
project to redesign our processes 
and supporting systems infrastructure 
to ensure we deliver industry 
leading services. We expect capital 
expenditure to reach £60m in the  
next financial year. 
Stock levels at the year-end increased 
by 3.9% to £89.9m (2013, £86.5m). 
Trade receivables increased by 9.5% 
to £577 .9m (2013, £527 .8m). The bad 
debt provision decreased to £50.2m 
(2013, £55.7m) which equates to 
8.0% (2013, 9.5%) of gross debtors. 
The reduction in the provision reflects 
the improvement in customer arrears 
profiles arising from the introduction of 
new fraud elimination processes and 
credit policy rule changes. 
The deficit position of the group’s 
defined benefit pension scheme has 
increased to £4.2m compared to  17 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
£3.3m at the prior year end.  
The movement predominately arises 
from a net actuarial loss of £2.7m 
together with service costs of £2.4m 
offset by contributions of £4.2m. 
Net cash generated from operating 
activities decreased from £72.4m to 
£40.7m due to further investment in 
the receivables book and after funding 
capital expenditure, finance costs 
and dividends, net debt increased by 
£25.0m to £213.7m (2013, £188.7m). 
Gearing levels increased slightly to 
44% from 42% last year.
Key Performance Indicators
The group employs a number of  
key performance indicators (KPIs)  
to monitor progress including:
Financial KPI’s
• Like for like sales growth − +6.3% 
(2013, +5.5%)
• Gross margin − 52.7% (2013, 53.0%) 
• The number of customer debtor 
accounts and their average debtor 
balance, which at the year-end was 
1,440,000 (2013, 1,475,000) and 
£409 (2013, £380) respectively.
• Operating margin − 12.8%  
(2013, 13.0%)
• Interest cover − 15.5 times  
(2013, 14.4 times)
• Adjusted earnings per share − 
27 .88p (2013, 28.15p)
Non-Financial KPI’s
• Mix of sales by Customer segments 
and product customer groups 
(Please refer to the Chief Executive’s 
Review for details)
• Proportion of online sales − 58% 
(2013, 55%)
• Proportion of online traffic from 
mobile devices − 40% (2013, 26%)
• UK Institute of Customer Service 
index – 84.1% 
• Average online delivery lead times – 
3.2 days (2013, 3.4 days)
Treasury
There has been no change during the 
year to the group’s banking facilities 
which are in place to support its 
ongoing trading and development 
activities. The group has committed 
borrowings of £370m of which £259m 
(2013, £250m) was utilised at the year 
end. The primary facilities are a £250m 
securitisation programme through an 
HSBC A-1/P1 rated conduit that has a 
matching standby facility. This facility is 
in place until March 2016. Additionally, 
the group has two revolving credit 
loan facilities of £50m each with 
HSBC Bank plc and the Royal Bank 
of Scotland plc which also expire in 
March 2016. All current facilities in 
place at the year end are arranged 
at floating interest rates. Where 
appropriate, exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations on indebtedness may be 
managed by using derivatives such 
as interest rate swaps. There were no 
interest rate swaps used in the year.
Foreign exchange requirements, 
primarily for the purchase of stocks 
denominated in US dollars may be 
hedged for up to three years ahead to 
fix the costs of sterling. This hedging 
activity involves the use of spot, 
forward and option contracts. At the 
year end the group had outstanding 
forward foreign exchange contract 
commitments of $51m (2013, $35m) 
with a fair value of £1.6m liability (2013, 
£1.2m asset).
Accounting Standards and  
Going Concern
Group accounting policies reflect 
current accounting standards and 
related guidelines issued by the 
International Accounting Standards 
Board and are prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted for use in the 
European Union.
In determining whether the group’s 
accounts can be prepared on a going 
concern basis the directors consider 
the group’s business activities together 
with factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance, and 
financial position. These include cash 
flows, liquidity position, borrowing 
facilities and the principal risks and 
uncertainties relating to its business 
activities. These are set out within  
this report and discussed further in  
the Chairman’s Statement and the  
Chief Executive’s Review.
The group has considered carefully 
its cash flows and banking covenants 
for the next twelve months from 
the date of signing of the group’s 
audited financial statements. These 
have been appraised in the light 
of the current economic climate. 
Conservative assumptions for 
working capital performance have 
been used to determine the level of 
financial resources available to the 
company and to assess liquidity risk. 
The key trading risk identified by the 
directors for these assumptions is the 
impact that any deterioration in the 
economic climate might have on the 
performance of the group’s sales and 
debtor book.
The group’s forecast and projections, 
after sensitivity to take account of all 
reasonably foreseeable changes in 
trading performance, show that the 
group will have sufficient headroom 
within its current loan facilities of 
£370m which are committed until 
March 2016.
After making appropriate enquiries, 
the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the company and  
the group have adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence  
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly,  
the directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in the preparation 
of the annual report and accounts.
Shareholder Return
The share price of 397p at the start 
of the year had risen to 590p at the 
year-end giving a market capitalisation 
of £1,672.2m (2013, £1,125.2m). A final 
dividend of 8.56p (2013, 8.23p) per 
share has been recommended by 
the board giving a total dividend for 
the year of 14.23p (2013, 13.68p) per 
share up by 4.0% and covered 1.96 
times (2013, 2.06 times).

the Pension Fund or in the administration 
of the Pension Fund. This amounts to a 
“qualifying pension scheme indemnity 
provision” (as defined in section 235 of the 
Companies Act).
The Pension Fund was closed to new 
entrants with effect from 31 January 2002. 
New employees joining the group after 
31 January 2002 and existing employees 
who had not joined the Pension Fund 
as at that date are entitled to join a 
stakeholder pension scheme administered 
by Prudential Stakeholder Pensions which 
provides a defined contribution pension 
arrangement.
Auto-enrolment progress report
The company commenced pension auto-
enrolment in September 2013 after a 
deferral of the group’s staging date. ‘The 
People Pension’ has been selected as the 
auto-enrolment provider for weekly paid 
employees, whilst Prudential will auto-enrol 
monthly paid employees and continue to 
run the Stakeholder Pension for weekly 
employees already in the scheme. By May 
2014 76% of all employees were members 
of a qualifying pension scheme with 1,758 
employees being auto-enrolled as at the 
date of this report. At the date of this 
report the current opt-out rate is 6.7%.
 
Financial risk management, objectives 
and policies 
The group is exposed to certain financial 
risks, namely interest rate risk, currency 
risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. Information 
regarding such financial risks is detailed 
in note 19 on page 71. The group’s risk 
management policies and procedures and 
the table of principal risks and mitigations 
can be found on page 26.
Change of control
There are a number of agreements that 
take effect, alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the company such 
as commercial contracts, bank loan 
agreements, property lease arrangements 
and employee share plans. None of these 
are considered to be significant in terms 
of their likely impact on the business of 
the group as a whole. Executive directors’ 
service contracts are terminable by the 
company on giving 12 months’ notice. 
There are no agreements between the 
company and its directors or employees 
that provide for additional compensation 
for loss of office or employment that 
occurs because of a takeover bid. No 
relevant events were reported in the year.
Significant contracts
The group has a number of contractual 
arrangements with suppliers (both of 
goods and services) and occupies 
leasehold premises for the purpose of 
conducting its business. Whilst these 
arrangements are important to the 
business of the group, individually none of 
them are essential to the business of the 
group and do not require disclosure under 
section 417(5)(c) of the Companies Act.
Tax status 
The company is not a close company 
within the meaning of the Corporation  
Tax Act 2010.  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 22
 Directors’ Report
Auditor
A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as 
auditor to the company will be proposed 
at the annual general meeting on 22 July 
2014.
The auditor’s fees for both audit and non-
audit work are given in the audit committee 
report on page 26. 
Voting rights and restrictions on 
transfer of shares
None of the ordinary shares in the 
company carry any special rights with 
regard to control of the company.
There are no restrictions on transfers  
of shares other than:
• certain restrictions which may from 
time to time be imposed by laws or 
regulations such as those relating to 
insider dealing;
• pursuant to the company's code for 
securities transactions whereby the 
directors and designated employees 
require approval to deal in the 
company's shares; and
• where a person with an interest in the 
company’s shares has been served with 
a disclosure notice and has failed to 
provide the company with information 
concerning interests in those shares.
The directors are not aware of any 
arrangements between shareholders that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or voting rights. The rights and 
obligations attaching to the company's 
ordinary shares are set out in the Articles 
of Association.
Amendment of the company’s Articles 
of Association
The company’s Articles of Association may 
only be amended by a special resolution at 
a general meeting of shareholders. Where 
class rights are varied, such amendments 
must be approved by the members of each 
class of shares separately. The company 
currently only has one class of share.
 
Powers of the directors
The directors are responsible for the 
management of the business of the 
company and may exercise all powers 
of the company subject to applicable 
legislation and regulation and the 
company’s Articles of Association.
 
At the 2013 annual general meeting, the 
directors were given the power to issue 
new shares up to a nominal amount of 
£10,442,189. This power will expire on 
the earlier of the conclusion of the 2014 
annual general meeting or 2 July 2014. 
Accordingly, a resolution will be proposed 
at the 2014 annual general meeting to 
renew the company’s authority to issue 
new shares. 
 
Directors were also given the power to 
issue new shares up to a further nominal 
amount of £10,442,189 in connection with 
an offer by way of a rights issue. This 
authority too will expire on the earlier of 
the conclusion of the 2014 annual general 
meeting or 2 July 2014, and a resolution 
will be proposed at the 2014 annual 
general meeting to renew it. 
 
Approval was also given at the 2013 annual 
general meeting for a certain number of 
shares up to a maximum nominal value 
of £1,566,328 to be allotted pursuant 
to the authority granted to directors set 
out above without being covered by the 
statutory pre-emption rights regime. As 
with the previously mentioned approvals, 
this authority too will expire on the earlier 
of the conclusion of the 2014 annual 
general meeting or 2 July 2014, and a 
resolution will be proposed at the 2014 
annual general meeting to renew this 
authority.
As in previous years, authorisation for 
the directors to buy back the company’s 
shares will not be sought at the 2014 
annual general meeting.
Employee share schemes –  
rights of control
The trustees of the N Brown Group plc 
Employee Share Ownership Trust hold 
shares on trust for the benefit of the 
executive directors and employees of the 
group. The shares held by the trust are 
used in connection with the company's 
various share incentive plans. The trustees 
currently abstain from voting but have the 
power to vote for or against, or not at all, 
at their discretion, in respect of any shares 
in the company held in the trust. The 
trustees may, upon the recommendation 
of the company, accept or reject any offer 
relating to the shares in any way they 
see fit, without incurring any liability and 
without being required to give reasons for 
their decision. In exercising their trustee 
powers the trustees may take all of the 
following matters into account:
• the long-term interests of beneficiaries;
• the interests of beneficiaries other than 
financial interests;
• the interests of beneficiaries in their 
capacity as employees or former 
employees or their dependents;
• the interests of persons (whether 
or not identified) who may become 
beneficiaries in the future; and
• considerations of a local, moral,  
ethical, environmental or social nature. 
Going concern 
The directors have adopted the going 
concern basis in the financial statements 
and their opinion is explained on page 15.
Liability statement 
All the information contained in the 
Chairman’s Statement on pages 8 to 9, 
the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 10 
to 13, the Financial Review on pages 14 
to 15, the Remuneration Report on pages 
33 to 50 and the Corporate Governance 
Report on pages 22 to 32 form part of 
this directors’ report. Any liability for the 
information is restricted to the extent 
prescribed in the Companies Act.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the annual report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. The directors are 
responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the company’s website. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the group 
financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and have elected to prepare the 
parent company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Standards 
and applicable law. The directors must  
not approve the accounts unless they  
are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the company 
and of the profit or loss of the company  
for that period. 
In preparing the parent company 
consolidated financial statements,  
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRS’s as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis, unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business. 23 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
 Directors’ Report
Disclosure of information to auditor
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Each person who is a director at the date 
of the approval of this report confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which 
the group’s auditor is unaware; and
• the director has taken all steps that he or 
she ought to have taken as a director in 
order to make himself or herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the group’s auditor is 
aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given and should 
be interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of section 418 of the  
Companies Act.

company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
and
• the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report, taken together, include a

and uncertainties that they face; and

Chairman’s introduction
The board is committed to meeting a 
high standard of corporate governance 
and compliance with the principles in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code issued 
by the UK Financial Reporting Council in 
2012 (the “Code”). My role is to ensure 
the board operates effectively, is well 
managed, complies with the requirements 
of the Code and has the correct balance 
of skills and experience to execute the 
strategy set by the board. The company’s 
continued success is a reflection of 
its strong governance and effective 
management.
Andrew Higginson
Chairman of the Board
Statement of compliance with the Code
The group complied with the provisions of 
the Code and the UK Financial Conduct 
Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules throughout the year. The board 
decided that, although one was due, an 
external review of board effectiveness 
(Code provision B.6.2) was not appropriate 
this year for the reasons given on page 23. 
An external evaluation will be conducted in 
the second half of 2014. All other provisions 
of the Code have been complied with. The 
following paragraphs explain how the main 
principles of the Code have been applied. 
The Remuneration Report contains further 
details on pages 33 to 50. Disclosures 
required by the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules (rule 7.2.6) regarding share capital 
can be found in the Directors Report.
Board composition 
The board comprises nine directors of 
whom seven are non-executive including 
the Chairman. Of the seven non-executive 
directors, Lord Alliance of Manchester 
and Ivan Fallon are not considered by the 
board to be independent. The Chairman 
was considered independent at the time  
of his appointment.
Full biographical details of all directors 
appear on page 16.
There is a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman, Andrew 
Higginson, who is responsible for the 
effective operation of the board and the 
Chief Executive, Angela Spindler, who is 
responsible for the group’s operational 
performance. 
The board understands the need for 
non-executive directors to be and remain 
independent of the management in order 
to be able to exercise proper oversight 
and effectively challenge the executive 
directors. The non-executive directors who 
served during the financial year ended  
1 March 2014 were: 
• Andrew Higginson (Chairman);
• Lord Alliance of Manchester CBE;
• Ivan Fallon; 
• John McGuire (resigned 31 March 2014) ; 
• Anna Ford;
• Fiona Laird (appointed 1 April 2013);
• Simon Patterson (appointed 1 April 
2013); and
• Ron McMillan (appointed 1 April 2013).
Ivan Fallon relinquished his roles as senior 
non-executive director and chair of the 
remuneration committee and stepped 
down from all other committees on which 
he sat with effect from 1 October 2013. 
Ron McMillan assumed the role of senior 
non-executive director on the same date. 
Ivan Fallon will remain on the board for the 
foreseeable future as the board considers 
that he still has much to offer in terms 
of his knowledge and experience. John 
McGuire relinquished his role as chair of 
the audit committee on 1 October 2013, to 
be replaced by Ron McMillan with effect 
from the same date, and subsequently 
retired from the board on 31 March 2014. 
In view of the foregoing, the board 
considers that, throughout the year, 
at least half of the board, excluding 
the chairman, comprised independent 
non-executive directors and that the 
composition of the board had the 
necessary balance of executive and 
non-executive directors to provide the 
requisite skills, experience, challenge 
and judgement appropriate for the 
requirements of the business and full 
board effectiveness. 
All board members remain in place as at 
the date of this report.
Pursuant to the Code, all directors are 
required to retire and submit themselves 
for re-election annually. Accordingly, 
each of the directors will retire at the 
forthcoming annual general meeting and, 
with the exception of Anna Ford who 
is stepping down from the board, offer 
themselves for reappointment at that 
meeting. 
With the exception of Ivan Fallon, 
who remains on a three month rolling 
arrangement, all non-executive directors 
serve on letters of appointments stipulating 
3 year terms. All appointments are 
terminable, without compensation, on 
between three and six months’ notice 
by either party and are subject to other 
early termination provisions without 
compensation, for example in the event 
a director is not re-elected at the annual 
general meeting. 
The board, having carried out a 
performance evaluation, believes the 
performance of all directors and their 
commitment to the role of director 
continues to be fully effective. Further 
details of this evaluation can be found  
on page 23. 
Appointments to the board are made 
solely on merit based on the skills and 
experience offered by the candidate and 
required by the role. This ensures that all 
appointees have the best mix of skills and 
time to devote themselves effectively to 
the business of the board and to discharge 
their duties to the best of their ability. 
Details of directors’ contract terms are 
shown in the Remuneration Report on 
page 40. In accordance with the Code, 
the company has made the terms and 
conditions of appointment of the non-
executive directors available for inspection.
Diversity
The board recognises the importance of 
diversity, including gender, at all levels 
of the company as well as on the board. 
The company is committed to equal 
opportunities and increasing diversity 
across our operations in terms of relevant 
skills, experience, ethnicity and gender. 
With the appointment of Angela Spindler 
as Chief Executive on 1 July 2013 and 
Fiona Laird as non-executive director on 1 
April 2013, the board is proud to announce 
that it now comprises six male directors 
and three female directors. The board will 
continue to consider how diversity can 
be enhanced through the board and the 
senior management teams and across 
the group generally, whilst ensuring that 
it appoints only the most appropriate 
candidates to the board. 
Gender diversity
We currently have 33% female diversity 
at board level and 40% on the Home 
Shopping board. This is above the current 
Government target of 25% by 2015, 
established in the Davies review, and 
significantly higher than the current FTSE 
250 who have achieved representation 
at 15.6%. We believe that gender 
representation makes good business 
sense, given that women make up over 
half of the UK population and almost 60% 
of our total workforce.
Strengthening our executive pipeline 
remains a permanent task for us and we 
continue to open up new opportunities 
for women in the business, working with 
head-hunters and agencies that can 
provide true gender diversification in  
their candidate bases.
 Corporate Governance Statement  25 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
To provide role models in the business  
and break the glass ceiling we are 
members of “Women on Boards” and  
have two representatives who serve in that 
organisation (Caroline Massingham - 
human resources director and Linda Quinn 
– trading director). Our aim is to allow 
development of board directors and to 
allow directors to take up non-executive 
roles in other businesses where appropriate.
The next stage is to have clarity, through 
succession and talent identification 
processes, of our policies and measures 
aimed at increasing the number of women 
in senior management. This will provide a 
true internal pipeline over time for board 
succession.
We will also apply the same approach 
when reviewing the appointment or 
re-election of non-executive directors  
to ensure gender balance.
Gender split
At the date of this report the gender split 
(male/female, senior management and 
entire workforce) is as follows:-

The board is responsible for all major 
policy decisions and for determining the 
operational and strategic risks it is willing 
to take in achieving its objectives. The 
board has, where necessary, delegated 
operational matters to its committees and 
sub-committees, and to its executive and 
operational directors and senior officers. 
The board is collectively responsible 
for providing effective leadership and 
promoting the success of the group and 
works to a formal list of matters reserved 
for the board (a copy of which is available 
on the company’s website, www.nbrown.
co.uk). Matters reserved to the board 
include, amongst other things, decisions 
on business strategy, the approval of 
financial statements, the annual capital and 
operating expenditure plans, investment, 
treasury and dividend policies, governance 
issues, major capital projects, overseeing 
the group’s risk control procedures, board 
membership and the composition of its 
committees and the group’s ethical, social 
and environmental policies. 
The board governs through clearly 
mandated committees, accompanied by 
robust monitoring and reporting systems. 
Further detail is given below. 
Day-to-day management of the group’s 
activities is delegated to the operational 
board, known as the Home Shopping 
board, on which both Angela Spindler and 
Dean Moore sit as chief executive officer 
and finance director respectively. Other 
members of the Home Shopping board are 
Paul Kendrick (International Director), Neil 
McGowan (IT Director), Ian Carr (Logistics 
Director), Mark Cheshire (Customer 
Services Director), Caroline Massingham 
(HR Director) and Joe Fogwill and Linda 
Quinn (trading directors of hardware and 
fashion respectively).
In January of each year the members of 
the board meet with members of the Home 
Shopping board over a two day period to 
review the progress being made against, 
and the future development of, the group’s 
long-term rolling strategic plan.
Board papers include detailed 
management reports from the Chief 
Executive and the Finance Director, 
management accounts, broker analyses, 
compliance and regulatory briefings and 
bespoke reports. A comprehensive pack 
of papers is electronically circulated to 
each director not less than seven days 
prior to each board meeting. Budgetary 
performance and forecasts are reviewed 
and revised at each meeting. Outside 
of the meeting there is a regular flow of 
information between the directors including 
the weekly dissemination of management 
information statistics. 
Non-executive directors meet with 
operational teams and the Home Shopping 
board and undertake site visits to ensure 
that they have the most up-to-date 
knowledge and understanding of the 
company and its activities and also so 
that the broader population of the group 
can derive benefit from the skills and 
experience of the non-executive directors. 
All board members are permitted to 
obtain independent professional advice in 
respect of their own fiduciary duties and 
obligations and have direct access to the 
Company Secretary, who is a qualified 
solicitor and who attends all board 
and committee meetings as secretary. 
The Company Secretary provides an 
on-going programme of briefings for 
directors covering legal and regulatory 
changes and developments relevant to 
the group’s activities and director’s areas 
of responsibility. The Company Secretary 
is also responsible for the induction of 
new directors. New directors are provided 
with a comprehensive pack of information 
(including terms of reference, information 
regarding the business and guidance on 
their roles and duties as directors) and 
meetings/site visits with key employee 
contacts are arranged as appropriate. 
Inductions to the business for new 
directors are designed to expose them  
to all areas of the group’s operations  
but with particular emphasis on each  
director’s area of expertise. 
Board effectiveness appraisal
The board has undertaken an internal 
appraisal of its own performance and 
effectiveness and also that of the 
Chairman, other directors and the board’s 
committees. The engagement of an 
external body to manage the performance 
evaluation process is now due under the 
Code. After careful consideration, the 
board concluded that, because of the 
changes to the board during the year in 
terms of the appointment of three new 
independent non-executive directors and 
the appointment of a new chief executive, 
it was sensible to allow the new board to 
“bed down” and get experience of the way 
it and individual directors worked together 
before employing the services of an 
external evaluator. An external evaluation 
of board effectiveness will be conducted in 
the second half of 2014 and its outcomes 
reported next year. 
Consequently, an internal evaluation 
was conducted by means of a written 
questionnaire containing 26 detailed 
questions ranging from the effectiveness  
of individual members, the size and 
number of board reports, relationships  
with management, the mix of skill-sets,  
to individual contributions at board 
meetings. The questionnaire was 
completed by all directors in relation to 
the board and also any committee of 
which they were a member. The process 
 Corporate Governance Statement  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 26
is designed to establish whether each 
director continues to meet the board’s 
requirements in terms of effective 
contribution, skills and devotion to the role. 
The evaluation results were collated by 
the Company Secretary for review by the 
Chairman and then a joint review by the 
board. The performance of the Chairman 
was reviewed and appraised by Ron 
McMillan, the new senior non-executive 
director, in consultation with the other 
board members. The Chief Executive’s 
performance was reviewed and appraised 
by the Chairman and the non-executive 
directors. The performance of the Finance 
Director (the only other executive director 
on the board) was carried out in a similar 
manner to the Chief Executive. 
The evaluation concluded that the board 
and committees perform well and are 
effective and that all non-executive 
directors contribute to an informed 
discussion with, and mount a robust 
challenge to, the operational and executive 
directors whenever necessary. The survey 
also found that the board and committees 
continue to be effectively led by their 
respective chairmen and that information 
provided to the directors was regarded 
as comprehensive, timely and sufficient 
for the directors’ needs. It was also 
concluded that each director is individually 
contributing to the overall effectiveness 
and success of the group. No material 
issues were raised.
The board therefore believes it has 
undertaken a formal and rigorous 
evaluation of its own performance and that 
of its committees and individual directors, 
in compliance with Main Principle B.6 of 
the Code.
Beyond the annual evaluation, the 
performance of the executive directors is 
continuously monitored throughout the 
year by the Chairman and the senior non-
executive director. 
The Chairman reviews and agrees 
with each director their training and 
development needs.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
The Articles of Association of the company 
give the directors the power to consider 
and, if appropriate, authorise conflict 
situations where a director’s declared 
interest may conflict or does conflict with 
the interests of the company.
Procedures are in place at every meeting 
for individual directors to report and record 
any potential or actual conflicts which 
arise. The register of reported conflicts is 
reviewed by the board at least annually. 
The board has complied with these 
procedures during the year.
Two potential conflicts of interest were 
reported in the year ended 1 March 
2014 in circumstances where the non-
executives concerned were neither directly 
or indirectly involved in any potential 
dealings between the group and the 
companies concerned. In each case, the 
conflicts were authorised by the board with 
appropriate safeguards being put in place.
Board activities in 2013/14
Some of the key activities that the board 
has covered over the past year are:
• Rolling out and communicating the 
group’s 2020 Vision long-term strategy, 
setting out the goals and priorities;
• Assessing the progress of the group’s 
Business Transformation Project which, 
amongst other things, will lead to a 
complete re-engineering of the group’s 
IT platform;
• Reviewing the group’s strategy in the 
USA and the investment in High Street 
Stores in the UK for Simply Be and 
Jacamo; and
• Reviewing the work of the audit 
committee and internal auditors on risk.
Committees of the board
The board has delegated authority to 
a number of committees to deal with 
specific aspects of management and to 
maintain supervision over the internal 
control procedures of the group. These 
committees meet regularly and have 
formal written terms of reference which are 
available for inspection on the company’s 
website. The minutes of the meetings 
of these committees are circulated to 
all committee members in advance of 
the next following committee meeting, 
at which they are ratified. The following 
committees of the board have been 
established: 
• an audit committee;
• a remuneration committee; and 
• a nominations committee.
A new committee, the Corporate Social 
Responsibility Committee, headed by  
Anna Ford, was also constituted in 
December 2013.
After each committee meeting the 
chairman of that committee makes a 
formal report to the board of directors 
detailing the business carried out 
by the committee and setting out its 
recommendations.
Audit Committee
Introduction by Ron McMillan,  
Chairman of the Audit Committee
Dear Shareholder,
The Audit Committee exercises oversight 
of the group’s financial policies and 
reporting. It monitors the integrity of 
the financial statements and reviews 
and considers significant financial and 
accounting estimates and judgements. 
The committee satisfies itself that the 
disclosures in the financial statements 
about these judgements and estimates are 
appropriate and obtains from the external 
auditor an independent view of the key 
disclosure issues and risks.
Amongst other things, during the year the 
committee considered:
• The regulatory environment in which 
the group operates, which is both 
complex and changing with the transfer 
of regulatory supervision from the 
OFT to the FCA. Changes in laws and 
regulations may have a material impact 
on the group’s business, sector and 
market;
• The group’s approach to and 
methodology for provisioning for bad 
and doubtful receivables, in light of the 
significant judgements and assumptions 
which need to be made in this area;
• The group’s approach to and 
methodology for provisioning for 
inventory which may end up being sold 
at below cost; 
• The group’s exposure to corporate tax 
and VAT risks through open items with 
tax authorities;
• The valuation of the group’s defined 
benefit pension scheme;
• The carrying value of goodwill and 
the related disclosures in the financial 
statements;
• Revenue recognition; and
• Financial instrument valuations and 
disclosures.
A key responsibility of the committee 
is to review the scope, nature and 
effectiveness of internal and external 
audits. The committee ensured that the 
head of internal audit has appropriate 
independence and authority, that the 
scope of internal audit’s work is not 
restricted and that the function has 
adequate resources. The head of internal 
audit has a direct reporting line to me and 
I will continue to work with him as we seek 
to strengthen further the function next 
year. The committee will also continue to 
monitor and review the key aspects of the 
group’s external audit.
Lastly, in relation to risk and control, the 
committee oversaw during the year 
 Corporate Governance Statement  27 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
the development of a new three lines 
of defence model that clearly attributes 
responsibilities and accountability for 
controls. This model is expected to be  
fully embedded next year.
Further information on the committee’s 
responsibilities and the way in which they 
have been discharged is set out below.
I will be available at the annual general 
meeting in July to answer any questions 
you may have on this report and would 
like to thank my colleagues on the audit 
committee for their help and support  
this year.

Chairman of the Audit Committee
 
Audit Committee report
Committee composition
The committee comprises a minimum 
of three members, all of whom are 
non-executive directors. Two members 
constitute a quorum. The committee 
requires the inclusion of one financially 
qualified member with recent and relevant 
financial experience. The committee 
chairman fulfils that requirement. All 
members are expected to have an 
understanding of financial reporting, the 
group’s internal audit control environment, 
relevant corporate legislation, the roles and 
functions of internal and external audit and 
the regulatory framework of the business.
The members of the committee during  
the year were:
Ron McMillan (Chairman appointed  
1 October 2013)
John McGuire (former Chairman retired  
1 October 2013)
Ivan Fallon (retired 1 October 2013)
Simon Patterson (appointed 1 April 2013)
Fiona Laird (appointed 1 April 2013)
Anna Ford
The Chief Executive, the Finance Director, 
the head of internal audit and the external 
auditor are invited to attend audit 
committee meetings where appropriate.
The committee met 3 times during the year 
and attendance was as follows:-
Attendance
Ron McMillan 3
John McGuire 2
Ivan Fallon 2
Simon Patterson 2
Fiona Laird 3
Anna Ford 3
In addition to scheduled meetings, the 
chairman of the committee met with the 
Finance Director, the head of internal audit 
and the external auditor on a number of 
occasions during the year.
Responsibilities
The committee is responsible for:
• Monitoring the integrity of the group’s 
financial statements and reviewing 
significant financial judgements and 
estimates in advance of these being 
considered by the board;
• In conjunction with internal audit and 
the external auditor, reviewing internal 
financial controls and managements’ 
response to required corrective action;
• Monitoring and reviewing the role and 
effectiveness of the group’s internal 
audit function, including activities and 
resources; and
• Overseeing the role and effectiveness  
of the group’s external auditor, reviewing 
and monitoring their objectivity and 
independence and agreeing the scope 
of this work and fees for audit and non-
audit services.
Activities
In addition to the matters referred to in the 
letter from the chairman of the committee 
on page 24, the work of the committee 
during the year included:
• Reviewing the draft interim and annual 
reports and considering:
 (1) The accounting principles, policies 
and practices adopted and the 
adequacy of related disclosures in 
the reports;
 (2) The significant accounting issues, 
estimates and judgements of 
management in relation to financial 
reporting;
 (3) Whether any significant adjustments 
were required arising from the audit;  
and
 (4) Compliance with statutory tax 
obligations and the group’s tax policy.
• Meeting with the internal and external 
auditor, both with and in the absence of 
the executive directors.
• Reviewing and approving the resources 
of, the scope of work undertaken by and 
the reports prepared by internal audit.
• Reviewing the reports prepared by the 
external auditor on key audit findings 
and any significant deficiencies in the 
financial control environment.
• Reviewing and considering the group’s 
systems of internal risk control, sources 
of assurance and exposure to fraud and 
overseeing the development of a new 
risk model for aligning identified risks 
with mitigating actions.
• Overseeing the management of the 
group’s whistleblowing procedures 
which contain procedures for the 
committee to receive, in confidence, 
complaints on all operational matters.
 • Reviewing the performance of the 
external auditor, including their 
relationship with the group, the group’s 
use of the auditor for non-audit services 
and the balance of audit and non-audit 
fees paid to the auditor. Non-audit 
services are generally subject to tender 
processes and the allocations of work 
are done on the basis of competence, 
cost effectiveness, regulatory 
requirements, the potential for conflicts 
to arise and knowledge of the group’s 
business. Deloitte LLP has, during the 
year, provided non-audit services in the 
form of corporate tax, and VAT advisory 
work and regulatory compliance. It was 
considered that Deloitte LLP was best 
placed to provide such advice in view 
of its knowledge of the group’s financial 
position. The committee is satisfied that, 
in relation to these services, Deloitte 
LLP has taken actions to ensure that any 
potential conflicts of interest are properly 
managed.
• Reporting to the board on how it has 
discharged its responsibilities, and
• Making recommendations to the board 
in respect of its findings in respect of all 
of the above matters.
The committee has established a 
continuous process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant 
risks the group faces. This monitoring is 
principally based on reviewing reports 
from senior management to consider 
whether significant operational risks are 
being identified, evaluated, managed and 
controlled and whether any significant 
weaknesses exist which need to be 
addressed. During the year, committee 
members have continued to receive, 
consider and approve updated risk 
evaluations from the operational directors. 
Further details are given later in the Risk 
Management section of this report.
The board considers that the processes 
undertaken by the audit committee 
continue to be appropriately robust and 
effective and in compliance with the 
guidance issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council. During the year the board has not 
been advised by the audit committee of, 
nor identified itself, any failings, frauds or 
weaknesses in internal control which it has 
determined to be material in the context of 
the financial statements. 
Deloitte LLP has been the group’s auditor 
for twelve years and, in light of changing 
practice, it is the group’s intention to 
formally review their appointment in 2015, 
which coincides with the completion of the 
current five year cycle of the audit partner’s 
rotation. The committee has recommended 
 Corporate Governance Statement  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 28
 Corporate Governance Statement 
that Deloitte LLP be reappointed as auditor 
at the forthcoming annual general meeting. 
Deloitte LLP has signified its willingness to 
continue in office and ordinary resolutions 
appointing Deloitte LLP as auditors and 
authorising the directors to set their 
remuneration will be proposed at the 
annual general meeting. The total fees paid 
to Deloitte LLP for the year ended 1 March 
2014 were £1.6m, of which £1.3m was 
in respect of non-audit services. Further 
details are set out in Note 5 to the financial 
statements.
Risk management
The directors have overall responsibility 
for ensuring that the group maintains a 
sound system of internal control. There 
are inherent limitations in any system of 
internal control and no system can provide 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement, loss or failure. Equally no 
system can guarantee elimination of the 
risk of failure to meet the objectives of 
the business. Against this background, 
the board has established a continuous 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the significant risks the group 
faces in order to give it reasonable 
assurances regarding its operations and 
compliance with laws and regulations.
In order to ensure key business 
developments and emerging risks are 
appropriately factored into the risk 
management process, the group’s internal 
auditors facilitated two board level risk 
sessions in the year. The Chief Executive 
and Finance Director along with the 
operational directors identified, ranked 
and reviewed the key risks facing the 
business and appraised the structure of 
internal controls and identified current 
and proposed activities to mitigate these 
risks. The committee was provided 
with the outputs from this process and 
given the opportunity to conduct its own 
assessment of risk across strategic, 
financial and operational areas. The results 
were circulated by internal audit as a key 
driver in the annual internal audit plan.
An enterprise wide mapping of activities 
across business functions was also 
undertaken by internal audit during the 
year to assess the level of risk within each 
activity. Output from this process has also 
been reflected in the annual audit plan.
Appropriate responsibilities and 
accountabilities have been set to ensure 
that there is ownership of the actions 
required to mitigate risk across the 
business.
Risk committee
A risk committee has been established as 
a sub-committee of the audit committee 
on which the Chief Executive, Finance 
Director, the Company Secretary and 
head of internal audit sit, to focus on 
reviewing management's activities and 
to continually monitor and manage the 
risks identified. Operational management 
is asked to present to the risk committee 
on a cyclical basis on the progress of 
agreed actions against the major risks 
identified by the process. The output from 
the risk committee is shared with the audit 
committee and the full board.
The risk committee met on two occasions 
during the year and received presentations 
from operational management covering 
group security, information security 
(including Payment Card Industry 
compliance), risk management and 
Payment Protection Insurance regulatory 
compliance.
The committee believes that appropriate 
internal controls are in place throughout 
the group, the most significant of which 
have been specifically referred to in this 
report. The group has a well-defined 
organisational structure, with clear lines 
of responsibility and explicit authority 
delegated to divisional boards and 
executive management. The group also 
has a comprehensive financial reporting 
system with good communication of plans, 
budgets and monthly results to relevant 
levels of management and the board.
The group has complied, and continues 
to comply, with the provisions of the Code 
on internal controls. There is an on-going 
process in place for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks 
facing the group that has been in place 
throughout the year and to the date of this 
report. The process has been reviewed by 
the committee and the board and accords 
with guidance appended to the Code.
The principal risks which the group has 
identified, together with actions to mitigate 
those risks are set out below:

Nomination Committee 
Introduction by Simon Patterson,  
Chairman of the Nomination Committee.
Dear Shareholder,
It has been a busy year in terms of 
succession planning for N Brown. The 
last year has seen us add three new non-
executive directors, myself, Ron McMillan 
and Fiona Laird, and also a new Chief 
Executive Officer, Angela Spindler. 
The new board members completed a 
full induction programme, which involved 
spending time with the main functions 
and departments of the business. The 
new non-executive directors each took 
up positions as chairs of committees, and 
commenced by reviewing and updating the 
charters and practices of the committees. 
Overall the new board and its committees 
are now well established and well 
positioned to support and challenge the 
executive team.
The objectives of the nomination 
committee is to ensure the board 
comprises individuals possessing the 
requisite skills, knowledge and experience 
to ensure effective oversight and 
governance.
The nomination committee is chaired 
by me, and the members are Andrew 
Higginson, Anna Ford, Ron McMillan 
and Fiona Laird. The formal terms of 
reference for this committee require it to 
make recommendations to the board for 
appointments of directors including, when 
appropriate, the Chairman of the board 
and also directors of the operating board 
and other senior executive staff of the 
operating company. Where appropriate, 
the Chief Executive and Company 
Secretary are invited to attend meetings  
of the committee.
The nomination committee evaluates board 
candidates on merit, against objective 
criteria, taking into account the skills and 
experience required to perform the duties 
of the post with due regard to diversity 
and gender. Where appropriate, external 
search consultants are engaged. 
MWM Consulting LLP ("MWM") was 
appointed by the Committee to assist in 
the discharge of its duties. The three non-
executive directors who were appointed on 
1 April 2013 were identified by means of 
an external candidate search and selection 
process conducted by MWM. MWM have 
no other connection with the company. 
As the new members of the board were 
busy settling into their respective roles, 
no need for a meeting of the nomination 
committee was considered necessary  
this year.
Simon Patterson
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
Corporate social responsibility 
Committee (CSR)
A CSR committee under the chairmanship 
of Anna Ford was established during the 
year.
Introduction by Anna Ford. 
Chairman of the CSR Committee.
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to report that the group 
established a Corporate Social 
Responsibility (“CSR”) committee during 
the year to formalise and focus on the CSR 
work the group has been undertaking. The 
inaugural meeting of the committee took 
place in December 2013.
The members of the committee are me, 
Andy York (ethical trading manager), the 
company secretary. Angela Spindler and 
Caroline Massingham (group HR director). 
The committee met once in the year in 
review.
The committee has responsibility for 
making recommendations to the board 
regarding the following areas of interest: 
looking after the environment, ethically 
sourcing our products and working with 
our employees and the wider community. 
The committee has baselined the group’s 
current level of compliance and is working 
on an overall CSR strategic plan and will 
report next year against agreed targets 
and measurable KPIs. We will seek to 
embed these throughout the business. 
Further details on the group’s compliance 
in the field of CSR are set out below.
At the inaugural meeting, membership 
and terms of reference were agreed and 
a benchmarking report together with an 
update on the group’s involvement on the 
Accord for Fire and Building Safety  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 30
in Bangladesh were received. I would, 
in particular, like to place on record my 
thanks for all the work that our Ethical 
Trading Manager has done on our behalf 
on that Accord.
This will be my last year with N Brown.  
I intend to step down at the forthcoming 
annual general meeting after five years 
service on the board and its committees. 
I am proud to be leaving the company 
having achieved many improvements in 
CSR (and particularly the fine work on the 
Accord). There is much more to do and I 
am sure my successor as chairman, Fiona 
Laird, will continue to make great progress 
in embedding the core values of CSR in 
everything we do.
 
Anna Ford
Chairman of the CSR Committee
 
Ethical standards
The board regards the maintenance of the 
highest ethical standards in business as an 
essential characteristic of the way in which 
the group conducts all of its business.  
A code of ethical conduct covering 
commercial standards, bribery and 
corruption, conflicts of interest, gifts and 
hospitality has been adopted by the group. 
All senior managers and employees of the 
group are required to comply with both the 
letter and the spirit of the code in all their 
dealings for and on behalf of the group. 
In dealings with each other, shareholders, 
customers, suppliers, competitors, 
regulatory authorities and the wider 
community, all employees are required to: 
• ensure that customers are treated fairly;
• conduct dealings with honesty, integrity, 
respect and fairness; 
• comply with all relevant laws, regulations 
and internal company policy; 
• encourage and support a business 
culture which promotes sound 
ethical conduct at all levels within the 
organisation; 
• avoid any situation or action, which 
could cause a conflict of interest or 
damage to the group’s reputation; and
• foster an inclusive team-working 
environment in which praise and 
recognition play key roles. 
Directors of all group companies are 
required to disclose details of related party 
transactions for review and authorisation 
by the audit committee and by the board. 
A gifts and hospitality register is 
maintained which requires all employees 
to record any gift or hospitality offered 
by suppliers and other parties. Monthly 
returns are required from all directors and 
employees declaring any such offers with a 
value of £25 or more, and stating whether 
any offers were accepted or declined. 
As reported in the audit committee report, 
a whistleblowing policy and confidential 
‘hotline’ exists, which provides employees 
with a secure and private means of 
reporting any ethical concerns that they 
may have regarding the way the group or 
any employee is behaving in day-to-day 
activities. One ‘whistleblowing’ event was 
reported in the year by an employee who 
was concerned about a minor pricing 
error on one of the group’s websites. This 
was thoroughly investigated and reported 
to the chairman who concluded that the 
complaint had no foundation.
Environment 
Overview
Our sustainability strategy and 
environmental performance has become 
an integral element of our core business 
strategy. As a responsible multi-channel 
retailer, we have formally committed to 
reduction targets and continually strive to 
exceed expectations of our customers, 
staff and investors. Responsibility for 
group-wide sustainability has been 
assigned to Ian Carr, director of logistics, 
who sits on the operational board of  
J D Williams & Company Limited and who 
reports to the Chief Executive Officer and, 
through her, to the board of directors.
Since 2007, the group has been actively 
working alongside its environmental 
partners, Envantage Limited and 
Viridor Limited, to boost environmental 
performance and increase group-
wide environmental awareness and 
accountability. Ongoing investment 
into energy, carbon, waste and water 
minimisation initiatives has led to a 
considerable reduction in our carbon 
emissions and water footprint profiles. 
Emissions profile
Our Green House Gas (GHG) emissions 
inventory is calculated for the global group 
under the operational control approach, 
in accordance with the GHG Protocol 
and GHG emissions factors published 
by DECC 2013 (V1.1). The inventory is 
independently calculated by our partner 
carbon consultants Envantage Ltd. 
Under GHG reporting guidelines, 
scope 1 and 2 emissions are the key 
mandatory areas to report, illustrating the 
environmental impact of the group for 
activities where we have direct control- i.e. 
operation of our sites and vehicles. As a 
responsible retailer we have also taken 
steps to quantify as many extra optional 
scope 3 emission sources related to our 
operation to boost our environmental 
impact assessment and emissions 
reduction plan.
The table below illustrates our GHG 
emissions across all our reporting areas, 
for the global Group from 1 March 2013  
to 28 February 2014.

Emissions reductions
The table below focuses on key scope 1 
and 2 emissions from the Group by source 
for both the current reporting period and 
the previous year. Since our last reporting 
period we have reduced our overall 
absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 1%, 
despite experiencing growth and increased 
output during this period.

As a growing organisation, evaluation of 
emissions performance using intensity 
ratios allows us to perform more 
meaningful comparisons between 
inventory periods. The table below 
illustrates emissions performance against 
group turnover (£million) and items sold 
(million items).
Since the previous reporting period we 
have significantly reduced our emissions 
by 6.3% and 5.5%, when compared with 
turnover and items shipped respectively.
Mandatory GHG reporting notes
The GHG data disclosed in this report 
complies with the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013. GHG emissions 
disclosed under the required reporting 
categories fall within the groups 
consolidated financial statement.  
Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been 
calculated on a global scale where the 
group has operational control using the 
GHG protocol. The quantified emissions 
are for the reporting year 1 March 2013  
to 28 February 2014. 
Data records
• Natural Gas and electricity: Data is 
primarily calculated based on actual 
metered consumption from invoices or 
meter readings. Where actual metered 
data is not available because energy 
is billed as part of a landlord service 
charge, energy consumption has 
been estimated using floor areas and 
published benchmarks.
• Gas oil: Fuel is used in stand by 
generators and onsite transport (forklifts 
etc.). Data for onsite transport is 
calculated using actual fuel usage from  
 invoices. Generator fuel usage has been 
estimated using generator fuel demand 
per hour and activation information.
• Diesel: Data is calculated based on 
actual fuel consumption from invoices.
• Company car: Data is primarily 
calculated for the group using data 
logged in our global expense system 
which records distance travelled, and 
vehicle information for each business 
travel expense claimed. Any company 
cars not logged on this system have 
been estimated based on milometer 
readings.

• HFC: Refrigeration emissions have been 
calculated from the F-Gas register for 
applicable plant. Emissions for plant 
not affected by this regulation (smaller 
systems) have been calculated using 
data provided by full service records 
or leaking estimator tables have been 
used. Where service records were not 
available for a very small number of 
shops refrigeration losses have been 
estimated.
Employees 
The Chief Executive has board level 
responsibility for employment matters.
Employee involvement – Our success 
is due, in the main, to an engaged, 
enthusiastic, motivated and well-trained 
workforce. Considerable resources are 
devoted to employee training, with a 
large dedicated training team based in 
the contact centre with around 40 people 
providing customer service and systems 
training to ensure our customers receive 
the highest possible levels of service. 
A management development team based 
at head office provides learning and 
development support for head office teams 
and all subsidiary and support divisions. 
The entire management team undergoes 
a bespoke 360 degree appraisal process 
every two years with the intention of 
ensuring that everyone understands the 
impact they have on the teams around 
them. In 2013 we launched ‘simplybefrank’, 
an employee survey used to validate 
engagement levels across the group’s 
divisions and subsidiaries. The Customer 
Service team also run a separate 
engagement survey which provides  
results on a team level within the division. 
A Consultative Forum operates within the 
logistics division where employees from 
all levels contribute and share ideas that 
help shape the culture of the business. 
This year the Logistics division achieved 
Investors in People accreditation at  
Gold standard, joining the Customer 
Service division which achieved this 
standard in 2013. 
A large proportion of the group’s training 
and development work is delivered by 
the HR learning and development team, 
which is supplemented by external 
training in specialist technical and IT 
training areas where necessary as well 
as individually tailored training. There is 
also a suite of self-training and e-learning 
tools available via an online database, 
“simply development”, which enables 
employees to access a wide range of 
self-development activities, tools and 
information.
The company has developed close 
relationships with local universities to retain 
talent within the northwest. We now offer 
graduate schemes in Buying, Quality & IT. 
In addition we offer placements within the 
Buying and Merchandising function with 
many graduates returning post degree. 
An employee profit share scheme has 
been introduced to enable employees to 
participate in the company’s success.  
The scheme provides an enhanced bonus 
for junior grades, providing greater benefit 
differentials for employees promoted to 
non-management grades.
Over 500 group employees either hold 
shares in the company or have options/
awards to acquire them through the 
group’s various share option and long-term 
incentive schemes. 
Consultation – Constructive relationships 
exist with the trade unions that represent 
the group’s employees (principally 
USDAW and SATA). Elements of the group 
are covered by a collective bargaining 
arrangement with USDAW. Union 
membership is encouraged and regular 
communication with the union is facilitated 
through ‘partnership forums’ established 
on the principle of shared commitment to 
business success, employment security 
and development with a particular 
emphasis on quality of life, openness  
and adding value.
Equal opportunities – The group supports 
the principle of equal opportunities in 
employment and is opposed to all forms 
of discrimination, including those on 
the grounds of colour, race, nationality, 
ethnic or national origin, religion, gender, 
age, sexual orientation, marital status or 
disability. 
Our selection processes for recruitment, 
promotion, training and development are 
non-discriminatory. We believe it is in 
the best interests of employees and the 
group to provide these opportunities to the 
most suitable candidates, and to achieve 
a balanced working population spread 
across a diverse range of ethnic origins, 
gender and age groups.
Applications for employment by 
disabled persons are thoroughly and 
sympathetically considered, with 
the aptitude of the applicant being 
regarded foremost. In the event of any 
employee becoming disabled during 
their employment, every effort is made 
to ensure that their employment with 
the group continues and the group will 
endeavour to assist the employee by 
offering additional training, adapting the 
job if appropriate or by offering a transfer 
to another position. It is the policy of the 
group that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons should, 
as far as possible, be identical to that of 
other employees. 
Health and safety – The health, safety 
and welfare at work of its employees, 
contractors, visitors and customers is 
paramount as is ensuring compliance with 
all relevant legislation. The group is also 
committed to best practice initiatives. 
As the number of our retail outlets 
increases, we ensure that we maintain our 
high health and safety standards by having 
robust procedures, training, supervision 
and guidance. Our audit programme for 
the group ensures that all sites are meeting 
the same exacting standards that we 
demand throughout.
Cumulative group accident statistics show 
that for the year in review, reportable 
accidents under Reporting of Injuries, 
Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences 
Regulations 2013 (RIDDOR) have fallen 
as a percentage of our employees from 
0.03% in the previous year to 0.02%.
In the year in review, the group ratio of 
accidents per employee remained static 
at 0.6%. This reflects the work completed 
to ensure that our new retail sites maintain 
the high safety standards expected within 
the group.
The group’s Health & Safety and Human 
Resources departments are complimented 
by an Occupational Health department, 
whose focus is to look after the well-
being of the group’s employees. The 
Department provides advice, guidance 
and support on people’s fitness to work, 
on-site physiotherapy, chiropody and a 
counselling service. 
We endeavour to ensure that all products 
and services sold by the group or used in 
the workplace are safe and without risk 
to employees and customers when used 
properly.
Customers 
A key factor of the group’s success is 
the strength of relationships with our 
customers and their levels of satisfaction 
with our group products and services. 
We aim to attract and retain customers 
through a highly competitive product and 
service offering, regularly monitoring retail 
and home-shopping sector developments 
to stay in touch with our marketplace. 
Insights into our customers’ needs and 
 Corporate Governance Statement  33 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
expectations are regularly updated through 
customer satisfaction surveys conducted 
both directly and through third parties. 
Our overall strategy is to adopt a "multi-
channel" approach to managing customer 
contacts, with the key aim of a joined-
up and consistent customer experience 
across channels. Our multi-channel service 
platforms cover web, telephone, mobile/
tablet and post, and will extend to our new 
store operations.
We continually develop our web-sites for 
richer product content, ease of use, and 
improved performance. Optimisation for 
mobile/tablet devices is a priority due 
to the rapid growth of demand in this 
channel. Web self-service capabilities 
are delivered through a "my account" 
facility for customer order and account 
management information. Web-enabled 
contact centre capabilities are being 
deployed to support our web-trading 
customers, including multimedia, web 
chat, click-to-call and social media. 
The group operates both in-house and 
outsourced contact centres, predominantly 
located in the UK. Our international 
businesses are supported through local 
contact centres in the USA, Germany 
and Eire. Enquiries and complaints have 
been pro-actively reduced over recent 
years as a proportion of customer order 
transactions, reflecting the introduction 
of more customer-oriented policies, 
processes and product/service standards. 
Telephone, email and letter contacts 
received from customers are analysed 
and remedial actions taken to improve our 
levels of service.
Our speed of answering calls and 
responding to emails has been improved 
and made more consistent. Automated 
speech services handle a significant 
proportion of customer telephone 
payments and parcel collection requests. 
We continue to invest in improved speed 
of product deliveries to our customers and 
to offer more delivery service options such 
as next-day or nominated day of delivery. 
E-mails inform customers about their order 
and account status.
Service developments are planned 
to further enhance our multi-channel 
customer experience with new capabilities 
to offer personalisation and choice. 
Individual customer needs and preferences 
will drive their relationship with us across 
brands, products, services, channels, 
offers, trading terms, and communications. 
 
Suppliers
We continue to monitor our suppliers 
under our Code of Conduct. This is based 
on the ETI (Ethical Trade Initiative) Base 
Code, www.ethicaltrade.org. This is a 
global Code of Conduct that is used as 
a standard by retailers across the world. 
We currently deal with 1,564 suppliers 
operating from around 3,400 factories. 
Our main sourcing countries are China, 
India, United Kingdom, Pakistan and 
Bangladesh. 
We continue to regularly audit and risk 
assess our suppliers by using a mix of 
external and our own internal audits.  
We have recently joined SEDEX (Supplier 
Ethical Data Exchange) in an effort to 
reduce duplication of audits and to 
encourage sharing of audit information 
and best practice amongst retailers and 
suppliers. Currently 135 of our suppliers 
are members of SEDEX and we are 
encouraging as many as possible to sign 
up to the scheme. We use the results of 
the audits to try and influence change. 
During the year we strengthened our 
ethical trading team to 3 full-time 
employees. 
As with many other retailers, a major focus 
of our work has been on Bangladesh 
following the tragic building collapse in 
April 2013 of the Rana Plaza complex.  
The group had no direct working 
relationships with any of the factories 
in Rana Plaza but was however the 
first company of its size to sign up 
to the Accord on Fire and Building 
Safety in Bangladesh, (http://www.
bangladeshaccord.org) in May 2013 as 
one of the founding 39 worldwide brands. 
The Accord is a legally binding 5 year 
commitment to make all garment factories 
in Bangladesh safe workplaces, and has 
now been signed by over 160 worldwide 
brands. Our ethical trading manager was 
seconded to work with the Accord staff 
full time for the first 6 months, which 
included spending 45 days in the Geneva 
office of the global trade union, Uniglobal. 
We were also elected as one of the brand 
representatives on the board of the 
Accord.
Full structural, fire and electrical 
inspections have begun with all 1,600 
factories covered by the Accord to be 
inspected by end of August 2014. We have 
participated in 2 separate delegations 
to Bangladesh and worked with the 
ILO (International Labour Organisation), 
Bangladesh government and the BGMEA 
(Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and 
Exporters Association) to enable set up on 
the ground in Dhaka. We are also working 
with the World Bank and the ILO to ensure 
that appropriate funding is available to 
enable the required remediation work to be 
carried out. We continue to invest time in 
this as we see it as a concrete example of 
working together to improve worker safety 
in the garment industry in Bangladesh. 
All factories, inspections and corrective 
actions are openly listed on the Accord 
website. The scheme has a budget of 10 
million USD per year for the 5 years of 
the programme. We have represented the 
Accord at a number of high profile events 
and have been featured in a number of 
press articles throughout the year. 
We have also been working on a number 
of similar projects. For example, we are 
working through the ETI on addressing 
labour rights concerns for women in the 
textile and garment industry in southern 
India. 
We have also been working with other 
retailers and Oxfam in the Vietnam 
Wooden Furniture supply chain. 
We were also part of a project which has 
revised the detail in the working hours 
clause of the ETI Base Code. This is 
designed to give greater clarity, specifically 
looking at the number of hours worked and 
that any overtime worked should be at a 
premium rate of at least 125% of the basic 
salary. We have worked with this group to 
develop an interactive learning tool to help 
companies understand the implications of 
this change for their suppliers.
We are members of a cross retail group 
looking at the issue of a living wage and 
how to put this into practice within all 
supply chains.
We have signed up to the United Nations 
Global Compact. This scheme has over 
10,000 corporate participants and other 
stakeholders from over 145 countries 
worldwide. We publically commit to 
implementing the 10 principles in the areas 
of human rights, labour rights, forced and 
child labour, the environment and anti-
corruption within our supply chain and 
reporting on progress on an annual basis. 
We have also signed up to a government 
funded scheme, SCAP (Sustainable 
Clothing Action Plan), to play our part in 
reducing the carbon, waste and water 
footprints of the clothing we sell by 15%  
by the year 2020. This scheme, involving 
56 other retailers, represents more than 
40% of all UK retail sales. 
 Corporate Governance Statement  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 34
We continue to be members of the 
All Party Parliamentary Corporate 
Responsibility Group and have retrained 
all our buying and merchandising staff in 
all aspects of ethical trading and corporate 
responsibility. 
Paying our suppliers
The group’s policy for the payment 
of suppliers is to ensure that terms of 
payment are negotiated with suppliers 
when agreeing the terms of each 
transaction and to ensure that all suppliers 
are made aware of and accept agreed 
payment terms. The group continually 
reviews payment procedures and liaises 
with suppliers to eliminate difficulties and 
to maintain good working relationships. 
Agreed payment terms are then abided by 
and payment is made in accordance with 
those terms. Trade creditors of the group 
at 1 March 2014 represented 36 days 
(2013, 38 days) of purchases.
Community relations
The group takes great pride in its links with 
local communities and actively supports 
the communities in which it operates.  
It maintains close links with the Christie 
Hospital in Manchester and the Retail Trust 
and also regularly encourages employees 
to participate in fundraising activities for 
these and other worthwhile causes.  
The group matches the money raised 
by employees to double the size of the 
donation. The logistics division provide 
Christmas presents and Easter Eggs for 
children’s wards at local hospitals, sponsor 
the local bonfire and firework display and 
Christmas lights, make donations to local 
schools and work closely with charities 
close to home to help raise much needed 
funds for good causes. 
The group’s family, health and well-
being programme, now in its ninth year, 
continues to provide support and real 
assistance for all of our employees.
 
Relations with investors 
The company places considerable 
importance on good communication with 
all shareholders, be they institutional or 
individual investors. Institutional investors, 
fund managers and analysts are kept 
informed of the company’s overall strategy 
through regular meetings and investor 
‘road-shows’ and site visits. All non-
executive directors are kept informed 
of shareholders’ views through detailed 
feedback on surveys and polls and analyst 
and broker reports are tabled at each 
board meeting. The senior non-executive 
director is available to meet with, and 
consider, the views of major shareholders. 
Other non-executive directors are available 
to meet major shareholders as appropriate.
The company aims to ensure that all 
shareholders have full and timely access 
to the information it discloses in the 
annual report, the yearly and half yearly 
announcements and interim management 
statements and that shareholders 
have the opportunity to meet with the 
executive management team (and certain 
members of the operating division) 
at the announcement of the group’s 
results and also at the annual general 
meeting. Non-executive and executive 
directors also attend meetings with major 
shareholders on request. As well as 
being provided with a copy of the annual 
report and results announcements, the 
group recently overhauled its website to 
provide shareholders with up to date and 
comprehensive material about the group 
and its activities and also real-time market 
information and prices. Shareholders  
also have the opportunity to ask questions, 
make observations and represent their 
views to the board of directors by 
constructive use of the annual general 
meeting.

 Remuneration Report
Introduction by Fiona Laird.  
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2013/14 on 
behalf of the Board and to summarise the 
remuneration committee's main activities 
during the year. 
The remuneration committee now consists 
entirely of independent non-executive 
directors. I became its chairman on  
1 October 2013. In addition to myself,  
the current members are Ron McMillan, 
Simon Patterson, and Anna Ford. 
The remuneration committee met  
on 5 occasions during the year.  
Members’ attendance was as follows:

The remuneration committee reviews, 
formulates and determines the reward and 
remuneration package of each executive 
director and other senior employees of the 
company including the Home Shopping 
board. It also considers how the company 
is applying the principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
in respect of directors’ remuneration. 
We have continued to develop our strategy 
of creating a remuneration framework 
that rewards both long and short-term 
performance as we believe this is in the 
best interests of all of our shareholders.
This is the first year that the report is 
subject to the new regime contained in 
the amended Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the 
“Regulations”). As such, it has been 
separated into the following parts:
• This “Annual Statement” which identifies 
the key messages on remuneration 
for the year under review and explains 
the business context in which the 
committee’s major decisions during the 
period were taken;
• A forward looking “Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy Report” which 
proposes an overall executive 
remuneration framework that will be 
adopted and operated by the company 
in 2014/15 and the following two financial 
years – if approved by shareholders the 
policy set out in this part of the report 
will become binding with effect from the 
annual general meeting to be held on 22 
July 2014; and
• An “Annual Report on Remuneration” 
which provides shareholders with details 
of the remuneration that was actually 
delivered to the company’s directors 
during 2013/14 and explains how the 
new policy referred to above will be 
applied in 2014/15 – this final part of 
the report will be subject to an advisory 
vote at the forthcoming annual general 
meeting. 
On 1 July 2013, Angela Spindler became 
chief executive on terms described in last 
year's Remuneration Report. Details of 
the bonus targets set for her first year as 
chief executive and of her joining awards 
are provided in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration. On 31 October 2013, Alan 
White retired as a director and employee. 
He received a pro-rata bonus for 2013/14 
and his outstanding share awards vested 
on a pro-rata basis as described in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
In addition, he will receive a lump sum 
cash payment as settlement of his pre-
existing entitlements under the company's 
unregistered pension arrangements. 
Details are set out in the Annual Report  
on Remuneration.
The principal performance metric for the 
normal annual bonus was based on group 
profit. The committee determined that 
this element of the annual bonus targets 
had not been met and therefore no bonus 
was awarded to Dean Moore nor to Alan 
White in respect of this element. The 
remainder of the normal annual bonus was 
based on meeting corporate and personal 
objectives. The committee determined 
that these were met in part, resulting 
in a bonus of 16.8% of salary for Dean 
Moore and a bonus of 15.8% of salary, 
on a time pro-rated basis for Alan White. 
As disclosed last year, the bonus agreed 
as part of Angela Spindler’s recruitment 
package was also time pro-rated and 
was based on non-financial personal 
objectives relevant to the balance of the 
financial year following her appointment. 
The committee determined that these had 
been met, resulting in a 83.3% bonus after 
pro-rating. Angela Spindler’s bonus will be 
paid wholly in cash. 25% of Dean Moore’s 
bonus will be delivered as an award of 
shares deferred for two years and in Dean 
Moore’s case, this will also qualify for an 
award of matching shares, vesting based 
on EPS performance over two years.
The committee reviewed the TSR 
performance of the company in respect of 
the 2010 Long Term Incentive Share Plan 
(“LTISP”) award. The company was ranked 
6th out of 20 against its peers at the end 
of the three year performance period, as a 
result of which 85% of the award vested. 
The committee also reviewed the TSR 
performance in relation to Alan White’s 
LTISP awards.
The committee reviewed the salaries of 
the executive directors in April 2014 and 
determined that these should be increased 
by 2.5%, in-line with most of the general 
workforce, effective from 1 June 2014.
Following Angela Spindler’s appointment 
as chief executive and in anticipation of 
the introduction of the company’s first 
binding vote on its remuneration policy at 
the forthcoming annual general meeting 
the remuneration committee has reviewed 
the company's remuneration arrangements 
for executive directors. As a result of this 
review the committee has decided to make 
the following changes to its policy for 
2014/15 and future years:
• The annual incentive arrangements will 
be simplified, bringing the arrangements 
of the Chief Executive and Finance 
Director into line with each other. For 
the Finance Director this will involve 
replacing the share matching element 
with an increase in the maximum 
annual bonus opportunity for 2014/15 
from 100% of salary to 125% of salary 
and an increase in the percentage of 
bonus deferred from 25% to 40% of 
any payout. This change will result in 
effectively no increase in the target value 
of his remuneration and no change in the 
target percentage of his bonus delivered 
in cash and in shares. In addition, the 
vesting period for future deferred bonus 
increased from two to three years for 
both directors. No further matching 
share awards will be made in relation to 
financial years after 2013/14.
• The company intends to seek approval 
for a new Deferred Share Bonus 
Plan that will give effect to the new 
arrangements. Going forward, this will 
replace the existing Deferred Annual 
Bonus Scheme. This will continue to 
enable matching share awards to be 
made to employees below the level of 
the executive directors.
• The weighting of performance measures 
used in the annual bonus is being 
changed to reflect the revised strategic 
priorities of the group, with an increased  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 36
 Remuneration Report
weighting on corporate measures 
and a reduced weighting on personal 
performance. Subject to commercial 
confidentiality, performance against 
these targets will be disclosed in next 
year's report.
• As part of its review the committee 
concluded that Angela Spindler's total 
remuneration was below a mid-market 
level for comparable retailers. Chiefly this 
is as a result of the variable elements of 
remuneration being below median. Given 
her performance and development in the 
role since appointment and in order to 
ensure an increased link to performance, 
the Committee intends to increase both 
the chief executive’s maximum bonus 
and normal long-term incentive award. 
Both are currently set at 125% of salary, 
as a result of which the overall level of 
incentive opportunity is below market. 
For 2014 onwards these will both be 
increased to 150% of salary. The impact 
of these changes will be to position 
Angela Spindler's total remuneration at 
a broadly mid-market level. The finance 
director’s LTIP award would also be 
increased from 100% to 125% of salary 
to increase the focus on longer-term 
performance. Following this change his 
remuneration would remain below mid-
market.
• The company intends to seek approval 
for a new Long-Term Incentive Plan 
at the annual general meeting in July 
2014. Going forward, this will replace 
the Long-Term Incentive Share Plan 
(“LTISP”). The new plan will reflect 
current market and best practice and 
the individual limit for normal awards will 
remain at 150% of base salary. However, 
in exceptional circumstances , such as 
on recruitment, awards up to 200% of 
salary will be permitted. Awards with 
an initial market value of 150% of salary 
and 125% of salary to Angela Spindler 
and Dean Moore, respectively, will be 
granted shortly after the annual general 
meeting in July 2014.
• With the exception of the award made 
to Angela Spindler shortly following 
her appointment which was subject to 
equally weighted earnings per share 
(“EPS”) and relative total shareholder 
return (“TSR”) performance conditions, 
relative TSR has historically been 
the sole performance metric used to 
determine the vesting of awards under 
the LTISP. For 2014/15 and future years 
the committee intends to use growth 
in adjusted EPS in excess of RPI and 
relative TSR as the metrics in the long-
term incentive arrangements. For the 
2014 awards adjusted EPS would have 
a 60% weighting and relative TSR would 
have a 40% weighting. The committee 
has also reviewed the TSR comparator 
group to ensure that it is appropriate 
for the awards in 2014 and has made a 
number of minor changes. Details of the 
revised group are provided in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
I will be available to answer any questions 
at the annual general meeting in July and 
very much hope that you will support 
the Directors' Remuneration Report and 
Annual Report on Remuneration at our 
forthcoming meeting.
I would like to thank all of my colleagues 
on the remuneration committee for all 
their hard work in implementing the new 
reporting requirements of the Director’s 
Remuneration Report and generally with 
the day to day tasks of the committee over 
the last year.

Remuneration policy
This report sets out the information 
required by Part 4 of the Schedule 8 to 
The Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2008, as 
amended. The report also satisfies the 
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules 
of the Financial Conduct Authority, and 
describes how the board has applied  
the principles and complied with 
the provisions relating to directors’ 
remuneration in the Code. 
It summarises the committee’s 
remuneration policy for the executive 
directors which, if approved by 
shareholders at the 2014 annual general 
meeting, will become effective immediately 
thereafter.
The committee’s policy is designed to 
ensure that the main elements of the 
remuneration package are linked to 
the company’s annual and long-term 
strategy, are appropriate in quantum 
and capable of attracting, motivating 
and retaining executive directors. The 
policy aims to reward executive directors 
and senior executives by offering them 
competitive remuneration packages, which 
are prudently constructed, sufficiently 
stretching and linked to long-term 
profitability and which do not encourage 
excessive risk taking. 
In particular, the committee strives to 
ensure that remuneration packages are:
• aligned with the group’s strategic plan;
• aligned with shareholders’ interests;
• measured against stretching targets, 
both in absolute and relative terms;
• competitive and sufficiently flexible to 
support the recruitment needs of the 
business;
• paid in a combination of cash and 
shares; and
• linked to performance measured over 
annual and three-year performance 
periods.

More significant increases 
may be awarded at 
the discretion of the 
committee, for example: 
where there is a change in

From 2014/15 onwards, 
bonuses will be paid 60% 
in cash, with 40% deferred 
as a conditional award of 
shares.
Vesting of future deferred 
shares is at the end of 
three years from the award 
of the bonus, subject to 
continued employment 
(save in “good leaver” 
scenarios). 
The payment of any 
earned bonus remains 
ultimately at the discretion 
of the committee.
Executives may also be 
entitled to receive the 
value of dividends that 
would have been paid on 
vested shares during the 
deferral period.
Chief executive: up to 150% 
of base salary p.a. 
Other executive directors: 
up to 125% of base  
salary p.a.
A significant majority of 
the annual bonus will 
normally be determined by 
reference to performance 
against stretching group 
profit measures.
Additional targets linked 
to corporate performance 
and individual targets will 
be applied.
Personal objectives will be 
measurable and linked to 
goals that are consistent 
with the group’s longer-
term goals.
Performance below 
threshold results in zero

 Remuneration Report
Notes:
1. A description of how the company 
intends to implement the policy set out 
in this table for 2014 /15 is set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration on  
page 41. 
2. The remuneration policy for the 
executive directors and other senior 
executives is designed with regard to 
the policy for employees across the 
group as a whole. However, there are 
some differences in the structure of the 
remuneration policy for senior executives. 
In general, these differences arise 
from the development of remuneration 
arrangements that are market competitive 
for the various categories of individuals. 
They also reflect the fact that, in the case 
of the executive directors and senior 
executives, a greater emphasis tends to be 
placed on performance-related pay in the 
market. 
3. Prior to 2014/15, 25% of any bonus to 
executive directors (other than Angela 
Spindler) was compulsorily deferred in 
shares for two years and eligible for a 1:1 
matching award of shares, vesting of which 
was subject to performance conditions. 
Angela Spindler’s 2013/14 bonus is 
delivered wholly in cash.
4. All-employee share plans do not 
have performance conditions. Executive 
directors are eligible to participate in the 
SAYE and SIP on the same terms as other 
employees. 
5. Copies of the LTIP rules are available on 
request from the company secretary.
6. LTISP awards granted prior to 2014 
are subject to performance conditions 
described in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
7. The company also operates share 
ownership guidelines requiring executive 
directors to acquire and hold a specified 
level of shareholding. The current level 
of holding expected under the guidelines 
is described in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
How employees’ pay is taken  
into account
The remuneration policy for the executive 
directors is designed with regard to 
the policy for employees across the 
group as a whole. The company’s 
ability to meet growth expectations and 
compete effectively is dependent on 
the skills, experience and performance 
of all of our employees. As a result our 
employment policies, remuneration 
and benefit packages for employees 
are regularly reviewed. Whilst there are 
some differences in the structure of 
the remuneration policy, these reflect 
individuals' differing responsibilities, with 
the principal difference being the increased 
emphasis on performance related pay 
for the more senior executives within the 
organisation. 
Although the committee does not consult 
directly with employees on directors’ pay, 
the committee does take into consideration 
the pay and employment conditions of 
all employees when setting the policy for 
directors’ remuneration. The committee 
is also mindful of any changes to the pay 
and benefit conditions for employees more 
generally when considering the policy for 
directors' pay.
Committee discretions
The committee operates the group’s 
variable incentive plans according to their 
respective rules and in accordance with 
HMRC rules where relevant. To ensure the 
efficient administration of these plans and 
to be consistent with market practice, the 
committee will retain certain operational 
discretions. These include:
• selecting plan participants;
• determining the timing of grants of 
awards and/or payment;
• determining the quantum of awards and/
or payments (within the limits set out in 
the policy table above);
• determining the extent of vesting based 
on the assessment of performance;
• making the appropriate adjustments 
required in certain circumstances 
(e.g. change of control, rights issues, 
corporate restructuring events, and 
special dividends); 
• determining “good leaver” status for 
incentive plan purposes and applying 
the appropriate treatment; and
• undertaking the annual review of 
weighting of performance measures, 
and setting targets for the annual bonus 
plan and LTIP from year to year.
If an event occurs which results in the 
Annual Bonus Plan, Deferred Share Bonus 
Plan or LTIP performance conditions 
and/or targets being deemed no longer 
appropriate (e.g. a material acquisition or 
divestment), the committee will have the 
ability to adjust appropriately the measures 
and/or targets and alter weightings, 
provided that the revised conditions or 
targets are not materially less difficult to 
satisfy.
Any use of the above discretions would, 
where relevant, be explained in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration and may, as 
appropriate, be the subject of consultation 
with the company’s major shareholders.
Legacy arrangements
In approving the remuneration policy, 
authority is given to the company to 
honour any commitments previously 
entered into with the current or former 
directors in accordance with the relevant 
plan rules, where applicable. It is also part 
of this policy that the company will honour 
payments or awards crystallising after the 
effective date of this policy but arising from 
commitments entered into at a time when 
the relevant individual was not a director 
at the company. Details of any payments 
to former directors will be set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Selection of performance metrics  
and targets
All incentives are subject to the individual 
review and scrutiny of the committee, 
particularly in the case of share incentives, 
both at award and vesting to ensure 
that performance has been correctly 
adjudicated and to safeguard against 
excessive overall reward. Variable pay 
and remuneration is linked to both 
corporate and individual performance and 
is benchmarked to attract and retain the 
highest quality people. 
The annual bonus is designed to 
thoroughly stretch the performance of the 
executive and is linked to absolute growth 
in annual group profit, the achievement of 
certain business targets and of personal 
objectives. These targets are reviewed and 
agreed by the committee at the beginning 
of each financial year to ensure that they 
are appropriate to the current market 
conditions and the long-term strategy of 
the company, and that they continue to 
remain stretching and challenging. The 
targets are linked to KPIs which are drawn 
from, and relate to, the achievement of 
‘milestones’ contained in the company’s 
strategic long-term plan. This ensures they 
are aligned to the strategic objectives of 
the company and designed to increase 
shareholder value, whilst being prudent 
and safeguarding the long-term future of 
the company.
The committee has decided to apply a 
condition based on growth in adjusted 
EPS alongside the existing measure,  
TSR, to awards made under the LTIP in 
2014 and future years. Adjusted EPS is 
considered appropriate as it is easily 
understood, is a key measure of financial 
performance and closely aligned to the 
company’s objectives of driving profitable 
growth. The measure takes account of fair 
value adjustments to financial instruments 
(net of tax) as well as other exceptional 
non-recurring items such as unplanned 
investments in, for example, IT 
infrastructure, investments to drive long 
term growth, acquisitions and/or disposals. 
As the targets are set as a rate of growth in 
excess of RPI it also takes into account 
inflation. TSR provides an external  N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 40
 Remuneration Report
assessment of the company's performance 
against its peers and aligns rewards 
received by the executives with the returns 
received by shareholders. The committee 
determines from time to time which 
companies are to be added or removed 
from this comparator group, including the 
treatment of any company which ceases 
trading during any performance period.
The committee considers the group’s 
performance on environmental, social and 
governance (‘ESG’) issues when setting 
the remuneration of any executive director 
and is of the opinion that the incentive 
arrangements for senior managers do not 
raise ESG risks by inadvertently motivating 
irresponsible behaviour or the taking of 
undue risks with the business.
Shareholding guidelines
It is the board’s policy that executive 
directors build and retain a minimum 
shareholding in the company. Under these 
guidelines the chief executive and the 
finance director are respectively required 
to hold company shares equal in value 
(at the time of acquisition) to 200% and 
100% of their base salary, respectively and 
to have met this guideline within 5 years 
of appointment. Details of the current 
shareholdings of the executive directors 
are provided later in this report.
How shareholders’ views are taken  
into account
The committee considers shareholder 
feedback received regarding the directors’ 
remuneration report and guidance from 
shareholder representative bodies more 
generally. As appropriate, the committee 
also seeks feedback from shareholders 
on specific matters. These views are key 
inputs when shaping remuneration policy.

Executive directors’ service 
agreements and termination policy 
It is the company’s policy that executive 
directors should have contracts with an 
indefinite term providing for a maximum  
of 12 months' notice. 
The policy is that the company does not 
make payments beyond its contractual 
obligations on termination. In addition, 
executive directors are expected to 
mitigate their loss or, within existing 
contractual constraints, accept phased 
payments. The committee seeks to 
ensure that there are no unjustified 
payments for failure. Neither of the 
executive directors’ contracts provides 
for liquidated damages. There are no 
special provisions contained in any of the 
executive directors’ contracts that provide 
for longer periods of notice on a change of 
control of the company. Furthermore, there 
are no special provisions providing for 
additional compensation on an executive 
director’s cessation of employment with 
the company. Where the director may 
be entitled to pursue a legal claim, the 
company will be entitled to negotiate 
settlement terms that the committee 
considers to be in the best interests 
of the company and to enter into a 
settlement agreement to effect the terms 
agreed under the service contract and 
any additional statutory or other claims. 
Potential termination payments are 
summarised below:
Other than in certain “good leaver” 
circumstances (including, but not limited 
to, redundancy, ill-health or retirement or 
on a change of control), no bonus would 
be payable unless the individual remains 
employed and is not under notice at 
the payment date. Any bonuses paid to 
a “good leaver” would be based on an 
assessment of their individual and the 
company’s performance over the period, 
and pro-rated for the proportion of the 
bonus year worked.
Deferred bonus share awards will 
also normally lapse on cessation of 
employment, unless the executive director 
is deemed to be a “good leaver” by the 
committee. Awards will vest early on a 
change of control subject to the plan rules.
With regards to long-term incentive awards, 
the LTIP rules provide that other than in 
certain “good leaver” circumstances, 
awards lapse on cessation of employment. 
Where an individual is a “good leaver”, the 
committee’s normal policy for future LTIP 
awards will be to permit awards to remain 
outstanding until the end of the original 
performance period, when a pro-rata 
reduction will be made to take account of 
the proportion of the vesting period that 
elapsed prior to termination of 
employment, although the committee has 
discretion to partly or completely disapply 
pro-rating and the performance conditions 
and/or allow earlier vesting in certain 
circumstances. On a change of control 
awards would vest, subject to the extent  
to which the performance conditions have 
been achieved and, normally, pro-rating  
for time. The committee has discretion to 
determine “good leaver” treatment. In 
doing so, it will take account of the reason 
for their departure and the performance  
of the individual. 
For awards granted under the LTISP, 
awards lapse if cessation occurs during 
the financial year in which an award is 
granted. Thereafter awards held by good 
leavers may vest subject to performance 
without pro-rating. On a change of control 
existing awards would not be pro-rated. 
Apart from service contracts, no executive 
director has any material interest in any 
contract with the company or its 
subsidiaries.
Copies of executive directors’ service 
contracts (and also non-executive 
directors’ letters of appointment) are 
available for inspection at the company’s 
registered office on application to the 
company secretary.
Recruitment of executive directors
Base salary levels will be set in accordance 
with the company’s remuneration policy, 
taking account of the executive’s skills, 
experience and their current remuneration 
package. Where it is appropriate to offer 
a lower salary initially, a series of above 
inflation increases to the desired salary 
positioning may be given over subsequent 
years subject to individual and company 
performance. 
Benefits and pension will generally be 
provided in accordance with the approved 
policy, with relocation expenses and/or an 
expatriate allowance paid for if necessary. 
For an overseas appointment, the benefit 
and pension arrangements may be tailored 
to reflect local market practice (subject to 
the overall maximum limits set out in the 
policy table). Assistance with relocation 
may be provided where appropriate. Tax 
equalisation may also be considered as 
may payment of the executive’s legal fees 
in connection with the appointment.
The variable pay opportunity will be in 
accordance with the company’s approved 
policy as detailed above. However, 
different performance measures and targets 
may be set for the first year in the case of 
the annual bonus and long-term incentives 
taking into account the responsibilities of 
the individual, and the point in the financial 
year at which they joined.
If it is necessary to buy-out incentive pay, 
which would be forfeited by reason of 
leaving the previous employer, in order 
to secure the appointment, this would be 
provided for taking into account the form 
(cash or shares), timing and expected 
value (i.e. likelihood of meeting any existing 
performance criteria) of the remuneration 
being forfeited and such other specific 
matters as the committee considers 
relevant. Existing arrangements may be 
bought out on terms that are no more 
favourable than the committee considers 
is required to provide reasonable 
compensation to the incoming director 
for the awards they will be losing. Existing 
plans will be used to the extent possible 
(subject to the exceptional limits contained 
in the plan rules), however, the committee 
retains discretion to agree bespoke 
arrangements and, if required, to make 
use of the flexibility provided by the 
Listing Rules to make awards without prior 
shareholder approval when buying out 
existing entitlements. There is no intention 
to use this flexibility to offer a “golden 
hello” unrelated to remuneration lost.
The service contract for a new appointment 
would be in accordance with the policy for 
the current executive directors.
In the case of an internal hire, any 
outstanding variable pay awarded in 
relation to the previous role will be allowed 
to pay out according to its terms of grant.
Fees for a new chairman or non-executive 
director will be set in line with the approved

Advisers
The committee received advice from  
New Bridge Street (a trading name of 
Aon Hewitt Limited, part of Aon plc). New 
Bridge Street was formally appointed by 
the committee. In addition, Mercer Human 
Resource Consulting Limited (“Mercer”) 
provided advice to the company during 
the year which materially assisted the 
committee in relation to the former chief 
executive's pension arrangements and 
Pinsent Masons LLP provided advice 
on compliance with legislation. Pinsent 
Masons LLP are the group’s general 
legal advisers and were not specifically 
appointed by the committee. Mercer 
were not specifically appointed by the 
committee and also provide other services 
to the company in relation to pension 
matters. These advisors have no other 
connections with the group other than as 
set out above.
New Bridge Street is a signatory to the 
Remuneration Consultants’ Group Code 
of Conduct, which sets out guidelines to 
ensure that its advice is independent and 
free from undue influence. The company 
received no other services from New 
Bridge Street, or any other part of the Aon 
group of companies, during the year.  
The fees paid to New Bridge Street in 
2013/14 were £39,226 (2012/13, £22,553). 
The fees paid to Mercer in 2013/14 in 
relation to the former chief executive’s 
pension arrangements in 2013/14 
were £15,049 (2012/13, £19,606). The 
committee reviews the performance and 
independence of its advisers on an annual 
basis and is satisfied that the advice 
received is objective and independent.
The advisors’ terms of engagement are

Notes:
1.  In assessing the performance achieved against the group profit performance condition the remuneration committee did not consider that the group profit 
achieved was supported by the underlying trading profit performance of the group. It therefore determined that the targets for the profit bonus element  
had not been met.
2. The precise targets set for the corporate and individual objectives are considered to be commercially sensitive and are not capable of disclosure at the  
present time.
3. Angela Spindler’s 2013/14 bonus award was pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the year employed at N Brown Group.
4. Angela Spindler’s bonus is delivered wholly in cash. Dean Moore’s 2013/14 bonus is delivered 75% in cash with 25% deferred in shares for two years and  
eligible for a 1:1 matching award of shares, vesting of which is subject to performance conditions.

On an exceptional basis, and only to the 
extent necessary to compensate for 
awards which were forfeited as a result  
of taking up her appointment with the 
company, Angela Spindler was granted 
two one-off share awards as detailed in 
the 2013 Annual Report on Remuneration. 
Vesting of the first, over shares worth 
£520,000 at the time of grant, is subject to 
employment conditions over two years. 
The value of this award is included in the 
single figure for 2013/14. The second, over 
shares worth £1,040,000 at the time of 
grant is also subject to the achievement  
of strategic objectives measured over a 
period of three years. 
The specific strategic targets are 
commercially sensitive but include the 
following:
• Further development of the retail  
space strategy;
• Development and delivery of segmented 
marketing strategy and multi-channel 
offering including international; 
• Improving the impact and effectiveness 
of customer insight through access to 
and analysis of big data;
• Delivery of our systems infrastructure 
programme.
The recruitment awards described above 
were granted pursuant to the exemption 
from the need for prior shareholder 
approval contained in Listing Rule 9.4.2. 
The awards are non-pensionable and  
non-transferable (other than on death).  
The committee considered that the  
awards were necessary to facilitate Angela 
Spindler’s recruitment as chief executive. 
 
Summary of awards (Audited)
The table below summarises each of  
the executive directors’ long-term share 
awards and the changes that have taken 
place in the year.
The current deferred annual bonus scheme 
was introduced in 2010. Under its terms, 
executive directors (excluding Angela 
Spindler) invest up to 25% of their base 
salary into shares and defer receipt for two 
years. Matching shares could be earned 
subject to employment conditions and 
were subject to a financial performance 
condition requiring that growth in the 
company's EPS must at least equal the 
growth in RPI over the deferral period.  
The matching element of the deferred 
annual bonus scheme will operate for the 
last time in respect of the finance director’s 
bonus outcome for 2013/14. N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 50

Directors’ shareholdings (Audited)
It is the board’s policy that executive 
directors build up and retain a minimum 
shareholding in the company. Under these 
guidelines the chief executive and the 
finance director are expected to hold 
company shares equal in value (at the time 
of acquisition) to 200% and 100% of their 
base salary respectively and to have met 
this guideline within 5 years of 
appointment.

served during the year, together with those 
of their families, in the shares of the

Termination payments (Audited)
Alan White received no payments 
specifically for loss of office or in relation 
to the cessation of his employment.  
His pro-rated bonus and share awards  
are included in the table on page 43.  
On retirement, the benefit calculated  
under the rules of a pre-existing 
unregistered pension arrangement 
adjusted so that it no longer includes the 
reduction for retained benefits described  
in the 2013 Remuneration Report was 
£19,299 per annum. That entitlement has 
since been commuted to a lump sum  
of £325,957 to be paid to him in due  
course, thereby extinguishing any future

Opinion on financial statements of  
N Brown Group plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the group’s and 
of the parent company’s affairs as at  
1 March 2014 and of the group’s profit 
for the 52 week period then ended;
• the group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union;
• the parent company financial statements 
have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and
• the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies  
Act 2006 and, as regards the group  
financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the group and parent company 
Balance Sheets, the Consolidated 
Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, and 
the related notes 1 to 39. The financial

in the preparation of the group financial 
statements is applicable law and IFRSs  
as adopted by the European Union.  
The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in the preparation of 
the parent company financial statements 
is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we 
have reviewed the directors’ statement 
contained on page 15 that the group is  
a going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the directors’ 
use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in the preparation of the 
financial statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material 
uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt on the group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
However, because not all future events 
or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the 
group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.
Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
The assessed risks of material 
misstatement described below are those 
that had the greatest effect on our audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in 
the audit and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team:
 Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of N Brown Group Plc
Risk
Impairment of customer receivables
The impairment provision is a critical judgement in preparing 
the accounts and is estimated using a model which contains 
a number of inputs and assumptions that includes the arrears 
stage of a customer, previous payment history, the historical 
performance of other customers and the length of time that the 
borrower has been a customer.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
We have focussed our audit challenge in a number of areas, 
including benchmarking the methodology and assumptions, 
comparing the assumptions to objective evidence, evaluating 
the design and implementation of the key controls, checking 
the calculation methodology for compliance with accounting 
standards and industry practice and assessing the movement in 
the provision compared to trends in arrears, write-offs, recoveries 
and the size and mix of the customer receivables portfolio.
We consulted with credit specialists to design the audit 
methodology and to enhance our challenge of assumptions  
and methodology through benchmarking.
Data specialists checked the integrity of the calculations by 
performing an independent recalculation of the provision and 
checked the completeness and accuracy of data inputs by  
testing the underlying transactions on a sample basis.
Regulatory
The Group operates in a regulated environment not only because 
it is a listed entity, but also because of the unsecured credit it 
provides to customers. Specifically:
• The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) began to regulate the 
consumer credit market on 1 April 2014. The FCA has the 
power to suspend or withdraw a firm’s regulatory permissions, 
so there is a risk that if a firm does not comply with regulations, 
then their permission to lend to customers may be suspended 
or terminated.
• Regulated companies must ensure that their governance 
arrangements are appropriate, that only authorised 
people within the group are approved to carry out work 
in this regulated environment and that their boards and 
subcommittees are operating effectively.
• Payment Protection Insurance (‘PPI’) remains an area of  
focus for the group given the media exposure this has  
received in recent years.
We involved regulatory specialists in our evaluation of the design 
and implementation of controls and practices in place in relation 
to the processes the group has established to manage regulatory 
compliance and governance and benchmarked these against 
sources of best practice.
We reviewed correspondence with regulators and selected a 
sample of customer complaints for testing and used analytical 
procedures to assess the completeness of any provisions for 
such complaints. N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 54
The Audit Committee’s consideration  
of these risks is set out on pages 26/27.
Our audit procedures relating to these 
matters were designed in the context of 
our audit of the financial statements as a 
whole, and not to express an opinion on 
individual accounts or disclosures. Our 
opinion on the financial statements is not 
modified with respect to any of the risks 
described above, and we do not express 
an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of 
misstatement in the financial statements 
that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person would be changed or influenced. 
We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group 
to be £4.9 million, which is 5% of pre-tax 
profit, and 1% of equity.
We agreed with the Audit Committee  
that we would report to the Committee  
all audit differences in excess of £97,000,  
as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds. We also report 
to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing 
the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Given the nature of the group’s corporate 
structure where all evidence relating to 
each component is compiled at the 
group’s head office, we performed an 
audit covering 100% of the group’s trading 
components and accordingly our samples 
were selected from 100% of the group’s 
total assets, revenue and profit. All group 
companies are subject to the same  
group-wide controls and consolidation 
processes, which were audited as part  
of our work.
The group has a significant trading 
component, J. D. Williams & Company 
Limited, which was focused on as part of 
the audit. The audit of this company was 
completed to a lower materiality than for 
the consolidated accounts. 
At the parent entity level we also tested 
the consolidation process and carried 
out analytical procedures to confirm our 
conclusion that there were no significant 
risks of material misstatement of the 
aggregated financial information of the 
remaining components not subject to audit 
or audit of specified account balances.
Opinion on other matters prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for 
the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and 
accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our 
audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not 
been kept by the parent company, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited 
by us; or
• the parent company financial statements 
are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of 
these matters.
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we 
are also required to report if in our 
opinion certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration have not been made or the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited is not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns. We 
have nothing to report arising from these 
matters.
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are also 
required to review the part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the company’s compliance 
with nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. We have nothing to 
report arising from our review.
 Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of N Brown Group Plc
Risk
Taxation provisions
The group has ongoing debates with HMRC in respect of open 
taxation positions and certain areas of expense. The outcomes of 
these cases are uncertain and therefore are subject to estimates 
by management.
How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Our audit team included independent taxation specialists who  
have reviewed correspondence with HMRC to date and considered 
whether this correspondence has been interpreted and applied 
correctly, having also considered current industry practice. 
We have reviewed and recalculated the amounts provided and 
agreed these to supporting documentation to ensure the integrity 
of the data provided. We have assessed the judgements taken 
and concluded on whether these judgements made are within a 
reasonable range of possible outcomes.
Inventory provisioning
The inventory provision is based on the amount of current and 
non-current stock on hand at the year end and the forecast 
disposal plan, which estimates inventory items to be sold both 
above and below cost. Therefore the provision is the subject of 
considerable management judgement.
We utilised data analytics to test the inventory provision by 
comparing the selling price of inventory in the year to the cost of 
the inventory as well as analysing the ageing of inventory items.  
In addition, we considered the appropriateness of the provisioning 
methodology through analysing the inventory disposal channels 
utilised in the year and comparing those to the forecast disposal 
plan. To confirm existence of the inventory and the inventory 
counting procedures, we test counted inventory independently 
twice in the year. 55 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
 Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of N Brown Group Plc
Our duty to read other information in the 
Annual Report 
Under International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland), we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the 
information in the audited financial 
statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to 
consider whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the 
directors’ statement that they consider 
the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the audit 
committee which we consider should have 
been disclosed. We confirm that we have 
not identified any such inconsistencies or 
misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of  
directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of  
the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require  
us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
We also comply with International 
Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and 
Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools 
aim to ensure that our quality control 
procedures are effective, understood  
and applied. Our quality controls and 
systems include our dedicated 
professional standards review team, 
strategically focused second partner 
reviews and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the 
company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as 
a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence  
about the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud  
or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the group’s and the parent 
company’s circumstances and have  
been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made  
by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.  
In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements  
and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based  
on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course  
of performing the audit. If we become 
aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.

 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 60
1 General information
N Brown Group plc is a company 
incorporated in the United Kingdom under 
the Companies Act 2006. The address of 
the registered office is listed at the end 
of the report. The nature of the group’s 
operations and its principal activities are 
set out on page 18 of the directors’ report. 
These financial statements are presented 
in pounds sterling because that is the 
currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the group operates. 
Foreign operations are included in 
accordance with the policies set out  
in note 2. 
The group's financial statements for  
the 52 weeks ended 1 March 2014 
have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted for use in the EU.
The accounting policies have been applied 
consistently in the current and prior 
periods, other than that as set out below.
Adoption of new and revised Standards
In the current year, the following new and 
revised Standards and Interpretations 
have been adopted and have affected 
the amounts reported in these financial 
statements.
 
Standards affecting the financial 
statements
IAS19 (revised) Employee Benefits.  
An amendment to IAS19 has impacted 
the various components representing 
movements in the defined pension 
obligation, but not the group’s total 
obligation. Expected returns on plan 
assets has been replaced with a net 
finance cost in the income statement.  
The prior year figures have not been 
restated as the impact is not material.
The Annual Improvements to IFRSs  
2009 - 2011 have made a number of 
amendments to IFRSs.
The amendments that are relevant to 
the group are the amendments to IAS 1 
regarding when a statement of financial 
position as at the beginning of the 
preceding period (third statement  
of financial position) and the related  
notes are required to be presented.  
The amendments specify that a third 
statement of financial position is 
required when a) an entity applies an 
accounting policy retrospectively, or 
makes a retrospective restatement or 
reclassification of items in its financial 
statements, and b) the retrospective 
application, restatement or reclassification 
has a material effect on the information in 
the third statement of financial position. 
The amendments specify that related 
notes are not required to accompany  
the third statement of financial position. 
• IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of 
guidance under IFRS for all fair value 
measurements. IFRS 13 does not change 
when an entity is required to use fair value, 
but rather provides guidance on how to 
measure fair value under IFRS. IFRS 13 
defines fair value as an exit price. As a 
result of the guidance in IFRS 13, the group 
re-assessed its policies for measuring fair 
values, in particular, its valuation inputs 
such as non-performance risk for fair value 
measurement of liabilities. IFRS 13 also 
requires additional disclosures.
Application of IFRS 13 has not materially 
impacted the fair value measurements of 
the group. Additional disclosures where 
required, are provided in the individual 
notes relating to the assets and liabilities 
whose fair values were determined.
At the date of authorisation of these 
financial statements, the following 
Standards and Interpretations which 
have not been applied in these financial 
statements were in issue but not yet 
effective (and in some cases had not  
yet been adopted by the EU):
• IFRS 9: Financial Instruments
• IFRS 10: Consolidated Financial 
Statements
• IFRS 11: Joint Arrangements
• IFRS 12: Disclosure of Interests in  
Other Entities
• IAS 27 (revised): Separate Financial 
Statements
• IAS 28 (revised): Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures
• Amendments to IAS 32: Offsetting 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
• Amendments to IAS 36: Recoverable 
Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial 
Assets
The directors do not expect that the 
adoption of the standards listed above 
will have a material impact on the financial 
statements of the group in future periods, 
except as follows:
• IFRS 9 will impact both the 
measurement and disclosures of 
Financial Instruments.
2 Accounting policies
Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting and Accounting Standards 
(IFRS)
The group has adopted Standards and 
Interpretations issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and 
the International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the 
IASB that are relevant to its operations.
Individual standards and interpretations 
have to be adopted by the European 
Commission (EC) and the process leads 
to a delay between the issue and adoption 
of new standards and interpretations 
and in some cases amendments by the 
EC. Where the group has applied a new 
standard or interpretation in advance of  
EC adoption this will be noted below in  
the relevant policy statement.
Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS.  
The financial statements have also  
been prepared in accordance with  
IFRSs adopted by the European Union  
and therefore comply with Article 4 of  
the EU IAS Regulation. 
The financial statements have been 
prepared on the historical cost basis, 
except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments. The principal accounting 
policies adopted are set out as follows. 
Accounting period 
Throughout the accounts, the directors 
report and financial review, reference to 
2014 means at 1 March 2014 or the  
52 weeks then ended; reference to 2013 
means at 2 March 2013 or the 52  
weeks then ended unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements 
incorporate the financial statements  
of the company and entities controlled  
by the company (its subsidiaries) made  
up to the Saturday that falls closest to  
28 February each year. The Employee 
Share Ownership Trust is also made up 
to a date coterminous with the financial 
period of the parent company. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or 
disposed of during the period are included 
in the consolidated income statement 
from the effective date of acquisition or 
up to the effective date of disposal, as 
appropriate. Control is achieved where 
 Notes to the Group Accounts 61 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
the company has the power to govern 
the financial and operating policies of an 
investee entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the 
accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated  
on consolidation. 
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is 
accounted for using the purchase method. 
The cost of the acquisition is measured  
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the 
date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities 
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree. The acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities that meet the conditions for 
recognition under IFRS 10 are recognised  
at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is 
recognised as an asset on the date 
control is acquired and initially measured 
at cost, being the excess of the cost 
of the business combination over the 
group’s interest in the net fair value of 
the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities recognised. If, after 
reassessment, the group’s interest in the 
net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
exceeds the cost of the business 
combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. 
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed 
for impairment at least annually. Any 
impairment is recognised immediately 
in the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the 
determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions 
before 1 March 1998 was charged against 
reserves in the year of acquisition in 
accordance with UK GAAP and has not been 
reinstated and is not included in determining 
any subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of 
the consideration received or receivable 
and represents the total amount receivable 
for goods and services provided in the 
normal course of business net of returns, 
VAT and sales related taxes. 
Sales of goods are recognised when goods 
are delivered and title has passed and it 
is probable that the economic benefits 
associated with the transaction will flow to 
the entity. Sales of rendering of services 
include interest, administrative charges 
and arrangement fees. Interest income is 
accrued on a time basis, by reference to 
the principal outstanding and the applicable 
effective interest rate which is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the 
financial assets to that asset’s net carrying 
amount. Such revenues are recognised only 
when collectability is reasonably assured. 
Revenue from non-interest related financial 
income is recognised when the services 
have been performed. 
Property, plant & equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated  
at cost, less accumulated depreciation  
and any provision for impairment in value. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write 
off the cost of assets to their estimated 
residual values, based on current prices 
at the balance sheet date, over their 
remaining useful lives, using the straight-
line method. No depreciation is charged on 
freehold land. In this respect the following 
annual depreciation rates apply:
Freehold buildings 2% 
Leasehold property  over the period  
and improvements of the lease 
Motor vehicles 20% 
Computer equipment 20% 
Plant and machinery  between  
5% and 20% 
Fixtures and fittings  between  
10% and 20%
Assets held under finance leases are 
depreciated over their expected useful 
lives on the same basis as owned assets 
or, where shorter, over the term of the 
relevant lease. 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal 
or retirement of an asset is determined as 
the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and 
is recognised in income. 
Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to  
the acquisition, construction or production 
of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of 
time to get ready for their intended use 
or sale, are added to the cost of those 
assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use 
or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised 
in profit or loss in the period in which they 
are incurred. 
Intangible assets 
Computer software development costs 
that generate economic benefits beyond 
one year are capitalised as intangible 
assets and amortised on a straight-line 
basis over five years. 
Customer databases arising on 
acquisitions assessed under the 
requirements of IFRS 3 are amortised  
over their useful economic lives, which 
have been assessed as being five years. 
Legally protected or otherwise separable 
trade names acquired as part of a 
business combination are capitalised at 
fair value on acquisition. Brand names are 
individually assessed and are assumed 
to have an indefinite life and are not 
amortised, but are subject to annual 
impairment tests.
Impairment of tangible and intangible 
assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date, the group 
reviews the carrying value of its tangible 
and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets 
have suffered an impairment loss. If any 
such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order 
to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss (if any). Where the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are independent 
from other assets, the group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. 
In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific 
to the asset for which the estimate of 
future cash flows have not been adjusted.
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or 
cash-generating unit) is estimated to be 
less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating 
unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately.
 Notes to the Group Accounts N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014 62
Where an impairment loss subsequently 
reverses, the carrying amount of the asset 
(cash-generating unit) is increased to the 
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, 
but so that the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount  
that would have been determined had  
no impairment loss been recognised for 
the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior 
years. A reversal of an impairment loss  
is recognised as income immediately.
Leasing 
Leases are classified as finance leases 
whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee. All other 
leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases 
are charged to income on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the relevant lease 
even where payments are not made on 
such a basis.
Assets held under finance leases are 
included in tangible fixed assets at a value 
equal to the original costs incurred by the 
lessor less depreciation, and obligations to 
the lessor are shown as part of creditors. 
The interest element is charged to the 
income statement over the period of the 
lease to produce a constant rate of charge 
on the balance of capital repayments 
outstanding. 
Inventories 
Inventories have been valued at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost comprises direct materials and 
those overheads that have been incurred 
in bringing inventories to their present 
location and condition based on the 
standard costing method. Cost has been 
calculated on a first-in-first-out basis.  
Net realisable value means estimated 
selling price less all costs to be incurred  
in marketing, selling and distribution. 
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the 
tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on 
taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and 
it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The group’s liability 
for current tax is calculated using tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be 
payable or recoverable on differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used 
in the computation of taxable profit, and 
is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities 
are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profits will 
be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities 
in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
taxable temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the group 
is able to control the reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable 
that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply in the period 
when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the income statement, except 
when it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of 
each group company are presented in 
the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates (its 
functional currency). For the purpose of 
the consolidated financial statements, the 
results and financial position of each group 
company are expressed in pounds sterling, 
which is the functional currency of the 
group, and the presentation currency for 
the consolidated financial statements. 
In preparing the financial statement of 
the individual companies, transactions in 
currencies other than the entity’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded 
at the rates of exchange prevailing on 
the dates of the transactions. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary assets and 
liabilities that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-
monetary items carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the rates prevailing at the  
date when the fair value was determined. 
Non-monetary items that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are not retranslated. 
Exchange differences arising on the 
settlement of monetary items, and on 
the retranslation of monetary items, are 
included in profit or loss for the period. 
Exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation of non-monetary items 
carried at fair value are included in profit 
or loss for the period except for differences 
arising on the retranslation of non-
monetary items in respect of which gains 
and losses are recognised directly 
in equity. For such non-monetary items, 
any exchange component of that gain or 
loss is also recognised directly in equity. 
In order to hedge its exposure to certain 
foreign exchange risks, the group may 
enter into forward contracts and options 
(see below for details of the group’s 
accounting policies in respect of such 
derivative financial instruments).
 
For the purpose of presenting consolidated 
financial statements, the assets 
and liabilities of the group’s foreign 
operations are translated at exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet 
date. Income and expense items are 
translated at the average exchange rates 
for the period, unless exchange rates 
fluctuate significantly during that period, 
in which case the exchange rates at the 
date of transactions are used. Exchange 
differences arising, if any, are classified 
as equity and transferred to the group’s 
translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or 
as expenses in the period in which the 
operation is disposed of. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
recognised on the group’s balance sheet 
when the group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Profits and losses on financial instruments 
are recognised in the income statement as 
they arise. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method. Appropriate allowances 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in profit or loss when there 
is objective evidence that the asset is 
impaired based on specific customer 
patterns of behaviour which may be 
affected by external economic conditions. 
 Notes to the Group Accounts 63 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2014
The allowance recognised is measured 
as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows discounted 
at the effective interest rate computed at 
initial recognition.
Trade receivables are assessed for 
impairment on a collective basis. 
Objective evidence of impairment could 
include the group's past experience of 
collecting payments and observable changes 
in national and local economic conditions 
that could correlate with a default event.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash 
on hand and demand deposits, and other 
short-term highly liquid investments that 
are readily convertible to a known amount 
of cash and are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value. 
Financial liabilities and equity 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
are classified according to the substance 
of the contractual arrangements entered 
into. An equity instrument is any contract 
that evidences a residual interest in the 
assets of the group after deducting all of 
its liabilities. 
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts 
are recorded at the proceeds received, 
net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement 
or redemption and direct issue costs, 
are accounted for on an accrual basis in 
the income statement using the effective 
interest method and are added to the 
carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise.
Trade payables 
Trade payables are not interest bearing 
and are stated at their nominal value. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the company 
are recorded at the proceeds received, net 
of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments 
The group’s activities expose it primarily 
to the financial risks of changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates relating to the 
purchase of overseas sourced products, 
and interest rates relating to the group’s 
debt. The group uses foreign exchange 
forward contracts and interest rate swap 
contracts where appropriate to hedge 
these exposures. In accordance with 
its treasury policy, the group does not 
use derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed 
by the group’s policies approved by 
the board of directors, which provide 
written principles on the use of financial 
derivatives. 
Derivatives are stated at their fair 
value. The fair value of foreign currency 
derivatives contracts is their quoted market 
value at the balance sheet date. 
Market values are based on the duration 
of the derivative instrument together with 
the quoted market data including interest 
rates, foreign exchange rates and market 
volatility at the balance sheet date. The 
fair value of interest rate contracts is the 
estimated amount that the group would 
receive or pay to terminate them at the 
balance sheet date, taking into account 
prevailing interest rates. 
Changes in the fair value of currency 
derivative financial instruments are 
recognised in the income statement  
as they arise. 
Share-based payments 
The group issues equity-settled share-
based payments to certain employees. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant. 
The fair value determined at the grant 
date of the equity-settled share-based 
payments is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the vesting period, based on 
the group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest. Fair value is measured  
by use of a Black-Scholes model. 
Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to defined contribution 
retirement benefit schemes are charged 
as an expense as they fall due. Payments 
made to state-managed retirement benefit 
schemes are dealt with as payments to 
defined contribution schemes where the 
group’s obligations under the schemes 
are equivalent to those arising in a defined 
contribution retirement benefit scheme. 
For defined benefit retirement benefit 
schemes, the cost of providing benefits is 
determined using the Projected Unit Credit 
Method, with actuarial valuations being 
carried out at the end of each reporting 
period. Remeasurement comprising 
actuarial gains and losses, the effect 
of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and 
the return on scheme assets (excluding 
interest) are recognised immediately 
in the balance sheet with a charge or 
credit to the statement of comprehensive 
income in the period in which they occur. 
Remeasurement recorded in the statement 
of comprehensive income is not recycled. 
Past service cost is recognised in profit or 
loss in the period of scheme amendment. 
Net-interest is calculated by applying a 
discount rate to the net defined benefit 
liability or asset. Defined benefit costs  
are split into three categories:
• current service cost, past-service cost 
and gains and losses on curtailments 
and settlements;
• net-interest expense or income; and
• remeasurement.
The group presents the first two 
components of defined benefit costs 
within operating expenses (see note 28) 
in its consolidated income statement. 
Curtailments gains and losses are 
accounted for as past-service cost. Net-
interest expense or income is recognised 
within finance costs (see note 8).
 
The retirement benefit obligation 
recognised in the balance sheet represents 
the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation, as reduced by the fair value  
of scheme assets. Any asset resulting 
from this calculation is restricted to the 
past service cost plus the present value of 
available refunds and reductions in future 
contributions.
Going concern
In determining whether the group’s 
accounts can be prepared on a going 
concern basis, the directors considered 
the group’s business activities together 
with factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and its 
financial position including cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
and the principal risks and uncertainties 
relating to its business activities. These 
are set out within the Financial Review 
and discussed further in the Chairman’s 
Statement and Chief Executive’s Review.
The group has considered carefully its 
cash flows and banking covenants for 
the next twelve months from the date of 
signing the audited financial statements. 
These have been appraised in light of 
the current economic climate. As such, 
conservative assumptions for working 
capital performance have been used to 
determine the level of financial resources 
available to the company and to assess 
liquidity risk. The key trading risk identified 
by the directors for these assumptions 
is the impact that a deterioration in the 
economic climate might have on the 
performance of the group’s debtor book.
The group’s forecasts and projections, 
after sensitivity to take account of all 
reasonably foreseeable changes in trading 
performance, show that the group will  
have sufficient headroom within its  
current loan facilities of £370m, which  
are committed until 2016. After making 
appropriate enquiries, the directors have

An analysis of the group’s revenue is as follows:
Sale of goods   592.7 557.8
Rendering of services   242.2 226.9
Revenue   834.9 784.7
Investment income   0.1 0.1

a reasonable expectation that the 
company and the group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in the preparation  
of the annual report and accounts.
Critical judgements and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty 
The key assumptions concerning the 
future and other sources of estimation 
uncertainty at the year end date, that have 
a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are discussed below. 
Trade receivables 
An appropriate allowance for estimated 
irrecoverable trade receivables is derived 
where there is an identified event which, 
based on previous experience, is evidence 
of a potential reduction in the recoverability 
of future cash flows. This estimation is 
based on assumed collection rates which, 
although based on the group’s historical 
experience of customer repayment 
patterns, remains inherently uncertain.
As a result this is continually assessed 
for relevance and adjusted appropriately. 
Further information is given in note 16. 
Taxation
The group’s tax balances comprise 
income tax, which is the sum of the total 
current and deferred tax balances, and 
VAT. The group has on-going discussions 
with HMRC in respect of open taxation 
positions and the calculation of the  
group’s potential liabilities or assets in 
respect of these necessarily involves a 
degree of estimation and judgement in 
respect of items whose tax treatment 
cannot be finally determined until 
resolution has been reached with HMRC 
or, as appropriate, through a formal legal 
process. Issues can, and often do, take a 
number of years to resolve. The amounts 
recognised or disclosed are derived from 
the group’s best estimation and judgement 
and, where appropriate, legal counsel’s 
opinion has been sought. However, the 
inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome 
of these means eventual realisation could 
differ from the accounting estimates and 
therefore impact the group’s results and 
cash flows.
Inventory 
Provision is made for those items of 
inventory where the net realisable value 
is estimated to be lower than cost. Net 
realisable value is based on both historical 
experience and assumptions regarding 
future selling values and disposal 
channels, and is consequently a source  
of estimation uncertainty. 
Regulatory
The regulatory environment in which the 
group operates is both complex and 
changing with the transfer of regulatory 
supervision from the OFT to the FCA. This 
can be a critical area of judgement when 
considering any liabilities that could arise 
as a result of the legislation in place.

The brand names arising from the acquisition of Gray & Osbourn Limited, High and Mighty, Slimma, Figleaves, Diva and Dannimac 
are deemed to have indefinite lives as there are no foreseeable limits to the periods over which they are expected to generate cash 
inflows and are subject to annual impairment tests.
The carrying value of the brand names have been determined from a value in use calculation. The key assumptions for this 
calculation are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and the forecast cash flows.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent three year financial budgets approved by management and 
thereafter extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity (with 2.7% growth assumed) to reflect that there is no foreseeable limit to the 
period over which cash flows are expected to be generated. The rate used to discount the forecast pre-tax cash flows is 7.2% 
(2013, 5.7%). The directors consider that the value in use calculation has sufficient headroom above the carrying value of the  
brand names. 
The carrying value in relation to Gray & Osbourn is £8.0m (2013, £8.0m), £7.1m (2013, £7.1m) for Figleaves and for High and Mighty 
is £1.0m (2013, £1.0m). The directors note that the headroom on the value in use calculations compared to the carrying values for 
Gray & Osbourn and High and Mighty is marginal and whilst they do not consider that these brand names are impaired as at the 
balance sheet date, should there be a downturn in future or forecasted cashflows, or an increase in the discount rate applied, then 
there is a risk of impairment to these brand names. Were the discount rate to increase by 5%, then the impairment charged would 
be £0.4m. Were it to increase by 10%, the impairment charged would be £0.8m.
The discount rates applied by the directors have been reviewed in the year and the directors are satisfied that they are reflective  
of the capital structure and debt to equity ratio of the group.

Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost. 
The average credit period given to customers for the sale of goods is 253 days (2013, 246 days). Interest is charged at 44.9%  
(2013, 39.9%) on the outstanding balance. Generally, receivables over 150 days past due are written off in full. Trade receivables 
that reach the trigger point of 56 days past due are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts, determined by 
reference to past default experience. The carrying amount of trade receivables whose terms have been renegotiated but would 
otherwise be past due totalled £97.3m at 1 March 2014 (2013, £86.7m). Interest income recognised on trade receivables which  
have been impaired was £10.0m (2013, £10.9m).
Before accepting any new customer, the group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s  
credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Credit limits and scores attributed to customers are reviewed every  
28 days. The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired, with regard to the historical default  
rate has remained stable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated and comprising 1.5 million  
(2013, 1.5 million) customers. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess  
of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows:   % %
Bank overdrafts   2.0 2.0
Bank loans   0.7 0.7
The principal features of the group’s borrowings are as follows:    
(i) Bank overdrafts which are nil at the current and prior year ends are repayable on demand, unsecured and bear interest 
 at a margin over bank base rates.
(ii)  The group has a bank loan of £220m (2013, £220m) secured by a charge over certain ‘eligible’ trade debtors (current and  
0-28 days past due) of the group and is without recourse to any of the group’s other assets. The facility has a current limit of 
£250m for which finance costs are linked to US commercial paper rates which is committed until March 2016.
  The group also has unsecured bank loans of £39m (2013, £30m) drawn down under various medium term bank revolving credit 
facilities, of which £120 million is committed until March 2016.
(iii)  All borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the group to cash flow interest rate risk. The group may use 
derivatives such as interest rate swaps where appropriate to manage this risk. None have been used in the current or prior 
year. Based on weighted average interest rates and the value of bank loans at 1 March 2014 the estimated future interest cost 
per annum until maturity would be £1.8m (2013, £1.8m).
  Financial liabilities other than financial instruments include bank loans and overdrafts and trade and other payables. Other than 
as disclosed above, all are due within one year. The maturity analysis of the group’s financial liability on an undiscounted basis, 
assuming that the facilities are retained until the end of the committed period are as follows:
    2014 2013 
   £m £m
On demand or within one year   10.8 1.8
In the second year   1.8 1.8
In the third year   250.2 251.8
   262.8 255.4
At 1 March 2014, the group had available £111m (2013, £120m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which  
all conditions precedent had been met.
The Financial Review on page 15 summarises the objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and  
similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the period.
There is no material difference between the fair value and book value of the group’s borrowings and other financial assets  
and liabilities.

   £m £m
Notional amount – Sterling contract value   32.2 22.1
Fair value of (liability)/asset recognised   (1.6) 1.2
 Changes in the fair value of assets/liabilities recognised, being non-hedging currency derivatives, amounted to a charge of £2.8m 
(2013, credit of £1.3m) to income in the period.
The financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are all grouped into Level 2 (2013, same).
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices).
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year (2013, same).

Capital risk management 
The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the 
return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the group consists of debt, 
which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 17, cash and cash equivalents disclosed in note 24 and equity attributable to  
equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 22 to 23 and the 
statement of changes in equity.

Equity   485.3 446.0
Gearing ratio   44% 42%
Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 17. 
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the group attributable to equity holders of the parent.
Externally imposed capital requirement 
The group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Significant accounting policies 
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and 
equity instrument are disclosed in note 2.
Financial risk management objectives 
The financial risks facing the group include currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. The group seeks 
to minimise the effects of certain of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures as governed 
by the group’s policies. The group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for 
speculative purposes.
Foreign currency risk management 
The group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations 
arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
It is the policy of the group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments for the 
purchase of overseas sourced products. Group policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to three years ahead.

Interest rate risk management 
The group is exposed to interest rate risk, as entities in the group borrow funds at floating interest rates. Where appropriate, 
exposure to interest rate fluctuations on indebtedness is managed by using derivatives such as interest rate swaps.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis 
If interest rates had increased by 0.5% and all other variables were held constant, the group’s profit before tax for the 52 weeks  
ended 1 March 2014 would have decreased by £1.25m (2013, £1.25m). 
This sensitivity analysis has been determined based on exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date and assuming the net 
debt outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
Credit risk management 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the group. 
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative financial instruments are made through banks which are approved by  
the board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures, supplied by independent rating 
agencies. Customer debtor balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable 
amounts. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated, and did not exceed five 
percent of gross monetary assets at any one time during the period.
Liquidity risk management 
The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate banking and borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring  
forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. Included in note 17 is a 
description of additional undrawn facilities that the group has at its disposal and details of the group’s remaining contractual 
maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
Fair value of financial instruments 
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted 
interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements  
approximate their fair values.

The awards outstanding at 1 March 2014 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.8 years (2013, 1.9 years).
The fair value of management and sharesave options/awards granted is calculated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes  
option pricing model. The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows:
    2014 2013
Weighted average share price at date of grant (pence)   475 239
Weighted average exercise price (pence)   185 102
Expected volatility (%)   28.1 – 37.4 32.6 - 39.4
Expected life (years)   2.5 – 5.5 2.5 - 5.5
Risk-free rate (%)   0.4 0.4
Dividend yield (%)   3.0 5.4
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the group’s share price over a period equivalent to the 
expected life of the option. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the 
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The group recognised total expenses of £2.4m and £2.1m related to equity-settled share based payment transactions in 2014 and 
2013 respectively.

28 Retirement benefit schemes
Defined contribution schemes 
The group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The group is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits.  
The only obligation of the group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of £2.7m (2013, £2.1m) represents contributions payable to the schemes by the group at rates 
specified in the rules of the plans. As at 1 March 2014, contributions of £0.3m (2013, £0.2m) due in respect of the current reporting 
period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme 
The group operates a defined benefit scheme, the N Brown Group Pension Fund. Under the scheme, the employees are entitled  
to retirement benefits based on final pensionable earnings and was closed to new members from 31 January 2002. No other  
post-retirement benefits are provided. The scheme is a funded scheme and operates under UK trust law and the trust is a seperate 
legal entity from the group. The scheme is governed by a board of trustees. The trustees are required by law to act in the best 
interests of scheme members and are responsible for setting certain policies (eg investment funding) together with the group.  
The scheme exposes the group to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and investment risk.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at  
30 June 2012 by an independent qualified actuary. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service 
cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method. The principal actuarial assumptions used in 
determining the group’s net retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date were as follows:
    2014 2013
Discount rate   4.30% 4.55%
Expected rate of salary increase 3.0% until June 2015, 3.5% thereafter 4.5%
Future pension increases   2.20% 2.15%
Inflation – Retail Price Index   3.5% 3.5%
Inflation – Consumer Price Index   2.5% 2.5%

Pensioner aged 65   24.6 24.2
Non-pensioner aged 45   26.7 27.2

Current service cost   2.4 2.1
Net interest cost   – 0.2

Alternatives 7.4 7.7 4.3 4.7
 96.6 100.0 91.0 100.0
 Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are the discount rate and inflation.  
An increase of 0.25% in the discount rate used would decrease the defined benefit obligation by £5.8m (2013, £5.9m).  
An increase of 0.25% in the inflation assumption would increase the defined benefit obligation by £3.9m (2013, £4.0m).
 The above sensitivities are applied to adjust the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period. Whilst the analysis  
does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows under the scheme, it does provide an approximation to the sensitivity  
of the assumptions shown. No changes have been made to the method and assumptions used in this analysis from those used in  
the previous period.
 The scheme is funded by the group and current employee members. Funding the scheme is based on a separate actuarial valuation 
for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from the assumptions above. Funding requirements are formally set out 
in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions and Recovery Plan agreed between the trustees and the group.
 Whilst no commitment has been made as at the balance sheet date, the group expects to contribute £2.0m to the defined benefit 
scheme in the next financial year.
 The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 1 March 2014 is approximately 24 years.
 The defined benefit obligation at 1 March 2014 can be approximately attributed to the scheme members as follows:
 – Active members: 46% (2013, 45%)
 – Deferred members: 35% (2013, 35%)
 – Pensioner members; 19% (2013, 20%)
 All benefits are vested at 1 March 2014 (unchanged from 2 March 2013).

our business
Making sharing the key focus for StatPro 
was the main theme for us in 2013; this is our 
unique selling point. 
Internally, we realigned teams to be global 
rather than regional, hired and trained new 
staff to ensure that we can capitalise on the 
opportunity that our new products offer 
us. Externally, we widened our network of 
partners for StatPro Revolution through 
fund administrators and platform providers 
(see more from page 20 onwards in the 
Operational Review). We also launched 
a beta version of StatPro R+ (cloud-
based replacement for StatPro Seven). 
We improved communication with our 
partners through a dedicated handbook 
and we conducted a series of events to 
communicate with our existing clients about 
the forthcoming release of StatPro R+.
Through better communication and 
sharing we were able to assist our 
partners and clients to increase their 
sales, improve client service, meet 
regulations and reduce their costs. This 
has increased both StatPro Revolution 
revenue and the potential market.
Sharing
The key value proposition of StatPro 
Revolution is its ability to share access to 
any portfolio with anyone, anywhere. We do 
not charge for users, so our clients can 
share at will. This creates a new self-service 
approach to client reporting that will truly 
revolutionise the asset management 
market, just like internet banking 
revolutionised the retail banking market. 
We believe every portfolio is a network: 
someone owns it, someone provides 
advice on it, someone manages it, 
someone checks it complies with 
regulations, someone tries to ensure it is 
profitable, someone is concerned about 
the risk. All these people have an active 
interest in knowing what is going on in 
that portfolio at any given time. StatPro 
Revolution manages this effortlessly. 
Sharing our expertise with clients and 
partners is important, because if we can 
communicate how best to sell our products, 
our partners can actively sell on our behalf, 
generating a snowball effect, leading to 
more clients and additional sales. 
In 2013, we hired 13 new sales people 
for our London, Boston, Hong Kong, 
Luxembourg, Cape Town and Paris offices. 
After attending one of two 12-week 
courses in the UK, they returned to their 
teams armed with a wealth of knowledge 
to sell StatPro Revolution. This sales 
training process has proved extremely 
useful in getting relatively inexperienced 
people up to scratch very quickly and 
making sales. We also completed the 
partner handbook and delivered several 
training courses and joint events with 
partners and fund administrators 
who, as part of our own network, 
can support our sales goals. Further 
information about this can be found in 
the Operational Review from page 20.
Reviewing the performance 
function
Since the replacement of StatPro Seven 
by StatPro R+ began, we have not only 
rewritten all our analytical software from 
scratch, but we have also redesigned the 
workflow to be more efficient. Performance 
analysis software has in the past been 
built around the structure of traditional 
performance teams, but with the advent 
of new technology, the way performance 
analysis is provided can be changed and, in 
addition, the organisation of performance 
teams can also be changed and this needs 
to be reflected in the new software.
Without performance and risk analysis, 
the asset managers cannot communicate 
appropriately with their clients nor 
control risk effectively. It is often the 
case that many people are complacent 
about performance and risk right up to 
the moment when something dramatic 
happens in the market, at which point 
they need a complete understanding of 
what is happening and more importantly 
need to communicate this understanding 
immediately with their clients. But putting 
a modern performance process in place 
is a complex and expensive operation so 
companies must plan ahead. We think 
this means that outsourcing will become 
increasingly popular, but outsourcing will 
not work unless the service offered is 
responsive, flexible and sophisticated.
StatPro R+ has been designed to address 
this requirement and we will be targeting 
the outsourcers with it. Built from scratch, 
it reengineers the portfolio performance 
process to maximise scale, frequency 
and speed and minimise errors.

Progress
I am pleased to report that the Group 
increased total annualised recurring 
revenue by 1% to £28.7 million (2012: £28.5 
million at constant currency) including 
a 114% increased contribution from 
StatPro Revolution of £3.2 million (2012: 
£1.5 million). Total revenue increased by 
2% to £32.5 million (2012: £32.0 million). 
Owing to increased investment primarily 
in sales, client services and infrastructure 
related to StatPro Revolution, adjusted 
profit before tax decreased by 20% to 
£4.1 million (2012: £5.0 million). StatPro 
Revolution related recurring revenue 
now amounts to £9.2 million (2012: 
£3.9 million), representing 37% of total 
software recurring revenue (2012: 16%).
Dividend
Your Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 1.95p per share for 2013 payable on 
21 May 2014 to all shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 25 
April 2014, taking the total dividend to 
2.8p per share (2012: 2.7p per share) an 
increase of 4%. We intend to maintain 
a progressive dividend policy.
Products
In 2013, total research and development 
expenditure increased by 6% to £4.4 million 
(2012: £4.2 million) representing 14% of 
Group revenue. The total cash expenditure 
on StatPro Revolution including marketing 
and other costs incurred in 2013 amounted 
to £4.9 million (2012: £3.7 million).
During the year, we launched the beta 
version of StatPro R+, the cloud replacement 
for StatPro Seven. Simplification will be our 
motto for 2014; we will continue to develop 
valuable features to help our clients tackle 
increased regulation, the refocusing of 
the performance analytics function and, 
uniquely, our clients will be able to share 
their analysis with all the stakeholders 
in the investment decision process. 
People
As your Company is transformed to a 
pure, cloud-based analytics provider, 
our employees have continued to 
excel and again I take this opportunity 
to thank them for their enthusiasm, 
resourcefulness and sheer determination 
to meet your Company’s objectives.
Prospects
Whilst markets remain volatile, the 
prospects for the asset management 
industry look brighter than last year. Asset 
managers are reviewing their investment in 
technology with regulation, reducing costs 
and communication remaining key drivers: 
your Company is well placed as asset 
managers seek to eliminate complexity and 
update their processes.

market actors and their regulatory bodies is 
critical to fulfilling the regulatory obligations 
of the SEC. The 2008 financial crisis is 
recognised as a showcase for the risks to 
the stability of the markets that ineffective 
information sharing among supervisory 
authorities represents.”
While discussing this with our clients in 
2013, we heard that sharing of relevant 
information to relevant parties in a 
controlled manner is a requirement in 
today’s heavily regulated environment. 
Those entities that do not have appropriate 
systems, skilled individuals, a compliance 
culture with rigorous oversight and an 
effective challenge process, will be subject 
to regulatory criticism.
Technology
As expected, the clear benefits of the cloud 
and other new technologies are causing all 
companies to reassess how they do things. 
The availability of the technology, the 
pressure from regulations and the demands 
of a new generation of impatient investors 
are making it clear that companies must 
invest to stay competitive. One example is a 
large European asset manager that has 
decided to rationalise over 100 systems into 
two services, both of which are cloud-
based. The savings they will generate in 
fees, IT infrastructure, management time 
and operating costs are huge.
market overview
There are three main drivers affecting the asset management market  
at the moment: regulation
,
 technology and client expectations. 
Announcing our partnership with

Monaco, June 2013)

professionals (London, March 2013)

Luxembourg, May 2013)
The drivers
There are three main drivers affecting 
the asset management market at the 
moment: regulation, technology and 
client expectations. In a sense all three 
drive each other. Regulators can ask for 
more because the technology exists 
to do so. Technology has given clients 
(especially the younger generations) 
a taste of what to expect in terms of 
immediacy and self-service systems. 
The growing mass of people with money 
to invest is driving regulators to protect 
investors, who are of course also voters.
Regulations that drive the 
desire to share
In Europe, the focus of regulations has been 
on UCITS, AIFMD and MIFID (Markets in 
Financial Instruments Directive). In the USA 
the focus has been on the Dodd Frank 
regulations and form PF filing requirements. 
All larger asset managers are affected by 
regulation in Europe or America because of 
the global and interconnected nature of the 
asset management market. For instance, 
nearly a third of assets in UCITS funds are 
managed by American firms.
All alternative investment funds in Europe 
will have to comply with the new AIFMD 
regulations by 1 July 2014. This requires 
them to be transparent about their leverage 
and liquidity risk. It is broadly equivalent to 
the UCITS regulations on risk that have 
been in place for ordinary mutual funds 
that are marketed across borders in Europe.
Greater transparency and better 
communication with investors has been a 
topic discussed for many years. Some 
people want to protect information about 
the investments in their portfolios to avoid 
being copied. Other people recognise that 
transparency builds trust and that this is 
worth the risk of ideas being stolen if it 
generates more sales. The regulatory 
framework of information sharing is a 
patchwork of laws derived from diverse 
fields such as bank secrecy, data protection, 
company information disclosure laws, tax 
laws and financial services regulations. 
From a compliance point of view, there are 
different considerations from integrity and 
market conduct (everything is sensitive and 
providing up-to-date information will cause 
regulatory problems) to communication 
with clients (advisers and clients should 
know what risks the investment manager is 
taking on a real time basis).
In April 2012, in the House Financial 
Services Committee, U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman, 
Mary Schapiro, stated that “effective 
information sharing between financial  7

Backtesting with the Risk  
Limits Monitoring Module  
in StatPro Revolution
Although StatPro R+ is still in beta, tests 
demonstrate that it calculates over 100 
times faster than StatPro Seven, based on 
the same infrastructure cost. This sort of 
benefit is not unique to StatPro; other 
companies will be profiting from the 
possibilities of the new technology. 
However, to take advantage of this 
technology, companies must create 
solutions that have been purpose built for 
the cloud. They cannot simply put old 
software into a cloud environment and 
expect it to be more efficient. This means 
that there is still much investment to be 
made by the companies that currently 
supply the asset management market and 
also opportunities for new market entrants 
who are faster to adopt the new technology.
Clients
Generation X and Y have much greater 
familiarity with new technology and are 
typically either making more money or 
inheriting it or both. They are much less 
likely to go to a financial adviser and, if they 
do, they are often baffled by the arcane 
nature of the client reporting they are 
subjected to. Many are used to using 
internet stock market sites to make 
investments and there are many innovative 
social investing websites being created to 
make investing online even easier. Mutual 
fund platforms and the huge growth of 
cheap Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are 
also driving new behaviour. If asset 
managers and financial advisers are to 
convince this new breed of very demanding 
investors to use their services, they will 
need to invest in new technology. It is the 
nature of such change that it is at first slow 
to happen and then sudden. We are 
witnessing this effect with a number of 
clients, some small, some extremely large. 
Where one competitor seizes an advantage, 
others will follow quickly.
Consequences for the market
We foresee that the process for providing 
performance measurement will change 
considerably over the next few years. 
Self-service information distribution 
solutions like StatPro Revolution will be 
essential for asset managers and financial 
advisers so that they can communicate 
quickly and efficiently with everyone in their 
network, both internally and externally. 
On the other hand, the process of extracting 
and managing accounting data and 
transforming it into performance-ready 
data is likely to be outsourced by many 
companies. This is because the data 
management process lends itself to scale. 
This is where StatPro R+ comes into play as 
it has been designed to manage huge 
quantities of data at high speeds with a full 
audit and quality controls. We will mainly 
target companies offering performance 
measurement outsourcing or very large 
businesses with it.
The combined technology of StatPro R+ and 
StatPro Revolution will enable asset 
managers and financial advisers, great or 
small, to meet regulations, the new 
challenges of technology and the changing 
demands of their clients.

StatPro’S strategy
Simplification is the key theme for us.
StatPro Revolution and StatPro R+ will 
greatly simplify the complex processes 
which our clients use to produce portfolio 
analytics and distribute it. At StatPro we 
are also reorganising how we work to 
simplify and standardise how we develop, 
sell and support our services so that we 
can ensure the highest possible quality. 
Simplification also means that we can 
scale our business comfortably.
Commercial strategy
Commercially we are focused on three core 
markets for StatPro Revolution: our existing 
clients, fund administrators and private 
wealth businesses. 
Existing clients
Our existing clients are largely the bigger 
asset managers with sophisticated 
requirements for analytics. These clients 
are under pressure to justify their fees and 
improve their client service as well as meet 
new regulations. Their only hope is to adopt 
new technology. Our approach is to 
persuade our clients that they should add 
StatPro Revolution to their installation of 
StatPro Seven so that they can start 
providing information on their portfolios 
more widely throughout their organisations. 
This approach is working well. During the 
course of 2014, we hope to deliver much of 
the remaining analytics that can be 
performed in StatPro Seven in StatPro 
Revolution and as we do, more clients will 
begin the migration process. 
In early 2015, we will deliver the first beta of 
the full replacement of StatPro Seven with 
StatPro R+. After that we expect to start 
upgrading our clients. Because of our focus 
on fund administrators, we will also be able 
to offer our clients the option of upgrading 
to an outsourced solution as well. Rather 
than seeing outsourcing as competition to 
our software solutions, we see it as highly 
complementary and we want to be the 
solution of choice for outsourcers. This 
approach will mean that many of our 
current clients will be able to leverage 
outsourced data management coupled  
with StatPro Revolution for self-service 
information distribution. Because of the 
technology, they will still be able to oversee 
every aspect of the process, without having 
to do all the work.
Generally we are working with our 
existing clients to explain to them how our 
strategy is built around helping to make 
them as efficient as possible. Whereas a 
few years ago talk of the cloud might have 
caused concerns, we increasingly hear the 
message that ‘we only want cloud-based 
products’. The market is moving rapidly in 
our direction.

Fund administrators
Fund administrators and other outsourcers 
are looking for ways to add value to the 
asset management process by picking 
up low value added tasks and reaping 
economies of scale. However, many are 
finding that their existing infrastructure 
is now too expensive and cumbersome. 
This means that on the one hand they 
cannot meet the new requirements of 
their larger clients and on the other they 
are too expensive for the smaller clients 
with less sophisticated needs. Once 
again, only technology can solve this 
problem and we have great expectations 
of StatPro R+ that it will enable our 
partners to provide a flexible, responsive 
and sophisticated service to any type 
of client, all from one platform.
Private wealth
It is clear that the trend towards a growing 
number of millionaires is set to continue. 
This has meant tremendous growth for 
private wealth companies of all sizes. The 
challenges they have are around regulation 
and the changing requirements of their 
clients who are of course more and more 
familiar with new technology. Right now, 
anyone younger than 30 doesn’t really know 
about the world without the internet. In ten 
years, the younger generation will be 
running things. Change will happen.
Once again the only way to meet the 
challenges for the private wealth market is 
to use technology. Increasingly asset 
managers are being bypassed as wealth 
managers use standardised investment 
products like ETFs to create holistic 
portfolios for their clients. Mass 
customisation is the theme, combined with 
lower fees. In Europe this is especially 
important as the new MIFID II regulations 
force advisers to declare all fees to their 
clients. This means that most are adopting 
an advisory fee as a percentage of assets. 
They are also bound by the regulations to 
be able to demonstrate that they have acted 
in the best interests of the client. So the 
ability to keep relevant information about 
why the investment was recommended  
is vital.
We are just beginning to open up this 
exciting new market and we already have  
a number of private wealth businesses as 
clients, including some very large private 
banks. We believe that StatPro R+ will also 
do well in this market as the volumes of 
data is sometimes quite staggering and 
StatPro R+ is perfectly suited to this level  
of scale and speed requirements.
Conclusion
Fundamentally, we see that the market 
trends for technology in our area of 
expertise are moving towards two quite 
different solutions: 
On the one hand, there is the fragmentation 
and vast expansion of the information 
distribution process, which requires a 
Self-Service solution, not a push solution. 
This is solved with StatPro Revolution. 
On the other hand, the data management 
side of the business will experience massive 
consolidation as businesses seek economies 
of scale. This is what StatPro R+ is designed 
to do, enabling scale, speed and

We are pleased with the excellent progress 
achieved during the year in transforming 
our business to a purely cloud-based 
analytics provider. We have seen a 
significant increase in our existing clients 
signing up to StatPro Revolution as the word 
spreads about its unique capabilities to help 
asset managers increase sales, improve 
their client service, comply with regulations 
and reduce their costs. It is our view that 
we can help clients greatly reduce the 
complexity of their client reporting process 
by replacing old technology with new.
The number of clients using StatPro 
Revolution grew to 257 in 33 countries 
by year end (2012: 156 in 22 countries) 
and StatPro Revolution recurring revenue 
increased by 114% to £3.20 million (2012: 
£1.49 million). We successfully grew 
the number of our fund administrator 
partners to 34 by year end (2012: 21). 
Fund administrators are core partners, 
ensuring that we can provide our 
clients with a smooth implementation 
process of StatPro Revolution.
Financial highlights
We are pleased to report that revenue 
for 2013 increased to £32.49 million 
(2012: £32.00 million). As expected, our 
profits before tax reduced to £3.11 million 
(2012: £3.78 million) following increased 
investment in development, sales and 
client services for our cloud services. Cash 
generated from operations was lower at 
£9.40 million (2012: £10.18 million), but 
our net cash position at the end of the 
year increased to £4.00 million (2012: 
3.67 million). Adjusted earnings per share 
reduced to 4.5p (2012: 5.9p) and the Board 
has recommended an increase in the full 
year dividend to 2.8p per share (2012: 2.7p).
A key performance indicator is the measure 
of the total value of contracts we have 
with clients who have also subscribed for 
StatPro Revolution. This grew by 134% 
to £9.19 million (2012: £3.92 million) and 
represents 37% (2012: 16%) of our total 
recurring software revenues, a strong 
indication that we are making good 
progress in demonstrating to our existing 
clients the benefits of StatPro Revolution. 
Total annualised recurring revenues grew 
to £28.72 million (2012: £28.47 million). 
There was a reduction in revenues from 
StatPro Seven to £24.02 million (2012: 
£24.60 million) and data revenues to £4.21 
million (2012: £4.69 million), counteracted 
by an increase in StatPro Revolution 
subscriptions generating overall growth.
Strategic focus
Our three areas of focus are: existing 
clients, fund administrators and the 
growing private wealth market. Our 
existing clients are a ready-made 
marketplace for StatPro Revolution and we 
are making steady progress in this area. 
We believe that in the course of 2014, as 
we add functionality to StatPro Revolution, 
we will see an even greater uptake. 
Fund administrators are a key focus for 
us as they hold the investment book of 
record for many asset managers. This 
means that once they have built an 
automated data connection to StatPro 
Revolution, adding more of their clients is a 
relatively straightforward process. It is our 
view that fund administrators will win a 
growing market share of the performance 
reporting market as outsourcing this 
function is an economically logical 
action for most asset managers. 
However, we also think that our 
combined solution of StatPro R+ and 
StatPro Revolution will enable fund 
administrators to offer a more flexible, 
more responsive and more sophisticated 
service than they could do otherwise, 
due to our leading-edge technology. 
Lastly, the private wealth market offers us 
many opportunities. This is in part because 
it is relatively under-serviced in the area of 
sophisticated analysis, yet the companies 
in this market are quick to adopt any tool 
that will give them an advantage over 
rivals. It is also a growing trend among 
the larger asset managers to merge their 
asset management and private wealth 
businesses, to reap economies of scale and 
provide institutional investment skills to the 
private wealth market. Such organisations 
need and want self-service solutions like 
StatPro Revolution in the same way that 
banks have adopted online banking: they 
effectively outsource the responsibility 
of reporting to the individual client and 
cut costs significantly. We already have a 
number of large private banks as clients 
of StatPro Revolution and we believe that 
we can grow our revenues in this area.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 11
Business transformation
The biggest challenge for StatPro is the 
business transformation from supplier 
of traditional software solutions to a new 
cloud-based service provider. It has been 
our view from early on that the economic 
reality of the productivity gains possible 
through new cloud technology will cause 
significant change in our market. The 
complexity of old processes will be swept 
away and replaced with entirely new 
technology platforms. One very large asset 
manager client has a project to replace 100 
separate back-office systems with just one 
cloud solution. We believe that this type of 
project will happen increasingly frequently 
and StatPro is well placed to take advantage 
of this as we have made the necessary 
and significant investments to do so. 
As we have said before, it will take a 
number of years to complete the business 
transformation, where most of our 
clients have wholly or partly migrated 
to StatPro Revolution and StatPro R+, 
but we believe we remain on track to 
achieve a successful transformation.
Reinventing the performance 
 reporting process
With the launch of the beta version of 
StatPro R+ in 2013 and its combination 
with StatPro Revolution, we believe that 
our new technology will make asset 
managers rethink how they structure their 
performance teams. Data management 
has become a massively labour-intensive 
and complex task for many organisations 
and StatPro R+ offers a means of greatly 
simplifying this as well as offering 
significant increases in scale and speed. Our 
new technology will make it practical for 
organisations to operate client reporting 
on a daily basis rather than the current 
industry standard of monthly reporting. 
The issues of checking data and getting 
sign-off by the compliance function are also 
dealt with in an efficient and transparent 
way. It is also possible to offer more 
detailed analysis for smaller portfolios, 
such as private wealth, and consequently 
expand the number of reported portfolios.
On the information distribution side, asset 
managers are increasingly realising that 
the self-service model of client reporting 
is the strategic route they must adopt. 
Sending out standard reports, which 
are known to be neither wanted nor 
understood, is a very unproductive activity. 
On the other hand, a solution like StatPro 
Revolution, where, subject to permission, 
you can see which clients have logged on 
and when and what type of analysis they 
were interested in, provides invaluable 
intelligence, as well as being much cheaper 
to run. This is a radical turning point for 
the industry, and StatPro is well placed to 
profit from this evident market trend. 
Development 
There were several significant version 
releases of StatPro Revolution in 2013. At 
the start of the year we launched our very 
popular stock-level attribution analysis. 
We followed that with the launch of our 
first premium module in May 2013 for 
UCITS reporting. This has proven popular 
and now represents about 6% of StatPro 
Revolution recurring revenue. In the 
second half of 2013, we focused on adding 
extra sharing functionality so that clients 
can share precisely what they want within 
StatPro Revolution, including specified 
portfolios and time periods. This means 
that a mutual fund company can share 
information on its funds up to a particular 
date, avoiding revealing its current 
position, whilst being transparent to its 
distributors and investors. It also greatly 
simplifies the management of the process.
In 2014, we have an ambitious schedule of 
development, starting with the release of 
our AIFMD module which is a complement 
to our UCITS module. All alternative 
investment fund managers (AIFM) in the 
EU must comply with the new directive 
which stipulates how they report on their 
derivatives exposure. Our new module 
provides a simple and cost-effective way 
to achieve this and we expect it to receive 
a good level of uptake. Following this, we 
intend to deliver an extended fixed income 
attribution module for which we have 
significant demand as well as add to the 
risk management capabilities of StatPro 
Revolution. With these two developments, 
we will be able to offer existing clients 
(approximately 55) of StatPro Seven 
fixed income and risk modules (SFI & 
SRM) a functionally superior upgrade.
People
I would like to thank all our employees 
for the great work they have done in 
2013. Transforming a business is not easy, 
but everyone has made a great effort to 
contribute to the process, and I also know 
that everyone is very proud of the new 
products and services that we offer.
Dividend
In line with our policy of paying a 
progressive dividend, which aims to balance 
return to investors with our investment 
needs, we are pleased to announce an 
increase in our full year dividend to 
2.8p per share in 2013 (2012: 2.7p).
Outlook
As StatPro Revolution begins to gain 
critical mass in terms of clients, users 
and revenue, we believe that the next 
steps become clearer. As our clients use 
StatPro Revolution more, we note the 
pick-up of additional subscriptions, with 
approximately one-third of revenues 
coming from repeat purchases. As our 
clients begin to share their portfolios 
with others outside their companies, 
we note that we have more in-bound 
calls from prospects. As we get more 
practised at selling StatPro Revolution, 
we see our pipeline of opportunities 
growing steadily. As our products add 
more functionality and capacity, we can 
cover more needs of asset managers. For 
all these and other reasons we believe 
that 2014 will be a good year for StatPro.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S Q&A
Q
 How does StatPro sell to 
prospects who have a 
competitor solution ingrained 
in their processes?
Every company is looking to gain a 
commercial advantage and in the asset 
management business, that frequently 
comes down to the level of service that is 
provided to clients. If company A provides 
its clients with daily access to online 
analysis of their portfolios and company B 
only sends their clients standard reports 
once a month, two weeks after the month 
end (this is predominantly the current 
standard), then company B is in danger of 
losing business to company A. StatPro R+ 
and StatPro Revolution necessitates a 
rethink about processes and this applies to 
our prospects and clients alike.
Q
 Are there some clients  
of StatPro Seven who 
wouldn’t naturally migrate  
to StatPro R+?
When the cloud was first mentioned, many 
people said ‘never’. However, things are 
changing rapidly and most people can now 
see that architecturally and technically, 
cloud-based solutions are better for pretty 
much everything, including security. StatPro 
is proud to have Deutsche Bank and Credit 
Suisse Private Bank amongst its clients for 
StatPro Revolution and they would not have 
subscribed if they had concerns about 
security. Nevertheless, there are some 
organisations, such as sovereign wealth 
funds, that will be the most reluctant to 
make the switch. However, we believe that 
in a few years even they may well be ready 
for migration.
The path to revolution 13
Q
 What is the market 
perception of StatPro R+ 
creating ‘efficiencies’ for 
performance teams?
Currently the larger asset managers have 
quite large teams of performance 
measurers, yet all of them work on a 
monthly data production cycle. We believe 
that StatPro R+ will make it possible to flip 
that to a daily production cycle. That is more 
than a 20-fold increase in productivity 
(assuming weekends are excluded). There 
will be no need for them to have the IT 
infrastructure, nor to manage market data. 
A big change will be not needing to manage 
complex performance report production, 
but rather using StatPro Revolution’s 
self-service capability to improve client 
service. So roles will change, but the 
quantity of work may stay the same.
Q
 How is revenue affected 
by the realignment of the 
client services teams to 
StatPro Revolution?
We have seen the number of StatPro Seven 
clients adopting StatPro Revolution greatly 
increase in 2013 and we expect this to 
continue. StatPro Revolution enables our 
clients to extract more value out of their 
performance function and so the client 
service teams need to help our clients 
realise these gains. We have found that 
thanks to StatPro Revolution we are getting 
exposure to more parts of our clients’ 
businesses and, as we understand our 
clients better, so we can help them more. 
We expect the realignment of the client 
service teams to boost revenue. 
Q
 How can StatPro identify 
the tipping point for StatPro 
Revolution?
We cannot be certain when or if this might 
happen. What we do know is that by sheer 
hard work, we are getting more and more 
recognition in the marketplace. We have 
gone from being a relatively anonymous 
back office provider to a new name in the 
front office with a distinctive brand. We now 
need to translate that into hard currency, 
but that will also take more hard work. 
Judging by the huge increase in cold calling, 
webex calls and meetings, we are getting 
the message out to the market, but there is 
always more to do.
Q
 Are the fund 
administrators happy with 
the price point of StatPro 
Revolution?
I think that we have established a price 
norm for portfolio analytics. It is a 
considerably lower price point than most 
other solutions can provide it for except 
for very high volumes of portfolios (and 
we offer volume discounts). Our fund 
administrator partners tend to pass on 
the cost of StatPro Revolution, but also 
charge a data management fee on top. 
This is perfectly reasonable from our 
perspective as there is a lot of value in 
managing the data properly. We hope that 
when StatPro R+ is fully ready, fund 
administrators will use it to provide 
additional services to asset managers.
Q
 Will we change the $100 
per month model for StatPro 
Revolution?
We already have four tariffs for portfolios: 
Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze. The price 
per portfolio, per month is $300, $100, $15 
and $5. You have to buy Silver in packs of 10 
and Bronze in packs of 50 portfolios. The 
distinction between the portfolio types is 
the level of functionality you get. In essence, 
the Silver and Bronze are suitable for the 
private wealth market and the Platinum and 
Gold portfolios are designed for the asset 
management and hedge fund community. 
We have no current intention of changing 
these price points, although volume buyers 
can get discounts on a per portfolio basis. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

FINANCIAL REVIEW

Underlying performance
Overview 
During 2013, we have continued to invest 
in transforming StatPro into a pure cloud 
solution business. We have increased 
investment in several areas of the 
business with a focus on sales operations, 
client services, development and cloud 
infrastructure. The annualised contracted 
revenues of cloud-based StatPro Revolution 
have grown by 114% (at constant currency) 
to £3.20 million (2012: £1.49 million). The 
increased expenditure on cloud services 
(StatPro Revolution) coupled with the 
reduction in software licence revenues and 
data overage from our non-cloud activities 
(StatPro Seven and Data) has resulted in 
a reduction in adjusted EBITDA to £5.46 
million (2012: £6.73 million), as expected. 
We also increased our StatPro Revolution 
related recurring revenue (defined as the 
total recurring revenue from clients whose 
subscription includes StatPro Revolution) 
to £9.19 million (2012: £3.92 million), 
giving us confidence that the transition 
is progressing well with existing clients.

Group Executive Board as part of the regular 
monthly management reporting, are shown 
in table 2.
The KPIs are discussed in detail below in the 
relevant sections of this Financial Review.
Revenue
Overall, Group revenue increased by 2% 
(at constant currency and at actual rates) 
to £32.49 million (2012: £32.00 million).
Revenue by segment
Revenue increased in the EMEAA region 
by 2% (at constant currency and at 
actual rates) to £20.45 million (2012: 
£20.08 million). In the North American 
region revenue increased by 1% (2% at 
constant currency) to £12.04 million (2012: 
£11.92 million) as shown in table 3.
Revenue by type
StatPro Seven software licence revenue 
fell by 2% (at constant currency and at 
actual rates) to £24.02 million (2012: £24.60 
million) as we focus our efforts on cloud 
technology and not proactively selling 
non-cloud solutions. This was offset by an 
increase in StatPro Revolution revenue of 
204% to £2.19 million (2012: £0.72 million). 
Data fees fell by 10% (9% at constant 
currency) for the year to £4.21 million (2012: 
£4.69 million) as expected due to a lower 
level of data overage. Professional services 
revenue increased by 4% to £2.07 million 
(2012: £1.99 million), as shown in table 4. 15

Recurring revenue 
The Group’s business model of Software 
as a Service (SaaS) and recurring revenue 
contracts continues to provide excellent 
visibility of revenue with the recurring 
revenue element being a high percentage 
(94%) of total revenue (2012: 94%). The 
annualised recurring revenue from software 
licences and data fees at the end of 
December 2013 increased by 1% at constant 
currency to £28.72 million (2012: £28.47 
million). The net growth rate for StatPro 
Revolution was 114% (2012: 234%) and the 
net cancellation rate for StatPro Seven/
Data was 5% (2012: 0%). New contracts 
signed in the year were £3.24 million 
(2012: £3.11 million), as shown in table 5. Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
16
Approximately 77% of new recurring 
contracted revenue arose from existing 
clients (2012: 71%). The proportion by 
value of recurring software licences and 
data clients at the end of 2013 secured 
to the end of 2014 or beyond amounted 
to 78% (2012: 81%); the weighted 
average length of contracts committed 
was 16 months (2012: 17 months). 
 
StatPro Revolution revenue 
profile
Recurring revenue relating to StatPro 
Revolution is now 11% of the Group 
total and it is growing at a higher rate 
as the service is developed on a highly 
scalable technology platform. The total 
recurring revenue from clients whose 
subscription includes StatPro Revolution 
was £9.19 million (2012: £3.92 million) 
representing 37% (2012: 16%) of our 
total software recurring revenue, a 
KPI we are focused on increasing.
The revenue distribution profile for StatPro

Operating expenses 
Operating expenses (before amortisation of 
intangible assets and exceptional items) 
increased by 7% (8% at constant currency) 
to £24.71 million (2012: £23.02 million). The 
increase in expenditure related to several 
areas of the business, mainly sales 
operations, client services, development 
and cloud infrastructure. The average 
number of employees was 249 (2012: 253), 
although we ended the year with 255 
employees, up 5% in the year (2012: 242). 
Exceptional items 
As previously announced, the Board 
decided to agree an out-of-court settlement 
in relation to the SiSoft acquisition 
contingent consideration dispute, and as a 
result there is an exceptional charge of 
£0.35 million. There is no tax deduction 
available as it is a capital item. Further 
details are provided in note 3. The 
exceptional item in 2012 of £0.98 million 
relates to the one-off charge for 
restructuring in January 2012.
Adjusted operating margin
As a result of increased investment in cloud 
technology and the growth of our sales and 
client services teams, the operating profit 
reduced to £3.39 million (2012: £4.28 
million). The adjusted operating profit also 
reduced by 22% year on year to £4.33 
million (2012: £5.53 million) as shown in 
note 3, with the adjusted operating margin 
reducing to 13.3% (2012: 17.3%). The 
adjusted EBITDA (note 3) reduced by 19% to 
£5.46 million (2012: £6.73 million).
Research and development  
and capex
The research and development team is now 
focused solely on cloud-based solutions, 
StatPro Revolution and StatPro R+ (the 
cloud upgrade path for StatPro Seven) and 
research and development expenditure 
increased overall by 6% to £4.44 million 
(2012: £4.18 million), equating to 14% 
of Group revenue (2012: 13%). The total 
expenditure on StatPro Revolution (and

£0.93 million (2012: £0.64 million). 
Finance income and expense 
Net finance expense reduced to £0.27

Profit before tax 
Profit before taxation decreased by 18% 
to £3.11 million (2012: £3.78 million). After 
adjusting for amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, share based payments 
and exceptional items, the adjusted 
profit before taxation reduced by 20% to 
£4.05 million (2012: £5.04 million). The 
impact of currency movements increased 
adjusted profit before taxation by £0.29 
million (i.e. approximately 9% impact). 
Taxation
The tax charge is £1.03 million (2012: £1.10 
million). The underlying tax rate (before 
the impact of exceptional items) is around 
30% and the overall effective tax rate is 
33% (2012: 29%). This is higher than the 
prevailing UK rate largely due to unrelieved 
losses in our development company StatPro 
International Sarl and also the impact of 
the non-deductible exceptional increase 
in SiSoft contingent consideration. 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share decreased by 
28% to 3.1p (2012: 4.3p). Diluted earnings 
per share decreased to 3.1p (2012: 4.3p) 
based on 0.07 million (2012: 0.25 million) 
potentially dilutive shares outstanding. 
Adjusted earnings per share (note 10) 
reduced by 24% to 4.5p (2012: 5.9p).  Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

FINANCIAL REVIEW ...continued
Balance sheet
The Group’s net assets reduced to £46.91 
million (2012: £49.62 million), mainly as 
a result of a reduction in goodwill due 
to currency translation movements. 
Cash flow and financing
2013 was another year of positive 
cash generation with cash inflow from 
operating activities (before exceptional 
payments) of £9.40 million (2012: £10.18 
million). The Group ended the year with 
net cash of £4.00 million (2012: £3.67 
million). The Group nevertheless retains 
its long-term financing facility which 
was undrawn at 31 December 2013. 
Dividends
The directors are recommending an 
increased final dividend of 1.95p per 
share (2012: 1.9p) making a total dividend 
for 2013 of 2.8p per share (2012: 2.7p). 
The final dividend will be paid on 21 May 
2014 to all shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 25 April 2014. 
Total dividends paid in 2013 amounted 
to £1.86 million (2012: £1.63 million). The 
Board intends to maintain a progressive 
dividend policy reflecting the balance 
between the investment needs of the 
business and the growth in underlying 
earnings per share (eps). When proposing 
the dividend, the Board satisfies itself that 
the current and projected level of dividend 
cover is appropriate. The dividend cover 
(calculated as adjusted eps: dividends 
per share) was 1.6 times (2012: 2.2).
Principal financial risks 
The principal business risks and 
uncertainties affecting the Group are 
described on pages 28 to 31. For each 
category of risk, the directors have 
identified means by which the risk can be 
managed or reduced in a cost effective way, 
whilst accepting that some risks cannot 
be completely eliminated. Details of key 
financial risks are considered below.
Financial risk management 
The current and projected financial risks 
of the Group are managed by the Group 
finance team. The primary risk relates to 
financing facilities and this is mitigated 
by ensuring very tight control of cash and 
detailed forecasting of business cash flows. 
Liquidity risk
The Group’s cash position is closely 
monitored with weekly updates from all 
overseas operations and daily updates 
of cash collected from customers. Any 
aged debtor balance that is overdue 
is investigated to ascertain the reason 
and to resolve the situation promptly. 
Monitoring procedures for short-term 
cash projections allow the Group finance 
team to closely monitor the key liquidity 
and other financial ratios to ensure that 
there is sufficient liquidity in the business 
at all times and sufficient headroom in 
relation to the banking covenants.

Financing facilities
The Company retains its senior debt 
facility with The Royal Bank of Scotland 
plc (RBS), which is committed to May 
2016, subject to compliance with agreed 
covenants. The Company has the option 
to extend the facility for a further year 
to May 2017 (subject to RBS Credit 
Committee approval). At 31 December 
2013, the Group had both net cash of 
£4.00 million and undrawn credit facilities 
of £8.50 million available to support its 
business operations and therefore the 
Board believes that the Group is well 
positioned to manage the business risks.
Foreign exchange risk 
management
The Group is exposed to exchange rate 
fluctuations given that the majority of its 
revenue is non-sterling based. The Group 
also has a significant proportion of its costs 
in the same currencies as its revenues and 
therefore there is a reasonable degree of 
natural reduction in overall currency risk. 
All material foreign currency transaction 
exposures (i.e. sales and purchase contracts 
denominated in a different currency to 
the local reporting currency) are hedged 
through use of foreign exchange contracts 
as soon as the amount and timing of the 
exposure is identified with reasonable 
certainty. The Group’s policy is not to hedge 
profit and loss translation exposures. 
As part of our liability management, we 
have made use of currency swaps with 
a total principal value of approximately 
£5.19 million denominated in USD, CAD, 
and EUR, to create synthetic currency 
hedges in order to provide a partial hedge 
against movements in the fair value of 
investments in overseas subsidiaries. 
As the Group continues to grow and 
generates increased profits overseas in 
foreign currencies this exchange rate 
exposure is expected to increase. 
Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk 
and an increase in interest rates would 
increase the interest payable on the Group’s 
banking facility. Given the Group’s current 
net cash position and the benign outlook 
for interest rates, the Board has decided not 
to undertake any interest rate hedging but 
will review the position from time to time.
The risk to rising interest rates (should 
the Group return to a net debt position) 
would be partly mitigated by an increase 
in interest income from surplus cash 
and deposits, where the policy is 
to seek to maximise interest return 
without exposure to inappropriate 
liquidity or counterparty risk.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW
As a Group, we continued to focus 
on enhancing our overall service for 
our clients in 2013. Maintaining high 
service levels and ensuring we adhere 
to the latest industry security standards 
remain top priorities for the team. 
A key message given to all our staff is that 
every single person within StatPro can 
positively affect how a client or prospect 
feels about StatPro. Understanding and 
appreciating this is an important part 
of our culture and something that we 
must never become complacent about.
Client experience isn’t just about service, 
even though it is a very important part, it’s 
about how StatPro first makes that prospect 
or client view StatPro, what that interaction 
is like, did the message resonate, did the 
sales resource engage in a timely and polite 
manner, were product/tariff questions 
answered clearly and succinctly, did the 
on-boarding go well, is the after-sale service 
functionally deep, as well as courteous, 
was the financial transaction itself pain 
free, is the system available all the time, 
does the product simply just work? 
You can read in the Marketing Strategy how 
we’re working more with clients to support 
both our business goals through sharing 
of communication and efforts (page 21). 
The Sales and Partnerships section on page 
22 also details how the sales team has 
been reorganised to reflect the segmented 
profiles of our new clients. Please also read 
on page 23 in the Client Services review 
how in 2013 we refocused on simplifying 
what is complex and making it available 
to those that require the information. 
As a globally focused client service 
team, we continually assess what our 
clients require from us and we adapt 
our processes to ensure we are aligned 
to meet their needs. Of course these 
teams also rely on each other to support 
the client-focused message, gather 
feedback on the product and deliver a 
tailored, yet simple and scalable service 
to our clients whether they are new to 
StatPro or a long-standing customer.
This focus continues in 2014 as we look 
to use third party tools and the best 
practices to improve our service as this 
will ultimately lead to increased revenue 
via our subscription-based business 
model. 2013 was a good year. Thanks to 
everyone in the client services team for 
their diligence and hard work. 2014 will 
hold more challenges but we’re confident 
that the structural changes we’ve put 
in place will allow us to improve our 
service further and that will allow for 
greater client satisfaction and growth.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW
 / Marketing Strategy
Neil Smyth
Our message in 2013 and 2014 is focused  
on the benefits of our cloud-based 
platforms. The debate on the adoption of 
cloud computing is almost over as we hear 
from clients and partners that the cloud 
is an accepted delivery mechanism for 
software and one which many companies 
now understand and actively pursue in 
their software strategy. By focusing on the 
benefits, the marketing message is more of 
a business conversation versus a technical 
one. All our clients and prospects want to 
increase sales, improve client service, meet 
regulations, and reduce costs. These are 
the four fundamental elements to StatPro’s 
A poll suggests the top key goals for investment managers are:
86%
75%
67%
offerings and our clients are realising 
these benefits by using the products to 
produce and distribute their portfolio 
analysis both internally and externally. 
In 2013 we had more engagement with 
our partners globally as we continue to 
build our network (in line with the StatPro 
Strategy set out on page 8). In the autumn 
of 2013 we held a joint conference with 
Apex Fund Services in Dublin with over 50 
attendees to discuss industry regulations 
and how StatPro Revolution is helping 
clients meet them in a cost-effective 
way. We are in the process of planning 
more joint partner events across Europe, 
North America and South Africa after the 
positive feedback. We continue to work 
closely with TD Ameritrade and attended 
their global client conference in the USA 
where over 1,600 investment advisers 
come together to learn about industry 
trends and new technology to help them 
deliver a better service to their clients.
Our marketing strategy for 2014 will 
continue to focus on our four key 
benefits but also on the unique selling 
point of StatPro Revolution; the ability 
to share portfolio analysis to anyone at 
no extra cost. Since Q3 2013, we have 
been promoting our new sharing feature 
that allows StatPro Revolution users to 
take control of their portfolio analysis 
distribution. It is no longer about managing 
software installations and delivering 
static reports to clients; the future of 
analysis distribution is about Self-Service 
reporting, managing users, content, and 
access, to enable online and interactive 
analysis for anyone across multiple 
devices. We continue to promote this 
unique benefit through content-based 
campaigns using statpro.com, webinars, 
white papers, videos, infographics, 
exhibitions and StatPro-hosted events 
whilst analysing the marketing mix to 
ensure improvement of this message to 
analysts and influencers, partners, clients 
and prospects throughout the year. 
Helping clients and prospects 
understand this unique 
selling proposition (USP) 
whilst working with sales and 
client services is the key goal 
of the 2014 marketing 
strategy.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW
 / Sales and Partnerships
The StatPro sales and account management 
activity is built around a team of over 30 
people located across 11 offices. Owing 
to the wide appeal of StatPro Revolution 
this large team has now been reorganised 
to reflect the segmented profiles of 
our new clients as we now see StatPro 
Revolution gaining traction from the 
private banking and pension funds markets 
while continuing its growth in the asset 
management space. Global accounts and 
third party partners are now also managed 
by a dedicated corporate account team.
In order to cover direct sales but 
also assist partners and distributors 
marketing StatPro Revolution, we will 
increase our resources in 2014.
During 2014, we will look to drive even 
further the usage of StatPro Revolution 
through the sharing functionality 
and through dedicated training and 
communication with respect to the clients’ 
guidelines and objectives. Understanding 
the complexity and the vision of our clients 
requires dedicated effort but this is made 
simpler with the ease of deployment of 
StatPro Revolution. Our clients are then 
able to access a global and unique analytics 
service whilst benefiting from one team 
with expertise in the relevant country.
The partnership programme for 
fund administrators and third party 
distributors initiated in 2012 proved 
successful with 34 companies now 
sharing our ambition to offer a unique 
analytics platform to their clients. 
The sharing capabilities offered by StatPro 
Revolution will support the extension of 
the number of users and we look forward 
to seeing this grow in 2014. By sharing 
our open platform to partners looking for 
analytics features or adding new services 
via third parties in the StatPro store we are 
confident of StatPro Revolution’s future. 
As we continue to add additional analytical 
functionality to StatPro Revolution, 
especially with advanced risk management, 
Michel Lempicki
we will be in a position to start migrating 
certain clients from our StatPro Seven 
platform during 2014. This process will 
be accelerated once the full version of 
StatPro R+, our cloud-based replacement 
for StatPro Seven, is released commercially 
in early 2015. StatPro R+ is a highly scalable 
production system for managing and 
producing portfolio performance and 
returns data that can then be analysed 
and distributed using StatPro Revolution.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW
 / Client Services
With experience of development, 
implementations, upgrades, banking 
and finance, infrastructure and hosting, 
we’re fanatical about client service.
As detailed in the StatPro Strategy 
(page 8) our products and services 
focus on simplifying what is complex 
and making it available to those that 
require the information our solutions 
calculate and provide. This is true for 
StatPro Revolution, StatPro Seven 
and the forthcoming StatPro R+.
As a globally focused client service 
team we continually assess what 
our clients require from us and we 
adapt our processes to ensure we are 
aligned to meet our clients’ needs.
In 2013 we adjusted the global teams 
to adopt a ‘hub and spoke’ model in 
respect to service delivery. Certain core 
support and oversight functions are being 
centralised in key locations to allow for 
efficient focused implementations and 
ongoing support across our 11 offices. 
The model is geared to achieve 
standardisation, increase scalability, 
remove duplication and apply focus to 
ensure we have the defined processes 
needed for an efficient and valuable 
service offering. In a nutshell, our aim is to 
ensure our clients get true value out of the 
products we have developed for a rapidly 
changing market. This enables our clients 
to focus on growing their own businesses 
while we ensure they have the platform 
to demonstrate the value they create.

PRODUCT STRATEGY
2013 focused on sharing
,
 compliance and StatPro R+ development. 
StatPro Revolution
Development has been driven by two 
strategic themes:
Compliance
As detailed previously, 2013 focused on 
UCITS (for mutual funds) and AIFMD (the 
equivalent for hedge funds). Therefore, 
StatPro Revolution development was 
dedicated to the integrated compliance 
solution enabling our clients to tackle 
the increased regulatory pressure 
they must adhere to. The new 
feature covers three key aspects:
• UCITS IV Global Exposure: regulating 
the risk limits that a fund is permitted 
to undertake;
• AIFMD Commitment Calculation: limits 
on the leverage a hedge fund is allowed 
to take; and
• UCITS IV Investment Restrictions: 
integrating the above two with 
compliance tools.
StatPro released the first module ‘Risk 
Limits Monitoring’, in May 2013, and  
we released the second part in early  
March 2014.
Sharing
During 2013, StatPro invested in the social 
aspect of StatPro Revolution, with the aim 
of increasing the distribution and usage of 
the product virally. StatPro has been 
externally audited and certified to both  
ISO 27001 and SSAE 16 information security 
standards. We have been developing our 
cloud technology since early 2008, bringing 
open collaboration and information control 
to the investment management community. 
We believe keeping performance data 
locked away in the middle office doesn’t 
serve anyone. Sharing portfolio information 
with your network makes it more powerful, 
usable and more likely to enhance business 
decision making or client relationships. 
Sharing portfolio analysis data across the 
organisation adds value to the data 
immediately: it can be analysed, audited 
and improved. Controlled sharing also adds 
value to the team producing such 
information, raising its profile across the 
wider business.
The new sharing features allow our clients 
the control they need when deciding how 
much of the portfolio they share, and with 
whom they share it. It’s all about users, 
content and access control. It can be 
centrally managed and monitored while 
still being quick and easy to accomplish. 
Such control enables rapid deployment of 
business information to any user with a 
full audit trail and without the hassle and 
expense of managing local applications. 
StatPro R+
In 2013, StatPro launched the beta version 
of StatPro R+, the cloud-based solution 
for computing accurate performance 
measurement in the fastest and most 
flexible way, and the replacement for 
StatPro Seven. With StatPro R+, StatPro 
solves two key issues in the industry 
when measuring performance:
• Speed and scalability: the first beta 
tests on client portfolios reduced 
the computational time by a factor 
of around 100 using the cloud, for 
the same infrastructural costs.
• Flexibility: StatPro R+ uses 
technology to simplify the work of 
the performance measurement team, 
give them the flexibility to design 
efficient production workflows, 
customising imports and controls. 
Speed and flexibility mean ultimately 
that performance measurers will be 
able to perform their tasks faster and 
more efficiently, significantly boosting 
the productivity of these teams. 25
Dario Cintioli
2014/2015
The development plan for both StatPro 
Revolution and StatPro R+ focuses on the 
functional completion of the two products. 
The objective is to introduce all those 
pieces of functionality that can serve the 
analytics and reporting needs of a large 
asset manager with the dual objective of 
starting the migration of bigger StatPro 
Seven clients while selling more actively 
at the top end of the buy-side industry.
StatPro Revolution 
development:
• AIFMD/UCITS commitment approach 
calculation: we look to enable the 
analysis of commitment (exposure 
and computing exposure) according 
to the EU rules with regards to 
derivatives. Hedge funds use 
derivatives and the AIFMD rules open 
the issue of computing commitment 
when derivatives are involved.
• The automation of report production: 
we want to change the industry 
and allow our clients to start 
reporting interactively on the 
web, while also enabling clients to 
continue to operate their traditional 
reporting activity efficiently.
• Fixed income attribution versus 
benchmark analysis: StatPro Revolution 
will become one of the only products 
in the industry covering every 
aspect of fixed income performance 
measurement, with fully integrated 
data, dramatically simplifying 
the access to sophisticated and 
beautiful fixed income analytics.
• Advanced Risk Management: relative 
risk, risk factor decomposition, 
sensitivity and many other exciting 
analyses will be released in the module 
providing more reasons for the front 
office to use StatPro Revolution.
StatPro R+ development:
In 2013 we released the so-called ‘external’ 
performance capabilities as a beta, which 
is the ability to compute the returns 
of a fund or other portfolio, starting 
from information on the total market 
value and ‘external’ transactions, like 
subscriptions, redemptions and fees.
In 2014 and early 2015 we will be 
completing StatPro R+ with the ability 
to perform transactional security-level 
(internal performance) calculations. This 
means that StatPro R+ will manage each 
individual security, computing the true 
performance generated by all trades in 
that asset. The sum of all assets’ internal 
performance is later reconciled with the 
‘official’ external performance, delivering 
very accurate and detailed calculations.
StatPro has always had a large knowledge 
base on how to make these calculations. 
Where StatPro R+ adds value is the 
speed of calculation and in the flexibility 
of managing the controls and data 
management processes for cleaning the 
data, while ensuring the perfect numbers 
with the smallest possible costs.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
StatPro has outlined its strategy in this Annual Report. Key to the 
successful outcome is our understanding of StatPro’s market drivers:
Transparency 
To ensure that StatPro adds the most value 
possible to its clients, it must listen and 
understand their requirements:
• StatPro uses client ‘new feature’ 
requests and sales team feedback to 
prioritise product enhancement.
• StatPro also employs suitable financially 
qualified staff (e.g. to CFA level, even 
on the product development team) 
to ensure that we understand our 
clients’ needs and their issues.
Regulation 
By understanding the impact of unfolding 
regulatory changes and updating its 
products in time, StatPro helps clients meet 
new regulatory requirements.
Competition 
StatPro has significant resources to 
deliver on what is required, yet is small 
enough to react to changing market 
threats or opportunities. Such agility is a 
key corporate attribute.
Cloud 
To allay customer concerns regarding their 
data being in the ‘cloud’, StatPro has 
invested in both the ISO 27001 and SSAE 16 
certifications. StatPro has embraced the 
best cloud product development and 
management practices for over three years, 
and has partnered with industry-leading IT 
services suppliers to ensure the best service 
availability and security.
Outsourcing 
StatPro has invested in its own products 
with best-practice procedures for its own 
staff to ensure that clients’ requirements 
are routinely met.
StatPro’s approach to risk 
– Enterprise Risk Management 
frameworks
An Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework provides a holistic approach 
that aligns an organisation’s strategic, 
operational, reporting and compliance 
objectives across all levels to manage all key 
business risks and opportunities. The goal is 
to maximise value for the entire enterprise.
The interaction between business 
objectives, risk framework components 
and organisational level is best illustrated 
by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organisations of the Treadway 
Commission’s (COSO) ERM Cube. 
The ISO 31000 ‘Risk Management – 
Principles and Guidelines’ standard 
(published 2009) complements COSO’s 
ERM framework by addressing the 
management system that supports the 
design, implementation, maintenance 
and improvement of ERM processes.

 Business Strategy fails: 
‘StatPro’s updated business 
strategy fails to identify new 
markets and/or products; 
and/or fails to improve on 
its current offerings.’
• StatPro continues to make 
considerable investment in StatPro 
Revolution, and will also migrate its 
‘traditional’ asset performance and 
valuation products to the ‘cloud’ 
with the launch of StatPro R+ in late 
2014/early 2015. If market take-up 
of StatPro Revolution (or StatPro 
R+) does not meet expectations, 
or current clients fail to sign up for 
the planned cloud-based products 
over current ‘hosted’ or ‘installed’ 
products, the ‘cloud’ investment 
won’t have been maximised. Indeed, 
legacy-product clients may leave 
for competitor offerings that they 
feel more comfortable with.
• Product design, complemented by a 
sufficient marketing and sales effort 
is key to identifying and winning 
new clients; at the same time 
convincing them of the merits of

 Clients not satisfied: 
‘StatPro’s reputation 
suffers as clients’ 
expectations are not met.’
• StatPro anticipates (as many 
successful products do in an 
‘infinite’ digital market) that StatPro 
Revolution will reach a ‘tipping 
point’ (when a critical mass of 
users act as product evangelists to 
further convince potential users 
to try or subscribe for the service), 
leading to ‘exponential’ growth.
• To reach the ‘tipping point’ sooner, 
StatPro must ensure that existing 
clients are ‘on-boarded’ as quickly 
and as smoothly as possible, thereby 
enhancing their customer experience 
and increasing their likelihood of 
becoming product evangelists.
• Ensure a good understanding 
of clients’ needs.
• Allocate an account manager to 
manage the client relationship.
• Escalate any issues to director level.
• Proactive account management.
• Long-term contracts foster 
client commitment.

our strategic direction for building 
cloud-related revenue growth. If 
our externally announced targets 
are not met this could cause

for our reputation and lower 
revenues could put pressure on 
our EBITDA and cash generation.
• Continuous control over 
the sales process and close 
monitoring of the sales pipeline 
by regional sales directors.
• Targets are set each year 
and territory performance is 
monitored against them.
• The sales pipeline is managed in 
salesforce and is updated with 
reasons for lost opportunities e.g. 
sales performance, functionality etc.
• Actions are identified in the sales 
strategy meeting to manage the 
strategy and competitive positioning.
• Monthly updates of sales 
forecasts are made.
• StatPro has implemented both 
traditional below-the-line marketing 
strategies such as event hosting and 
sponsorship and cost-effective online 
advertising tools to track and report 
interest in its products, thereby 
enabling a more effective and 
efficient marketing and sales effort.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
INTRODUCTION TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
This section of our Annual Report explains how the Board and each of its committees 
function. The Board oversees the Company’s financial reporting, risk management and 
regulatory compliance functions. It also sets executive remuneration and oversees 
executive appointments. These roles are fulfilled by the Board and its three committees 
shown below. The Board and its committees meet regularly, discuss matters by phone 
when necessary, and circulate minutes and relevant papers in advance of each meeting.
My aim as Chairman is to create a diverse, inclusive and effective Board, which is fully 
informed about the business and able to provide the executive membership with an 
appropriate balance of challenge and support. My relationship with our CEO and our 
interaction with the non-executive directors is of key importance for a climate of open 
communication and constructive debate. I run annual Board evaluations, which provide 
useful feedback to drive improvements in the Board’s and committees’ work.

corporate governance
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
Your Company is listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange (AIM), so the Company is not required to 
comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code, which applies only to fully listed companies. Nevertheless, the Company is committed 
to high standards of corporate governance and the Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders. This statement describes how 
the Company applies the principles of good corporate governance, and the Company’s adherence with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code to the appropriate level. 
The workings of the Board and its committees
The Board
The Board comprises the Non-Executive Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director and three other non-
executive directors. It is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Company. Directors’ biographies appear on 
pages 36 to 37 and demonstrate their range of relevant experience, bringing independent judgement to bear on issues of strategy, 
performance, resources, industry knowledge and standards of conduct. 
All directors have access to the Company Secretary, who is responsible for company secretarial matters and compliance with relevant 
statutory obligations. All directors have access to training to enable them to comply with their duties as a director. 
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all directors have full and timely access to all relevant information. The Board meets at least 
quarterly and has adopted a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by it, thus ensuring that it exercises control 
over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues. At its meetings the Board reviews trading performance, 
ensures adequate financing, sets and monitors strategy, examines investment and acquisition opportunities and discusses reports to 
shareholders. The directors can also take independent professional advice as appropriate at the Company’s expense. The Chairman 
meets at least once a year with the non-executive directors without the executive directors present.
The performance of the executive directors is reviewed annually by the non-executive directors. On resignation from the Board a 
non-executive director would be invited to provide a written statement to the Chairman for circulation to the Board, if he or she were to 
have any unresolved concerns about the running of the Company. The overall effectiveness of the Board and its sub-committees is 
reviewed by the Board as a whole through annual completion and discussion of a questionnaire. 
The Board believes that the level of sales consulting to promote StatPro Revolution provided by Mark Adorian in 2012 and 2013 means 
that he may no longer be considered independent under the UK Corporate Governance code, although the Board believes that Mark 
Adorian is independent of mind and continues to act in the interests of all shareholders.
Stuart Clark is the Senior Independent Director and is available to the shareholders for any concerns which have not been resolved by 
contact with the Chairman, Chief Executive or other executives, or for which such contact is inappropriate. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Jane Tozer. The Audit Committee also comprises the Chairman (Carl Bacon), Mark Adorian and Stuart 
Clark, and meets at least three times annually. The Audit Committee receives reports from the Group’s external auditors and its 
meetings are also attended, by invitation, by the Group Finance Director. 
The Audit Committee reviews the Company’s financial matters, as set out in written terms of reference, including the interim results and 
the Annual Report and Accounts, before their submission to the Board. It monitors the controls in force to ensure the integrity of 
financial information reported to shareholders. 
The Audit Committee reviews the appointment of external auditors, discusses the nature and scope of the audit and reviews the 
external auditor’s remuneration both for audit and non-audit work. The Audit Committee assesses annually the qualification, expertise 
and resources, the independence of the external auditors, and the effectiveness of the audit process. 
The Audit Committee reviews the whistleblower policy and process for staff and receives reports on all issues raised through this process.
Remuneration and Nominations Committees
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the contract terms, remuneration and other benefits for executive 
directors, including performance-related bonus schemes and participation in the Group’s Long Term Incentive Scheme. Stuart Clark was 
appointed chairman of the Remuneration Committee with effect from 1 July 2013 (previously Mark Adorian) and the other members are 
Carl Bacon, Mark Adorian and Jane Tozer.  34
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

The Remuneration Report, which includes details of directors’ remuneration, pension entitlements and directors’ interests, together 
with information on service contracts, is set out on pages 41 to 44. 
Mark Adorian is the chairman of the Nominations Committee and the other committee members are Carl Bacon, Stuart Clark and Jane 
Tozer. The Nominations Committee reviews and nominates appointments to the Board. All such appointments are then reviewed and 
approved by the full Board. 
Six scheduled Board meetings were held in 2013. During the year, there were three Audit Committee meetings, three Remuneration 
Committee meetings and no Nominations Committee meetings. The number of scheduled Board meetings and sub-committee meetings 
attended by each director during the year were as follows:

Group Executive Board
The Group Executive Board (GEB) is the executive committee, which comprises the executive directors and other senior executives of 
the Group who meet at least ten times per year to discuss strategic and operational matters. Regional executive boards and product-
focused committees have been established to deal with other executive matters within clearly defined terms of reference established 
by the Board. 
On 1 January 2013 a number of changes were made to the members and roles within the Group Executive Board. Andrew Peddar was 
appointed Group Chief Operating Officer and Marc Zandt was promoted to the GEB as Global Services Director. On 1 January 2014 
Michel Lempicki was appointed as Global Accounts Director. 
The members of the Group Executive Board and their roles and responsibilities are:
Justin Wheatley, Group Chief Executive
Andrew Fabian, Group Finance Director
Andrew Peddar, Group Chief Operating Officer
Dario Cintioli, Product Director
Michel Lempicki, Global Accounts Director
Neil Smyth, Marketing and Technology Director
Marc Zandt, Global Services Director
The Group Executive Board has the following sub-committees:
Regional Boards
EMEAA Region (Europe, South Africa and Asia Pacific) and North American Region
Operational decisions on implementing the Group’s strategy, including sales and client services strategy and expenditure and 
recruitment plans, are delegated to senior executives in the Group’s regions, within clearly defined terms of reference and overall 
budgets established by the Board. 
Product strategy
Operational decisions on implementing the Group’s product strategy, including development plans and related expenditure and 
recruitment plans, are delegated to the Product Director who works with other senior executives on product-focused committees, 
within clearly defined terms of reference and overall budgets established by the Board.  35
Relations with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are very important. There is a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders and market analysts, 
including presentations after the Company’s preliminary announcement of the annual and interim results and any other major 
announcements. 
Internal controls and risk management 
During the year, the Board has formally reviewed the Group’s risk profile and reported on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls and management of Group risk. This review addresses internal financial controls and other risks and controls of the 
business. The directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the Company’s system of internal control, which is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate business risks and which provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatements 
or loss. 
The Company has established risk management procedures which the Board considers appropriate to a group of StatPro’s size and 
complexity. During the year the risk management procedures were reviewed by the directors. This is achieved through a series of 
reports and meetings of specific committees including the Information Security Committee. The Company has a Group Risk Manual, 
which sets out the key risks and the controls in place to manage these risks, and identifies actions to be taken to eliminate or mitigate 
risks as appropriate. 
Each senior executive is responsible for managing risks in his or her area of responsibility, and making regular reports on risk issues to 
both the main Board, Audit Committee and the Group Executive Board. This risk analysis is embedded in risk review meetings in the 
Group Executive Board, and covers all business risks including commercial, financial, operational, legal and environmental risks. These 
reports include the potential impact to the business of each key risk and its likelihood of occurrence, plus details of mitigating actions 
and insurance policies including specific cover for the Company and/or its directors. 
Recommendations on internal controls and risk improvement are reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board. 
A statement of the directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements is set out on page 39 and a statement on going 
concern is below. 
Financial controls
The Group has established written expenditure approval, delegation of authority and authorisation levels, segregation of duties and 
other control procedures including accounting policies and procedures.
Budgetary process 
Each year the Board approves the annual budget and key risk areas are identified. Performance is monitored and relevant action is 
taken throughout the year through regular reporting to the Board of variances from the budget, updated forecasts for the year and 
information on the key risk areas.
Investment appraisal 
Major capital and other project expenditure is controlled by a budgetary process and authorisation levels set by the Board. For capital 
expenditure above specified levels, and for acquisitions and disposals, detailed written proposals must be submitted to the Board for 
approval. 
Internal audit 
The Group currently does not have an internal audit function as the directors consider this to be inappropriate given the size of the 
Group. However, this is reviewed by the Board annually. An element of internal audit assurance is provided through internal staff 
working on specific projects, for example reviewing the policies and procedures relating to information security, including the 
effectiveness of related internal controls.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries and for the reasons set out in the Directors’ Report, the directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements (see note 1). Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
The directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Group’s financial statements (see note 1).
Research and development 
The Group continues to invest in developing improved software products and services. Development expenditure incurred during the 
year was £4.44 million (2012: £4.18 million). In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), development costs 
are capitalised where recognition criteria are met and written off over the useful life, currently estimated by the directors to be three 
years. The amount capitalised in the year was £3.40 million (2012: £3.21 million) and the total amount of amortisation was £3.40 million

Directors’ Report
For the year ended 31 December 2013 39
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to 
prepare the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ indemnity insurance
The Company carries an appropriate level of professional indemnity insurance cover for the size of the business and also has insurance 
cover for Directors’ and Officers’ liability.
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each director has confirmed that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
• he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself or herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given in accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Substantial shareholdings
The Company has been notified of the following disclosable holdings of voting rights in the Company’s issued share capital as at 
10 March 2014:
Number of shares % of share capital 
Liontrust Asset Management 12,843,304 19.0%

Artemis Investment Management 6,798,037 10.1%
Brown Brothers Harriman & Co 3,423,273 5.1%
MC Adorian 2,873,548 4.3%
In addition to the above holdings, JMBT Wheatley holds 69,000 Ordinary Shares (representing 0.1% of the Ordinary Share capital) in a 
family trust, being a trustee and potential indirect beneficiary of the trust. 40

Directors’ Report ...continued 41
Remuneration Report
Stuart Clark is the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee (appointed 1 July 2013) and the other members of the committee are Carl 
Bacon, Mark Adorian and Jane Tozer. The remuneration of all executive directors and other senior executives is recommended to the 
Board by the Committee. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board. During the year the committee 
has reviewed salary surveys and the policies of other companies of a comparable nature and has taken professional advice in relation to 
the design of a new Long Term Incentive Plan. 
Remuneration policy
The Group’s policy is to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives by rewarding them with remuneration packages which 
reflect both individual performance and the results of the operations under their control. Packages consist of basic salary, performance-
related bonuses, share options, pensions and other benefits, with a proportion of potential remuneration based upon achievement of 
demanding performance targets. Details of the remuneration package of each director are set out on page 43.
The Group has implemented a remuneration policy to align the executives’ interests with the objectives of all shareholders. The current 
focus is on the execution of the cloud strategy, and the achievement of revenue growth for StatPro Revolution.
Basic salary and benefits
Salaries are established by reference to prevailing market rates, adjusted to reflect individual performance, experience, responsibilities 
and skills. With effect from 1 July 2013, Justin Wheatley relocated to Boston, USA. As part of his move his remuneration package was 
re-denominated as a US$ amount based upon his existing remuneration package. The Remuneration Committee approved an increase 
in basic salary for Andrew Fabian to £155,000 with effect from 1 January 2014. 
Non-executive fees
Following a review, the fee arrangements for non-executive directors were changed during 2013. As a result of the review, the 
Chairman’s fee was increased to £45,000. For other non-executive directors, the basic fee increased to £35,000 (or currency equivalent) 
with an additional fee of £5,000 per annum applicable for being chairman of a Board committee. There have previously been no 
increases applied to non-executive fees for approximately ten years. Therefore, the annual fees payable were amended as follows with 
effect from 1 July 2013:
Non-executive director
Previous 
annual fee
New 
annual fee
Carl Bacon £36,000 £45,000
Mark Adorian £30,000 £35,000
Jane Tozer £30,000 £40,000
Stuart Clark US$45,000 US$60,000
Annual performance-related bonus scheme
In addition to basic salary, executive directors and other senior executives participate in an annual performance-related bonus scheme. 
Performance targets are designed to both stretch and encourage individuals whilst aligning their interests to that of the Group. 
In 2013, the targets for performance-related bonuses for main Board executive directors related to the Group’s revenue growth rate for 
StatPro Revolution, combined with satisfactory profit generation. The Committee may also award individual discretionary bonuses. In 
2013 and 2012, there were no discretionary awards. Bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings.  42

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The committee is currently reviewing the LTIP arrangements for the senior executive team in consultation with external advisers and 
institutional shareholders. 
Prior to 2013, share options have been granted to directors and eligible employees under established HMRC-approved and unapproved 
employee share option schemes as the Company places emphasis on the encouragement and motivation of senior executives. Options 
over shares to executive directors and senior executives were granted with a notional value at grant dependent upon the seniority of the 
participant and related to the participant’s base salary and the performance terms for those options. These options generally have a 
strike price based on a premium to the market price at the time and be exercisable after three years. They include performance criteria 
as determined by the Remuneration Committee from time to time, relating to growth in eps and other measures such as StatPro 
Revolution sales to ensure incentives are aligned with strategic objectives. The Remuneration Committee ensures that awards are made 
within the overall limits authorised by shareholders.
Details of the options outstanding under the schemes are provided in note 20 to the financial statements. 
The LTIP award granted in 2010 to Justin Wheatley failed to vest and as a result options over 45,000 shares previously granted to Justin 
Wheatley lapsed in 2013.
Pensions and other benefits
The Company also operates a defined contribution pension scheme for executive directors. Other benefits include allowances, life 
assurance and membership of a private healthcare scheme. 
Service contracts
Each of the executive directors has a rolling contract of service, which is terminable by no more than 12 months’ notice. In the event of 
termination of a service contract, compensation amounting to the notice period would be payable. Details of service agreements for 
each executive director are as follows:

StatPro International Sarl entered into a new employment contract with JMBT Wheatley on substantially the same terms as his previous 
employment contract with effect from 1 January 2013. Justin Wheatley is currently on secondment to StatPro Inc.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts. CR Bacon and AM Fabian seek re-election at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting. Biographical details of all directors can be found on pages 36 to 37.
Performance graph
 
31 December 2008 = 100 43
In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE™ AIM index is the most appropriate benchmark for total shareholder return comparatives. For 
the five-year period from 31 December 2008 to 31 December 2013 the total shareholder return for StatPro was +154%. Over the same 
period the FTSE™ AIM total shareholder return was +116%.

StatPro operates a pension salary sacrifice arrangement where individuals can exchange their salary for Company-paid pension 
contributions. Where individuals exchange salary this reduces StatPro’s National Insurance contributions. For executive directors, 
StatPro credits this saving to the individual’s pension. As part of JMBT Wheatley’s new service agreement, JMBT Wheatley has opted to 
swap pension benefits for other allowances and, therefore, he received no pension contribution from the Company in 2013 or 2012.  44

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE 
MEMBERS OF STAtPRO GROUP PLC
We have audited the financial statements of StatPro Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise Group Income 
Statement, Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, Group Balance Sheet, Company Balance Sheet, Group and Company Statements 
of Cash Flows, Group Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity, Company Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity and the 
related notes 1 to 27. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent Company financial statements, as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 39, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the 
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2013 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. 46
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes:
1. The maintenance and integrity of the StatPro Group plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not 
involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial 
statements since they were initially presented on the website.
2. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
1 Principal accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC 
interpretations endorsed by the European Union (EU) and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the measurement of financial 
assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. A summary of the significant Group accounting policies is set out below, together 
with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own income statement or statement of 
comprehensive income. The profit after taxation for the financial year of the Company was £4,026,000 (2012: £5,209,000).
The Group and parent Company financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 
pounds (£000) except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of preparation – going concern
The Group operates in the asset management sector of the financial services industry and whilst many of our clients are part of banking 
groups most of them are relatively resilient to the challenging economic backdrop. This is because, like StatPro itself, they themselves 
have recurring revenue business models and, to a large extent, the services and software provided by StatPro are reasonably embedded 
within their core operations. StatPro has a client base of around 450 (2012: 350), which is diversified geographically and by product and 
with no significant client concentration. The largest client group, which comprises a number of contracts for a variety of products and in 
a number of territories, represents less than 6% of recurring revenue. StatPro has a level of cancellations each year but most of our 
contracts are multi-year agreements which roll into subsequent commitments unless written notice is given to terminate the contract. 
For most software contracts the annual licence fee is payable in advance and for data contracts the fees are monthly in advance. For 
these reasons, we have good visibility on any potential deterioration in our trading outlook and potential risks to our business.
Renewals occur throughout the year although there is a slightly greater weighting in the fourth quarter. The Board closely monitors 
clients that are potentially at risk of cancellation as well as the pipeline of new business.
The Group has both cash and undrawn credit facilities available to support its business operations and therefore the Board believes that 
the Group is well positioned to manage the business risks. In reaching their conclusion the Board has reviewed cash flow forecasts. After 
making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Group and Company financial statements.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. 
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, therefore not necessarily equate to the actual outcome. Estimates are made by the 
directors based on experience and estimates believed to be reasonable expectations of future outcomes. Critical accounting estimates 
and judgements are made in the following areas:
• Impairment of goodwill.
• Carrying value of development assets.
• Deferred tax recognition.
The accounting policies in respect of these items are set out below and further details can be found in notes 11 and 17.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group’s impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is based on a value in use calculation. The 
value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the budget and projections for the 
next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that 
will enhance the asset’s performance of the cash generating unit being tested. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount 
rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation 
purposes. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash generating units, including a sensitivity 
analysis, are disclosed further in note 11.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2013 53
Carrying value of development assets
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with Group accounting policy. Initial recognition is based on management’s judgement that 
technological and economical feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according 
to an established project management model. In determining the amounts to be capitalised, management makes assumptions regarding the 
expected future cash generation of the assets, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of the benefits.
Deferred tax recognition
The Group establishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by tax authorities of the 
respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, such as experience with previous 
tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority. Management 
judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level 
of future taxable profits together with an assessment of the effect of future tax planning strategies.
New and amended accounting standards and interpretations
The following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations were effective as of 1 January 2013:
•  IAS 1 (amendment) Presentation of Financial Statements
•  IAS 19 (amendment) Employee Benefits
•  IFRS 7 (amendment) Offsetting financial assets and liabilities
•  IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
We believe that there are no areas within these standards which have a material impact to the Group.
Interpretations and revised standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group
The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Group’s future accounting but which 
the Group has not adopted early. Management has not yet fully assessed the impact of these new standards but does not believe they 
will have any material impact on the financial statements.
•  IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement – 1 January 2015
*
•  IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements – 1 January 2014
•  IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements – 1 January 2014
•  IFRS 12 Disclosure of interest in other entities – 1 January 2014
•  IAS 27 (amended) Consolidated and separate financial statements – 1 January 2014
•  IAS 28 (amended) Investments in associates and joint ventures – 1 January 2014
•  IAS 32 (amendment) Offsetting financial assets and liabilities – 1 January 2014
* Not yet EU endorsed
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings all made up to  
31 December each year. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Revenue
Revenue represents the invoiced value of goods and services, excluding value added tax, of the following:
a) Licence revenue and related software support contracts
 Licence revenue and software support contract income relating to obligations under contracts is recognised in the income statement 
over the period of the contract, on a monthly basis, from the start of the month in which the licence commences. Any balance not 
relating to the accounting period is carried forward as deferred income on the balance sheet. 54
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2013 ...continued
b) Data fees
 Data fee income is recognised in the income statement over the period of the contract, on a monthly basis, from the start of the 
month in which the contract commences. Any balance not relating to the accounting period is carried forward as deferred income on 
the balance sheet. Data overage revenue on data contracts (data revenue in excess of contracted amount) is recognised in the period 
that the overage was incurred.
c) Professional services revenue
 Income relating to consultancy projects is recognised in the income statement as a right to consideration established as a result  
of performance.
d) Royalty revenue
 Income is recognised in the income statement as rights to consideration accrues.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The 
chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has 
been identified as the Group Executive Board.
Research and development
Expenditure on research and development comprises salaries and related costs of personnel involved in software programming and 
development activities. Development costs are capitalised where the appropriate recognition criteria in accordance with IAS 38 are met, 
including the asset and related costs being separately identifiable, the use of the asset being technically feasible and intended and the asset 
being expected to generate future benefits. As a result there is an intangible asset relating to capitalised development costs (both internally 
developed and acquired) recognised on the Group’s balance sheet where the Board expects the benefits to be recovered through 
incremental revenue from future sales. The carrying values, which are analysed by product, are considered carefully by the Board and are 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets – customer contracts
Customer contracts acquired with acquisitions are valued based on the net contribution expected to be realised over the estimated life 
of the contracts and discounted at an appropriate discount rate, taking into account any tax effects. The carrying values are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Goodwill
For business combinations before 1 January 2010, goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the consideration 
including all costs relating to the acquisition and the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity. 
In accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised), the calculation of goodwill relating to any acquisitions that completed after 1 January 2010 will not 
include any acquisition related costs. Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews. Goodwill arising on 
acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 has been frozen with effect from 1 January 2004 and is no longer amortised but subject to annual 
impairment reviews.
Business combinations
The results and net assets of subsidiary undertakings acquired are included in the Group income statement and balance sheet using the 
acquisition method of accounting from the effective date of acquisition, the date control is gained over the subsidiary. The results, and 
net assets of subsidiary undertakings disposed of, are included in the Group income statement and balance sheet using the acquisition 
method of accounting to the effective date of disposal. Income and expenditure relating to transactions between Group undertakings 
are eliminated on consolidation.
Amortisation
The cost of other intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets as follows:
Development costs internally generated  – 33% per annum
Customer contracts    – over the period of the contracts (between 3 and 7 years)
Other intangibles – software    – between 14% and 33% per annum
Other intangibles – website development costs  – 33% per annum
Other intangibles – trademarks   – 10% per annum 55
Depreciation
The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets as follows:
Improvements to short leasehold property – over the period of the lease (between 3 and 12 years)
Office equipment    – between 10% and 20% per annum
Fixtures and fittings   – between 10% and 20% per annum
Computer equipment   – 33% per annum
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, including estimated contingent consideration less any provisions for impairment.
Current and deferred taxation
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. The current tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate 
taxable income. Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements at the balance sheet date and where these transactions or events result in an 
obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax in the future. Temporary differences are differences between the Group’s taxable 
profits and its results as stated in the financial statements. Deferred taxation assets are only recognised when their recoverability is 
more probable than not. Deferred taxation is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the 
temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. Recognised deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Leased assets
Rentals applicable to operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Financial instruments
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available 
for sale. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. The directors determine the 
classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category 
if acquired principally for the purpose of use in the short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are 
designated as hedges. Assets in this category are presented as current assets.
b) Loans and receivables
 Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are presented in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date, 
which are presented as non-current assets.
c) Available-for-sale financial assets
 The Company does not hold any assets available for sale (other than investments in subsidiaries which are deemed to be assets 
available for sale).
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised 
cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of prepaid transaction costs) and the redemption value (including interest) is recognised 
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current 
liabilities unless the facility is committed such that the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months from 
the balance sheet date. 56
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2013 ...continued
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group considers all bank deposits and highly liquid investments of less than three months’ maturity (which are considered to have 
insignificant risk to a change in value) to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts are excluded from cash and cash equivalents and are 
presented within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow 
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the 
effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks 
specific to the liability.
Pensions
The Group provides contributions on behalf of certain directors and employees to a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions 
payable in the year are charged to the income statement.
Share-based payments
In common with many high-growth technology enterprises, the Company has issued a number of share options to executives and employees. 
Under IFRS, the equity-settled share-based payment awards are valued at fair value at inception and this cost is recognised over the option 
vesting period (typically three years). As there is no readily available market price for the options, the Board has used an independent model to 
estimate the fair value of the options. There are a number of assumptions that affect the value and the Board has carefully considered 
these assumptions in order to derive an appropriate charge for the cost of options (note 20). The financial effects of awards by the 
Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised by the Company in its individual 
statements as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in 
which the dividend becomes a liability of the Company. In the case of an interim dividend this is on the payment date; for final dividends 
this arises on the passing of the relevant resolution at the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders.
Exceptional items
Significant items which are separately disclosed on the face of the income statement by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to 
the income statement. The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. The profit and loss for the year is translated at the average rate for the year. The exchange differences arising on 
retranslation of opening net assets are taken to other comprehensive income. The difference between the profit and loss at the average 
rate and closing rate are taken to other comprehensive income. All other translation differences are taken to the income statement.
2 Segmental information
The Group’s operating segments have been determined based on the information regularly reviewed by the Group Executive Board, 
which has been identified as the chief operating decision maker. The Group Executive Board considers the business to be split into two 
primary geographical markets: EMEAA and North America and central costs, which relate to the expenses of the Group’s headquarters 
and costs directly associated with the parent Company, which are managed by the Group management team. The external debt is also 
held within Central.
All revenue, profit/(loss) before taxation and total assets are attributable to the principal activity of the Group, being the development, 
marketing and distribution of software systems and the provision of web-based portfolio analysis and asset pricing services to the 
global asset management industry. Segment assets represent those assets arising from the operating activities of those segments. 
Segment results exclude the impact of any intercompany recharges of revenues or costs. Revenue was generated in the UK of £6.0 
million (2012: £5.9 million) with non-current assets held by UK entities totalling £31.1 million (2012: £32.6 million). 57

Exceptional items
2013 – Increase in contingent consideration for SiSoft
As announced in July 2013, the Board agreed an out-of-court settlement on the SiSoft acquisition contingent consideration, and as a 
result there is an exceptional charge of £0.35 million in 2013, and a remaining liability of £0.73 million.
Background
SiSoft developed an advanced web-based Composites solution, which is integrated into StatPro Seven’s Composites module. In 2010, 
StatPro announced its intention to exercise its option to acquire the 49% minority interest in SiSoft. However, as previously announced, 
the non-controlling shareholders, consisting of two parties owning 55% and 45% of the minority interest, disputed elements of the 
calculation of the contingent consideration and the matter has been progressing through the French courts. 59
Contingent consideration – partial settlement
Under the formula stipulated by the acquisition agreements, the contingent consideration was originally estimated at approximately 
€1.6 million (£1.3 million). Following further review, the directors determined that it was in the interests of the Company to propose an 
out-of-court settlement with the non-controlling shareholders to minimise the risk of a protracted dispute and to mitigate further legal 
costs and management time involved in the ongoing dispute. The offer was accepted by representatives of 55% of the non-controlling 
shareholders in SiSoft and, as a result, €1.16 million (£0.99 million) was paid in July 2013.
Remaining interest
The Court has now made a provisional judgment regarding the remaining 22% non-controlling interest and whilst most of the original 
elements of the claim (making up the bulk of the value) made by the non-controlling shareholders have now been rejected by the Court, 
the Court has appointed an expert to review the remaining elements at dispute to assist in evaluating the merits and the quantification 
of the claim.
The Board expects the remaining contingent consideration payable to the 22% shareholder party to be in the range of €0.7 million – 
€1.1 million (approximately £0.6 million – £0.9 million) and has increased the provision by approximately €0.4 million (£0.35 million). 
There is no tax deduction available on this provision as it relates to a capital item. The Board remains confident that our analysis of the 
case is robust and will provide an update when appropriate. Refer to notes 8, 16 and 26 for more detail.
2012 – Restructuring costs
The exceptional item in 2012 of £0.98 million was the one-off charge associated with the restructuring in January 2012 to re-focus the 
business on cloud technology.

8 Non-controlling interests
As previously noted, the Group exercised its option to acquire a 49% non-controlling interest in SiSoft in June 2010, and in July 2013 we 
completed the acquisition of 55% of the minority interest. Vendors representing approximately 22% of the shares (i.e. 45% of the 49% 
minority interest) are disputing certain aspects of the valuation and we are in a legal process in the French Commercial Court to resolve 
the matter. There is therefore a risk that the final consideration determined by the Court including related costs will be higher than the 
amount provided – see notes 16 and 26. We will provide a further update if the position changes materially or on the completion of 
the acquisition.

The directors have recommended a final dividend of 1.95p per Ordinary Share for 2013 (2012: 1.9p) resulting in a total dividend for the 
year of 2.8p per Ordinary Share (2012: 2.7p). If the 2013 final dividend is approved at the Annual General Meeting in May 2014 the 
dividend will be paid on 21 May 2014 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 25 April 2014 (ex-div date 23 April 2014). 
In accordance with IFRS, the dividend is not provided for as a liability in the accounts until it becomes a legal liability of the Company 
and will therefore be recorded in the interim and annual accounts for 2014.
10 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to Ordinary Shareholders by the weighted average number of 
Ordinary Shares in issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted number of Ordinary Shares 
outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares into Ordinary Shares. The Company has two categories of dilutive 
potential Ordinary Shares: shares to be issued and share options. For the share options, a calculation is performed to determine the 
number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the Company’s 
shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options. The number of shares 
calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

The movement on goodwill relates to exchange differences of £3.59 million (2012: £1.17 million). The total goodwill of £47.93 million 
includes goodwill for the North American region of £31.76 million (2012: £34.53 million) and goodwill for the EMEAA region of £16.17 
million (2012: £16.99 million).
Goodwill impairment review
The carrying value of goodwill arising on acquisition is reviewed at each balance sheet date to assess whether there has been any 
impairment. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) by considering the Group’s share of the cash 
that is expected to be generated by the business or product that was acquired. The evaluation is based on management forecasts over 
the period five years forward and assuming a terminal value based on 3% growth thereafter. Discount rates are based upon a prudent 
risk-adjusted pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
2013 2012
Discount rate for CGUs
EMEAA 9% 9%
North America 10% 10%
To assess for impairment, the value in use of the CGU is compared to the goodwill. If the resultant net present value of the discounted 
cash flows is less than the carrying value for goodwill the difference is written off through the income statement. Key assumptions in the 
projection of cash flows are: levels of new sales, renewal rates, growth in expenses and the discount rate. Management base these 
projections on the latest budgets and forecasts which take into account market conditions and economic factors. The headroom is 
therefore dependent upon sensitivities to these and other assumptions. The largest element of goodwill is in the North American region 
and if there were no growth in EBITDA in the region then this could result in impairment. However, it is not considered that there would 
be any impairment based on any reasonable set of assumptions. 64

Sensitivity for North America
Headroom at 10% discount rate £10 million £16 million
Headroom at 7.5% discount rate £36 million £48 million
Discount rate indicating impairment 12% 13%
The Board believes the 10% discount rate as being cautious, with an acceptable range being 6%-10%. The fair value measure is also 
sensitive to exchange rates, and could have an impact on the goodwill impairment assessment. In particular, the value of goodwill 
related to the FRI acquisition is linked to the Canadian dollar, whereas the underlying projection of cash flows is linked to exchange rates 
for several currencies. As a result, a strengthening Canadian dollar could have an adverse impact on the measured headroom. The 
goodwill on all acquisitions has been reviewed and, in the opinion of the directors, there is no impairment to the carrying value at 31 
December 2013 (2012: nil).

Acquired and internally generated development costs
Expenditure on research and development comprises salaries and related costs of personnel involved in software programming and 
development activities. Development costs are capitalised, where recognition criteria are met. As a result, there is an intangible asset 
relating to capitalised development costs (both internally developed and acquired) recognised on the Group’s balance sheet where the 
Board expects the benefits to be recovered through incremental revenue from future sales. Development expenditure is amortised over 
a three-year period as, in the opinion of the directors, this is the period over which the benefits arise. The carrying values, which are 
analysed by product, are considered carefully by the Board and if there has been any impairment in any development costs then the 
carrying value is written down accordingly. There was no impairment in 2013 (2012: nil). 
Customer contracts
Customer contracts acquired were valued on acquisition by estimating the future cash flows to be derived from those contracts over a 
period varying between three and seven years depending on the type of contract and discounting cash flows at a discount rate of 10% 
(2012: 10%), adjusting for any tax impact. The resultant fair value for the acquired customer contracts is amortised over a period of 
between three and seven years as, in the opinion of the directors, this is the period over which the benefits arise. At each balance sheet 
date the current values of the original contracts are reviewed against the carrying values to assess for impairment. The acquired 
customer contracts have been reviewed and, in the opinion of the directors, there is no impairment to the carrying value at 
31 December 2013 (2012: nil). 67

The contingent consideration is the consideration on the SiSoft acquisition and is now due to be utilised in 2014 although it is possible 
that it will fall beyond 12 months. This provision was increased during the year following the out-of-court settlement reached with one of 
the shareholders (see notes 3, 8 and 26). The onerous contracts provision relates to onerous leases and other contracts, and is expected 
to be utilised within four years. The increase in the year is an onerous property lease and associated costs following a relocation of a 
data centre in North America. The restructuring provision is the cost of redundancies and other cost associated with the restructuring 
and was fully utilised in the year. 70

No deferred tax liability with respect to unremitted earnings has been recognised at the balance sheet date. Undistributed profits 
available to be remitted to the UK should meet the requirements of the UK dividend exemption and should, therefore, be exempt from 
UK corporation tax. No deferred tax liability has been recognised with respect to the value of the underlying subsidiaries since, in the 
event of a sale, a gain or loss arising on disposal should meet the UK Substantial Shareholders Exemption criteria and, therefore, be 
exempt from UK corporation tax. The Finance Act 2013 included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% 
from 1 April 2014 and from 21% to 20% from 1 April 2015. As these changes were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013 and therefore 
before the balance sheet date, UK deferred tax is recognised at 20% in the current period. The rate changes will impact the amount of 
future tax payments to be made by the Company.
18 Financial instruments and financial risk management
The Company’s and Group’s key financial risks and its approach to managing these risks are described in the Financial Review on 
pages 18 and 19.
a) Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, money market deposits, bank loans, provisions, derivative financial instruments and 
various other accounts receivable and accounts payable, that arise directly from its operations.
Cash and money market deposits, when held, are carried at fair value. All financial assets except derivatives belong to the category 
‘loans and receivables’ in IAS 39. All financial liabilities except derivatives are held at amortised cost. The only derivative financial 
instruments relate to forward currency contracts which are purchased from banks and are considered Level 2 financial instruments in 
accordance with IFRS 7.
Bank loans are recorded at the value of the proceeds received less any direct issue costs which, due to the short-term nature of these 
instruments, approximates to fair value. They are subsequently stated at cost plus accrued interest, less any repayments which, due to 
the short-term nature of these instruments, approximates to amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 72
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2013 ...continued
Contingent consideration provision is considered a Level 3 financial instrument; further information on contingent consideration can be 
found in note 16.
Derivative financial instruments are used by the Group to hedge against various financial risks, such as foreign currency and interest 
rate risk. They are initially recognised at fair value and are designated by the entity at fair value through profit or loss.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group held forward currency hedging contracts to mitigate the effects of currency exposure relating to 
non-sterling financial assets and liabilities, cash flows and investments. The fair value of forward currency contracts relating to 
commercial transactions is recognised through the income statement; the net unrealised gain in respect of these contracts as at 
31 December 2013 was £74,000 (2012: £9,000). The fair value of forward currency contracts relating to hedging of net investments 
designated in hedge accounting relationships is recognised through equity, and the net unrealised gain relating to these contracts 
recognised through equity as at 31 December 2013 was £27,000 (2012: £14,000 loss).
The Company recognises financial instruments in its accounts when it enters into a binding agreement to receive cash or other economic 
benefits and derecognises them once all parties to the agreement have discharged all of their obligations. 
Interest income and expenses are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis. Realised gains and losses upon expiry of 
derivative financial instruments are recognised on settlement of the underlying contract.

Committed facilities
In May 2012 an agreement was signed with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc to extend our existing financing facilities until May 2015. 
We exercised an option to extend the facility to May 2016 and we have an option to extend for a further year to May 2017, subject to 
customary covenants and terms. At 31 December 2013, the facility was £8.5 million (£6.5 million of which is available as a revolving 
credit facility, reducing by £0.5 million tranches every six months to a minimum of £5.5 million). This restructured facility strengthens 
our financial position and provides financing options at a commercial cost and provides more flexibility than the previous arrangement, 
which was negotiated in early 2009.
As a result the facilities available as at 31 December 2013 comprise:
• Multi-currency fully revolving three-year amortising facility amounting to an initial value of £8 million (£6.5 million at December 
2013) with six-monthly repayments of £0.5 million reducing the facility to a minimum of £5.5 million.
• Flexibility to repay early with no penalty and to redraw within the amortising limits.
• Option to extend for a further year to May 2017 (subject to The Royal Bank of Scotland plc Credit Committee approval and 
compliance with covenants).
• Multi-currency revolving working capital loan of £2.0 million (£2.0 million available at December 2013). 73
There are covenants associated with the facility primarily relating to the gearing (net debt/EBITDA), interest cover and debt service 
ratios. Repayments of the facilities are on a six-monthly basis and, subject to compliance with the covenants, the facility remains 
committed until May 2016. As part of the secured financing arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, the bank has security over 
certain Group assets, including pledges over shares in certain subsidiaries.

Net investment in foreign operations
As part of our liability management, in order to provide a partial currency hedge against movements in the fair value of investments in 
overseas subsidiaries, we have made use of currency swaps to create synthetic currency hedges denominated in a mixture of currencies 
(USD, CAD, and EUR). At 31 December 2013, the Group had currency swaps in place, with a notional principal amount of £5.19 million 
(2012: £5.23 million) as synthetic loan hedges. The Group recognised a net gain on the hedging instrument of £0.13 million (2012: 
£0.14 million) in equity.

Trade creditors, other creditors and accruals and other taxes of £4.40 million (2012: £4.29 million) have been excluded from the above 
tables and are non-interest bearing.
Floating rate financial liabilities predominantly relate to bank loans in sterling, Canadian dollars, US dollars and euros. Some debt is 
denominated in currencies in order to provide a currency hedge for profits generated by overseas subsidiaries and the investments in 
those overseas net assets.
As at 31 December 2013 the Group had no material borrowings and therefore it has not assumed any risk sensitivity to reasonably 
possible changes in interest rates (with all other variables held constant) on the Group’s profit before tax through the impact of floating 
rate borrowings. The Group did not assume any risk sensitivity in 2012 as it had no borrowings.
Currency risk
The Group’s principal exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arises on the translation of overseas net assets and trading results into 
sterling for accounting purposes. The Group has a minimal transaction risk as most of the transactions are invoiced by the entities in 
their local currency. Where there are material exposures, these are covered by taking out currency contracts to eliminate the exposure. 
However, offsetting revenues against costs in the same currency reduces this risk so that only the residual accounting profit translation 
element is at risk. The balance sheet exposures are minimised by reducing the net asset exposure, for example, by arranging borrowings 
in local currency where appropriate. Where the resulting hedge qualifies for hedge accounting under IAS 39 the gains and losses on the 
translation of both the loan and the investment are deferred in equity. As the Group continues to grow and generates greater net profits 
overseas this exchange rate exposure will increase. Following the increase in the percentage of the Group’s operations that are overseas, 
the exposure to US dollars and euros in particular has increased. 
The table below shows the estimated sensitivity of the profit before tax and the net assets to movements in the key exchange rates to 
which the Group is exposed. If the US dollar and the euro strengthen/(weaken) against sterling this is expected to increase/(decrease) 
profits as shown below. 76

The main balance sheet translation exposure is to the revaluation of goodwill denominated in foreign currency; the largest component 
relates to the goodwill arising on the acquisition of FRI, a Canadian business, and is denominated in Canadian dollars. A depreciation of 
10% in sterling against the Canadian dollar would result in a £1.1 million increase in net assets and an appreciation of 10% in sterling 
against the Canadian dollar would result in a £1.1 million decrease in net assets.
The fair value of all financial assets and liabilities is approximately equal to book value. The Group has a forward foreign exchange 
facility which allows the Group to hedge foreign exchange exposures. The Group does not permit anyone in the Group to trade in 
financial instruments.
Counterparty credit risk
This is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due. Credit risks are associated with deposits with banks 
and receivables from customers. The Group takes into account the credit risk of the counterparty to any major bank deposits but 
currently the level of bank deposits is such that this is not considered a material risk. There is no large concentration of credit risk with 
customers as the largest customer group currently represents less than 6% of projected Group revenues. The maximum exposure to 
credit risk comprises the value of the Group’s cash and debtor balances from time to time.
Liquidity risk
This is the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds to meet its cash obligations when due. The Group manages this risk by close 
monitoring of projected cash collection from customers and cash obligations to suppliers and salary payments to staff, as well as all 
other cash commitments. At 31 December 2013, the Group also had £8.50 million headroom under its committed revolving credit and 
overdraft facility in addition to cash reserves to reduce the risk that an unforeseen change in the Group’s liquidity position will result in a 
breach of statutory or other payment obligations. 77

Capital risk
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain further 
development of the business. The Board monitors the composition of investors as well as the return on capital, measured as earnings 
per share (profit attributable to shareholders divided by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year). The 
capital managed by the Group comprises equity of £46.91 million (2012: £49.62 million) and borrowings of £12,000 (2012: £14,000) 
as capital. 79

The Company has only one class of Ordinary Shares in issue and there are no restrictions regarding voting or other distribution or 
repayment rights. At 31 December 2013 the Company held 225,000 shares in treasury (2012: 225,000), and therefore 67,478,650 
Ordinary Shares is the number of shares that may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by 
which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company 
under the FSA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules, and for earnings per share calculations. The share premium account has remained 
the same (2012: £23.47 million).

Share based payments
Under the approved and unapproved option schemes the Remuneration Committee can grant options to employees of the Group. 
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price which is typically issued at a premium to the market price. The contractual life is 
generally ten years from date of grant although occasionally a shorter period has been chosen. Options become exercisable after three 
years although exceptionally the period is shorter. Options issued to directors and senior executives carry performance criteria. There 
are other vesting conditions for options identified in the scheme rules, including performance conditions which are in the option terms 
with typically eps growth above a minimum hurdle, share price growth above a minimum level and a vesting period of three years. 
Options are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair market value after consideration of market based 
performance conditions has been estimated using the following key assumptions:

Fair value of options issued in year 12.36p 10.98p 11.37p 12.81p
The risk free rate is based on the yield to maturity of a UK government bond for a term consistent with the assumed life of the options. 
The average share price in the year was 86p. The expected volatility level was determined by comparing the historic and current 
volatility for the Company and comparing with the average volatility for companies in the same sector to determine a reasonable 
estimate for the future volatility. The total charge in the income statement for the year relating to employee share based payments for 
the Group was £192,000 (2012: credit of £159,000) and for the Company was £13,000 (2012: credit of £197,000).
There were 1,107,500 options exercisable at the balance sheet date (2012: 1,114,367), with a weighted average exercise price of 90p 
(2012: 90p). The weighted average remaining contractual life for options outstanding at the balance sheet date is 5.67 years 
(2012: 6.36 years).

25 Pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme for directors and certain employees. The total costs of pension 
contributions during the year were £446,000 (2012: £478,000). Contributions outstanding at the end of December 2013 were £27,000 
(2012: £26,000).
26 Contingent liabilities
As is normal for a group of our size and scope of operations, Group companies are involved in a number of potential legal claims 
and disputes from time to time arising from our activities, none of which are expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial results.
As noted in previous Annual Reports, the Group exercised its option to acquire a 49% non-controlling interest in SiSoft in June 2010 for 
an estimated contingent consideration of approximately £1.3 million. The vendors were disputing certain aspects of the valuation and 
the process has not been completed as originally expected and a legal process in the French Commercial Court is still ongoing. In 2013, 
we proposed an out-of-court settlement and the offer was accepted by 55% of the minority shareholders and as a result €1.16 million 
(£0.99 million) was paid out in July 2013. 
The Board expects the remaining contingent consideration payable to the 45% minority shareholder party (22% of total shares in SiSoft)  
to be in the range of €0.7 million – €1.1 million (approximately £0.6 million – £0.9 million) and has increased the provision by approximately 
€0.4 million (£0.35 million). It is possible that it will not be fully resolved during 2014. There is also a risk that the final consideration 
determined by the Court, including related costs, will be higher than the amount provided, although the Board’s estimate of the 
measurement of the liability has not changed (allowing for fluctuations in exchange rates – see note 16).
27 Capital commitments
At 31 December 2013, the Group had expenditure committed but not yet incurred of £0.46 million relating to leasehold improvements 
and furniture for our new London office. 86

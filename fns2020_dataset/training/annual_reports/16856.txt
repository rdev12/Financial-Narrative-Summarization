CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
2005/06 WAS ANOTHER RECORD YEAR FOR VT
GROUP WITH TURNOVER INCLUDING JOINT
VENTURES INCREASING BY 15% TO £847M 
(2005: £734M). PROFIT BEFORE TAX FROM
CONTINUING OPERATIONS IMPROVED BY 33% 
TO £55.5M (2005: £41.6M) WITH THE
CORRESPONDING EARNINGS PER SHARE 
ALSO IMPROVING BY 33% TO 24P (2005: 18P).
MICHAEL JEFFRIES CHAIRMAN
The board recommends a final dividend of 7.75 pence
per share giving a total dividend for the year of 10.75
pence per share, an increase of 10.3% over last year.
The strong performance and progress reported by the
group indicates the underlying strength of the company
and the commitment of our employees. 
Since taking over as chairman in July 2005, I have visited
many parts of the group and met a number of able and
impressive individuals. There is a clear understanding of
the direction in which VT is headed and an awareness 
of the focus and effort needed to realise our growth
objectives. As the group continues to grow and embrace
new challenges, it is important this focus is maintained.
The group has grown significantly over the last three
years. We are now bidding for and winning increasingly
large and more diverse contracts. Internal skills are
developing as expertise from across the group is required
to deliver effective services to our customers. This makes
for more streamlined working methods and common
objectives, both of which are fundamental to our
continued success. 
Our support services business has expanded significantly.
Revenues in our Education and Skills and Communication
businesses have grown to approaching £100m each and
in our US business to over $350m. Our customers now
include British Airways, the Metropolitan Police and
several regional Fire Authorities. 
Our support services business has performed well,
growing both organically and through acquisition. 
We completed two acquisitions in the year in the
Education and Skills division, underlining our strategy to
grow this business. Since the year end we have been
selected to progress the Greenwich Building Schools 
for the Future programme. This is a major step for VT 
and offers us potential for further wins.
Also after the year end we completed the acquisition of
four vehicle support services businesses from RAC plc
(part of Aviva plc) for a total cash consideration of £87m.
Together, the businesses had a turnover of £140m for 
the year ended 31 December 2005. Profit before interest
and tax was £10.3m with a total order book in excess of
£1.25 billion. These businesses provide a strong strategic
fit with our existing portfolio. 
Our shipbuilding business performed strongly and good
progress has been made on all key projects, including 
the Type 45 Destroyer, Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV)
(Helicopter) and the Super Vita Fast Attack Craft for 
the Royal Hellenic Navy.

KEY FIGURES
Chris Cundy has been appointed as Commercial Director
with responsibility for steering the company through an
intense negotiating period with a number of strategic
customers. We thank Chris for his dedication and skill
during his eight years as Finance Director. 
We have also strengthened the management teams in two
of our key businesses. Ken Smith has been appointed as
Chief Executive Officer of our US business and Simon
Withey, previously Group Business Development Director,
was appointed as Managing Director of VT Education
and Skills.
We have ambitious plans within VT Group and these
appointments reflect our commitment to those plans. 
A strong management team is crucial to the future
success of the group and we are confident that these
appointments, together with the existing management,
will achieve this.
I am delighted to be the Chairman of a group that has
such dedicated people and clear vision for the future. 
With these two key strengths, plus the recent achievements
in key areas of the business and the prospects outlined
within this report, there is every reason to remain confident
and optimistic about VT’s continuing success.
In April we were pleased to announce that VT has been
named preferred bidder for the supply of three OPVs 
to the Royal Navy of Oman. This extends the long and
successful relationship that we have had with Oman 
over the past 25 years. This additional work, together
with our work on the Type 45 Destroyer and the future
aircraft carriers (CVF) will ensure that our shipbuilding
division will be operating at a high level of activity for
several years to come.
During the year VT was confirmed as a full member 
of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA). We welcome 
the opportunity to work with the other members in
progressing the build of CVF for the Royal Navy. 
Peter McIntosh, former Managing Director VT Shipbuilding,
was seconded to the Alliance Management Team as
Chief Executive for this project. Geoff Smith has been
appointed as Managing Director VT Shipbuilding during
Peter’s secondment. Having spent more than 30 years
with the Dowty Group, where he was latterly Chief
Executive, Geoff’s background and experience is 
ideally suited to supporting our shipbuilding business
during this period. 
Chris Rickard’s appointment as Finance Director was
announced during the year. He joins the board on 1 July
2006. During the last five years Chris has been Finance
Director for Meggitt plc and most recently The Weir Group.

Business strategy and objectives
The board manages the group in order to achieve good
levels of growth in shareholder value on a consistent
long-term basis. The board, however, recognises that this
can only be achieved by providing a competitive and high
quality service to our customers and offering an attractive
working environment to our staff. 
Our group vision clearly outlines our aspirations and 
gives both our internal and external stakeholders an
understanding of what we are striving to achieve:
‘To be recognised as the number one international
government services group’
Underpinning this vision is a set of core values which
define the way we operate as an organisation:
Acquisitions and disposals
During the year the group has continued its strategy of
growing the Education and Skills division, including the
completion of two further business acquisitions in the
vocational training area. HCTC Limited was acquired 
on 6 January 2006 and Touchstone Learning and Skills
Limited was acquired on 3 February 2006. These
acquisitions broaden both the geographical and sector
coverage of the Group’s vocational training services. 
On 8 December 2005, the group acquired the 40%
minority shareholding of ManTech Inc. in Vosper 
ManTech Limited, consolidating its provision of services 
in government communications. 
After the year end the group strengthened its portfolio 
of support services with the acquisition of four vehicle
support businesses from RAC plc on 27 April 2006. 
The businesses comprise Lex Transfleet Limited, 
Lex Defence Limited, Lex Defence Management Limited
and RAC Software Solutions. The activities of these
businesses include fleet management and logistics,
vehicle provision and disposal, software and support 
and asset finance. 
In line with the group’s policy of dispensing with non-core
businesses, the sale of VT TSS Limited was completed in
June 2005. VT TSS Limited was the last remaining part of
the group’s marine controls business (reported within the
shipbuilding division).

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
NATURE, OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES CONTINUED
CURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE
BUSINESS DIVISION OPERATING REVIEW
CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND TREASURY
RESOURCES, RISKS AND RELATIONSHIPS
Meeting these objectives is key to achieving the financial
and non-financial measures that increase shareholder value.
Over the past three years we have pursued a consistent
strategy. This falls under four main headings and progress
on each is set out below:
1 To maximise our market share as the leading UK
Defence Support Services company.
We anticipate that the UK Support Services defence
market will start to flatten out after the next four to five
years, following the award of pending major PFI/PPP
projects. We are currently targeting three major
programmes:
a)  Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) where we
have been named preferred bidder (as part of the
AirTanker consortium);
b)  Defence Training Rationalisation (DTR) where our
bid was submitted in October 2005; and 
The quality of our people
directly contributes to
business success. 
We must demonstrate our
commitment to them by
enabling them to release
their full potential and
achieve their goals. We
achieve this by:
• Valuing contribution and
teamwork
• Effective communication
• Empowering people
• Demonstrating
commitment to personal
development
• Sharing the success
VT is recognised as a
trusted and reliable partner
that can deliver the
specified requirement on
time and to budget. 
We will continue to do 
this and further that
recognition by:
• Developing and
maintaining positive
relationships
• Listening to and
understanding the needs
of customers and
suppliers
• Encouraging openness
and honesty
• Promoting teamwork
• Sharing the success
We must ensure we
continue to deliver
excellence to both our
internal and external
customers. We achieve
this by:
• Adopting a ‘can do – will
do’ approach
• Being results focused
• Encouraging and
demonstrating
innovation and creativity
• Demonstrating integrity
• Delivering the
requirements

c)  Military Flying Training System (MFTS) where our
bid was submitted in August 2005.
These are the major programmes in the 
Military Training and Support Services areas and
alongside award of these projects, we see a period 
of consolidation.
2 To diversify our business by growing our involvement
with other UK government agencies.
Historically we have been reliant on the Ministry of
Defence and our strategy has been to target related
government agencies. In particular:
• Our target to grow our Education and Skills
business to over £150m in the medium term has
been aided by two acquisitions in the period to help
consolidate the vocational training services and has
resulted in a business with annual revenues now
approaching £100m.
• The extension of the BBC World Service contract
and the acquisition of the minority interest in Vosper
ManTech provides the critical communications
business with confirmed revenues of close to
£100m per annum for the next five years.
3 To develop our US Services business to limit our
reliance on UK government revenues.
In 2001 we acquired Griffin Services Inc. a base
operations business with revenues of $70m with the
aim of growing a business independent of the UK
government. Our strategic targets are:
• To grow the base operations business to $500m 
in the medium term – against which we now have 
a run rate of $360m, a 57% increase year on year.
• To improve the margins in the business, given the
restriction of the current cost plus environment –
margins are increasing towards 3%.
• To expand the business to related customers. 
The acquisition of the Cube Corporation, Inc. 
in March 2005 provided a direct relationship with
NASA as well as opening up the adjacent market
sectors of training and logistics.

the Learning and
Skills Council.
Recent acquisitions
have confirmed
VT's commitment
to the education
sector.
C
4 To develop alliances with other defence companies 
to increase our involvement in large equipment
programmes.
We have been actively involved in developing alliances
with other contractors during the year:
• We became a full member of the Aircraft Carrier
Alliance in January 2006 and have an ambition to
gain over 20% of the production workshare on 
the programme;
• Signature of a partnering agreement with Lockheed
Martin to cover worldwide flying training; and
• FSTA, where we have joined EADS, Thales, Rolls-
Royce and Cobham as partners on this programme.
The board remains committed to this strategy and
confident in its success.
Strategy
VT has pursued this consistent strategy to build the
business and has made great progress so far. We have
achieved well above double digit increases in
performance in terms of revenues, profit before taxation
and earnings per share. Our focus going forward will
remain to win a major share of the UK defence projects,
grow our non-defence related support services activities
and to further penetrate the US market.
In addition, we have carried out a review of other
government markets in which our skills in PFI, long term
contract management, partnering relationships and
through life logistics support are a key requirement.
This has culminated in VT bidding, with experienced
partners, in the waste management market for a 
recycling project in Wakefield.
VT announced on 10 May that exploratory discussions
with BAE Systems for a possible joint offer for Babcock
International Group plc had ceased. Regardless of this,
VT will continue to consider alternative options to
restructure the UK naval surface ship sector, in line 
with the government’s policy set out in the Defence White
Paper published in December 2005, with a clear focus on
maximising value for its shareholders.

BUSINESS DIVISION OPERATING REVIEW

Outlook and future development
Through organic growth and a focused acquisition 
policy, we have grown our Support Services businesses
significantly. Revenues in our Education and Skills and
Communications businesses have grown to approaching
£100m each and in our US business to over US$350m.
The recent £87m acquisition of the Lex businesses not
only provides a strong strategic fit with our existing
defence support services and relationship with the MoD,
but also brings into the fold new services – such as
logistics services for non-military applications, including
the Metropolitan Police and British Airways. 
The increased breadth of our support services business
model, strong trading conditions in our shipbuilding
business and, following the acquisition of Lex Defence in
April 2006, an order book close to £3.6 billion, provides
us with excellent visibility of earnings and confidence for
the current year and beyond.
Our growth over recent years has been impressive and
provides a sound platform from which to build. We are
determined to continue our success and to make
investment to ensure the long-term profitability of the group.
Our overall growth strategy remains focused on our
target markets of Defence, Education and Skills and 
the US. With a stronger organisational structure and
strengthened management the group is well positioned 
to continue this growth.
Our forward order books are strong and we anticipate
that the coming year will continue to provide growth for
VT Group.
Business KPIs
The board has assessed that the following KPIs are the
most effective measures of progress towards achieving
the group’s strategies and as such towards fulfilling the
group’s objectives. 
• Profit before taxation, intangible amortisation and
exceptional items;
• Order intake level;
• Cash generation from operating activities;
• Underlying earnings per share.
Business development and performance
The following discussion of the group’s performance is
conducted wholly in the context of financial performance
as measured under International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS). The effect of the group’s conversion to
IFRS has already been communicated to shareholders in
our statement in September 2005 and the reconciliations
and accompanying narrative explaining the restatement of
the UK GAAP financial statements for 2004 are given in
note 39 to these financial statements.
As we explained in our September statement, the
fundamentals of the group’s business and the actions
required of management to maintain and improve
shareholder value are unaltered by the change in
accounting regime.
Under IFRS the results of discontinued operations 
are disclosed as a single line item at the foot of the
income statement.
Revenue growth in the business has continued with
group sales, excluding disposals, up by 15% to £847m.
Excluding the effects of acquisitions (including the Cube
Corporation) revenue grew by 8.2%.
Profit before taxation on continuing activities has
increased by 33% to £55.5m (2005: £41.6m).
Net interest payable has increased to £7.0m (2005: £5.3m)
as a result of higher levels of debt during the year.

STRENGTHENING OUR SUPPORT TO THE UK MILITARY
C
The group uses underlying profit before taxation (ie profit
before taxation, before amortisation of intangibles and JV
taxation) as a key measure of performance. The increase
year on year was 34%. 
The effective tax rate on reported profit before taxation
from continuing activities is 23.6% (2005: 22.5%). If the
IFRS presentation relating to taxation on joint venture
profits was shown as taxation rather than share of post
tax earnings of joint ventures, the effective rate would
have been 29.3% (2005: 29.5%). 
Profit of £0.1m (2005: £0.8m) was derived from the
discontinued business, VT TSS Limited which, being a
non-core business, was sold during the year. 
Earnings per share before impairment charges,
amortisation of intangibles arising from acquisitions and
exceptional items were 24.89p (2005: 18.51p) an
increase of 34%.
The proposed final dividend of 7.75p per share, coupled
with the interim dividend of 3p per share paid in January
2006, gives a cumulative dividend for 2006 of 10.75p
(2005: 9.75p), an increase of 10.3% on the prior year.
The total dividend is covered 2.3 times by earnings
before intangible amortisation and exceptional items
(2005: 1.9 times). 
As part of a restructuring of its PFI debt, the OPV PFI
contract was refinanced in March 2006, resulting in 
on-balance sheet PFI debt being reduced by £51m. 
In addition, certain VT Communications assets were
disposed of under an asset-backed finance scheme 
with the result that £48m of short term debt was repaid.
Overall, the group’s net debt position at 31 March 2006
was £15.2m (2005: £66.1m).
Cashflow
Operating cashflow, before exceptional items, 
was £64.1m (2005: £52.0m) which converts 102%
(2005: 111%) of group operating profit into cash.
The group is improving its ability to generate cash within
the business and continues to improve its measures of
cash generation and collection.
The net cash inflow from investing activities of £24.0m
(2005: outflow of £29.5m) was largely caused by the 
sale and leaseback of three OPVs offset by business
acquisition activity.
The £15.4m net change in cash flows from financing
activities is due to increased borrowing levels during 
the year.
The overall result is a net increase in cash and cash
equivalents of £72.1m (2005: net reduction of £14.6m).

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
NATURE, OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES
CURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE CONTINUED
BUSINESS DIVISION OPERATING REVIEW
CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND TREASURY
RESOURCES, RISKS AND RELATIONSHIPS
Net debt at 31 March 2006 was £15.2m (2005: £66.1m)
and can be analysed as follows:
Non-recourse debt is excluded from the group’s banking
facility financial covenants but is presented as a liability in
the group’s balance sheet.
Pensions
VT Group has five pension schemes accounted for as
defined benefit pension schemes, with deficits, net of
related deferred tax assets, of £43.6m (2005: £43.2m)
included within the group balance sheet. The increase 
in the year is due to changes in actuarial assumptions
applied, predominately a decrease in the discount rate 
to calculate scheme liabilities, which is driven by general
bond market activity outside of the group’s control.
A review has been carried out of the group’s main
pension scheme with a number of changes made to
retirement arrangements, mortality assumptions and
company and employee contribution rates. This has
resulted in additional employer pension cash contributions
of £5.1m compared with the previous year.
Critical accounting policies
The group’s main accounting policies affecting its 
results are set out on pages 72 to 79. Judgements and
assumptions have been required by management in
applying the group’s accounting policies in certain areas.
Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated
using these judgements and assumptions. 
The following policies are considered to be the group’s
critical accounting policies as the judgements and
assumptions made could have significant impact on 
its results and financial condition.
Retirement benefits
Accounting for pensions and other post-retirement
benefits involves judgement about certain events,
including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at
retirement, mortality rates, rates of return on assets 
and determination of discount rates for measuring plan
obligations. Determination of the projected benefit
obligations for the group’s defined benefit pension plans
impacts on the recorded amounts for such obligations on
the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense
in the income statement. The assumptions used may
vary from year to year, which will affect future results. 
Any differences between these assumptions and the
actual outcome also affect future results.
Pension benefit assumptions are discussed and 
agreed with independent actuaries in March each year.
These assumptions are used to determine the projected
benefit obligation at the year end and hence the deficits
recorded on the group’s balance sheet and pension
expense for the following year.
Taxation
Provisions for tax contingencies require management to
make judgements and estimates in relation to tax issues
and exposures. Amounts provided are based on
management’s interpretation of country specific law and
the likelihood of settlement. Tax benefits are not recognised
unless it is probable that the tax position will be sustained.

The group uses the present value of future cash flows 
to determine implied fair value. In calculating the implied
fair value, significant management judgement is required
in forecasting cash flows of the reporting unit, in
estimating terminal growth values and in selecting an
appropriate discount rate. If alternative management
judgements were adopted then different impairment
outcomes could result. No impairment resulted from 
the annual impairment test in 2006.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
The group has capitalised goodwill included on the
balance sheet of £170m at 31 March 2006. Goodwill 
is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the
occurrence of events indicate potential impairment exists.

VT Communications’ order book benefited in the year by 
the continuation of the BBC World Service contract
through to 2012. Together with other major contracts 
at GCHQ and for the MoD, this now gives a strong 
base workload for the next six years. 
Our international broadcast business is benefiting from
the technological challenges affecting broadcasters 
with the advent of digitalisation. We are currently in
discussions with several international broadcasters
regarding both analogue and, more importantly, 
digital broadcast services. 
Our communications contract with the Defence
Procurement Agency, the £200m Defence High
Frequency Communications Service contract, 
continues to progress well and we are exceeding the
service levels set down in the contract. This contract
remains on track to meet the capability upgrade
programme schedule and is successfully delivering
enhanced service and capability to end users. We are
building on this UK platform and now have military
contracts in Europe and the USA.
In December 2005 we purchased the remaining 40%
shareholding in Vosper ManTech from ManTech Inc.
This business supplies information and communication
technology services for the security service market in the
UK, an area which continues to benefit from government
focus on homeland defence.

Our Contractor Logistic Support operations continue 
to perform well with good customer feedback on the
performance of both the Survey Vessel and River Class
(OPV) contracts. Service availability has remained in
excess of 97% for all vessels, exceeding the contracted
days specified by the customer. A similar service will
commence later in 2006 for the OPV(H) and a number 
of navies around the world continue to show interest in
this type of arrangement.
VT Naval Support was awarded a three year follow-on
contract to provide configuration management services
for the Royal Navy’s surface fleet. 
Following the selection of VT Shipbuilding as preferred
bidder for the Oman Ocean Patrol Vessel programme, 
VT Naval Support will provide initial logistics support,
including the provision of technical documentation and
spares to support the vessels. 
VT Emergency Services commenced operation of its
second Fire and Rescue Training Centre under a 25 year
PFI arrangement in October 2005. The centre, built in
Cardiff, is run under a contract with the South Wales 
Fire Authority, with VT responsible for the design, build,
maintenance and operation of the facility. This addition,
coupled with the existing similar contract with the
Somerset, Avon and Gloucester Fire Authority will see
some 25,000 student days of training provided per
annum. VT Emergency Services also secured a three year
extension to its contract with the Environment Agency
to provide crew and contractor logistic support to four
vessels undertaking coastal survey work.
VT Land extended its contracts at the Bordon and

Following the AirTanker flight refuelling consortium being
appointed preferred bidder in March 2005, we continue
to work with our partners in progressing this complex 
PFI project. We expect financial close on the project to
be achieved by the end of 2006. VT will be responsible
for the provision of a range of supporting services which
are expected to be worth approximately £150m in the
early years of the programme.
VT Defence has submitted a bid for the UK Military 
Flying Training System (UKMFTS) in a joint venture with
Lockheed Martin known as Ascent. This is an opportunity
to work with the MoD as Training System Partner to take
responsibility for the design, implementation, integration
and ongoing development of a replacement training
system. MoD are expected to announce the preferred
bidder at the end of 2006. VT Aerospace and Lockheed
Martin have capitalised on their strong relationship
created by joint bidding for UKMFTS and have entered
into an agreement to pursue opportunities to deliver and
support military flying training worldwide.
VT has played a leading role in the MC3 consortium, 
with BAE Systems and Carillion, in bidding for the
Defence Training Rationalisation project (DTR). 
This is an opportunity to rationalise Armed Forces
training, with VT building on its extensive experience 
with Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and
Flagship Training. The technical bid has been 
submitted and MoD is expected to announce the
preferred bidder in October 2006.
In our two joint ventures, Fleet Support continues to provide
a range of services including ship repair, integrated ship
support, facilities management, engineering services and
logistics support. The company has had a mixed year
with lower profits reported on ship repairs as a direct
result of increased competition for this type of work.
However, profits have increased from other business
areas during the year. Contract wins on HMS Richmond
and regeneration work on three Type 23 frigates for the
Chilean Navy will provide a core workload for the next
two years. 
Our other joint venture, Flagship Training, the Royal
Navy’s key training partner, has achieved a more cost
effective and co-ordinated service under its core contract
with the Navy Training Command following the transfer of
further activity by the Navy to this business. In September
2005 training commenced for Network Rail, with 200
students beginning their apprenticeships. Training
contracts were secured with the Chilean Navy and
through the Maritime Composite Training Service project.
The company also increased its facilities management
and construction interests through securing first-time
contracts with tri-service and non-military customers.
2006/07 provides the potential for further growth and
diversification in VT Defence with particular focus on 
the DTR PFI project.

In May 2006 VT was selected for the Greenwich BSF
programme and we expect to be confirmed as the
Strategic Partnering Organisation during the financial year.
The programme will cover three waves of secondary
school regeneration to include the complete stock of 
13 secondary schools, with a capital value in excess of
£290 million for the three waves.
Also on BSF, we have been short-listed on the 
Lewisham schools programme through Learning21, 
our joint venture with Costain, where preferred bidder
announcement is expected in late 2006. In addition 
we are reviewing and identifying future phases of 
projects to bid for other opportunities.
In January 2006 we completed the acquisition of HCTC
Limited, for a consideration of £10m and in February
2006 we completed the acquisition of Touchstone
Learning and Skills Limited for £12m. These acquisitions
contributed £4.4m turnover and £0.1m operating profit
during the year and increase both our overall service
offering and geographical coverage across England,
Scotland and Wales in the vocational training arena. 
Our vocational training business now has approximately
20,000 learners across the hospitality, care, sport, 
retail and engineering sectors and continues to grow 
both organically and from the two acquisitions made in
the year. VT is now the largest provider of work-based
vocational training assessment to the Learning and Skills
Council (LSC). Our key deliverables of learner completion
and success rates continue to improve and, as the
market consolidates, we continue to explore
opportunities to extend the business into additional
sectors and geographical areas.

We welcomed the invitation to become a full member 
of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA) with MoD, BAE
Systems, Thales, KBR and Babcock in December 2005,
providing the group a key role in the programme to 
build two new aircraft carriers (CVF) for the Royal Navy.
The award of the Demonstration Phase contract has
started significant design activity across the alliance
including a team at Portsmouth. The allocation of a
superblock of the carriers to VT underlines the significant
contribution the business intends to make to the project.
We were announced as preferred bidder for Ocean Patrol
Vessels for the Royal Navy of Oman and will now enter
detailed contract discussions. This c£400m contract 
is for three 97.5 metre vessels to be designed and built in
Portsmouth. This significant contract was won against
international competition and combined with the CVF
project will provide a secure workload for the future. 
We are pursuing a number of additional export
opportunities in the short term in Trinidad & Tobago,
Greece and elsewhere in the medium term. In Trinidad &
Tobago an announcement on preferred bidder status is
awaited later in the year. 
Despite difficult conditions in the small boat market, 
VT Halmatic has maintained its position as the major

CURRENT AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE
BUSINESS DIVISION OPERATING REVIEW
CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND TREASURY
RESOURCES, RISKS AND RELATIONSHIPS
The acquisition of Touchstone Limited was funded by the
issue of £11.2m of floating rate loan notes, repayable in
instalments to 12 April 2007. The acquisition of HCTC
Limited was funded entirely from the group’s cash
resources.
Treasury policies
The group’s treasury function is responsible for managing
the group’s exposure to finance risks and operates in 
line with policies set by the board. The primary objectives
are to:
• Manage interest rate and foreign currency exposure
• Provide cash management
• Ensure the availability of cost-effective facilities to
finance new investment, working capital and
guarantees.
The board has a conservative policy towards the
investment of cash. Treasury instruments are used only 
to reduce risk. Speculation is not permitted.
The group finances its activities with a combination 
of bank loans, loan notes, finance leases and cash. 
Other financial assets and liabilities, such as trade
debtors and trade creditors, arise directly from the
group’s operating activities. The group also enters into
derivative transactions, including principally interest rate
swaps and foreign currency contracts. The purpose is to
manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from
the group’s operations and its sources of finance.
The main risks associated with the group’s financial
assets and liabilities are set out below, together with the
policies agreed by the board for their management. 
Foreign currency risk
The group has invested in operations outside the 
United Kingdom and also buys and sells goods and
services denominated in currencies other than sterling. 
As a result the value of the group’s non-sterling revenues,
purchases, financial assets and liabilities and cash flows
can be affected significantly by movements in exchange
rates, particularly in the US Dollar and Euro.
VT Group policy is to finance, so far as practicable, 
the costs of acquisition and new business opportunities
by matching borrowings in the local currency in order 
to eliminate foreign exchange transaction exposure,
provided that the benefits are not outweighed by the
overall cost of the borrowing.
The group’s transactional currency exposure arises 
from sales or purchases by certain operating units in
currencies other than its functional currency. It is the
group’s policy not to enter into forward contracts for
purchases until there is a high degree of certainty. 
In addition, the group treasury policy is to hedge if 
and when a significant exposure is recognised, 
through the use of foreign exchange instruments to
manage the currency exposures on any individual
transactions for which payment is anticipated.
Interest rate risk
The group’s policy is to manage its cost of borrowing
using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Whilst fixed
rate interest bearing debt is not exposed to cash flow
interest rate risk, there is no opportunity for the group to
enjoy a reduction in borrowing costs in markets where
rates are falling. In addition, the fair value risk inherent in
fixed rate borrowing means that the group is exposed to
unplanned costs should debt be restructured or repaid
early. In contrast, whilst floating rate borrowings are not
exposed to changes in fair value, the group is exposed 
to cash flow risk as costs increase if market rates rise.
VT Group has no absolute policy towards either fixed 
rate finance or floating rate finance. The proportion of
interest rate exposure that should be fixed and the
proportion that should be floating will be dictated by 
the nature and terms of the underlying asset(s) and
contract(s) being funded. The exact proportion will be
determined by current economic conditions, the currency
in which the debt is denominated and the purposes and
duration of the debt.
The group does use interest rate swaps agreed with
other parties to generate the desired interest profile,
agreeing to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference
between fixed rate and variable interest amounts calculated
by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal. At the
year end, 19% (2005: 70%) of the group’s borrowings
were at fixed rates after taking account of interest 
rate swaps.

C
Credit risk
The risk of financial loss due to a counterparty’s failure 
to honour its obligations arises principally in relation to
transactions where the group provides goods and
services on deferred terms, enters into derivative
contracts requiring settlement by the other party 
and invests or deposits surplus cash.
Group policies are aimed at minimising such losses, 
and require that deferred terms are granted only to
customers who demonstrate an appropriate payment
history and satisfy creditworthiness procedures. 
Individual exposures are monitored with customers
subject to credit limits to ensure that the group’s
exposure to bad debts is not significant.
Group policies also restrict the counterparties with which
derivative transactions can be contracted and funds may
be invested to those approved by the treasury team and
by the board, comprising banks and financial institutions
with a high credit rating. The treasury team ensures that
exposure is spread across a number of approved
financial institutions.

Liquidity risk
The group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing
cash generation by its operations, applying cash
collection targets throughout the group. Investment is
carefully controlled, with authorisation limits operating 
up to group board level.
In its funding strategy, the group’s objective is to maintain
a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility
through the use of overdrafts, bank loans, loan notes 
and finance leases. To meet this objective, the group’s
policy is to ensure that adequate unutilised committed
funding facilities are available to cover authorised capital
expenditure commitments and debt due for repayment
within one year.
Surplus cash is only invested in high credit rated financial
institutions and in financial instruments exposed to
insignificant risk of changes in market value, with not 
less than 50% of surplus funds available invested with
maturities of three months or less. Funds may not be
invested for periods of greater than one year.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is only invested 
in financial instruments exposed to insignificant risk of
changes in market value, being placed on interest-
bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than 
six months. Short term flexibility is achieved by 
overdraft facilities. 
Price risk
It is, and has been throughout the period under review,
the group’s policy that no trading in derivative financial
instruments shall be undertaken.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND TREASURY
RESOURCES, RISKS AND RELATIONSHIPS
Resources
The group aims to safeguard the assets that give it
competitive advantage, being its reputation for quality
and reliability, its intellectual capital and its people.
Reputation
Codes of conduct operate across the group to provide 
a framework for responsible innovative and ethical 
yet commercial business practices. Structures for
accountability through operating units to managing
directors and from them to the group board are 
clearly defined.
Employees
Information about our people is provided in the Corporate
Responsibility report on pages 30 to 49.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The board is committed to ensuring that high quality 
risk management systems are in place across the 
group. The objective is to safeguard the interests of
shareholders, customers and staff through effective
management of corporate and operational risk.
Management throughout the group uses a common
framework to identify and assess the impact of risks 
to their businesses. For each risk the likelihood and
consequence are identified, management controls and
frequency of monitoring are confirmed and results reported.
The group has produced risk registers for each division and
will use risk scores and software as part of its risk
management process. Action plans have been developed
for key risks.
The group’s business is susceptible to changes in
government policy, budget allocations and the changing
political environment, both in the UK and worldwide. 
The group has sought to mitigate this risk in recent years
by diversifying the service offering from a largely UK
based defence orientated business to provision of a
broader range of services on an international basis. 
The group is involved with complex long-term contracts
which exposes it to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
The group has in place robust contract approval and
management processes in order to identify and manage
those risks.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable
expectation that the group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
The operating and financial review and certain other
sections of this annual report contain forward looking
statements that are subject to risk factors associated
with, amongst other things, the economic and business
circumstances occurring from time to time in the
countries and sectors in which the group operates. 
It is believed that the expectations reflected in these
statements are reasonable but they may be affected by a
wide range of variables which could cause actual results
to differ materially from those currently anticipated.

VT recognises its obligations and takes responsibility for
the wider impacts of our operations on society. Part of
delivering that responsibility is open communication and
this year we have widened the scope of our reporting on
Corporate Responsibility (CR).
A major part of VT’s operations has connections with 
the defence industry. We recognise that this places an
ethical responsibility on the group to ensure that in all our
dealings we not only meet legal requirements but ensure
our own internal values are not compromised. In 2005 
we introduced a new suite of policies to assist us in
addressing these issues.
Last year also saw continued focus on health and 
safety including the alignment of our operations with
detailed management requirements and expectations.
Next year we will further consolidate our health and 
safety governance processes and focus on delivering
improvements around specific areas supporting 
our overall group visions and values.
Our employee feedback is very positive on the action
programme to deliver our values. I am very encouraged 
by this progress and by the openness of the culture 
within the group. 
The excellent financial results in this report have their roots
in outstanding performance by the individuals who make
up the group, all of whom we thank for their efforts. We
will continue to ensure sharing in success through the
development and tailoring of our reward programmes.
Making CR part of the way we do business requires
focus and resource and 2006 saw the appointment of
Barbara Harrison as Director for Health, Safety and
Environment to lead our efforts in this field. As well 
as improving governance, we are giving priority to
quantifying our environmental aspects and impacts and
to the robustness of our data collection processes. 
Also next year we will be re-affirming CR on the boardroom
agenda and further developing our supporting polices
and frameworks. The engagement of our stakeholders in
identifying the issues that really matter and the development
of our CR strategic plan will be paramount.

About this Corporate Responsibility report
The period covered by this report is the 12 months to
March 2006. The framework of the Global Reporting
Initiative (GRI) has guided the scope and content of 
this 2005/06 CR report. In developing our reporting
incrementally, we are focussing on those areas of
greatest importance to our stakeholders, giving particular
consideration to our employees. The detailed content 
of the report this year has a focus on our UK operations
and has only limited coverage of our joint ventures. 
Our future CR reports will be guided by feedback from all
of our stakeholders and by our business strategy and will
also better cover the full scope of our operations.
Understanding the wishes of our stakeholders
In the Marketplace and Workplace sections of this report,
we describe our approach to listening to, and partnering
with, our customers, suppliers and our employees.
Institutional shareholders 
The company is required to have a dialogue with
shareholders and it adopts a pro-active approach to its
major institutional shareholders, both current and
prospective. Regular visits are made to institutions’
offices and there are frequent reciprocal visits to the
group’s premises. Comment and opinion from
shareholders and their representatives is regularly
provided to directors. The Chairman visited major
shareholders during the year.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director communicate
with institutional investors through analysts’ briefings and
investor meetings as well as making timely stock
exchange announcements. 
Private shareholders 
As a result of the company’s evolution many private
shareholders are also current or former employees. 
The company wishes to encourage employee
shareholding and the board committed the company to
providing employees with a Share Incentive Plan, which
was launched in June 2005. The annual general meeting
will again be held in the Southampton area as this is
convenient for a significant number of employee
shareholders. They are actively encouraged to attend the
AGM. The company recognises that communication with
its smaller shareholders and those without internet
access is less than perfect and will strive to improve this
in the future. For those with internet access the company
can be contacted through links on its website.
The AGM 
All directors normally attend the AGM and shareholders
are invited to ask questions during the meeting and to
meet the directors informally afterwards.
The results of votes on all resolutions put to the AGM 
will be available on the company’s website, together with
details of proxy votes cast for each resolution, whether or
not a poll is demanded.

DEMONSTRATING INTEGRITY
Our Trading Ethics
In the past year we have further developed our 
Anti-Corruption Policy, including our policy on the
appointment of international agents and our Code 
of Ethics and Conduct. We are carrying out training
throughout the group, both to clarify the group’s
approach to ethical trading and to ensure support 
and assistance to our employees in the field. 
Corruption 
Corruption is illegal and highly damaging to societies 
and to businesses. VT’s policy states, in simple terms,
what we all believe to be right – that corruption will not
be tolerated. No other policy or business target of the
group takes precedence over this rule. 
To this end we ensure clear guidance is available on 
the management of agents and consultants. We keep 
a record of payments made by the company; we operate
a Whistleblowers line with direct access to the Audit
Committee/CEO and full support to employees reporting
their legitimate concerns – even if such concerns turn out
to be groundless.
Gifts to employees are subject to a strict code for
declaration, as are entertainment and hospitality. 
The VT Group does not make political donations. 
Our charitable donations are carried out as an integral
part of our community relations policies, donations 
are approved via the group charity committee and a
record kept of all monies disbursed. 
Export Control Compliance 
The group ensures that, as appropriate, it respects the
export controls of the UK Government, the European
Community, the US Government and any other relevant
national control. 
The VT Group believes that it is in the interests of us all
that the controls are effective and that full compliance 
is essential. Each business has responsibility for
implementing export controls, we ensure that information
is kept current, that employees are appropriately trained
and that each operating business has internal compliance
procedures. We are routinely audited by the DTI’s export
control compliance unit.
Detailed reporting on Corporate Governance is on 
pages 54 to 57.

Our financial performance data and business reviews are

Understanding the needs of Customers
Throughout the group we have procedures in place to
actively monitor levels of customer satisfaction and
ensure that communication channels are effective. 
All feedback received from customers is used to
understand and respond better to our customers 
and to shape the way we work. 
Understanding the needs of our Suppliers
VT Group understands that its own quality of delivery
depends on its total supply chain and has continued to
develop the scope and depth of supplier partnerships.
In sourcing services and materials, the group expects its
suppliers’ policies and behaviours to be in accordance
with the group’s values. During 2006, as strategic supply
chain management further develops within the group, key
issues relating to corporate responsibility will be identified
and appropriate group requirements incorporated into the
supply chain improvement plan.
Our standard terms of payment are within 45 days of 
the end of the month in which we receive the goods 
or services. 
The group recognises the importance of small suppliers
and supply from within our local communities. We realise
that cash-flow is crucial for small businesses.
ONE OF THE GROUP’S CORE VALUES IS ‘PARTNERING WITH CUSTOMERS AND
SUPPLIERS’. WE DEMONSTRATE THIS THROUGH DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING
POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND BY LISTENING TO AND
UNDERSTANDING THEIR NEEDS, VALUES AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS.

Charter Mark is the UK
Government’s national standard
for excellence in customer
service and is a very challenging
one to meet. For VT Four S, 
our joint operation with Surrey County
Council, achieving Charter Mark is seen 
as another driver to ensure excellence in
customer service. 
Preparations for assessment began over 
18 months ago and involved people at every
level of the organisation. The assessment
recognised the strength of the Four S
service as anticipating and meeting partners’
and stakeholders’ needs. Gaining Charter

Through these workshops we intend to drive
cost out  of the business and ensure that we
work as a seamless team with our suppliers
to mutual benefit.
The Environment Agency’s National Marine
Monitoring Team is responsible for continuously
evaluating the health of Britain’s coastal
waters. Over the last 7 years the VT Group
has been contracted to operate and crew the
Environment Agency's four purpose built
coastal survey vessels.
Roger Proudfoot, the Environment Agency’s
contract manager said: 
“VT have contributed to the assessment of
the state of our estuaries and coastal waters 
through environmental monitoring and help
to chart improvements to pollution control
and highlight continuing problems such as
nutrient enrichment.”
“The crews of the boats have been doing an
excellent job in a tough working environment.”

ENVIRONMENT
A significant proportion of our workforce has transferred
from the government sector into the group. This clearly
has an impact on our working environment. Human
Resources is committed to helping them adapt and
perform in a commercial culture. In this diverse and
evolving business the vision and the values are the
essential glue that aligns us behind our common purpose.
We have not performed as well as we would like in the
collection of consistent data from business units so this
year we want to improve our HR reporting across the
group. Likewise in our community work we are
sometimes unaware of the very good work going on in
the business units particularly with schools and young
adults. We intend therefore at group level to improve our
understanding and support of these important initiatives.
This year in the workplace we have a number of
programmes to support our people. These include
management development opportunities, in-house
coaching and success planning to implement our 
talent management programme.
Diversity and Equality 
The group believes in continuously developing a culture
that works to eliminate prejudices and actively encourages
a positive approach to all sectors of the community.
During the last year we have introduced HR information
technology software to enable improved central monitoring
and reporting of diversity and equality.
Data gathering and use of the software is still being
embedded within the businesses but we are reporting
some initial baseline data this year.
VT values the diversity of skills and experience available
across the breadth of its workforce and remains
committed to ensuring that its own policies and
procedures provide equal treatment to all in terms 
of recruitment and employment of staff, the provision 
of training and in working with partner organisations.
Unsurprisingly, our Education sector has a considerably
higher proportion of female employees than the
engineering based sectors of Defence and Shipbuilding. 
The businesses provide positive assistance to workers to
remove disability barriers, whether by modifying the physical
environment of the work processes/locations, or by adapting
hardware/software as required. This includes assistance for
workers to return to work after periods of sickness absence.
We are also encouraging our older, more experienced,
employees to remain active within the group.
WE HAVE WORKED HARD THIS YEAR ON
PROGRAMMES TO UNDERPIN OUR KEY PEOPLE
VALUES, FOCUSING ON COMMUNICATION AND
BUILDING THE SKILLS WITHIN OUR WORKFORCE.

A multi-channel communications approach with feedback
is actively promoted at all levels. Innovative communication
streams have emerged, with VT Communications
initiating a “Back to the Floor” programme where each
member of the management team spends two days
working within a site or department to gain a grass 
roots understanding.
An externally managed confidential Employee Assistance
Programme via a freephone helpline is available to all
employees – and has been extended to employees’
families in some areas. The assistance programme 
offers counselling and advice over a wide range of 
areas, including personal financial/legal problems and
personal/family stresses. In all, nearly 200 calls were
taken by the helpline in the last 12 months and about 
one third of the callers took advantage of onward 
referral for 1:1 counselling. Employee feedback on 
the Assistance Programme has been very positive. 
The helpline is also available (and has been used) for
whistleblowing should employees feel they wish to
maintain anonymity in bringing serious concerns to 
the attention of the group. 
The VT Group operating companies have constructive
dialogue with the unions which represent our employees.
We regard the continued development of our partnership
with the unions as essential to the strength of the business.
COMMUNICATION IS CENTRAL TO THE GROUP’S CONTINUING DRIVE TOWARDS
ACHIEVEMENT BY THE ENGAGEMENT OF ALL EMPLOYEES. MANY HAVE
RECENTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE FOCUS GROUP EVALUATION OF HOW THE

VT DEFENCE VT SHIPBUILDING VT EDUCATION & SKILLS
VTES acquired HCTC and
Touchstone in 2006. As a first
step towards integrating these
companies into VT Education 
and Skills, the managing director
hosted ten national roadshows 
to communicate the acquisition
process and future plans.
Employee engagement was critical
to this integration process. Two
hundred emails received either a
direct response or were collated
into FAQs. Fourteen elected
members of staff from 
the companies affected by the
acquisition now sit on a Staff
Consultation Forum. This forum
has provided staff with a voice
and its positive influence has been
a part of the developing strength
of the new integrated business.
When VT Shipbuilding moved
from Woolston to Portsmouth in
2003 an externally facilitated
culture change programme began
involving employees at all levels.
The working groups enabled VT
Shipbuilding to break down
internal barriers. This approach
has been further consolidated by
incorporating our Vision & Values
into a new feedback appraisal
scheme which replicates desired
behaviours and expectations. 
The VT Shipbuilding directors and
26 members of the management
team are now participating in an
open and interactive management
course to encourage managers in
inspirational leadership, self-reliance,
and to allow empowerment of 
the workforce.
VT Defence was created through
the amalgamation of VT Integrated
Services and VT Aerospace. 
It was essential that there was 
a good understanding of the
structure and activities of the
organisation. Bi-monthly Team
Talks were launched in April 2005
in the form of a core brief, 
to which local operational news 
is added and cascaded down 
the organisation via face to face
meetings. A programme of site
visits provides opportunities for
employees to meet directors
improving their understanding 
of how their activities impact on
the performance of the business.

The Flexible Benefits Scheme introduced last year is
proving very popular. Several aspects such as flexible
hours, buying and selling leave, child care vouchers and
reduced cost computers have received very positive
feedback. We also offer “Staff Advantage” enabling 
UK employees to purchase goods and services at
considerably discounted rates. 
The VT Group Share Incentive Scheme – employee share
ownership is described further in note 31 of the Financial
Statements. This is a further opportunity for staff 
to share in the success of the business, in addition to 
the Sharesave scheme, which employees tell us is 
highly valued. For overseas locally employed staff 
VT Communications have mirrored the Sharesave
scheme and staff have received the monetary 
equivalent at the local exchange rate.

provisions for its employees, operating five funded
defined benefit schemes and several money purchase
schemes. Financial details are given in note 37 of the

We approach this commitment across the full range of
training needs, from our interaction with schools, our
partnerships with government and industry training bodies,
work experience, our apprentice and our (recently launched)
group graduate training schemes. With our unions we offer
life-long learning to all and sponsor our skilled workers in
their formal continuous professional development. Training
needs are embedded within the performance review
process and our management development programmes
operate at all levels within the group.
Management Development 
Work on our vision and values last year outlined the
commitment to people in terms of development of
individuals and in the future the aim is to create an
organisation where everyone has a personal 
development plan. 
We will put in place the skills and tools needed to
support a performance based culture giving opportunity
to everyone in the company to improve both their
individual and their team performance. Key individuals will
be trained and accredited in coaching skills and some of
these will, in turn, train others across the organisation.
This programme will support our integrated talent
management process aiming to recruit, develop and
retain high performers across the organisation
Graduate Training Scheme 
Building on the 2004 launch of our VT Young 
Graduate Scheme, the group has designed a
comprehensive graduate development programme.
The scheme makes effective use of student and
undergraduate placements as a link to graduate recruitment. 
Each graduate will undertake a rotational programme that
will give them experience within the diverse businesses of
the group. The duration of the scheme is two years for
general management and engineering graduates and 
three years for finance graduates. There are currently 
12 graduates on the scheme and over the next few years
we intend to increase the intake.
In this, the first year of the scheme, feedback from 
the management teams of the business units and the
graduates themselves has been very positive. We are
also very pleased to report that the scheme was designed
by Jessica Titchener, herself a gap year student on the
Year in Industry scheme. The standard of her work on
this project resulted in her reaching the Year in Industry
finals for 2005.

to increase tree cover in Bedfordshire. 
The centre itself uses heating and lighting 
from solar panels. 
Since Sam started work at the centre, 
they have developed the café-restaurant, 
a boutique selling local craftsmen's wares

Group employees attended a gala event
where academic and business achievement
received recognition. 
Brian Dill, nominated by VT Defence won

supporting military aircrew officers, 
Brian demonstrated diplomacy, patience 
and skill when maintaining the crews’
personal kit, uniforms, parachutes and 
safety and survival equipment. The ultimate
testament to Brian's partnering excellence
hangs on the wall in his office - two

Employees are encouraged to support their communities
by taking on roles such as school governors and local
authority councillors.
Education & Employability
As major employers, we invest in the skills of our workforce
and support the development of local talent. We invest our
time and resources to provide educational opportunities 
for all.
Skills for Life
In 2004 the DfES approached Business in the Community
to set up a Skills for Life campaign to address the need for
essential skills training in the workplace. As part of VT’s
support to the Employer Champions network, Paul Lester,
VT’s CEO, led an Opening Doors event where local
businesses were invited to share best practices. 
VT Shipbuilding believes that future success depends on
bringing through the next generation of skilled engineers 
to help fulfil its growing order book.
Charities
The VT Group Charities Committee has changed its
approach and, in addition to being composed of
employees’ representatives, now asks all employees to
suggest charities with which they have a close personal
link. Attention is focused on charities which have strong
links with business units and in particular local charities
including education, health and community causes. 
The largest donation went to RLSS Poole Lifeguard to fund
the modifications to their new 3.85mtr IRB to conform 
to the new Rescue Boat Regulations. In all, 40 charities
received support from the Group Charities Committee, 
but many other local communities benefited directly from
VT operating companies.
Decision making on donations is delegated to the most
local level in the organisation by VT Communications. 
On Ascension Island donations help the Station Manager's
wife in running the islands’ nursery. In Thailand a local
youth team received football kit.

When VT Services Inc. were
contracted to assist relief after

assignment as Project Manager and left a
familiar, comfortable environment at the

The ALNS Business & Enterprise
College is very proud of its
strong relationships with the
surrounding community.
VT Group plc is a local business
sponsor to the Admiral Lord Nelson School,
Portsmouth and assisted the school in its
application to achieve specialist status as a
Business and Enterprise College. Since then,
the group has supported the school as it
develops its business links and commercial
activities.
More recently we have invited ALNS to work
with us to develop a website for young people
about the Building Schools for the Future (BSF)
programme. ALNS seized the opportunity,
suggesting that this could lead to the
development of a community website for
VT Shipbuilding plays an active role in the
Learning Skills Council (Marine Engineering
& Manufacturing Skills Partnership), the Area
Investment Framework Planning Board and
the Marine section of SEMTA (the Sector
Skills Council for Science, Engineering and
Manufacturing Technologies). 
VT Shipbuilding is truly an Industry Partner
for education:
• arranging visits to the yard and "master
classes" by VT shipbuilding graduates for
local schools 
• supporting the ActionStations! "Interaction"
project within the historic dockyard.
www.actionstations.org/education.html
• helping expand the educational programme
on HMS Warrior in the historic dockyard
and sponsored the development of 
HMS Warrior's science/technology
education website
• hosting a "scrapheap challenge" day 
for schools
parents and local businesses so that they too
could get involved in BSF as Portsmouth City
Council prepares to apply for funding.
Having recruited a group of young people to
be involved in the project – through a
competitive selection process – we met with
the pupils and their project sponsors to brief
them on the BSF programme and on the
project requirements. There was a great 
deal of enthusiasm for the idea and we have
agreed to support the group to develop their
project management, marketing and website
design skills.
The team report back at the end of the
Summer Term and we are looking forward 
to an innovative and original design to 
use as part of our own website and BSF 
bid responses.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
ENVIRONMENT
Last year VT employed an external consultant to complete
comprehensive Health and Safety (H&S) audits of our
business units and all major operating sites. The exercise
gave us valued insight into the issues of concern and key
areas of improvement were identified as well as identifying
examples of best practice.
VT’s employee risks reflect the diverse nature of its
operations. Hand arm vibration, noise and manual 
handling exposures are among those seen in our
shipbuilding businesses. 
Our employees often work in challenging surroundings in
which personal security can be an issue. The group has
processes and procedures to ensure the safety and
security of all of our personnel while delivering services in
the most taxing of circumstances. We do not allow the
safety of our people to be compromised.
Likewise, in delivering services to the young or vulnerable,
we ensure that every protection is in place. For example,
our Education and Skills business carries out comprehensive
checks on potential employees (including Criminal Records
Bureau checks) and gives training in child protection. 
VT Services Inc. provides special training for staff in
respect of harassment and conflict resolution.
Employee health is also seen as an important area of
focus. Health surveillance is carried out for exposed
workers and this year the group has engaged with a
national occupational health provider to support it in its
aspirations to further improve performance in the areas of
sickness absence management and health monitoring.
Next year the business units will focus on delivering the
improvements identified by the corporate audits and further
developing their H&S strategies around three specific focus
areas, supported and aligned with the vision and values:
Passionate About People
• Engaging the Workforce
• Public / third party safety
Partnering
• Key stakeholder engagement
• Contractor Management
Driving Performance Culture
• Improving accident reporting and data capture
• Clear quantified understanding of risks
All businesses have Health, Safety and Environment (HS&E)
management systems in place and last year saw the
implementation of a consistent standard for data reporting.
This year the publication of a revised HS&E policy will
further consolidate the group requirements and
expectations of last year.
Key focus will now be the strengthening of HS&E
governance framework and further improvements to 
the consistency and reliability of our data to enable future
target setting. Reviews of performance will be undertaken
six monthly with the MDs of the business units, the Chief
Executive and HS&E Director.
VT IS COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING INDUSTRY LEADING STANDARDS OF HEALTH
AND SAFETY IN OUR PLACES OF WORK. WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY EMPLOYEE
CAN AND SHOULD MAKE A VALUED CONTRIBUTION TO ACHIEVING THIS AIM
AND THAT VISIBLE DEMONSTRATION OF LEADERSHIP BY ALL ITS DIRECTORS
AND MANAGERS IS PARAMOUNT.

ENVIRONMENT
VT Halmatic is currently putting in place an action plan to
meet their obligations under the requirements of Integrated
Pollution and Prevention Control.
The board is currently reviewing the group’s environmental
policy and setting goals and KPIs. Each business has its
own environmental policy and will set and measure additional
KPIs appropriate to its environmental aspects. The data
gathered over the next 12 months will form the baseline
for continuous improvement and future reporting.
As part of its commitment to continuous improvement in
environmental performance, the group has over the last
12 months carried out a number of assessments and
audits of its shipbuilding operations. These assessments
are forming the basis of our forward action plans. During
the next year we are focussing on the verification and
consolidation of data to ensure robustness and
transparency.
VT Communications have an environmental management
system in place which applies to all locations worldwide.
The business recognises concerns regarding
electromagnetic radiation and takes steps to 
be fully informed of international scientific research and
advice and that close liaison is maintained with
employees and with local communities.
VT Education and Skills has low direct environmental
impacts and will be reviewing aspects of energy use 
and transport. Office-based recycling programmes 
are established.
VT Defence ensures environmental controls are in place
for the vessels it operates, the training facilities for fire
services and airfield support services.
In the US, VT Services Inc. ensures compliance with both
customer and US Federal laws through operational
control processes and training for all personnel.
Operating near environmentally sensitive sites
We are aware that a number of our operations take 
place near sites designated either for special protection
(Ramsar protected wetlands, Sites of Special Scientific
Interest (SSSI)) or are in areas of outstanding natural
beauty. The operating companies take special account of
proximity to such sites and ensure liaison with
appropriate authorities and the local communities. 
VT Communications operate in remote locations near to
the SSSI in the English Nature site in Cumbria where rare
wild orchids and Natterjack toads are found. The seas
around Ascension Island are designated a Marine
Protection Zone in the island’s Charter and in 2005
investments in additional protection against pollution 
risk were completed.
Portsmouth harbour is home to a bass spawning ground
and is a designated protected wetland, an SSSI with a
rich ecology supporting much birdlife. VT Shipbuilding
works closely with its partners in Team Portsmouth to
ensure permits are rigorously observed.
Key Environmental Aspect: Energy
helping to meet the Kyoto Commitment
We reported last year that VT Shipbuilding was part of
the Team Portsmouth registration with the EU Emissions
Trading Scheme (ETS). In this first year of operation of the
scheme, Team Portsmouth has submitted its report on
time, and has succeeded in beating its CO
2
emission
allocation by almost one third (8241 tonnes, 29%), 
and reducing emissions by 41% over the baseline 
set in 2003.
WE RECOGNISE THAT OUR OPERATIONS HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT BOTH LOCAL TO OUR SITES AND THE WIDER 
GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT. WE REGARD LEGAL COMPLIANCE AS A MINIMUM
STANDARD FOR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS
THERE HAVE BEEN NO MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENTS OR PROSECUTIONS.

This result has been achieved through the switch in
primary heating fuel from oil to gas, allied with changes in
operating practice. Planned improvements to the heating
infrastructure are expected to yield further dividends in
the next trading period.
Electromagnetic radiation surveys are
carried out to ensure that RF exposure 
levels are not exceeded at all site public
boundaries. Precautions and arrangements
are in place to ensure that the International
Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation
Protection basic restrictions are not
exceeded, which accords with the current
EU Directive on worker exposure.
Along with other operators of RF
installations, VTC are members of the Safety
Advisory Discussion Group, which reviews
Radio Frequency health and planning issues.

VT Communications has recognised that energy
consumption is a major environmental aspect of its
business and energy use is monitored weekly as a
business KPI. A business Energy Forum develops
forward strategies for energy reduction, shares best
practice and leads technology change and employee
training. 2005/06 improvement programmes include:
• energy surveys with the Carbon Trust
• using technology to reduce broadcast energy use – 
4% reduction in global energy use achieved so far 
by investing in Optimod technology
• sourcing energy from renewable sources, and investing
in renewables – for example we are evaluating the use
of wind turbines on locations such as Ascension Island
• investment in new energy efficient transmitters

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Compliance with the Combined Code
Throughout the period of this report the board has been
in compliance with the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance as issued in July 2003 as applicable under
the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The Code requires listed companies to report how the
main and supporting principles of the Code have been
applied, giving sufficient detail to enable shareholders to
evaluate the report and to state whether there has been
compliance with the provisions of the Code and providing
an explanation for any points of non-compliance.
Directors
The board
The Code requires the company to have an effective
board whose role is to provide leadership within a
framework of controls which allow risk to be assessed
and managed. The board sets strategic aims and the
company’s values and ensures that obligations to
shareholders are met. The role of non-executive directors
includes the development of strategy, the scrutiny of
management and ensuring the integrity of financial
information and risk management systems. The board
believes it has met these requirements.
During the year Mr Martin Jay stepped down as chairman
and retired from the board on 5 July 2005. Mr Michael
Jeffries was appointed to the board on 16 May 2005 and
became chairman on 5 July. Mr Peter McIntosh resigned
from the board on 31 January 2006 following his
secondment to the CVF project.
As at 15 May 2006 the board comprises Mr Jeffries,
chairman, Mr Paul Lester, chief executive, five
independent non-executive directors and two executive
directors. Mr Andrew Given is the senior independent
director. Biographies of the directors, giving details of
their experience and main commitments are set on out
pages 50 to 51.
It is intended that Mr Chris Rickard be appointed to the
board as finance director on 1 July 2006 and a resolution
to re-appoint him will be presented to the annual general
meeting.
The board holds full meetings at least seven times a year,
spread across the full calendar year. In addition there is a
separate meeting each year to discuss the strategic plan.
The directors believe that these meetings enable the
board to exercise control over the group and remain fully
conversant with its activities. There is a formal schedule
of matters reserved for the board which only the board
itself can change; these matters include the acquisition
and disposal of businesses, significant contractual
commitments and a review of risk management
processes.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Chairman and Chief Executive
The Code requires that there should be a clear division of
responsibilities between the running of the board and
executive responsibility for the running of the business so
that no one person has unrestricted power.
The board has met this requirement by establishing
clearly defined roles for the chairman and chief executive.
This division of responsibilities is set down in writing and
agreed by the board. The chairman is responsible for the
leadership of the board, ensuring its effectiveness and
setting its agenda. Once the strategic and financial
objectives have been agreed by the board as a whole, 
it is the chief executive’s responsibility to ensure their
delivery. The schedule of relative responsibilities is
available on the company’s website or on request. 
The chief executive is obliged to comply with a practical
schedule of matters requiring board approval before
implementation.
Board balance and independence
The company complies with the requirements of the
Code that there should be a balance of executive and
non-executive directors so that no individual or small
group can dominate decision taking. The board has met
the Code requirement that at least 50% of the board
should be independent throughout the year.
In deciding the chairmanship and membership of board
committees the need to refresh membership, as well as
the skills of the individuals, is taken into account and a
review of the composition of board committees was
undertaken during the year.
All non-executive directors are considered by the board
to be independent.
At the time of his appointment as chairman, and in
compliance with the Code, Mr Michael Jeffries was
considered to be independent.
Processes are in place to ensure that, in the event of a
conflict of interest, this is reported to the board and the
director involved takes no part in the relevant discussion.
Appointments to the board
There is a rigorous and transparent procedure for the
appointment of new directors, which are made on merit
and against objective criteria. Spencer Stuart were
retained as consultants for the appointment of Mr Jeffries
and Heidrick and Struggles were retained for the
appointment of Mr Rickard.
Information and professional development
A main principle of the Code is that information of
sufficient quality is supplied to the board in a timely
manner. The board is supplied with detailed information
several days prior to the board meeting. The agenda for
each board meeting includes substantial reports on all
aspects of the group’s business and ad-hoc reports are
circulated if decisions are required between formally
arranged meetings. Non-executive directors have ready
access to executive directors. Board meetings are held at
different company locations during the year as well as at
the head office, enabling directors to make site visits.
Non-executive directors make site visits during the year
and executive directors carry out regular business reviews
at different locations throughout the year.
All newly appointed directors are provided with a
structured induction programme which includes meetings
both internally and externally with those principally
involved with the business.
Ongoing training for directors is provided for all directors
to ensure that directors are aware of their responsibilities.
All directors have access to the advice and services of
the company secretary and are able to take independent
professional advice at the company’s expense.
Performance evaluation
The Code requires the board to undertake a formal and
rigorous evaluation of its own performance annually and
that of its committees and directors.
A formal evaluation was conducted by means of detailed
questionnaires which were completed by each director,
both for the board as a whole, for each committee and
on the performance of the chairman. The answers
formed the basis of a one on one feedback session
between each director and the chairman and senior
independent director, followed by a review of the whole
board. Comments were invited on a wide range of issues
including board and board committee skill and balance,
frequency of meetings, access to management other
than executive directors, sufficiency of information,
achievement of objectives, operational issues and
monitoring, dialogue with shareholders, rigour of
meetings and working relationships.
Re-election
Under the Code directors should offer themselves for 
re-election at regular intervals and all the directors submit
themselves for re-election at least every three years.
Directors stand for reappointment by the shareholders at
the first annual general meeting following their
appointment and subsequently at least every three years.
Non-executive directors are appointed for a term of three
years and may be reappointed for a further term of three
years by agreement of the board. On appointment each
non-executive director receives a letter setting out the
terms of their appointment. Non-executive directors are
not employees and do not participate in the daily
business of the group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Remuneration
Information regarding the remuneration committee is set
out on page 58 and the Directors’ Remuneration report is
on pages 58 to 65.
Board committees
The board has the following standing committees; each
has its own terms of reference which are available on
request and on the company’s website.
The company secretary is secretary to each committee.
Audit committee
Members during the year were: Mr A F Given (chairman),
Mr D Barclay and Mr D A Thorpe. The finance director
and representatives of the external auditors attend by
invitation. The committee meets at least twice a year 
and at least once a year there is an opportunity for the
external auditors to discuss matters with the committee
without the executive directors being present.
The board has determined that the committee members
have sufficient skills and experience to contribute
meaningfully to the committee’s discussions. The
chairman of the committee has the required experience 
in accounting and financial management.
The committee has set parameters so that the
independence of the external auditors is not prejudiced
when undertaking non-audit work. Depending on the
nature of the work it is either prohibited or requires prior
approval from the finance director or committee, as
appropriate. The auditors are precluded from providing
accounting, internal audit and valuation services but may
provide other services including due diligence and tax
compliance with the approval of the finance director 
or audit committee. In turn, the external auditors have 
in place processes to ensure that their independence 
is maintained.
Remuneration committee
Members during the year were: Mr D A Thorpe
(chairman), Baroness Blackstone, Lord Boyce, 
Mr D Barclay and Mr A F Given.
The committee is comprised exclusively of non-executive
directors. The chairman, chief executive and group HR
director attend the committee, by invitation, when
appropriate. No executive is present when the committee
considers matters relating to himself. Mr Jeffries is absent
when his remuneration as chairman is under
consideration.
The committee’s responsibilities are described in the
remuneration report on page 58.
The committee meets periodically when required but not
less than twice a year.
It has access to information and advice both from within
the group and externally, at the cost of the company, as 
it deems necessary. It is responsible for appointing any
consultants in respect of executive remuneration.
Nomination committee
Members during the year were: Mr M M E Jeffries (Chair)
Baroness Blackstone, Lord Boyce, Mr D M Barclay, 
Mr P J Lester.
All directors’ appointments are considered before 
formal approval by the board and the committee aims 
to maintain a proper balance between executive and 
non-executive directors in accordance with the Code.
The committee leads the process for identifying and
recommending candidates for appointment as directors,
giving full consideration to succession planning and 
the needs of the group, including qualifications and
expertise to guide the strategy of the group. Before
concluding arrangements with any preferred candidate 
for appointment to the board, the committee satisfies
itself that their other commitments are not such that
would adversely affect their ability to devote adequate
time to the position. The committee reviews the structure,
size and composition of the board. It also makes
recommendations to the board on the composition of 
the board committees.
The committee meets when required. No-one other than
members of the committee is entitled to be present at 
its meetings but non-executive directors are invited 
to attend.
The committee has access to such information and
advice as it may require both from within the group and
externally, and at the cost of the company. This may
include the appointment of external search consultants.
The procedures were used in the appointment of 
Mr Jeffries as chairman and the proposed appointment 
of Mr Rickard as finance director. Independent search
consultants were used in connection with each
appointment. Mr Martin Jay, former chairman, was not
involved in the selection of Mr Jeffries as his successor.
The current commitments of Mr Jeffries outside the 
VT Group are as chairman of Wembley National Stadium
Limited, National Car Parks Limited and Wyless Plc and
as a non-executive director of De la Rue Plc.

VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
The board is required to present a balanced and
comprehensible assessment of the group’s position and
prospects and is satisfied it has met this obligation. 
A summary of the directors’ responsibilities for the
financial statements is set out on page 66.
Organisation
The group has a defined structure in which operational
management have detailed responsibilities and levels of
authorisation. The group has a code of business ethics
setting out principles to be followed by all employees in
the course of business. A confidential telephone line is
available for staff to report concerns with regard to
conduct.
Ethical trading
Further information on the group’s ethical trading policies
is given in the corporate responsibility report on page 33.
Internal controls
Following the publication of the Turnbull guidance, 
the board confirms that the group has established
processes and procedures for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks faced by the group.
The processes have been embedded into the fabric of
the group and have been in place for the year under
review and up to the date of approval of the annual 
report and financial statements.
The board is ultimately responsible for the group’s system
of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The role of management is to implement board policies
on risk and control. The system of internal controls is
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of
failure of the achievement of business objectives. In
pursuing these objectives, internal controls can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
A process of control self-assessment and hierarchical
reporting has been established which provides for a
documented and auditable trail of accountability. These
procedures are relevant across all group operations: 
they provide for successive assurances to be given at
increasingly higher levels of management and, finally, to
the board. This process is facilitated by internal audit,
which also provides a degree of assurance as to the
operation and validity of the system of internal controls.
Internal audit ensure that corrective action is taken to
rectify any weaknesses.
The processes used by the board to review the
effectiveness of the system of internal controls include 
the following:
• annual budgets are prepared for each operating
business and compared with monthly management
reporting, which focuses on actual performance
against these budgets;
• management reports and internal and external audit
reports on the system of internal controls and any
material control weaknesses that are identified;
• discussions with management including discussions on
the actions taken on problem areas identified by board
members or in the internal/external audit reports;
• policies and procedures for such matters as delegation
of authorities, capital expenditure and treasury
management as well as regular updates;
• review of the adequacy of the level of experienced and
professional staff throughout the business and the
expertise of individual staff members so that they are
capable of carrying out their individual delegated
responsibilities;
• review of major tenders which are specifically approved
by the board and contract performance which is
regularly reviewed and compared against estimates
drawn up at the time of original tender; and
• review of the external and internal audit work plans.
The group’s management operates a risk management
process which identifies the key risks facing each
business. The process is based on each business unit
producing a risk register which identifies the potential key
risks to the individual business unit, the impact should
they occur and the action being taken to sufficiently
manage those risks. Internal audit independently review
the risk identification procedures and control process
implemented by management, and report to the audit
committee on a quarterly basis. The audit committee
review the assurance procedures, ensuring that an
appropriate mix of techniques is used to obtain the 
level of assurances required by the board.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable
expectation that the group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
REMUNERATION REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2006
This report has been prepared in accordance with
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985. It also
describes the group’s compliance with the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance in relation to
remuneration for the current and forthcoming financial
years. The report has been approved by the board for
submission to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. 
The company’s auditors have audited the report to the
extent required by the relevant legislation. The chairman
of the committee will attend the AGM and will be
available to answer shareholders’ questions regarding 
the contents of this report. 
Remuneration Committee
In accordance with the Combined Code, the
remuneration of the executive directors and chairman is
determined by the remuneration committee on behalf of
the board. The committee also reviews and monitors
remuneration for other senior executives below the board
and oversees the operation of the company’s share
schemes. The committee’s terms of reference are
available on the company’s website.
Details of the composition of the committee during the
year are contained in the Corporate Governance Report
on pages 54 to 57. 
By invitation, remuneration committee meetings are also
attended by the chairman, the chief executive and the
director of human resources. No person is present during
any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
During the year, the remuneration committee appointed
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (“NBSC”) as
independent advisers to the committee. NBSC does not
provide any other services to the company. The
committee also received advice during the year from
Monks Partnership, Aon Consulting (for UK pensions) 
and Advaita Consulting (for US pensions), each of whom
was appointed by the company.
Remuneration Policy
The company’s policy continues to be to provide for each
of its executive directors a remuneration package which
is adequate to attract, retain and motivate individuals of
the appropriate calibre, whilst at the same time not paying
more than is necessary for this purpose. The company’s
policy is regularly reviewed so as to ensure it remains
appropriate to the company’s current circumstances and
prospects. The remuneration package for executive
directors and other senior executives is structured to
ensure that a significant proportion of total remuneration
is only payable subject to the achievement of challenging
targets, designed to improve shareholder value.
When setting remuneration for executive directors, regard
is paid to the pay policy throughout the group.
The following comprise the principal elements of
executive directors’ remuneration:
• base salary
• benefits, including pension, company car and fuel,
healthcare and private telephone costs
• participation in the annual short term performance
related bonus plan
• participation in the company’s long-term incentive
plans, as described below under which awards vest
subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions
set by the remuneration committee with the primary
aim of encouraging the generation of returns to
shareholders
Base Salary
Base salaries for executive directors are reviewed
annually, usually in April. When setting salaries, the
remuneration committee considers salary levels for
executive directors in companies of a similar size and
within similar industries to the company, as well as the
director’s personal experience and performance. 
The current salaries of the executive directors (effective
for the year beginning on 1 April 2006) are:
• P J Lester £406,000 (4% increase since 2005/6) 
• C J Cundy £218,400 (0% increase since 2005/6) 
• S E Tarrant £208,000 (4% increase since 2005/6) 
Annual Bonus
Executive directors, in common with other executives in
the company, are eligible to participate in the annual
bonus plan. For executive directors, the maximum annual
bonus payable under the plan is 75% of salary, of which
40% of any payment is normally required to be
compulsorily deferred under the Deferred Annual Bonus
Scheme (see below). The level of bonus paid is
determined annually by the remuneration committee
dependent on the achievement of a combination of
challenging profit, cash flow and strategic targets set by
the committee (on a split of 60%:25%:15% bonus
opportunity respectively).
Mr Tarrant is intending to retire at the end of the financial
year and therefore the remuneration committee has
exercised its discretion to remove the requirement for
compulsory deferral of 40% of bonus.
Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme
Under the Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme (“DABS”),
approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM, executive
directors and other members of the Group Executive
Committee are normally required to defer 40% of any
bonus payment into VT Group shares for a period of
three years. Individual executive directors may also elect
to defer a further 35% of bonus under the same
arrangement. At the end of the three year period,
matching shares will be awarded dependent upon the
extent to which Earnings per Share (“EPS”) targets have
been achieved over the three year period. Matching
Shares will be released as follows:
VTG011 R&A 2006 p52-67  13/6/06  14:25  Page 58 59
VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
REMUNERATION REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2006
In addition, no matching shares will vest unless the
company’s EPS growth in each of the three years of the
performance period is at least 3% higher than in the
previous year.
The first deferral of shares under the DABS will be 
made in May 2006 linked to the out-turn of the 2005/6
annual bonus.
LTIP
Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) approved by
shareholders in 2003, each year shares may be awarded
to executive directors and to other selected senior
executives equal in value up to 50% of basic salary. 
The shares are held in trust and released after three years
subject to the extent to which a Total Shareholder Return
(“TSR”) performance target is met over the vesting
period. The current policy is that the comparator group
for measuring performance is the FTSE 250 (but
excluding Investment Trusts). If the company is ranked at
the median at the end of the performance period, 50% of
shares will be released, with full vesting for upper quartile
performance or above (an approach to vesting which the
remuneration committee believes is appropriate, given the
size of awards made under the LTIP). No shares will vest
if the company is ranked below the median.
Performance under the TSR target is independently
calculated by ABN Amro on behalf of the 
remuneration committee.
Each time executive directors were awarded shares
under the LTIP they were entitled to invest up to 5% of
base salary to purchase additional shares in the company
provided that the cash cost did not exceed the amount
they received in their most recent short term bonus
payment. These shares are held in the trust for at least
three years and they are then matched on a 1:1 basis
with further shares, which the remuneration committee
considers appropriate given (i) the upfront co-investment
requirement and (ii) the overall level of awards. From 2006
onwards this feature has been removed from the LTIP .
Share Option Plans
The company operates two share option plans (a UK
Inland Revenue approved plan and an unapproved plan)
approved by shareholders in 1999 and 1996 respectively
and under which directors and other executives are
eligible to participate at the discretion of the remuneration
committee. Options are granted at market value
determined immediately before the grant. Annual awards
do not normally exceed one times base salary.
Options under these schemes can normally be exercised
only on the achievement of an objective performance
condition set by the remuneration committee and linked
to the underlying performance of the company. The
performance condition currently applying is real growth in
underlying earnings per share of at least RPI plus 3% per
annum over three consecutive years. If this target is not
met at the end of the three year period, the options lapse
(i.e. there is no “re-testing” facility).
Under the DABS and share option plans, the
remuneration committee obtains external guidance as
regards the extent to which the EPS targets are satisfied.

REMUNERATION REPORT 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2006
Pension benefits
Executive directors are members of the group’s contributory defined benefit pension scheme which entitles them to a
pension on retirement of two-thirds of pensionable salary after twenty years’ service: details of accrued benefits are set
out below. No elements of remuneration apart from salary are pensionable. The normal retirement age for directors is 60. 
The remuneration committee has determined that following A-Day an artificial pension cap will be retained, except 
Mr Tarrant whose pension is already uncapped.
Mr P J Lester and Mr C J Cundy are subject to the Inland Revenue pensions cap. Consequently, in each case a
Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme has been established to which they pay the same rate of
contribution (subject to Inland Revenue limits) as for the main scheme. The FURBS is a defined contribution scheme.
The company contributions to these schemes during the year were £89,430 (2005: £89,430) for Mr Lester and
£44,655 (2005: £42,120) for Mr Cundy.

i) The pension entitlement shown is that which would
be paid annually on retirement based on service to
the end of the year, or leaving service if earlier.
ii) The transfer value has been calculated on the basis
of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial
Guidance Note GN11.
iii) Members of the Scheme have the option to pay
Additional Voluntary Contributions; neither the
contributions nor the resulting benefits are included 
in the above table. 
iv) Mr P J McIntosh resigned from the board on 31
January 2006 but remains a member of SIPS. The
pension figure at the end of the year is the pension 
at this date. 
v) No allowance is made in the transfer value of accrued
pension figures for Guaranteed Minimum Pensions or
for the value of any refund of members’ contributions.
The impact of this is not expected to be significant.
vi) The transfer value calculations as at 1 April 2006 are
based on market yields at 31 March 2006. This is
consistent with the transfer value basis adopted for
the scheme up until March 2006. This was withdrawn
prior to 1 April 2006 due to changes in actuarial
advisors to the scheme. Therefore it would not have
been possible for the members to take the transfer
values at 1 April 2006 detailed above. 
vii) During the year Mr C J Cundy and Mr P J McIntosh
have been awarded additional one off pension
contributions of £200,000 and £94,592 respectively.
These contributions were awarded as the
remuneration committee identified previous
underfunding of pension arrangements. 
viii) The remuneration committee has determined that no
special arrangements will be made for executives
who are affected by the life time allowance.

VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT 
OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual
Report and the group and parent company financial
statements, in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and
parent company financial statements for each financial
year. Under that law the directors are required to prepare
the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs
as adopted by the EU and have elected to prepare the
parent company financial statements in accordance with
UK Accounting Standards.
The group financial statements are required by law and
IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial
position and performance of the group; the Companies
Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements
that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial
statements giving a true and fair view are references to
their achieving a fair presentation.
The parent company financial statements are required 
by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the parent company.
In preparing each of the group and parent company
financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
• for the group financial statements, state whether they
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company financial statements, state
whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have
been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the parent company
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the group and the parent company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records that disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent
company and enable them to ensure that its financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the
group and to prevent and detect fraud and other
irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are
also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report,
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate
Governance Statement that comply with that law and
those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the corporate and financial information included
on the company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
We have audited the group and parent company financial
statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’) of VT Group plc
for the year ended 31 March 2006 which comprise 
the Group Income Statement, the Group and Parent
Company Balance Sheets, the Group Cash Flow
Statement, the Group Statement of Recognised Income
and Expense and the related notes. These financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is
described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as
a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that
we might state to the company’s members those matters
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the company and the company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual
Report and the group financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and for
preparing the parent company financial statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance
with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in
the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 66.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and
the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether 
in our opinion the information given in the Directors’
Report is consistent with the financial statements. The
information given in the Directors’ Report includes that
specific information presented in the Operating and
Financial Review that is cross referenced from the
Directors’ Report. We also report to you if, in our opinion,
the company has not kept proper accounting records, if
we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions
is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement
reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions
of the 2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review
by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority,
and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the board’s statements on internal
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on
the effectiveness of the group’s corporate governance
procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual
Report and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited financial statements. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not
extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination,
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and
judgments made by the directors in the preparation of 
the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately
disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all
the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence
to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In
forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the group financial statements give a true and fair view,
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the
state of the group’s affairs as at 31 March 2006 and of
its profit for the year then ended;
• the parent company financial statements give a true
and fair view, in accordance with UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the
parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2006;
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985
and, as regards the group financial statements, Article
4 of the IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is
consistent with the financial statements.

VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs
The group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006 were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 15th
May 2006 and the balance sheet was signed on the board’s behalf by CJ Cundy. VT Group plc is a public limited company
incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (Adopted IFRS). The accounting policies as set out below
have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements and in preparing an
opening IFRS balance sheet at 1st April 2004 for the purposes of the transition to Adopted IFRS. The principal exception is that
financial instrument accounting is determined on different bases in the current year and the comparative year due to the
transitional provisions of IAS32 and IAS39. In preparing this financial information, the group has decided to early adopt the
amendment issued in December 2004 to IAS 19 Employee Benefits – Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures. 
The company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented
on pages 120 to 124.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies
i Basis of preparation
This is the first year in which the group has prepared its financial statements under Adopted IFRS and the comparatives have
been restated from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP) to comply with Adopted IFRS. The group issued
a press release in September 2005 incorporating its preliminary IFRS financial statements for 2005 and the reconciliations to
Adopted IFRS from the previously published UK GAAP financial statements are summarised in note 39.
These are the group’s first consolidated financial statements and IFRS1 has been applied. In general, for the first-time
adoption of Adopted IFRS, the standards are applied retrospectively. However, there are a number of exemptions available
under IFRS1 and details of the exemptions that the group has applied are shown in the notes to the financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial
instruments that have been measured at fair value. The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged
are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged.
The group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£’000)
except when otherwise indicated.
ii Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of VT Group plc and its subsidiaries at each balance
sheet date, and include its share of its joint ventures’ and associates’ results on the equity method. A subsidiary is an entity
controlled by the group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain
benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting
year as the parent company. 
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been
eliminated.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired during the year are consolidated up to, or from, the date control passes.
iii Investments in associates and joint ventures
Joint ventures are those businesses in which the group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise joint control with its
partners under a contractual agreement. Associates are those businesses in which the group has a long-term interest and is
able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The post tax results of joint ventures and associates are included in the consolidated income statement as an element of
profit before tax.
In the consolidated balance sheet the net investment is carried as a fixed asset at the share of the joint venture’s or
associate’s equity including any goodwill arising on the group’s acquisition of its interest.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
iv Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can
be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and can
be reliably measured.
Rendering of services
Revenue from services rendered is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction. Revenue from
services provided on a short-term or one-off basis is recognised when the service is complete. The provision of services over
a long-term period are treated as construction contracts and the revenue recognised as set out below.
Construction contracts
Revenue from construction contracts, including long-term service provision contracts, is recognised by reference to the stage
of completion of the contract. The stage of completion is determined by the costs incurred on the contract to date, to the
extent that such costs represent progress made on the project. A prudent level of profit attributable to the contract activity is
recognised if the final outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed. An expected loss on a contract is recognised
immediately in the income statement.
Rental income
Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term on ongoing leases.
v Leases
Finance leases, which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concerned, are capitalised
on the balance sheet at the lower of fair value of the leased asset and net present value of the minimum lease payments at
the inception of the lease. The corresponding liabilities are recorded as long term or current liabilities depending on the
period when they are due. The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over the
periods of the leases as a finance cost. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance cost and the reduction in the
lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Rental income is recognised in revenue on a straight-line basis.
vi Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in
which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted
at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following
temporary differences are not provided for: 
• goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, 
• differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, to the extent that they will
probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of
assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax
benefit will be realised.

2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
vii Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of
property, plant and equipment comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an
item of property, plant and equipment. Land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated. The estimated
useful lives are as follows:
Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter
Computer equipment 3 to 5 years
Fixtures and fittings 5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Plant & machinery 5 to 10 years
Heavy equipment 20 to 33 years
Impairment reviews are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
The residual value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reassessed annually and adjustments, where
applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
viii Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are
capitalised as part of the cost of that asset when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits and can be
measured reliably. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its
intended use.
Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
ix Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation consists of the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the
identifiable intangible and tangible assets net of the fair value of the liabilities including contingencies of businesses acquired
at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill in respect of business combinations of subsidiaries is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill arising on the
acquisition of a joint venture or associated undertaking is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Where negative goodwill arises, following re-assessment of fair values, it is credited to the income statement in the period in
which the acquisition is made.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses that arise from annual assessment of its carrying value. To
the extent that the carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, goodwill is written down and an impairment charge is
recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the estimated
value in use. Value in use is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS (1 April 2004) has been retained at the previous UK
GAAP amounts. No further amortisation charges are incurred following transition to IFRS.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill
written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any
subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
x Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred. 
Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is carried forward when its future recoverability can reasonably be
regarded as assured. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Following
the initial recognition, development expenditure is included in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses. Any expenditure carried forward is amortised over the period of expected future sales from
the related project.
The carrying value of development costs is reviewed for impairment annually when the asset is not yet in use, or more frequently
when an indicator of impairment arises during the reporting year indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
xi Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business combination are capitalised at fair value as
at the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets, excluding development costs, created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged
against profits in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and
bring to use the specific software.
Intangible assets arising from a business combination are amortised over their remaining useful lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible
asset. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Acquired software licences 2-5 years
Trademarks and licences up to 20 years
Other intangibles 5-10 years
Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating unit level. Useful lives are
also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable are made on a prospective basis.
xii Investment properties
Land and buildings that are leased to non-group entities are classified as investment properties. The group applies the cost
model to measure investment properties at their cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of investment properties over their estimated useful lives
of up to 50 years.
The residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
xiii Impairment
The carrying amount of the group’s assets are tested for impairment when events occur or circumstances indicate that their
carrying values may be impaired. Goodwill, capitalised development costs and acquired intangibles are subject to annual
impairment tests. Impairments arising are charged to the income statement.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other
assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an
individual asset. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
xiv Other investments
The group determines the classification of its other investments at initial recognition. The classification depends upon the
purpose for which the investments were acquired. 
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of 
the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within
12 months of the balance sheet date.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell
the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair
value through profit and loss.

VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been
transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risk and rewards of ownership.
Available-for-sale financial assets are carried at fair value. Unrealised gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of
non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in equity. When securities classified as available-for-
sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as gains and losses
from investment securities.
xv Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the
ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in-first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the
inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in
progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
xvi Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An
estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when
identified.
Long-term contract balances are stated at cost less provision for any anticipated losses. Appropriate provisions for any
losses are made in the year they are first foreseen. Progress payments are amounts received from customers in accordance
with the terms of the contracts which specify payments in advance of delivery and are credited, as progress payments,
against any expenditure incurred for the particular contract. Any unexpended balance in respect of progress payments is
held in trade and other payables as customer stage payments.
Other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment losses.
xvii Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original
maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts repayable on demand.
xviii Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the foreign
exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction.
Exchange differences arising on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in foreign
operations are taken to a translation reserve. They are released to the income statement upon disposal of the net investment.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are
translated to Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign
operations are translated to Sterling at average rates of exchange during the year. Foreign exchange differences arising on
retranslation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred
cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognised in the income
statement. Translation differences that arose before the transition date to IFRS are deemed to be nil under the transitional
rules available. 
Exchange differences arising on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in foreign
operations are taken to a translation reserve. They are released to the income statement upon disposal of the net investment.
Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also dealt with in equity.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
xix Derivative financial instruments
From 1 April 2005
The group primarily uses foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate
and foreign currency fluctuations. In accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair value of forward exchange contracts
and interest rate swaps are calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to
changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability; or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash
flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
In relation to fair value hedges which meet the conditions for special hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring
the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement. Any gain or loss on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income
statement. 
In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge firm commitments which meet the conditions for special hedge accounting, the
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in
equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or
liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial
measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the
gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged
firm commitment affects the profit or loss.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising in fair value are taken directly to profit or
loss for the year.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in
equity remains in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the
net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss for the year.
Period to 31 March 2005
The group used derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures in interest and foreign exchange rates. Receipts and
payments on interest rate instruments were recognised on an accruals basis over the life of the instrument. Gains and losses
on foreign currency hedges were recognised on maturity of the underlying transactions. Gains and losses arising on hedging
instruments which were cancelled due to the termination of the underlying exposure were taken to the income statement
immediately.
xx Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs
associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or
premium on settlement.
xxi Retirement benefit plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as
incurred.
The group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is
discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at
the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the group’s
obligations. The calculations, together with the cost of providing benefits under the plans, are performed by a qualified
actuary using the projected unit credit method.

VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued
All actuarial gains and losses as at 1 April 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were recognised. Actuarial gains and losses are
recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
xxii Long-term service benefits
The group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit
that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is calculated using the
projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted. The
discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the
terms of the group’s obligations.
xxiii Share-based payment transactions
Share based incentive arrangements are provided to employees under the group’s share option, incentive and other award
schemes. Share options granted to employees and share based arrangements put in place since 7 November 2002 are
valued at the date of grant or award using an appropriate option pricing model and are charged to operating profit over the
vesting period of the scheme, with a corresponding entry recorded within equity. The annual charge is modified to take
account of shares forfeited by employees who leave during the vesting period and, in the case of non-market related
performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely the option will vest.
The group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to
executives and senior employees. Shares in the group held by the employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and
presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
The group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied
IFRS2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 April 2005.
xxiv Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of
the amount of the obligation.
Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when it becomes probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed
total contract revenues. Such provisions are recorded as write downs of work in progress for that portion of the work which
has already been completed and as liability provisions for the remainder. Losses are determined on the basis of estimated
results on completion of contracts which are updated regularly.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products and services are sold. The provision is based on
historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the
restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced. Future operating costs are not provided for.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the group from a contract are
lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligation under the contract.
xxv Accounting for PFI contracts
In determining an appropriate accounting policy for the group’s interests in PFI projects under Adopted IFRS, the Group has
considered the current status of the project by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) on
accounting for service concession arrangements. IFRIC published three draft interpretations on accounting for service
concessions in 2005. However, the final form of the interpretations and the timetable for IFRIC to finalise and the EU to 
adopt the interpretations remain uncertain.
In light of this uncertainty, the group considers that until such time as final guidance is issued by IFRIC and adopted by the
EU it remains appropriate to apply elements of the approach set out in UK Financial Reporting Standard 5 “Reporting the
substance of transactions” in accounting for its interests in PFI projects. This involves applying a “risks and rewards” test to
determine whether a non-current asset or finance debtor model should be followed. Once the accounting model has been
determined, the recognised assets and liabilities of the PFI projects are measured in accordance with Adopted IFRS; these
accounting policies do not differ significantly from those applied previously under UK GAAP .

IFRIC 6 Liabilities Arising from Participating in a Specific Market – 
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment 1 December 2005
IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 
Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies 1 March 2006
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 1 May 2006
Upon adoption of IFRS 7, the group will have to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their
significance and the nature and extent of risks that they give rise to. More specifically the group will need to disclose the fair
value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail. There will be no effect on reported income or net
assets.
Upon adoption of IFRIC 4 the group will have to assess whether any contracts or arrangements convey the right to usage,
capacity or output from a specified asset, and hence fall to be accounted for as a lease. The group have not yet finalised the
impact of this accounting interpretation, but do not believe the impact will be material on the reported results.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of the other standards and interpretations noted above will have a material
impact on the group’s financial statements in the period of initial application.

4 Segment reporting
Segment information is presented in respect of the group’s business and geographical segments. The primary segment reporting
format is determined to be business segments as the group’s risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in
the products and services provided. Secondary segment information is reported geographically. 
The group’s geographical segments are based on the location of the group’s assets. Sales to external customers disclosed in
geographical segments are based on the geographical location of its customers.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. Segment revenue, segment expense and segment result include
transfers between business segments. Those transfers are eliminated in consolidation.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a
reasonable basis. 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used
for more than one period.

parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares
that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

16 Goodwill continued
The fair value adjustments to prior year acquisitions are in respect of the Guidance and Cube acquisitions made in the year ended
31 March 2005. Additional  employee benefits and other creditors, net of deferred tax of £1,142,000 have been recognised
following revision of previous estimates. Of this amount, £895,000 relates to the minority share of these prior year acquisitions.
Under the provisions of IFRS 3 the adjustments to fair value have been made within 12 months of acquisition date and have been
included as prior year adjustments.
The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based
on financial budgets approved by the board. The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 8.5% (2005: 8.5%) and cash
flow projections beyond the three year budget are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate (2005: 2.5%) that is the same as the
long term average growth rate in the UK.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following key assumptions:
•  Gross margin
•  Discount rates
•  Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period
Gross margins are based on the current values being achieved.
Discount rates reflect the company’s weighted average cost of capital.
Growth rate estimates are based on published information in respect of long term growth rates.
Management believes that no reasonable change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit
to exceed its recoverable amount.

The available for sale preference shares have been designated as available for sale and mature in instalments from 2010. Interest

The reimbursement right represents a life insurance policy held to fund the future liabilities arising in the US defined benefit
pension scheme. Under the provisions of IAS 19 this policy is defined as a non-qualifying insurance policy and as such is not
deemed to be an asset of the pension scheme. It is therefore deemed to be a corporate asset and is held at fair value on the
balance sheet.

Foreign exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price
and deducting the current spot rate. For interest rate swaps broker quotes are used. Those quotes are back tested using pricing
models or discounted cash flow techniques. Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are
based on management’s best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet
date. Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest-bearing loans and borrowings is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest
cash flows.
Cash flow hedges
The group uses forward contracts to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Certain of these contracts qualify for hedge
accounting and are designated as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses are held in the cash flow hedge reserve and are recycled to
the income statement when the related purchases are recorded and recognised in the income statement. There is an immaterial
amount of hedge ineffectiveness related to these hedges.
Gains and losses on cash flow hedges are ultimately recorded in the income statement consistently with the underlying hedged
item. Any gains or losses on cash flow hedges arising due to hedge ineffectiveness would be shown in the income statement
within net financing costs.
At 31 March 2006, the group held foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of expected future purchases and expenses
in respect of overseas operations for which the group had firm commitments. The terms of the contracts are as follows:
Quantity Maturity Exchange rate

Cyprus Pounds 1,904,700 CYP April 2006 - March 2007 CYP/£ 0.84

At 31 March 2006, a net unrealised gain of £202,000 with deferred income tax of £61,000 is included in equity in respect of these
contracts.
At 31 March 2006 the group also held a forward contract to purchase US$12m in November 2006 at an exchange rate of £/ $ of
1.75 which has not been designated for hedge accounting. This contract had a fair value of £1,000 at 31 March 2006 and is
included as an asset within the balance sheet at 31 March 2006.

At 31 March 2005 the group was not required to account for foreign exchange contracts in accordance with IAS 39. On adoption
of IAS 39 on 1 April 2005 the following foreign exchange contracts were designated as cash flow hedges:
Quantity Maturity Exchange rate
Buy
Cyprus Pounds 900,000 CYP April 2005 - March 2006 CYP/£ 0.82

UAE Dirhams 3,800,000AED April 2005 - March 2006 AED/£ 6.52- 6.69 
The above currency contracts had a fair value liability of £67,000 upon adoption of IAS 39 which was deferred in reserves. Upon
settlement of these contracts this amount was transferred to the profit and loss account during the year ended 31 March 2006.
In addition the company held various currency contracts with a fair value liability of £597,000 upon adoption of IAS 39 which were
not designated for hedge accounting. A gain of £598,000 has been included within the profit and loss account for the year,
representing the movement in fair value on these contracts.
The group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on certain of its bank borrowings.
Contracts with nominal values of £24.7m have fixed interest payments at a weighted average rate of 5.57% for periods up until
2029 and have floating rate interest receipts at 5.2% plus LIBOR.
The fair value liability of swaps entered into at 31 March 2006 is estimated at £779,000 (2005: £1,842,000). These amounts are
based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date. All of these interest rate swaps are designated and
effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity. An amount of £28,000 (2005: £nil) has been
offset against hedged interest payments made in the period. 
During the period an interest rate swap contract and related loan balance were terminated. The interest rate swap had a fair value
liability estimated at £1,035,000. Both the change in fair value and the previously deferred losses on this contract held in equity
have been included within the income statement for the year.
Hedge of net investments in foreign entities
Included in other loans at 31 March 2006 is a borrowing of US$20m (2005: US$20m), which has been designated as a hedge of
the net investments in the United States subsidiaries. Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing are transferred to
equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investment in the subsidiaries.

31 Share-based payments
Employee and management share participation plans exist as follows. All plans are equity-settled except where stated.
Share option plans
The Group operates two share option plans under which directors and other executives are eligible to participate at the discretion
of the Remuneration Committee. Options are granted at market value, determined immediately before the grant.
Share options vest in equal tranches on the 3rd, 4th and 5th anniversaries of the date of the grant subject to achievement of a
performance condition. The performance condition currently applying is real growth in earnings per share of at least 2% pa for
options granted before May 2005 and 3% pa for options granted thereafter, over three consecutive years. These share options
have a maximum life of 10 years.
Deferred annual bonus scheme (DABS)
The group operates a deferred annual bonus scheme for senior executives. Under the provisions of the scheme members are
required to defer 40% of their annual bonus which is used to acquire shares to that value. In addition, employees have the option
to defer a further portion of annual bonus to acquire additional shares, up to a maximum of 35% of annual bonus. 
The deferred shares are held in trust for a period of three years. At the end of the three year period employees will receive these
shares together with a matching element from the company. The quantum of the matching element is dependant upon earnings
per share growth targets. The maximum matching element obtainable is three times the deferred shares originally held for an
employee.
Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The long-term incentive plan was established as an incentive scheme for executive directors and other selected senior executives.
Under the terms of the scheme, employees may be awarded shares equal in value up to 50% of basic salary. The grant of awards
is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The shares are held in trust and released after three years pro rata to
achievement of the performance target. The performance criteria is the Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) of the comparator group
which currently comprises the members of the FTSE 250 (but excluding Investment Trusts) but for future years the remuneration
committee has the discretion in addition to relate the TSR to the Defence sector or the Support services sector. Shares vest fully if
the company’s performance equals or exceeds the upper quartile of the comparator group but there is no vesting if performance is
below the median.
Each time share awards are made under the LTIP employees are entitled to invest, subject to certain conditions, up to 5% of basic
salary to purchase additional shares in the company (‘Retained Shares’). These shares are held in the trust for at least three years
and they are then matched on a 1:1 basis with further shares (‘Matching Shares’). 
Share incentive plan (SIP)
The group operates a share incentive plan open to all employees. Under this plan employees are granted share options subject to
the group meeting certain financial profit targets. Options are granted at the market value on date of the award and vest
unconditionally if the employee remains in service for a period of 3 years from the date of the award. The contractual life of the
options is five years and there are no cash settlement alternatives.
Employee Share Option Savings Plans (ESOP)
The group operates Share Option Savings Plans for all eligible employees, whereby employees can save towards the exercise
price payable for an award of share options. The exercise price of these options is set at 90% of the market value of the share
price at the date of grant. Under awards granted by the group, the savings period is ether 3 or 5 years for UK based employees
and 2 years for US based employees. At the end of the savings period, the options vest and the option holders have a 6 month
window in which to exercise their options.

the options were granted before 7 November 2002. These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not
need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised was £3.44 (2005: £2.95).
For the options outstanding as at 31 March 2006 the weighted average remaining contractual life is 1.4 years (2005: 1.6 years).

options outstanding at the year end was £2.26 – £3.84 (2005: £2.26 – £3.00).
Deferred annual bonus scheme
As noted above the deferred annual bonus scheme is open to senior executives. The scheme was formally approved by
shareholders on 27th July 2005 and the first period runs from this date to 31st March 2006. In accordance with the provisions of
IFRS 2 a cost of £1,298,000 has been included within the financial statements representing services provided by the employees
under the terms of this scheme. The first issue of any shares under this bonus scheme will take place following the publication and

Share incentive plan
The share incentive plan was introduced with effect from 1st June 2005. Under the rules of the scheme, employees will receive
shares dependent upon the group achieving certain profit targets. In the period ended 31st March 2006, a cost of £215,000 has
been included within the financial statements representing the fair value of shares that are expected to be issued following the
publication of the group’s results. The first shares are expected to be awarded in June 2006.

do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised is £3.71 (2005: £2.86).
For the options outstanding as at 31 March 2006 the weighted average remaining contractual life is  4.2 years (2005: 4.1 years).

outstanding at the year end was £2.20 – £2.61 (2005: £2.20 – £2.58).
Share option valuation assumptions
The fair value of options granted were measured using the Black-Scholes method for the share option plans and Employee Share
Options Savings Plans, the Monte-Carlo method for the grants under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, and a simplified Black-
Scholes method for the matching shares granted within the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The weighted average assumptions used in
determining fair value of options granted were as follows:
Share options 
Long-term incentive plan Share options plans savings plans
2006 2005 2006 2005 2006 2005
Dividend yield 2.9% 3.4% 3.0% 3.1% – 3%
Expected volatility 23.9% 24.2% 21.8% 22.6% – 23.1%
Risk–free interest rate 4.1% 5.2% 4.3% 4.6% – 4.4%
Expected life 3 years 3 years 5 years 5 years – 4.1years
Exercise price 334p 267p 324p 295.5p – 261p
No options were issued under the share savings plan during the year ended 31st March 2006.
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility (calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share
options), adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan includes a market vesting condition linked to the Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) of a comparator
group which requires the volatility of comparator companies’ share prices and the average correlation between the share prices of
the Company and the comparator companies to be considered in assessing the fair value of options granted. The following
approach has been adopted for these items:
Comparator company volatility – Annualised, daily historic volatility assessed over a period prior to the date of grant that
corresponds to the period over which the TSR is being projected;
Company correlation – Taken as the average correlation of TSR between all of the companies over the same historic period.

On 27 April 2006 the group purchased the share capital of four vehicle support companies, Lex Transfleet Limited, Lex Defence
Limited, Lex Defence Management Limited and RAC Software Solutions Limited from RAC plc, part of Aviva plc for a total
consideration of £87m.
35 Capital commitments
At 31 March 2006, amounts contracted for but not provided in the financial statements for the acquisition of property, plant and
equipment amounted to £43,000 (2005: £762,000).
36 Contingent liabilities
In the ordinary course of business group companies from time to time enter into contracts which can account for a substantial
part of the consolidated revenue.
In connection with these contracts, particularly with overseas customers, group companies are required to undertake significant
obligations in relation to the performance and financing of the contracts.
In the opinion of the directors, no further provision is required in respect of these obligations.
The company has not adopted amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for
accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where the company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group,
the company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the company treats
the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make 
a payment under the guarantee.

The group participates in five defined benefit pension schemes; the Shipbuilding Industries Scheme (SIPS), LAWDCs, the Local
Government Pension Scheme (LGPS), the Guidance Enterprises Group Pension Scheme and a US scheme. The UK schemes are
funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered funds. 
The US scheme was a new scheme in the year and is an unfunded scheme. The group hold a life assurance policy which is to be
used to fund retirement benefits arising. Under IAS 19 this insurance policy is deemed to be a non-qualifying insurance policy and
as such is not an asset of the pension scheme. The asset is instead a corporate-owned asset and is included within the balance
sheet (note 19).
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using
the projected unit credit method. Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and
overall expected rates of return are established by applying published forecasts to each category of scheme assets.
The assets and liabilities of the schemes at 31 March are:

Assumptions for pensioner longevity are based upon actuarial tables relevant to the specific schemes. For the main SIPS scheme
the actuarial table used is PMA 92/ PFA 92, which allows for expected increases in longevity. The table has been adjusted for
deferred members and pensioners to reflect actual scheme experience. In addition, following actuarial advice the mortality
assumption for the SIPS scheme for 2006 includes a medium cohort effect reflecting improved longevity of members born
between 1925 and 1945. The inclusion of this cohort effect strengthens the mortality assumption within the actuarial calculation.
The mortality assumption adopted predicts that a current 60 year old male would have a life expectancy to age 87 and a female
would have a life expectancy to age 90.
The assumption considered to be the most significant is the discount rate adopted. If the discount rate in the SIPS scheme were
to change by 0.1% then it is predicted that the deficit in the scheme would change by £6m.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
39 Explanation of transition to IFRS
As stated in note 2, these are the group’s first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by
the European Union.
The accounting policies set out in note 2 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 March
2006. The restated financial information for the year to 31 March 2005 has been prepared on the same basis with the exception 
of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation (IAS 32) and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement (IAS 39). In November 2004 the EU endorsed a reduced version of IAS 39 as issued previously by the IASB. 
With effect from 1 April 2005 the group has adopted IAS 39 in accordance with the guidance issued by the IASB.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared
in accordance with its old basis of accounting (UK GAAP). An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has
affected the group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows is set out in the following table and the notes that
accompany the tables.
IFRS 1 exemptions
IFRS 1 sets out the rules for an entity preparing its first IFRS financial statements. The entity is required to determine the IFRS
accounting policies in accordance with the IFRS that are in place and, in general, apply them retrospectively. There are a number
of possible exemptions from the retrospective application to assist an entity in making the transition. The group has taken the
following exemptions:
• Business combinations prior to the transition date (1 April 2004) have not been restated to an IFRS basis.
• All cumulative actuarial gains and losses on the group’s defined benefit pension schemes have been recognised in equity at the
date of transition.
• Financial instruments in the comparative period are recorded on the existing UK GAAP basis, rather than in accordance with
IAS 32 and IAS 39, which have been adopted from 1 April 2005.
• IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates requires translation differences relating to a net investment in a
foreign operation to be classified as a separate component of equity. In accordance with IFRS 1, the cumulative translation
differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero at the date of transition.
• IFRS 2 requires a profit and loss charge to be made in respect of all share-based payment arrangements based upon the fair
value of the shares at the date of grant. The group has taken advantage of the transitional rules that permit options issued prior
to 7 November 2002 to be excluded from this treatment.

Notes to the reconciliation of equity
(a) Property plant and equipment
Under IAS 17 Leases, long-term leases of land are considered to be operating leases and the land is not recognised on the
balance sheet. Any up-front payment made to obtain the right to use the land is capitalised as a lease prepayment and
recognised over the lease term as an operating lease expense. Accordingly £4m previously disclosed within property, plant 
& equipment under UK GAAP is reclassified as a long-term prepayment under IFRS. The related depreciation charge under
UK GAAP is reclassified as an operating lease charge under IFRS.
IAS 16 provides more definitive guidance in that it requires spare parts, stand-by and servicing equipment held for use 
over more than one accounting period are classified as property plant & equipment as opposed to inventories. Accordingly, 
a reclassification of £1m reducing inventories and increasing property, plant & equipment is reflected at 31 March 2005
(2004: £0.7m).
IAS 38 requires software costs that are not an integral part of a tangible fixed asset to be classified as intangible assets,
whereas UK GAAP included such costs as tangible fixed assets. Accordingly, net book value of £2.6m (2004: £1.8m)
previously disclosed as tangible assets under UK GAAP is reclassified as intangible assets under IFRS. 
IAS 40 requires that all land and buildings owned but not in use within the group are separately classified as investment
property. Accordingly, £0.9m previously disclosed as property, plant and equipment under UK GAAP has been separately
presented as Investment Property under IFRS.
(b) Goodwill and business combinations
IFRS requires that more intangible assets of an acquired business are separately recognised from goodwill if their fair value
can be measured reliably. Intangible assets recognised are then amortised over their useful life. As a result of acquisitions
made in the year ended 31 March 2005, intangible assets of £4.9m were transferred out of goodwill arising on acquisition,
with an associated amortisation charge of £0.1m for the year. 
In addition, IFRS 3 prohibits the amortisation of goodwill and accordingly the UK GAAP amortisation charge for the year
ended 31 March 2005 of £9.1m was reversed upon transition.
IFRS 3 also requires that subsequent adjustments made to fair values from business combinations made within 12 months 
of the date of acquisition are treated as prior period adjustments. As a result of fair value adjustments arising during the year
ended 31 March 2006 in respect of prior year acquisitions, goodwill has been increased by £0.2m from that previously
stated. This fair value adjustment also required the recognition of additional employee benefit liabilities of £2.5m and a
reduction in trade and other payables of £0.6m. The minority interest was also reduced by £0.9m to reflect the minority share
of the net asset adjustments made.
Goodwill of £4m in respect of a joint venture investment was also transferred from goodwill and included within the carrying
value of equity accounted investments upon conversion to IFRS.
(c) Equity accounted investments
Upon conversion to IFRS, certain adjustments were required to align the financial statements of joint ventures and associates
with the principles of IFRS. In particular, IFRS requires the inclusion of retirement benefit liabilities within the balance sheet. At
31 March 2005, these adjustments led to a reduction in the carrying value of equity accounted investments of £3.8m (2004:
£4.4m). 
(d) Employee benefits
IFRS requires liabilities within company sponsored pension schemes to be included within the reported assets of the group.
At 31 March 2005 this has required including a liability of some £61.7m (2004: £79.9m) within the balance sheet, including
the fair value adjustment arising as noted above. An associated deferred tax asset arising of £18.5m (2004: £24m) also arises
in respect of this adjustment.
In addition a non-current debtor balance arising under the previous UK GAAP accounting rules of £5m (2004: £5m) was
removed from the balance sheet. Deferred tax liabilities were also reduced by £1.5m (2004: £1.5m) as a result of the removal
of this asset. 
IFRS also contains more detailed guidance in accounting for other long-term employee benefits, including holiday pay and
retirement leave. As a result an additional liability of £2.5m (2004: £2.7m) has been included upon conversion to IFRS,
analysed a current liabilities of £1.6m (2004: £1.9m) and non-current liabilities of £0.9m (2004: £0.8m). An associated
deferred tax asset of £0.8m (2004: £0.9m) has also been recognised in respect of these additional liabilities.

(e) Deferred taxation
Under IFRS there is a requirement to show deferred tax assets separately from deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly a grossing
up adjustment of £1.9m has been made to deferred tax balances at 31 March 2005 (2004: £2.9m).
IFRS has also resulted in recognition of the following additional deferred tax assets as compared with UK GAAP:

(f) Income tax
Under IFRS there is a requirement to show income tax assets separately from income tax liabilities. Accordingly a grossing
up adjustment of £3.4m has been made to income tax balances at 31 March 2005 (2004: £2.7m).
Other adjustments arising from conversion to IFRS have resulted in a reduction in tax liabilities of £1.4m for the year ended
31 March 2005 being recognised in respect of contract accounting (note g)
(g) Contract accounting
IFRS contains more detailed guidance in respect of accounting for long-term contracts and service contracts, including
whether contracts should be aggregated or segregated. As a result of differences arising from previous UK GAAP accounting
treatment, contract related debtors were reduced by £0.5m at 31 March 2005 (2004: increase of £0.4m). Contract related
creditors were also increased by £4.2m (2004: £3.9m).
At 31 March 2005 this has also resulted in a reduction of income tax liabilities of £1.4m and at 31 March 2004 a reduction in
deferred tax liabilities of £0.9m.
(h) Cash and cash equivalents
IFRS contains more detailed rules in respect of set-off of borrowings against cash balances. As a result of these changes
cash balances have increased upon conversion to IFRS by £10.6m at 31 March 2005 (2004: £10.9m), with a corresponding
increase in the interest bearing loans and borrowings balances.

(i) Equity
The overall effect of transition to IFRS upon retained earnings can be summarised as follows:
31 March 2005 31 March 2004
£m £m
IFRS 2 – Share-based payments (note l) 3.4 1.0
IFRS 3 – Business combinations (note b) 8.3 0.6
IAS 10 – Post balance sheet events (note m) 12.1 11.1
IAS 18 – Revenue and contract accounting (note g) (3.2) (2.5)
IAS 19 – Retirement benefits (note d) (44.9) (59.4)
IAS 19 – Other employee benefits (note d) (1.8) (1.9)
IAS 31 – Equity accounted investments (note c) (3.8) (4.4)
(29.9) (55.5)
(j) Minority Interest
Upon conversion to IFRS, minority interest was reduced by £2.4m at 31 March 2005 (2004: £1.6m) representing the minority
share of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities.
(k) Provisions
In a change from UK GAAP , IFRS requires that provisions are analysed between those amounts that will be utilised within the
next twelve months and those that are longer-term in nature. As a result £12.6m (2004: £20.8m) of provisions have been
reclassified as current liabilities upon conversion to IFRS.
(l) Share-based payments
IFRS requires that charges are made in respect share-based transactions based upon fair values of the equity instruments
concerned, which is a change from UK GAAP .
For the year ended 31 March 2005 a charge of £0.5m arises in respect of equity settled share based payments which is
credited directly to equity within the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets of £0.6m (2004: £0.2m) also arise as a result of this
new accounting requirement.
Upon transition to IFRS, a creditor in respect of share options amounting to £2.8m (2004: £0.9m) has been reclassified as a
component of equity.
(m) Proposed dividends
IFRS requires that dividends are only recognised when they have been approved by shareholders. As a consequence of this
change from UK GAAP , trade and other payables have been reduced as compared to UK GAAP by the final proposed
dividend of £12.1m for the year ended 31 March 2005 (2004: £11.1m).

sheet. Consequently forward currency contracts with a positive fair value of £6,000, forward currency contracts with a negative fair
value of £670,000 and interest rate swaps with a negative fair value of £1,842,000 have been recognised in the group balance
sheet as at 1 April 2005, with a related deferred tax asset of £753,000.

Notes to the reconciliation of profit
(i) Revenue
IFRS contains more detailed guidance in respect of accounting for long-term contracts and service contracts, including
whether contracts should be aggregated or segregated for accounting purposes. As a result of differences arising from
previous UK GAAP accounting treatment, reported revenue for the year ended 31 March 2005 was reduced by £1.1m upon
conversion to IFRS.
The impact on the taxation charge of this adjustment was to reduce the tax charge for the year by £0.3m.
(ii) Business combinations, goodwill amortisation and intangible assets
Under IFRS goodwill is no longer systematically amortised, but is tested annually for impairment. As a result the amortisation
charge of £9.1m included within cost of sales has been reversed upon conversion.
IFRS also require that additional intangible assets are identified in business combination transactions as compared to UK
GAAP . Such intangible assets are subject to annual amortisation charges. The charge for the year arising from such
separately identified intangible assets was £0.1m, which has been included within administrative expenses.
IAS 12, Income Taxes, also contains changes to the treatment of fair value adjustments arising in business combinations. As
a result of these changes and the transactions noted above, the tax charge for the year was increased by £0.5m as
compared to UK GAAP .

VT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2006
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
39 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued
Notes to the reconciliation of profit continued
(iii) Employee benefits
IFRS introduces new methods of accounting for retirement benefits as compared to previous UK GAAP . Charges for
retirement benefits are based upon the service provided by employees in any one accounting period and are measured with
external actuarial advice. As a result of these changes additional charges to cost of sales of £2.9m and administration
expenses of £0.7m were incurred upon conversion to IFRS.
IFRS also contains more detailed rules in respect of accounting for other short and long-term employee benefits, including
holiday pay and long-service leave. The impact of adopting these rules for the year ended 31 March 2005 was to reduce cost
of sales by £0.2m.
The taxation charge for the year was reduced by £1m as a consequence of these changes.
(iv) Share-based payments
In a change from UK GAAP , IFRS requires that charges are made for all share based transactions, including employee share
options. These charges are based upon the fair value of the relevant equity instruments at the date of inception of the
transaction. As a result of this new accounting standard administration expenses were increased by £0.5m for the year
ended 31 March 2005.
The tax charge for the year was increased by £0.1m as a result of the adoption of this standard.
(v) Equity accounted investments
Where the group chooses under IAS 31 to adopt the equity method of accounting for investments in joint ventures and
associates, IFRS requires that the results of such investments are presented in the income statement for the year as a single
line item. This single line item is measured as the profit after taxation arising from such investments.
As a result financial income relating to joint venture investments of £1m has been reclassified upon conversion to IFRS as
profit arising from equity accounted investments. Similarly the reported taxation charge for the year has been reduced by
£4m with an equal reduction in profits arising from equity accounted investments.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Presentation of the financial statements
Description of business
VT Group plc is the parent company of the VT Group which is engaged in Support Services and Shipbuilding.
2 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to
the company’s financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are drawn up in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting principles.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the historical cost
convention.
The company is exempt under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 1, paragraph 5a, from the requirement to publish its own
cash flow statement, as its cashflows are included within the consolidated cash flow statement of the group.
Advantage has been taken of the exemption available under FRS 8 not to disclose details of transactions with other group
undertakings as the consolidated financial statements are shown on pages 68 to 119.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting,
in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen
but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19. Deferred taxation assets are recognised 
only to the extent that in the opinion of the directors, there is a reasonable probability that the asset will crystallise in the
foreseeable future.
Dividends paid and received
Dividends paid and received are included in the accounts in the period in which the related dividends are actually paid or received.
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation less any provisions for impairment in value.
Fixed assets and depreciation
Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each
asset on a straight line basis over the expected useful life as follows: 
Computer software  –  3 - 5 years 
Share based payments
The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) issued Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 20 ‘Share Based Payments’ in April 2004.
Although the company does not incur a charge under this standard, the issuance by the company to its subsidiaries of a grant
over the company’s options, represents additional capital contributions by the company in its subsidiaries. An additional
investment in subsidiaries results with a corresponding increase in shareholders equity. The additional capital contribution is based
on the fair value of the grant issued allocated over the underlying grant’s vesting period.
Events after the balance sheet date
The ASB issued FRS 21 ‘Events after the balance sheet date’ in May 2004. This standard replaced Statement of Standard
Accounting Practice 17 ‘Accounting for post balance sheet events’ and the main effect of this change is to prohibit the recording
of a provision for a proposed dividend where the dividend is declared after the balance sheet date. FRS 21 is applicable for
accounting periods beginning on or after 1st January 2005. Therefore final dividends are now only recognised in the profit and loss
account when shareholders have approved such amount and interim dividends are only recognised when paid.
3 Profit and loss account disclosures
The company has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The company profit on ordinary activities after tax was £15.4m (2005: £16.2m restated).
The company audit fee was £15,000 (2005: £14,000).
Dividend disclosures are provided in note 13 of the VT Group plc consolidated accounts.
The company had no employees during the year (2005: nil).
Details in relation to directors’ remuneration is set out in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 58 to 65.

The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) issued Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 20 ‘Share Based Payments’ in April 2004.

based on the fair value of the grant issued allocated over the underlying grant’s vesting period.
FRS 21 ‘Events after the Balance Sheet Date’ requires that dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be
recognised as a liability at that date as the liability does not represent a present obligation as defined by FRS 12 ‘Provisions,
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’. The final dividend accrued of £12,133,000 and the final dividend receivable of
£12,000,000, were reversed in the opening reserves.

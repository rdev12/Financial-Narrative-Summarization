Chairman’s review
Strategy 
Our return to growth has been shaped by a strategy that focuses 
on larger and more impactful high volume and high value targets, 
and utilises our strong technical excellence, marketing know-how 
and innovation across our five chosen markets of Automotive, 
Aerospace, Electronics, Energy and Medical.
Victrex is the world leader in high performance polymer solutions. 
We are a global business, with UK headquarters, which continues to 
steadily transform from its historic manufacturing and polymer sales 
focus into a more integrated global solutions provider, supporting 
and working with customers on short, medium and long term 
development programmes. With our investment in significant new 
production capacity nearing its conclusion, the combination of our 
market leadership, technical excellence and sizeable manufacturing 
capability offers us a strong platform to realise Victrex’s future 
potential and to truly differentiate ourselves from our competitors. 
Results
We delivered a strong and broad based growth performance 
this year, with all of our markets performing well. Group revenue 
of £252.6m was 14% ahead of the prior year (2013: £221.9m). 
We continued our innovation and new business commercialisation 
to reflect Victrex being more than just a manufacturer; we are 
becoming a more focused solutions provider for our customers.
Our profitability and ability to invest, alongside delivering 
appropriate returns to our shareholders, remained strong this year. 
Gross margins of 64.6% (2013: 66.6%) reflected a marginally higher 
cost of manufacture in the first half – which saw improvement in 
the second half year – and a softer sales mix driven by some shorter 
lifecycle Consumer Electronics business. Our long term pipeline of 
high volume and high margin opportunities keeps us well placed 
to retain our margin strength, with a complementary mix of future 
business opportunities. As a global business and a major exporter 
from our UK manufacturing base, we are not immune to the 
challenges of foreign currency and are redoubling our focus on 
cost efficiency and appropriate pricing, to ensure we can maximise 
profitability from top line revenue growth. We believe that the medium 
term opportunities to improve in these areas remain attractive.
The strong investment in our products, in capacity and in our 
research and development (‘R&D’) capabilities to deliver technical 
excellence remains a key differentiator for Victrex, particularly as 
we move downstream into new added value products and closer 
to our customers. By working with our customers and end users, 
we are working across the value chain – producing PEEK, developing 
PEEK and pioneering the market for PEEK in new applications. R&D 
expenditure of £15.7m was ahead of the prior year (2013: £14.6m), 
representing approximately 6% of revenue.
Group profit before tax of £102.7m was 9% ahead of the prior year 
(2013: £94.6m), as was earnings per share of 94.6p (2013: 86.5p). 
As we start to see our capital expenditure reduce next year, our 
longer term cash position remains attractive. The investment in new 
PEEK and new Aptiv film capacity was underpinned by continued 
strong cash generation, with the Group’s closing cash balance reaching 
£89.6m this year (2013: £91.6m) and no debt. Overall, our balance 
sheet remains robust, underpinning investment, providing reassurance 
to customers and enabling us to deliver appropriate returns 
for shareholders.
Looking ahead, we will refine our key financial metrics to focus 
on return on sales, earnings per share, research and development 
investment and sales from new products. We will also ensure that the 
sustainable benefits our products can bring to customers are measured, 
with sustainability being embedded in everything we do. Further 
details can be found in the CEO’s Strategy and Business Model section 
on pages 7 to 9 and the Sustainability Report on pages 20 to 31.
Our clear and focused product leadership strategy has 
underpinned our strong growth performance this year 
and keeps us well placed for the longer term.
The combination of our market leadership, 
technical excellence and sizeable manufacturing 
capability offers us a strong platform to realise 
Victrex’s future potential and to truly differentiate 
ourselves from our competitors. Larry Pentz

Annual Report 2014 / Victrex plc / 05 
Overview
Dividends
Our continued confidence in the strength of and prospects for our 
business is reflected in our progressive and sustainable dividend 
policy, which applies to both regular and special dividends. The 
Group is proposing to pay a special dividend of 50p per share, 
which reflects our robust balance sheet and is underpinned by 
strong cash generation, even after a year of record capital 
expenditure. Alongside our special dividend is a final dividend of 
33.76p (2013: 32.65p), with cover at 2.1x (2013: 2.0x). Our medium 
term focus is to maintain cover around or above this level, thereby 
supporting a sustainable future dividend. The full regular dividend 
for the year, incorporating interim and final dividend, is 45.15p per 
share (2013: 43.0p), an increase of 5%.
Board composition
The Board has a diverse range of complementary skills to 
support the strategic and operational direction of the Group. 
We recognise the importance of diversity at Board level and our 
Board members comprise different nationalities with a wide range 
of skills and experiences from different business backgrounds, 
including international and industrial expertise. Our current female 
representation on the Board is 29%, already consistent with the 
recommended minimum representation by 2015. 
Anita Frew retired as Chairman of the Board in September 2014 and 
I would like to thank Anita for her strong and inspired leadership and 
her significant contribution during her 14 years as a Board member, 
six as Chairman. Louisa Burdett joined the Group as Finance Director 
in January 2014 and brings her diverse career experience to bear, 
helping Victrex shape its strategy and future direction as we become 
a larger and more focused international business.
Board effectiveness
The Board is responsible for the Group’s strategic development, 
monitoring achievement of its business objectives, oversight of risk 
and maintaining a system of effective corporate governance, which 
includes the responsibilities for health, safety, environmental, social 
and ethical matters. A more detailed description of the governance 
processes that are embedded in our business are provided in the 
Corporate Governance section of this report, starting on page 35.
Governance
Sound governance is critical to our business and the Board regards 
the continuing setting, maintenance and review of the highest 
standards of corporate governance as a key objective. The framework 
for our approach is supported by the Audit, Currency, Nominations, 
Remuneration, Risk and Disclosure Committees. 
For details of our compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code throughout the year ended 30 September 2014 see our 
Corporate Governance Statement on page 35. 
Sustainability
We have made significant progress in our approach to sustainability 
over the last two years. Sustainability for Victrex is now firmly 
embedded in our business, whether that be around our environmental 
approach and maximising our resource efficiency; or in delivering 
products and applications which support sustainability and help 
reduce CO 2 for many of our customers – for example, in weight 
reduction within aerospace or automotive. This year, Victrex also 
refined its sustainability targets and we have a clear and bold vision 
statement and targets to strive for over the coming years. Further detail 
can be found in the Sustainability Report on pages 20 to 31.
People and safety
Victrex relies on the skills, experience and competence of our people 
to drive our business into new applications and new geographies, as 
well as operating our assets to the highest standards of safety and 
with the highest regard for the environment. 
Victrex was recognised with the Order of Distinction for its Safety 
record and processes by the Royal Society for the Prevention 
of Accidents (RoSPA) this year, a strong achievement. We also 
recorded no lost time accidents, a measure of our safety practices. 
Victrex was also listed in the top ten UK companies for the quality 
of its goods and services by Management Today.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our employees 
for their significant contribution in a year of strong performance 
for Victrex. Whilst we face a challenging 2015, the inherent passion, 
innovation and performance of Victrex employees remain key assets 
for Victrex and its success in the future. 
Outlook
Looking forward, our new PEEK and Aptiv film capacity investments 
will put Victrex in a good position to capture more impactful and 
value creating business over the coming years. Our 2015 financial 
year has started well and although currency headwinds remain 
considerable, we now anticipate being able to fully cover the FX 
impact, reflecting our positive trading momentum and more recent 
exchange rates. With a continued focus on growth and efficiency, 
Victrex remains well placed for the year ahead.

Chief Executive’s review
Our strategy is helping to accelerate growth, transforming Victrex from its 
manufacturing and sales roots into an integrated and focused solutions partner.
Last year we communicated our evolved strategy which focuses 
on Product Leadership. Put simply, this blends our inherent technical 
excellence, marketing know-how and innovation to deliver superior 
and leading edge products and solutions for our customers and 
our markets. 
Our strategy also means that we are focused on a smaller number 
of larger and more impactful targets in the future. Rather than 
manufacturing a product and chasing every single sales opportunity, 
we will truly pioneer the development of the market for PEEK and our 
polymers. Our focused strategy will also help us to translate and sell more 
of our materials within our markets, further building on our position as 
market leader. Our strategy is supported by our significant investment 
in new production capacity, which will come online during 2015, at a 
time when the diversity and breadth of new business opportunities are 
growing, validating our decision to invest. Aligned with our technical, 
marketing and innovation strengths, our capacity will act as an enabler 
for larger business opportunities and opens the door to commercial 
discussions with a wider range of potential customers, helping to 
differentiate us from our competitors. 
Our customers continue to specify VICTREX PEEK and our polymers 
to replace metal and other polymers, and to capture a unique 
combination of performance properties, which lead to application 
benefits such as lightweighting to improve efficiency and durability, 
energy and emissions reduction; improved reliability; environmental 
tolerance; as well as faster patient recovery and clinical benefit in 
medical applications. Getting our materials specified requires detailed 
and diligent pre-development work, using our strong technical 
expertise. We have proven time and again that, once specified, we 
can build the position of our materials within ourmarkets, whether 
it be more PEEK polymers on aircraft, in cars, in smartphones, in oil 
and gas operations, or in newer and emerging medical areas. 
Over the course of the year we demonstrated that our strategy is 
helping us to drive growth and enhance value across our markets 
of Automotive, Aerospace, Electronics, Energy and Medical. Going 
forward, we will continue to move further downstream towards our 
end customers with new technologies and product forms (eg pipes, 
film), principally through organic means. We will continue to consider 
acquisitions at the right price, but only if they can accelerate our 
growth and reduce development time. All of this will broaden the 
applications for our products, an area we continue to invest in. 
In the future, we aspire to maintain our margin strength and enhance 
our profitability and shareholder value, particularly as we work 
to fill our new capacity with a diverse mix of more impactful and 
large scale business, thereby improving our medium term operating 
efficiencies. Our future growth programmes remain healthy across 
our three growth horizons, with a mix of long and short lifecycle 
business, and a focus on more impactful developments. Working 
with our customers as genuine long term solutions partners on 
development programmes will provide mutual benefits. 
By helping our customers to solve their own technical challenges 
and gain competitive advantage, we will continue to provide a 
clear point of difference for Victrex.

Financial review
Group financial results
Victrex delivered a strong performance in 2014, reflecting a focused 
strategy which is accelerating growth across our five chosen markets of 
Automotive, Aerospace, Energy, Electronics and Medical. Growth was 
driven in the first half of the year by an outperformance in our core PEEK 
resin business and in the second half by new business in Consumer 
Electronics. Our higher margin Speciality Products and Invibio medical 
business delivered continuing growth year on year.
Group revenue for the period was 14% ahead of the prior year (2013: 
£221.9m) but with a slightly lower average selling price of £71.1/kg 
(2013: £76.0/kg). This was due to currency and a softer sales mix, 
principally the lower priced but higher volume Consumer Electronics 
business. Excluding Consumer Electronics volumes, but still reflecting 
some currency impact, our average selling price remained broadly 
stable year on year at £74.6/kg. Volumes were particularly strong, 
22% ahead of last year at 3,551 tonnes (2013: 2,920 tonnes) following 
a broad based performance across each quarter. 
Our PEEK powder manufacturing capacity utilisation at year end was 
78% (2013: 62%), compared to our nameplate capacity of 4,250 tonnes 
(although effective capacity is slightly lower than this when maintenance 
and grade changes are factored in). This level of utilisation, and year 
on year increase, supports our decision to invest in new manufacturing 
assets which will support the breadth of new and larger business 
opportunities which we are focused on. Our PEEK manufacturing 
process remains technically superior, enabling us to differentiate 
versus competitors, whether we use raw materials from our own 
upstream assets (principally BDF, one of the key precursors to PEEK) 
or BDF which we source externally.
Divisional summary
Growth across Victrex Polymer Solutions (VPS) reflects broad based 
growth across our markets as long term global megatrends such as 
fuel efficiency in Automotive and Aerospace, and yield and reliability in 
Oil and Gas, remain strong, irrespective of cyclical patterns. These longer 
lifecycle and higher margin markets, together with our Invibio medical 
business form the bulk of our portfolio, remain attractive over the 
longer term. In the Consumer Electronics market, we anticipate a 
continuation of volumes during the first half of FY 2015 and we are 
working hard to use this opportunity as a platform into more sustainable 
and longer lifecycle business in the future. 
The higher margin Speciality Products business continued to progress, 
particularly Aptiv film, where we saw continued demand and recorded 
a 17% increase in revenue over the year. Our new Aptiv film capacity 
came online in Q1 FY 2015 and will enhance our ability to supply 
ultra-thin and ultra-wide film to customers in the future. Film remains 
a key differentiator for Victrex, particularly in the Aerospace and 
Electronics markets, where its unique combination of properties 
helps overcome complex technical challenges.
In our Invibio medical business, we saw a steady return to growth 
over the year, compared to the weaker period of destocking seen in 
the first half of last year. Revenue in Invibio was 5% ahead of the prior 
year at £53.4m (2013: £50.8m). This predominantly reflects continued 
improvement in sales to the spine market in the mature geographies 
of the US and Europe with sales to emerging countries, particularly 
China (with double-digit growth), progessing well. Away from spine, 
our emerging medical businesses including Dental, Trauma and Knee, 
and sales to new geographies continue to show steady progress. 
Group gross margin of 64.6% (2013: 66.6%) reflects a slightly softer 
sales mix and higher cost of manufacture in the first half and the lower 
priced Consumer Electronics business and currency in the second half. 
With an improvement in our cost of manufacture programme over the 
course of the year, H2 gross margin saw an improvement on the first half 
year, to 65.1% (H1 2014: 64.0%). We are renewing our focus on cost of 
manufacture in FY 2015, with the aim of improving our medium term 
efficiency, particularly as our new manufacturing capacity starts to 
ramp up.

the increase seen in 2013. With significant overhead investment in recent 
years to create the building blocks for our future growth, we anticipate 
that overhead growth will be more moderate in the medium term. To 
support our solutions-driven approach to customers, we continued to 
invest in research and development, of which approximately 85% relates 
to market and customer related product and application development. 
Our R&D expenditure increased to £15.7m this year (2013: £14.6m), 
representing 6% of revenue (2013: 7%). 
As a UK-based global exporter, currency had a £2.3m adverse 
impact on our profits for this year as our major trading currencies 
moved against the pound. Some of the 2014 impact arose from 
hedging Q2 outperformance volumes and the new Consumer Electronics 
business at less favourable spot rates, rather than up to 12 months 
in advance as part of our normal hedging policy. Looking forward, 
currency remains a considerable headwind for FY 2015, although 
we note the more recent favourable movement of the £/$ rate. We 
now anticipate being able to fully cover the FX impact, reflecting 
our positive trading momentum and more recent exchange rates.
Group profit before tax of £102.7m was 9% ahead of the prior year 
(2013: £94.6m), evidence that our strategy is accelerating growth. 
Basic earnings per share of 94.6p per share (2013: 86.5p per share) 
also reflects the lower effective tax rate of 21.9% (2013: 22.9%) 
resulting from the lower UK corporation tax rate.
Balance sheet
Our strong balance sheet remains a key competitive advantage, 
supporting our ability to invest for future growth, to provide 
security of supply to our customers and to support appropriate 
shareholder return. Net assets at 30 September 2014 totalled 
£353.4m (2013: £313.7m). Our working capital reflects how we 
choose to differentiate ourselves through product leadership and 
security of supply for both existing and future customers and end users. 
Inventory levels reduced year on year to £44.2m (2013: £51.1m). 
This reflects higher sales performance and product demand across 
the breadth of our product grades. Trade receivables are in line with 
the prior year, with receivables which are either current or less than 
30 days overdue at 98% (2013: 97%). Trade payables reflect 
consistent creditor days with the prior year, underpinning our 
commitment to our suppliers to pay within agreed terms to maintain 
strong working and strategic relationships. Return on capital 
employed (ROCE) has reduced slightly following a period of high 
capital investment in manufacturing assets but remains ahead 
of many peers. ROCE for the year was 22.7% (2013: 23.2%) and 
we believe there is an opportunity to enhance ROCE once our new 
capacity ramps up and utilisation rates improve.
Cash flow and capacity investment
Despite 2014 being our highest level of capital expenditure 
(2014: £65.6m; 2013: £40.7m) to support investment, Victrex continued 
to see healthy cash generation. Cash generated from operations was 
£118.3m (2013: £100.9m) representing an operating cash conversion 
of 116% (2013: 107%). Investment was principally in the construction 
of our new PEEK plant (we announced in October 2012 that we 
expected to invest £90m in new capacity) alongside our Aptiv film 
facility. This is our third PEEK plant and it will be commissioned from 
early 2015 (the second quarter of Victrex’s financial year). Our capacity 
investment (an additional 2,900 tonnes) reflects continued underlying 
confidence in our business and the breadth of future opportunities, 
where global megatrends remain strong. The investment has continued 
to support our commercial discussions, particularly as we focus on larger 
and more impactful long term opportunities, giving our customers 
confidence that capacity will be available to support larger long-term 
applications. Our Aptiv film investment will increase capacity for 
film, which is currently used in Aerospace and Electronics markets.
Taxation paid during the period was £21.1m (2013: £21.7m), which 
reflects the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate, partially offset 
by a stronger trading performance. Total dividends during the period 
increased to £37.3m (2013: £32.7m), reflecting the increase in the 
FY 2013 final dividend. As a result, and despite the high capital 
expenditure, the closing Group cash balance as at 30 September 2014 
was £89.6m with no debt (2013: £91.6m; no debt).
Special dividend
Our proposed special dividend of 50p per share is underpinned by 
strong cash generation, despite high capital expenditure this year, 
with the payout representing a total of £43m, enabling the Group 
to still retain a robust balance sheet position. Alongside our special 
dividend is a final dividend of 33.76p (2013: 32.65p), with cover 
improving to 2.1x (2013: 2.0x). Our medium term focus is to 
maintain cover around or above this level, to support a sustainable 
future dividend. 
These dividends reflect both our cash performance and underlying 
confidence in the growth programmes and prospects for our business. 
The full regular dividend for the year, incorporating interim and final 
dividend, is 45.15p per share (2013: 43.0p), an increase of 5%.

VPS delivered a strong performance this year. The division generated 
revenue 16% ahead of the prior year of £199.2m (2013: £171.1m) 
reflecting broad based growth across our strategic markets and a 
particularly strong performance from core PEEK resin sales in the 
first half, alongside continued progress in Speciality Products where 
Aptiv sales recorded a 20% increase over the year. The second half 
was characterised by continued broad based market growth, aided 
by strong volumes in Consumer Electronics, with some continuation 
of volumes anticipated for the first half of 2015. Gross margin 
at 58.3% (2013: 60.3%) reflects a softer mix, adverse currency 
and the slightly increased cost of manufacture in H1, which saw 
improvement in H2. Sales, marketing and administrative expenses 
increased by £4.4m to £38.9m (2013: £34.5m) with continued 
investment to develop our organisational infrastructure and 
capabilities to drive our future growth initiatives. The resulting 
operating profit of £77.2m was 13% ahead of the previous year 
(2013: £68.6m).
Market overview
Whilst we remain a market-led business, geographic trends remain 
important. Our core geographies of the US, Europe and Asia-Pacific 
all performed well this year. Sales volume in Europe of 1,778 tonnes 
was 9% ahead of the prior year (2013: 1,637 tonnes) driven by good 
growth in all key markets, particularly Automotive. In the US, sales 
volumes of 878 tonnes was 14% ahead of the prior year (2013: 770 
tonnes). In Asia, sales volume of 895 tonnes was 74% ahead of the 
prior year (513 tonnes) with good growth in industrial and transport 
applications, a steady performance in semiconductor applications, 
alongside a much stronger performance in Consumer Electronics. 
Japan also saw a steady recovery, from a low base, with sales ahead 
by approximately 19% year on year. 
Energy/Industrial sales volume at 1,196 tonnes was ahead of last 
year (1,125 tonnes). Increased demand for industrial machinery and 
equipment, and increased emerging market demand drove growth, 
aided by good growth in oil and gas, although drilling activity 
remains patchy. We also remain cognisant of the recent softer oil 
price and the potential implications for near term capital expenditure 
in oil and gas projects, although long term trends remain supportive. 
Transport sales volume increased 20% to 962 tonnes (2013: 799 
tonnes) with strong sales into Automotive and Aerospace. The 
increase in Automotive sales reflects the trend towards highly 
durable and weight saving materials, as global megatrends of 
emissions reduction in cars and fuel saving for aeroplanes remain 
strong. The use of PEEK polymers in transmission and braking 
systems remains an important part of our offering, in helping to 
reduce weight, improve efficiency and durability. We also continue 
to work on other future programmes, including gears. In Aerospace, 
build rates steadily increased during 2014. We continue to work on 
a number of opportunities to translate the existing level of our 
materials across the aircraft, as well as some emerging retrofitting 
opportunities for existing aircraft. Brackets and fasteners remain the 
key product areas in focus, as well as film. Beyond our key end 
customers of Boeing and Airbus, pre-development work with 
Victrex materials are helping shape future performance.
Becoming the partner of choice in delivering 
solutions to customers remains key.

Strategic report
COMAC in China continues, which offers an attractive medium 
to longer term opportunity. 
Electronics sales increased markedly to 1,031 tonnes (2013: 628 tonnes) 
reflecting both an improved performance in semiconductor applications, 
but supplemented by growth in Consumer Electronics. Whilst 
Consumer Electronics has slightly softened margins this year, this 
remains very attractive and viable high volume business and we 
believe that more sustainable and longer lifecycle business in this 
area remains achievable, complementing our other longer lifecycle 
portfolio opportunities.
Product and market development
Becoming the partner of choice in delivering solutions to customers 
remains key. Our Speciality Products business, driven predominantly 
by Aptiv film used in many acoustic applications, delivered a good 
performance, with sales increasing by 17% and pricing ahead year 
on year. Our other existing Speciality Product platforms are coatings, 
pipes and composites. Our pre-development work with Magma 
continues and whilst field testing trials remain ongoing, further test 
orders of piping were shipped during the year, to both oil majors 
and oil service companies. Commissioning of the spooling system, 
which is part of the laying process for Magma pipe, was also 
concluded after the year end.
Development pipeline
The development pipeline reflects our focus on larger and more 
impactful targets, in line with our strategy to drive value rather 
than just focusing on the total volume of opportunities and 
chasing every PEEK sale. Our portfolio management approach 
ensures we focus on the deliverability of our development pipeline 
rather than just the volume of opportunities. Our strategy KPIs 
show five ‘mega-programmes’ of PEEK-OPTIMA
®
 HA-ENHANCED 
(Spine), JUVORA (Dental), Victrex Pipe/Magma, Trauma and Knee, 
each offering revenue potential of at least £50m in their peak year, 
alongside more typical ‘Horizon 1’ (0-2 years) opportunities. We 
will also continue to report the mature annualised volume (MAV) 
of 2,141 tonnes (30 September 2013: 2,064 tonnes) which is if all 
of the developments were successfully commercialised. 
Growth drivers
We continue to see good growth potential for our business, 
reflected by our strong development pipeline, as well as 
opportunities to target further market penetration or geographies 
through strategic marketing. Continued investment in talent, 
technology and new capacity means that we are well placed 
to take advantage of growth opportunities – whether organically 
or through selective acquisitions – in delivering solutions to our 
customers and markets.

Automotive: The trend of highly durable and 
weight saving materials in cars reflects the need 
to reduce emissions and improve fuel efficiency
Focus on Automotive
The demand for materials which offer durability and can 
help meet the trend of reducing CO 2 emissions remains 
strong. With global mobility and interconnection being 
a key global megatrend, transport remains an attractive 
area for Victrex. We remain at the forefront of helping 
the global transport industry, whether it is in Aerospace 
or Automotive.
With over 1 billion cars and estimates of over 100 
million new vehicles per year by 2018, improving 
energy efficiency and emissions is vital to the 
sustainability of personal transport.
Victrex materials are helping shape future performance 
in powertrain technology within vehicles, building on 
PEEK’s long standing reputation in ABS braking systems. 
Efficiency improvements are reliant on the reduction 
of friction associated energy losses. Through the use 
of Victrex PEEK in transmission seals and thrust washers, 
frictional losses are reduced by approximately 20% 
compared with metal based or incumbent materials, 
enabling reduced transmission power consumption. 
Victrex also has a number of development programmes 
focused on other applications including gears. As ever 
more challenging regulatory criteria demands CO 2 
reductions but with better performance, Victrex 
materials have a key role to play in the Automotive 
market over the coming years. www.victrexplc.com

Market overview
Spine remains our core market and saw continued progress on 
2013. The Spine market generated sales of £40.1m, an increase 
of £0.8m (2%) on the prior year. Improvement reflects steady 
recovery from de-stocking, alongside translating Spine sales 
into newer emerging markets, which continue to be attractive 
for us, particularly China. Outside of Spine, Arthroscopy remains 
our other current revenue play. In our emerging medical markets of 
Dental, Trauma and Knee, we have made steady progress this year, 
with partner agreements signed and new channels to market being 
explored which will accelerate growth in the medium to longer 
term. In short, the demand for newer and more radical solutions 
which are proven to deliver clinical benefit remains high. We retain 
our focus on markets with high procedure rates and surgery which 
can deliver proven clinical benefit by using our materials. 
Product and market development
Invibio is the proven market leader in providing versatile and high 
performance PEEK based polymer solutions to the implantable 
medical device market. With a strong track record and unrivalled 
expertise, our materials are used extensively across a number of 
core applications such as spinal fusion and Arthroscopy, as well 
as in emerging opportunities such as Dental, Trauma and Knee.
Spine
One of our focus areas, alongside our position in mature markets, 
has also been in emerging geographies where we have increased 
our regulatory approvals this year. To support our ability to drive 
adoption and subsequently growth, we have continued to invest in 
marketing and regulatory expertise, with new regulatory expertise 
in South America and capability in China. New product offerings 
also comprise one of our growth opportunities. Our PEEK-OPTIMA

Focus on PEEK-OPTIMA
® 
HA-ENHANCED 
With regulatory approval secured in both Europe and 
the US, roll-out and adoption of this innovative product 
will be at the forefront of our activity in 2015. Spine 
companies continue to look at ways where they can 
differentiate their offering and many surgeons are 
interested in methods where they can enhance 
bone-on growth and improve clinical benefit. 
PEEK-OPTIMA HA-ENHANCED is a version of PEEK 
which improves bone-on growth for patients on all 
sides of the spinal device, offering a more integrated 
solution, avoiding the need for coatings. A product 
which promotes bone growth is more effective for 
patients, as well as omitting the extra processing time 
and expense of other alternative bone on-growth 
technologies, for example coatings. Deployment by 
surgeons remains key in this area and we continue to 
attend trade shows and develop our clinical network to 
drive adoption and gain acceptance, thereby helping to 
support future growth in this area.

Emerging businesses
Our activities in emerging businesses were driven by JUVORA, 
our dental brand, which offers a certified dental disc, providing our 
customers and their patients with an effective metal free denture 
solution, with improved comfort and fit. Following the traction for 
dental last year across geographies, we now have 130 labs operating 
under our certified training programme. JUVORA also has US FDA 
regulatory approval. The trends for the denture market are extremely 
encouraging and we believe that the JUVORA product is well 
positioned to be the material of choice for a significant patient 
population that could reach as many as 1.5 million denture 
applications per year. Whilst we have secured some revenue to date, 
JUVORA remains as a Horizon 2 (2-5 year) opportunity. During the 
course of the year, we also began exploring a more direct route to 
market with dental companies, rather than simply through dental 
laboratories. Given the fragmentation in this market, we believe this 
could help accelerate adoption and penetration in the market over 
the medium term. 
Our other emerging opportunities include Trauma (Horizon 2; 
2-5 years) where our materials can deliver superior performance 
and accelerate healing, as well as offering durability and less 
complexity than many incumbent solutions. In Horizon 3 (5 years +) 
we see significant potential in Knee, where revision rates from existing 
metal based materials are high, as well as high patient dissatisfaction. 
We signed a partner agreement to progress pre-development work on 
Knee during the year. Partnerships to accelerate adoption will be one 
option for us to drive growth in the medical markets over the coming 
years. Pre-development work remains ongoing and the offering of 
a new PEEK based knee which can be tailored to a patient’s needs 
within a much shorter space of time and which provides superior 
clinical benefit, remains attractive. Knee could be particularly 
relevant in emerging geographies, where kneeling rates and the 
typically higher proportion of manual work requires an effective 
and sustainable solution. The proven reaction by surgeons within 
these markets to utilise materials that deliver clinical benefit and 
patient satisfaction gives us confidence on our portfolio of long 
term opportunities across medical markets.

Risk management
Risk management is embedded in Victrex’s culture, ensuring that we 
assess risks as part of delivering our strategy.
1
 
Risk communication – Effective communication
At Victrex, our risk management structure is as follows:
Victrex plc Board
The Board undertakes an annual review of the effectiveness of the risk management framework, policy and procedures, the performance 
of the Audit Committee and also approves the risk management policy. Twice yearly, the Board reviews the key risks in the corporate risk 
register, thereby evaluating the level of risk it is prepared to accept in pursuit of Victrex’s strategic objectives.
The corporate risk register is consolidated from registers within business functions and projects. The corporate risk register tracks the 
status ratings against each line of defence and the action plan, therefore allowing it to be used effectively as a record of the completion 
of risk improvement actions and their revised likelihood and impact.
Audit Committee
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee are explained on page 42. These responsibilities have been expanded from October 2014 
to include reviewing the Company’s risk management systems, a role performed during the year by the Risk Management Committee 
(“RMC”). The risk management system is primarily designed to mitigate risk down to an acceptable level, rather than completely 
eliminate the risk, and the review can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of effective operation, compliance with 
laws and regulations and against material misstatement or loss.
The Company’s management are responsible for the identification, assessment, management and monitoring of risk, for developing, 
operating and monitoring the system of internal control and for providing assurance that it has done so. The Audit Committee receives 
reports from management on the effectiveness of those systems they have established.
The independent Business Assurance function supports the Audit Committee in its review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control, 
as do other independent assurance providers, for example the external auditor on matters identified during the course of its statutory audit work.
ELT Risk Management Committee
The Executive Leadership Team (‘ELT’) Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Group Finance Director, reviews the corporate risk register 
at least half yearly to ensure it remains relevant to the changing uncertainties threatening our business’s strategic objectives. During the year 
feedback from these reviews was provided to the RMC twice by the Group Finance Director. In turn the RMC reported twice during the year 
to the Board. With effect from October 2014 feedback will be provided at least twice yearly directly to the Audit Committee and the Board by 
the ELT Risk Management Committee, the former in respect of the risk management systems and the latter the key risks in the corporate risk 
register. The ELT Risk Management Committee comprises the ELT membership in addition to the Head of Business Assurance and Global SHE 
Manager. Prior to its cessation in October 2014 the RMC was chaired by Larry Pentz and comprised the executive Directors, Managing Director 
of Invibio, the General Counsel and Company Secretary, Head of Business Assurance, VPS Manufacturing Director and Global SHE Manager.
Risk Management Subcommittees
Risk management committees exist for business unit/functional levels. These meet and report up to the ELT Risk Management 
Committee at least half yearly, via their respective Chairs, who are ELT Risk Management Committee members.
Projects
Where it is appropriate, projects will have a project specific risk register which will be reported to the relevant business unit. www.victrexplc.com

Risk assessment – How do we assess and record risks?
When assessing risk, we consider:
» » External factors, including environmental, social and governance factors (ESG), arising 
from the environment in which we operate; and
» » I n t e rna l f a c t o r s arising from the nature of our business, our internal controls and processes.
Analysis and recording of risks
Executive managers take ownership of specific business risks. The likely causes and 
consequences of each risk are recorded. Each risk is evaluated based on its likelihood of 
occurrence and severity of impact on strategy, profit, regulatory compliance, reputation 
and/or people. Risks are evaluated at both a gross and a net level, ie before and after 
the effect of mitigation. All risks are positioned on a risk ranking matrix. This approach 
allows the identification and consistent evaluation of significant risks, as well as 
consideration of the effect of current lines of defence in mitigation. 
We look at three lines of defence:
1st: The day to day controls and processes put in place by management.
2nd: Management’s oversight activities over its first line controls and processes and risk 
management processes.
3rd: Independent business assurance provided by both third parties and in-house 
internal audit over the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls and 
processes in management’s first and second lines of defence.
Re-evaluation and challenge of risks
We seek to keep the risk registers up to date and relevant to our strategic objectives. 
The risk registers are regularly reviewed, challenged and debated. Risks are escalated 
as appropriate.
4
 
Risk response – How do we respond to risks?
For each risk, we decide whether to tolerate it, mitigate it through further control, 
transfer it (e.g. through insurance) or terminate the threat to the business.
We continually challenge the efficiency and effectiveness of existing internal controls 
and always seek to improve our risk management framework. The risk owners and the 
Business Assurance team allocate a status rating of appropriateness and effectiveness 
against each line of defence. This allows the risk register to record and track the 
completion of improvement recommendations. 
5
 
Risk governance – How do we 
evaluate and provide assurance 
over our management of risks? 
In Victrex, the processes in place to 
support the risk governance component 
of our risk management framework 
include the following:
» » For Board and internal audit, 
see pages 32 and 42 respectively.
» » The Chairman of each of these 
risk management subcommittees 
communicates significant output, 
activities and emerging and evolving 
risks to the meetings of the ELT Risk 
Management Committee, which 
reviews these and the risks in the 
corporate risk register. The three lines 
of defence model is recognised as best 
practice in relation to risk governance, 
and its inclusion on the face of our 
corporate risk register enhances the 
governance aspect of our risk 
management framework.
2
 
Risk agenda – Why do we undertake risk management?
Risk objectives
The Board is responsible for determining the nature and extent of the risks it is willing 
to take in delivering Victrex’s strategic objectives. The strategic risk appetite for the 
business is defined in the business strategy and is reviewed annually.
Victrex undertakes risk management to improve the resilience, performance, 
sustainability and success of its business, whilst in turn facilitating decisions and 
providing useful information to shareholders.
Risk strategy
The Board is responsible for creating the framework for the Group’s risk management to 
operate effectively. This risk management framework includes risk assessment, response, 
communication and governance. The Board is also responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
and proportionate resources are allocated to risk management activities. www.victrexplc.com

Principal risks
Risk area and description Mitigation
Safety, health and environment
The Group’s success is dependent on us conducting 
our business safely. Given the nature of our various 
manufacturing facilities, a significant operational 
disruption could adversely affect our ability to make 
and supply products.
The environment in which Victrex operates is subject 
to numerous legislative and regulatory requirements, 
where failure to comply could adversely impact 
our employees, our manufacturing capability, the 
environment or the attractiveness of our business 
or products to various stakeholders. 
 
We employ a dedicated Safety, Health and Environment (‘SHE’) department to assist 
line management and to provide expert guidance.
We have policies and procedures to; efficiently, safely and compliantly manage all 
our operations; protect the safety and health of our employees, contractors and 
visitors; and both manage our environmental responsibly and continually improve 
our resource efficiency.
As our manufacturing facilities are regulated, we are subject to close regulatory 
review, for example by the Environmental Agency under the Environmental 
Permitting Regulations.
Further detail is contained in the Sustainability Report on pages 20 to 31.
Technological change
Innovation and product leadership are key to 
the success of our business. We provide innovative 
solutions to help our customers overcome their 
technological challenges. 
Innovation failings could result in a lack of competitive 
advantage and relevant new products, erosion of 
margin and failure to achieve sustainable earnings.
 
We are future thinkers, continually assessing and identifying market needs and 
capturing value as product leaders. We serve a diverse range of markets and work 
directly with our customers, end users, OEMs and industry leading decision makers 
to develop a pipeline of new applications. 
With long-term megatrends in our favour, we have a diverse mix of new growth 
opportunities. Further information can be found on page 2.
We actively invest to advance our technology skills and knowledge, in commercial 
and technical specialists and global technical centres, to underpin our growth and 
deliver sustainable earnings growth for our shareholders.
Recruitment and retention of the right people
Our success depends on recruiting and retaining the 
right people in all areas of our business. Victrex relies 
heavily on the skills, experience and competence of our 
people to drive business in existing and new markets, 
as well as to operate our manufacturing assets safely 
and with a strong regard to the environment.
 
We have strategies in place (collectively our “People Strategy”) to attract and retain 
the best talent, provide opportunities for personal development, encourage diversity 
and recognise and reward excellence. The People Strategy is regularly discussed at 
Board, Executive Leadership Team and functional level. Our employees have clear 
objectives and development plans, aligned to our strategy, and participate in formal 
and informal training programmes. We have succession plans in place for key roles 
and develop our future leaders so that we are able to promote internally as well as 
bringing in new talent from the outside. We operate an equal opportunities policy 
and regard this as a commitment to make both full use of the talents and resources 
of all our employees.
Foreign currency risk
The Group exports the majority of its product out of the 
UK, but has a significant Sterling cost base. Fluctuations 
in exchange rates between Sterling and US Dollar, Euro 
and Yen could cause profit and balance sheet volatility.
 
The Group adopts a hedging policy to mitigate short-term currency risk. This 
policy is managed by the Currency Committee and is detailed in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 35 to 43.
The Group’s strategic objectives can only be achieved if certain 
risks are taken and managed effectively. We have listed below the 
most significant risks that may affect our business, although there 
are other risks that may occur and impact the Group’s performance. www.victrexplc.com
Annual Report 2014 / Victrex plc / 19 
Strategic report
Risk area and description Mitigation
Business continuity and supply chain
It is essential to ensure continuity of supply and service 
to our customers and that we can operate even if 
a significant incident did occur.
Failure to maintain a secure supply of high quality products 
to our customers by, for example, an unexpected upsurge 
in demand or delays in the implementation of major 
capital expenditure programmes, could lead a capacity 
shortage and loss of earnings.
 
It is our policy to keep capacity well ahead of demand by continual investment in 
our supply chain so that our customers can be confident that we can meet their 
requirements today and in the future. The current construction of our third PEEK 
plant, which is expected to be operational in 2015, will increase capacity by 2,900 
tonnes to in excess of 7,000 tonnes. Our two existing PEEK plants are able to 
operate independently, thereby reducing the impact of any operational disruption 
on our ability to continue manufacturing products.
Stocks of finished goods, which are held in a number of locations worldwide, 
should enable us to maintain supplies to our customers during any short-term 
disruption. Additionally, we work with our key suppliers to maintain appropriate 
stocks of key raw materials.
We have robust and comprehensive business continuity plans in place that are 
regularly reviewed to ensure their continued effectiveness.
Network and IT systems and security
A significant failure or interruption in our IT networks 
and systems could have a detrimental impact on our 
business. Data security is very important to us, as failure 
to appropriately process, store or share information 
could result in the loss of data, whether it be our data, 
or that of our employees or customers.
 
We continue to review and invest where appropriate in the development and 
maintenance of our IT infrastructure, systems and processes. 
We operate a firewall, antivirus software and monitor any attempted breaches and take 
action where necessary to ensure our infrastructure remains robust and appropriate. We 
have in place recovery plans and business continuity plans, which are regularly reviewed 
and tested.
Product liability
We sell into highly demanding end use applications 
and regulated markets. Any failure to supply our 
products in accordance with the specification could 
lead to loss of business and a potential product 
liability claim.
 
Victrex PEEK polymer is manufactured within a quality management system approved 
to ISO 9001:2008. Invibio PEEK-OPTIMA polymer is additionally manufactured within 
the requirements of ISO 13485:2003, a system of good manufacturing practice often 
used by the pharmaceutical industry and by medical device manufacturers. We have 
also attained ISO 17025:2005 General Requirements for Competence of Testing and 
Calibration Laboratories certification. There is a quality management process in place 
and the Group maintains appropriate levels of product liability insurance.
Changing global economic environment
Exposure to changes and events outside the Group’s 
control, such as external global economic conditions, 
markets or territories, as well as natural disasters, 
may impact the Group’s performance and its ability 
to achieve its strategic objectives.
 
The diverse nature of the Group’s markets, customers and the territories in which 
it operates, together with appropriate contingency planning, helps to mitigate the 
impact on the business of such changes and events. www.victrexplc.com

Sustainability is now firmly embedded 
in Victrex’s culture, ensuring that our 
sustainable products are recognised for 
providing a competitive advantage to our 
customers and markets, for example in 
reducing CO
2
 emissions in aircraft, as well 
as reflecting the strides we are making 
to maximise our own resources and be 
a responsible business.
Introduction from the Chief Executive
Victrex has made considerable progress in its sustainability 
journey over the last two years. Whilst financial results remain 
an important measure of success, to be a truly successful global 
business, we will work hard to continually improve our positive 
impact on the environment and society, and to ensure our 
sustainable products can deliver real competitive advantage 
to our customers and markets.
This year, we introduced a clear and bold sustainability vision and 
targets across our new focus areas of sustainable solutions, resource 
efficiency and social responsibility. For each of these areas, we have 
metrics to assess our performance against our 2023 goal, which is 
timed for the 30th anniversary of Victrex being formed (1993 saw 
the management buyout of Victrex from ICI). Our 2023 goals are 
clear and measurable, and we believe they will show real long term 
progress for Victrex, as a business that is using sustainability in a 
proactive way and to deliver a competitive advantage.

Sustainable solutions
Sustainable Solutions is our focus area which includes 
products and services, in line with our vision of delivering 
products which provide clear environmental and social 
benefits to society.
At Victrex, we enable many industries to deliver against their future 
challenges. In doing so, we are not only helping our individual 
customers solve problems, we are providing innovative and 
sustainable solutions across our markets, proving our real credentials 
in sustainability. Our industries continue to be challenged to achieve 
higher performance with less: less material, less energy, less waste, 
less noise, less time, less cost. This drives the need for innovative 
designs using our materials and expertise to bring them to market. 
The unique combination of properties and physical forms of Victrex 
materials help customers deliver against these challenges.
With proven expertise and over 35 years of experience, our customers 
choose to specify VICTREX PEEK in many of their applications, 
whether it be in aerospace to ‘fly lighter’, in automotive to ‘reduce 
wear’ and ‘improve durability’, in electronics to deliver ‘thinner, 
smaller and smarter’ devices, in energy to ‘improve durability’ and 
‘recover more’, or in medical applications to help address an ageing 
global population.
We retain a strong and diverse development pipeline, with 
opportunities to target further market penetration or geographies 
through strategic marketing. Ultimately, we believe our products 
and services will continue to play an important role in delivering 
real and sustainable solutions for our customers and markets. New 
materials, new applications, new forms and new geographies will 
all play a part in Victrex’s future. As evidence of our commitment in 
this area, our research and development spend once again increased 
this year, representing approximately 6% of Group revenue.
We also continue to focus on a sustainable supply chain, including 
our own upstream production assets manufacturing BDF in the UK, 
or our non-Victrex BDF supply, as well as how we can sustainably 
source our other global raw materials into the future.
Minimise CO
2
 emissions – maximise efficiency
Across industries and countries, the reduction of CO
2
 emissions 
remains a dominating trend. Global mobility continues to be a key 
megatrend, with transport systems having a major impact on the 
environment and global carbon footprint. Transport consumes 20% 
of global energy consumption and contributes approximately 22% 
of worldwide CO
2
 emissions. With more than 1 billion cars and light 
good vehicles and forecasts of 100 million new vehicles per year 
by 2018, improving energy efficiency and emissions is vital to the 
sustainability of personal transport.

Minimise CO
2
 emissions – maximise efficiency continued
Only one quarter of the fuel consumed by a car is converted to 
propulsion. To meet ever more challenging regulatory criteria to 
reduce CO
2
 emissions, the global automotive industry is focusing on 
improvements in powertrain technology, brake energy recovery, exhaust 
gas energy recovery and treatment, and lighter weight construction.
Victrex remains at the forefront of helping the global transport 
industry, whether it be in Aerospace or in Automotive. 
In cars, powertrain technology not only encompasses alternatives 
such as electrification and hybridisation, but also smaller engines 
with improved power output combined with highly efficient 
transmission systems. 
Efficiency improvements are reliant on the reduction of friction 
associated energy losses. Victrex materials are shaping future 
performance in powertrain technology. 
Through the use of VICTREX PEEK in transmission seals and thrust 
washers, frictional losses are reduced by approximately 20%, 
compared with incumbent materials, enabling reduced transmission 
power consumption. 
Victrex materials are also replacing heavier metal. In single vane 
vacuum pumps, Victrex polymers demonstrated up to 30% 
less power consumption and consequently enabled >1% fuel 
savings according to the New European Driving Cycle (‘NEDC’), a 
standardised cycle used to measure the emissions and consumption 
of motor vehicles. Further consolidating multiple metal parts 
into one plastic component paves the way to overall system cost 
reductions and reduced time to market – always a welcome effect 
for the automotive industry!

Resource efficiency
Victrex retains a strong focus on resource efficiency and our clear 
targets (page 21) and vision to maximise efficiency across our own 
operations and across the value chain will help us to continually 
improve in this area.
Resource efficiency includes a focus on our products, which 
enhance sustainability and efficiency in many applications, or in 
our own operations, as a manufacturing backed global company. 
Our products help our customers to make a sustainable difference 
by reducing their impact on the environment, for example, Victrex 
polymers help our aerospace and automotive customers to reduce 
the weight of their aircraft and vehicles to improve fuel efficiency 
and reduce CO
2
 emissions. Our bold target of reducing CO
2
 
emissions in aerospace by 5 million tonnes shows the commitment 
we have in this area. In medical, the wear characteristics of PEEK 
polymer is helping spinal fusion patients, whilst in the emerging 
area of plastic knees, our devices can be injection moulded to 
reduce surgery time, as well as enhancing patient satisfaction.
At the same time, we have an impact on the environment through 
the resources that we use to make our products and the processes that 
we operate. We continue to control these impacts and, as we grow, 
we are committed to continual improvement. Our priorities remain the 
efficient use of energy and waste minimisation, and we are proactively 
delivering continual improvement to address these areas. 
Principal environmental impacts
The principal environmental impacts of the Group’s operations 
are set out in the charts overleaf and are different from the 
Group’s overall GHG emissions (see left). These show energy use, 
water use and waste from our UK activities which include all our 
manufacturing operations. The impact from our overseas technical 
and office facilities is not material and is not included.
We have reported data per unit of revenue to best align our indicators 
with our business strategy along with absolute data to demonstrate 
our total impact. CO
2
 emissions are reported separately left as part of 
our greenhouse gas emissions report under the Companies Act 2006 
(Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
Our emissions have been calculated based on the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Standard. Emissions reported correspond with our financial 
year. We have included emissions from both our owned and leased 
assets for which we are responsible in the UK and overseas. This 
includes our manufacturing plant, technical centres and offices. No 
material emissions are omitted. Emissions have been calculated using 
data gathered to fulfil our reporting requirements under Climate 
Change Agreements on two of our manufacturing sites (we operate 
under a tenancy agreement at our Seal Sands facility). Emission 
factors are from UK government conversion factor guidance. Whilst 
not a mandatory requirement we have included scope 3 emissions in 
our report for greater transparency; these include indirect emissions 
from employee travel and distribution of goods.
Our emissions are predominantly from gas and oil combustion and 
electricity use on our manufacturing plants in the UK. Emissions 
from our overseas technical facilities and offices are relatively 
immaterial to those from our UK activities, which explain our focus 
on UK reporting metrics.
Whilst our overall emissions have increased this year – principally 
as a result of increased sales volumes through our manufacturing 
plant – pleasingly, our emissions per unit of product have reduced 
because of our focus on optimising and delivering cost of 
manufacture efficiencies in our manufacturing operations. 
Our efficiency focus has been enhanced this year with a specific 
Cost of Manufacture programme. This has already started yielding 
savings through more efficient distribution – for example, through 
shared product distribution – and through improved manufacturing 
efficiency in the second half year. We are focused on continuing this 
into 2015 as we commission our new PEEK and APTIV film capacity, 
with an aim of improving our medium term operating efficiency.
Victrex also continues to participate in the Carbon Disclosure 
Project, where our performance ranking improved this year.
Our efficiency focus has been 
enhanced this year with a specific

Energy use (UK operations)
In line with previous reporting, energy 
use is reported for our UK manufacturing 
sites. Energy per unit revenue has remained 
steady this year despite the stronger 
production performance. This is primarily 
because of resource efficiencies from the 
way we have been able to operate our 
manufacturing plants to meet demand. 
Energy is a priority sustainability target for 
us as part of our resource efficiency focus.
Water (UK operations)
Water use is reported for our UK operations. 
Our overseas water usage is not material. 
Our manufacturing operations are not in 
regions which experience water shortages.
Waste (UK operations)
Whilst our manufacturing process generates 
hazardous waste, we work closely with 
licensed waste service providers to ensure 
that it is recovered, recycled or disposed 
of with minimal environmental impact. 
We have invested in improving and optimising 
the production process to reduce waste, but 
we are already striving to reduce it further. 
This is a priority sustainability objective and 
there is an ongoing programme of work 
to examine how we can further minimise 
generation of waste at source and how we 
can also recover value from waste generated 
over the medium term. Waste per unit of 
revenue remained steady this year, following 
reductions in previous years.

Compliance
In line with our focus on resource efficiency, Victrex proactively 
stays well ahead of environmental standards.
Our manufacturing plants are regulated under Environmental 
Permitting Regulations and, as such, are subject to close regulatory 
review by the UK Environment Agency. In 2014, our routine 
environmental emissions monitoring demonstrated that all our UK 
manufacturing plants were being operated within agreed consent 
limits. We work closely with the Agency on new projects to ensure 
that best available techniques are adopted during new plant design.
During the year there was one notifiable event. At our Hillhouse 
manufacturing plant in the UK, the contents of a raw material 
package was accidentally released inside the plant building. No one 
was injured and there was no harm to the environment.
There were no other notifiable events at any of our other UK 
manufacturing sites. We are also pleased to have recorded another 
year with no prosecutions, fines or enforcement action from 
environmental or health and safety legislation. 
During the year we successfully achieved ISO 14001:2004 
accreditation for the environmental management system on our 
compounded pellets production plant, validating our commitment 
to being a sustainable and environmentally conscious business.
REACH
REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction 
of Chemicals Regulations) is a well established regime for the 
chemical industry and Victrex has well established processes in 
place to ensure adherence to legislation. We monitor and review 
to ensure that raw materials involved in our manufacturing process 
are compliant and that REACH will not adversely impact on the 
security of supply, which is important both for Victrex and for our 
customers, who are focusing on long term demand. There has not 
been, and we do not anticipate, any disruption to the supply of 
products arising from the regulations.
Health and safety
Protecting the occupational safety and health of all our employees 
along with contractors and visitors to our sites remains the highest 
priority for Victrex. We continue to have a strong track record and 
have won several accolades to mark our success in this area.
In 2014 the Group was again recognised for its strong health 
and safety performance. We received the Royal Society for the 
Prevention of Accidents (‘RoSPA’) Order of Distinction award. 
It is the 17th consecutive year that we have received an award 
and the third year running that we have received an Order of 
Distinction award.
Despite our track record, we set targets to drive continual safety, 
health and environment (SHE) performance improvement. During 
the year, over 1.1 million employee hours were worked with 
no employee reportable injuries and no cases of reportable ill 
health. This has been achieved by establishing and maintaining 
a strong health and safety culture throughout the business from 
the Executive team to the shop floor. We have a strong business 
risk management culture and believe that good health and safety 
management is just one part of it. 
The occupational health and safety of contractors working 
on our sites is of equal importance as our employees. With 
our major investment in new PEEK production capacity seeing 
major construction activity this year, there has been a significant 
number of contractors on major projects, with over 600,000 
contractor hours worked with only one contractor reportable 
injury, a contractor breaking his ankle when he stumbled on a 
cable. This result has been achieved by working closely alongside 
project principal contractors to ensure that robust project health 
and safety procedures are in place and that they are actively 
monitored, audited and reviewed. 
This year the principal contractor, K-Home, building our new polymer 
manufacturing plant at our Hillhouse site in the UK, received a RoSPA 
gold award for its occupational health and safety.

Social responsibility
Social responsibility
In line with our proactive vision to inspire the next 
generation by supporting science, engineering, technology 
and maths education, our social responsibility focus has been 
refined this year, whilst maintaining our commitment to 
employees and to the communities where we operate both 
in the UK and globally.
Our employees
Our business success is a reflection of the depth of talent in our 
global workforce. In a competitive global market, ensuring that 
we attract, motivate and retain our people remains a consistent 
theme for Victrex. This year we introduced an Organisational 
Capability Strategy, which supports us to identify and develop the 
skills and experience we need to deliver our business strategy and 
shape our people strategy. This was led by the Chief Executive, 
supported by the Group Human Resources Director and the 
Managing Directors of each business unit.
Employee breakdown
As a company we continue to invest in skills and talent to support 
our future growth. This year we recruited 76 new employees to the 
Victrex team, balancing this with promoting internal talent within 
the business. Our workforce continues to strengthen and diversify, 
and our gender breakdown continues to show changes across the 
business. Approximately 80% of our employees are male (average 
2014: 542) and 20% female (average 2014: 139). On our Executive 
Leadership Team, one quarter of the team is female. In Victrex, 
diversity encompasses differences in ethnicity, gender, language, 
age, sexual orientation, religion, socio-economic status, physical and 
mental ability, thinking style, experience and education. We believe 
that the wide array of perspectives that result from such diversity 
promotes innovation and business success. We operate an equal 
opportunities policy and provide a healthy environment which 
will encourage good and productive working relationships within 
the organisation. 
We have a policy of giving full and fair consideration to applications 
for employment made by disabled persons, continuing the employment 
of employees who have become disabled when they were employed 
by the company and the training, career development and promotion 
of disabled persons employed by the company.

Development
We continue to invest in the development of all our employees, 
through both an informal and formal route. Assessment of individual 
training needs comprises a key element of the annual appraisal 
process which is undertaken by all employees. This year has seen 
us complete a global learning needs analysis and we continue to 
roll out programmes globally across different employee groups. 
We continue to invest in our apprenticeship programme at our 
Hillhouse manufacturing site in the UK, across a range of disciplines, 
with eight apprentices currently on the apprenticeship programme. 
Last year, Adam Moat one of our engineering apprentices based 
at Hillhouse, our UK headquarters, was awarded Best Engineering 
Progress award and runner up in the Best Engineering Skills award 
at Blackpool and Fylde Technical College, whilst studying for a 
BTEC National Diploma in Engineering. Adam was also awarded 
the Springfields’ Gareth Jobes Endeavour Award 2013, the third 
time in four years a Victrex apprentice has won this award. 
As part of our focus on development and apprenticeships, we 
annually present the Shaun Thompson Young Person of the Year 
Award. The award, which commemorates our first Victrex apprentice, 
is open to young people across the operations discipline. Recipients 
are nominated by their peers and the winner is selected by a committee 
made up of the senior Manufacturing and Technical team.
The 2014 recipients are Richard Whiteside, Process Engineer, and 
Richard Jebb, Finished Product Shift Technical Officer. Both have 
continued to develop and expand their knowledge and are highly 
regarded and valued members of the Manufacturing team.
Wellbeing
We continue to place a high priority on the health and wellbeing 
of employees and promote this in a number of ways. Occupational 
health and private medical services are available for all employees 
in all locations. Over the last year we have started to focus on 
wellbeing services rather than medical treatment programmes, 
this has included, for the UK sites, on site medical checks, financial 
education sessions and defensive driving for company car owners 
and frequent travellers. This approach will be rolled out to the rest 
of the business in the next financial year.

Involvement
The Group places considerable emphasis on two-way communication 
and involving our employees in the business. We have a number 
of channels to keep employees informed on business news, these 
include a newly launched global monthly business briefing to keep 
employees aware of Company performance, quarterly global staff 
briefings and more formally through the Staff Committee and union 
partnership meetings. The Company supports employee share 
ownership and, offers the opportunity to participate in share schemes. 
This year we ran a series of briefing sessions to help our employees 
understand more about the range of share schemes available. As at 
30 September 2014, approximately 89% (2013: 86%) of employees 
worldwide were participants in employee share schemes, principally as 
option holders under the Company’s employee share option schemes. 
We also sponsor pension plans for employees across most of our 
global operations. Details of the Group’s principal pension schemes 
are set out in note 14 to the financial statements.
Largely as a result of the above approaches, Victrex has low 
voluntary employee turnover. This has risen slightly during the last 
year as many countries have moved out of recession, increasing 
the number of opportunities available, although the rate is still 
low for both the chemical sector and for manufacturing backed 
businesses. We conduct exit interviews with all employees leaving 
to understand reasons, so we are able to address any trends.

As a business we continue to:
1
provide a clean, safe working 
environment which meets 
all legislative requirements 
and to provide all the 
necessary training support 
for employees to operate 
safely within it;
2
provide appropriate 
remuneration for work carried 
out and equal opportunities 
for development and 
career advancement;
3
be intolerant of any 
unacceptable working 
practices such as any form 
of discrimination, bullying 
or harassment; 
prohibit illegal activities 
on our sites; and
4
promote fair, ethical and 
transparent business 
practices both within our 
business and in dealings 
with external stakeholders.

Strategic report
Our communities
We have increased our proactive focus on corporate citizenship to 
have a clearer vision of how we work with the local communities, 
ensuring that the Victrex name is synonymous with good business, 
and helps to establish our employer brand and reputation, in turn 
helping us to secure the right skills for our future development. 
With a clear vision and targets in line with our 2023 sustainability 
goals, we have made good progress in this area and now have 
a more focused approach.
Last year we outlined in our sustainability strategy that our focus 
is to get young people interested and excited about science, 
technology and engineering. This year, we signed up to Business in 
the Community’s Business Class programme, which matches local 
businesses and schools together in a three year partnership. We 
are pleased to be working with Fleetwood High School in the UK 
over the next three years. This year we hosted a visit to our main UK 
manufacturing operations and work experience for year 10 students. 
As a company using technical excellence as part of our more 
focused strategy, our 20th birthday celebrations last year saw 
us sponsor a ‘Polymer Zone’ at the Catalyst Discovery Centre in 
Runcorn, UK. The Catalyst Centre was launched in September and 
the ‘Polymer Zone’ helps young people understand more about 
polymers and their application in the world and day to day life, 
whether it be in smartphones, cars, aeroplanes, medical devices 
or wider industry.
Victrex has also participated in a range of activities within local 
communities, offering apprenticeships, awareness in schools, 
advancement of research work at universities and offering work 
experience to students of all ages at varying stages of their 
academic careers. We are actively involved in the Science Industry 
Partnership which was awarded £52m to enable industry to take the 
lead in investing in the skills they need. Our Manufacturing Director 
sits on the Board and a number of employees are actively involved 
in the sub-groups. 
Charitable giving
In the UK, a proportion of the charitable donations budget 
is distributed by the Staff Committee mainly to local charities 
chosen from nominations made by employees. National or overseas 
charities are supported where there is strong employee involvement. 
The Group made charitable donations of £164,590 (2013: £81,224) 
during the year. No political donations were made (2013: £nil).
Our employees remain active fundraisers, following the successful 
opening and launch of our UK head office and UK technical centre 
in 2012, with quarterly employee events to encourage employee 
networking and to raise money for charity. All employees based 
on the UK Hillhouse site were invited to attend informal lunches 
provided by the company. During the year a total of £588 was 
donated to charity through employee donations.
Alongside Company led events, our employees proactively support 
charities through their own wishes. Three Victrex employees, 
Rob Baylis, Barry Fullard and Adam Briscoe, committed to walk 
100km over the UK’s Yorkshire Dales in under 30 hours in May 
2014. This involved climbing more than 2300m, more than Ben 
Nevis and Snowdon on top of one another. The PEEK-y-Knees 
team successfully completed the challenge and raised over 
£2,000 for Oxfam.
With a clear vision and targets in 
line with our 2023 sustainability goals, 
we have made good progress and 
now have a more focused approach.

Governance and Board of Directors
We as a Board of Directors are committed to the principles 
of good governance. We believe these principles form the 
foundations for the long term success of the Company, 
enabling us to achieve our strategy and growth aims for 
the future. 
Our Corporate Governance Report is set out on pages 35 to 56, 
including the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 44 to 56. 
This section of the Annual Report sets out how we manage the 
Group and comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. It also outlines any governance initiatives 
undertaken in the year. Key areas of focus this year included 
strengthening our succession planning, re-aligning our 
governance structures with our product leadership strategy 
and a focus on Board appointments.
We remain cognisant of the strong relationship between ethics 
and governance and the role the Board plays in demonstrating 
ethical leadership. In the current year, we embedded our Victrex 
Global Code of Conduct which was launched in 2013. We remain 
committed to operating ethically, demonstrating integrity 
and acting responsibly for both our shareholders and wider 
stakeholders. Further information on ethics and social responsibility 
is contained in our Sustainability Report on pages 20 to 31.
We continue to operate a clear line of distinction between 
management, led by David Hummel, Chief Executive, who is 
responsible for the day to day running of the business, and the 
Board, acting under my leadership, which provides constructive 
challenge to management ensuring an open culture of debate 
that creates and preserves value for our shareholders.
In the current year, I led the board evaluation process as 
incoming Chairman. As part of our process this year, we 
assessed how we work as a board, our skills, our diversity 
and how we could improve our effectiveness. We will continue 
to focus on board effectiveness over the coming year.
Finally, our Statement of Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code is set out on page 35.

Corporate governance

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Corporate governance
The Board of Directors (‘the Board’) recognises the importance of sound governance 
and its role in achieving sustainable growth. The Board is committed to high standards 
of corporate governance and it supports the principles laid down in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’). Victrex continues to maintain and review its systems, 
processes and policies to support its sustainability and governance practices.
Statement of compliance
A detailed review has been performed 
of the Company’s compliance with the 
Code published by the Financial Reporting 
Council (‘FRC’) in June 2010 and revised 
in September 2012. We have been mindful 
to ensure that we comply not just with the 
principles of the Code but also the spirit 
of the Code. In assessing our approach, 
we have had regard to the FRC guidance 
on Board Effectiveness (March 2011) and 
the FRC guidance on audit committees 
(September 2012). We are also cognisant 
of the 2014 update to the Code, which is 
effective for year ends from 1 October 2014.
This report, including the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 44 to 56, 
describes how the main principles of good 
governance have been applied throughout 
our business.
Except as referred to below, the Company 
has complied with all relevant provisions 
of the Code throughout the year ended 
30 September 2014 and from that date up to 
the date of publication of this Annual Report.
» » Provision B.6.2 requires the board 
evaluation of FTSE 350 companies to 
be externally facilitated at least every 
three years. The last such evaluation was 
in 2011 and the intention was that an 
externally facilitated evaluation would 
take place in 2014. However, given a new 
incoming Chairman from October 2014, 
after careful consideration and discussion, 
the Board chose to conduct an internally 
facilitated process, postponing the 
external facilitation until 2015. 
» » The Senior Independent Director is 
aware of the views of the Company’s 
major shareholders and has a balanced 
understanding through regular feedback 
from the Chairman and the CEO and 
Group Finance Director. Code provision 
E.1.1. envisages that meetings would take 
place between the Senior Independent 
Director and major shareholders during 
year. Both the Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Directors make themselves 
available for meetings, however, none 
were requested in the current year and 
no such meetings took place. Further 
information on how we engage with 
shareholders is set out on page 40.
» » The 2012 revised Code included a new 
provision C.3.7 in relation to audit tendering. 
The Company has not complied in full with 
part of this provision which states that 
‘FTSE 350 companies should put the external 
audit contract out to tender at least every 
ten years’. As noted on page 42, KPMG has 
been our auditor since the MBO in 1993. 
Consistent with good governance principles, 
we review independence and objectivity 
annually as part of our annual review of the 
effectiveness of the external audit process. 
In light of the requirement of the Code, EU 
Regulation and the recommendations of 
the Competition and Markets Commission, 
the Audit Committee will keep the timing 
of an audit tender under review.
Leadership
The Role of the Board
The role of the Board is to provide 
entrepreneurial leadership and the Directors 
are collectively responsible for the long-term 
success of the Company. The Board also acts 
as custodian of the Company’s values and 
of its long-term vision and provides strategic 
direction and guidance for the Company. 
The names, biographical details and 
significant time commitments of the 
members of the Board are set out on 
pages 32 and 33.
In discharging its responsibilities, the Board 
also seeks to set, promote and demonstrate 
adherence to our values and ethical standards 
for the Company. It remains mindful of the 
need to observe the duties owed by Directors 
in law, including promoting the sustainable 
success of the Company, not only for our 
shareholders, but also for our stakeholders, 
which includes our employees, suppliers, 
customers and wider community.
The offices of the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) are separate 
and clearly distinct. The division of their 
responsibilities is set out in writing and has 
been approved by the Board. There is no 
Deputy Chairman. The CEO is responsible 
for the day to day running of the Group, 
carrying out agreed strategy and implementing 
specific Board decisions.

Corporate governance continued
Leadership continued
The Role of the Board continued
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership 
of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness in 
all aspects of its role. The Chairman is also 
responsible for creating the right board 
dynamic and for promoting a culture of 
openness and debate, in addition to ensuring 
constructive and productive relations between 
executive and non-executive Directors. 
The Chairman is also an ambassador for 
the Company to shareholders and 
wider stakeholders.
The executive Directors are responsible 
for the running of the business. The 
non-executive Directors are responsible 
for exercising independent and objective 
judgement in respect of Board decisions, 
developing corporate strategy with senior 
management and for scrutinising and 
constructively challenging the actions 
of senior management.
Our Senior Independent Director (‘SID’), 
Pamela Kirby who took over as SID from 
Giles Kerr on 1 November 2014, acts as 
a sounding board to the Chairman and 
serves as an intermediary for other 
Directors when necessary. She is also 
available to shareholders should they 
have any concerns, where contact through 
the normal channels is inappropriate. 
ensure that, in addition to the day to day 
matters requiring its consideration, all 
necessary matters are covered and to allow 
sufficient time for debate and challenge, 
particularly on areas such as strategy.
During the financial year, the Board considered 
a wide variety of matters including corporate 
development opportunities, the Group’s 
strategic plan, financial performance of the 
Company, risk management and controls 
within the Company, strategy and performance 
of the business units and Board effectiveness 
and evaluation.
Matters reserved for the Board 
and delegation of authority 
There are certain matters that are deemed 
significant enough to be reserved for Board 
decision only. A clearly documented schedule 
of matters reserved for Board decision is 
reviewed annually by the Board to ensure 
it continues to be appropriate for the 
Company. These matters include: 
» » setting the Group’s strategy and approval 
of the Company’s long-term objectives;
» » approval of half-yearly reports, interim 
management statements and any 
preliminary announcements of the 
final results;
» » changes to the Company’s capital 
structure;
She is also responsible for leading the 
review of the Chairman’s performance, 
as part of the annual Board evaluation. 
The Company Secretary reports to the 
Chairman on governance matters and 
is responsible for keeping the Board up 
to date on all legislative, regulatory and 
governance matters. She is also responsible 
for supporting the Chairman and other 
Board members as necessary, including 
the management of Board and Committee 
meetings and their evaluation, advising on 
Directors’ duties and facilitating appropriate, 
high quality and timely information flows 
between the business and the Board.
Operation of the Board
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
strategic development, monitoring 
achievement of its business objectives, 
oversight of risk and maintaining a system 
of effective corporate governance, which 
includes the responsibility for health, safety, 
environmental, social and ethical matters. 
The Board discharges these responsibilities 
through scheduled meetings, which include 
regular reviews of financial performance and 
critical business issues and benchmarking 
performance against our strategic plan 
and objectives.

Board committees
The Board has delegated certain 
responsibilities to Board committees namely:
» » the Nominations Committee;
» » the Audit Committee;
» » the Remuneration Committee; and 
» » the Disclosure Committee. 
Until September 2014, the Board was 
supported in its responsibilities by the 
Group Risk Management Committee, 
which was chaired by the non-executive 
Director Larry Pentz, and was responsible 
for ensuring that all significant risks facing 
the Group were reduced to an acceptable 
level. During the course of the year, the 
Group Risk Management Committee met 
twice. However, due to the strengthening 
of the risk management process over recent 
years, and the activities of the Executive 
Leadership Team in that risk management 
process, and the Audit Committee’s enhanced 
responsibilities in terms of supporting the 
Board in its risk responsibilities, the Group 
Risk Management Committee has been 
dissolved. Such evolutions in process help 
further embed and drive the effectiveness 
and efficiencies of risk management in 
our business. The sub Risk Management 
Committees (VPS Risk Management 
Committee, Invibio Risk Management 
Committee and Support Services Risk 
Management Committee) will continue 
to meet and report to the ELT Risk 
Management Committee.
The Board has ultimate responsibility 
for the approval of the treasury and cash 
management policy and continues to 
be supported in its work by the Currency 
Committee. The Currency Committee 
is chaired by the Group Finance Director, 
Louisa Burdett and meets on a monthly 
basis to manage the application of the 
Group’s treasury policy, which has been 
approved and reviewed annually by 
the Board. Further details on the policy 
and the activities of the Currency 
Committee are included in note 13 
to the Financial Statements.

Risk Management Committee 
Chairman – Larry Pentz
The Risk Management Committee 
(‘the RMC’) was in operation throughout 
the 2014 financial year. However, effective 
from 1 October 2014, its responsibilities 
will be subsumed into the Audit Committee 
and ELT Risk Management Committee, as 
appropriate. It was chaired by Larry Pentz 
and comprised the executive Directors, 
Managing Director of Invibio, the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary, Head of 
Business Assurance, VPS Manufacturing 
Director and Global SHE Manager. The RMC 
was responsible for ensuring that all 
significant risks facing the Group are 
reduced to an acceptable level.
Full details of the way the risk 
management framework operates at 
Victrex are given on pages 16 and 17.
During the course of the year, the RMC 
met twice and reported to the Board 
after each meeting.
The Board annually undertakes a formal 
review of the effectiveness of the risk 
management framework, policies and 
the performance of the RMC. Twice a 
year the Board reviews the key risks in 
the Group risk register, thereby allowing 
it the opportunity to review the level of 
risk the Board is prepared to accept in 
pursuit of its strategic objectives. This 
process will continue in 2015.
The Chief Executive’s 
Committee (‘ELT’)
In discharging his responsibilities, the 
Chief Executive is assisted by the 
Executive Leadership Team (‘the ELT’). 
The ELT comprises the Chief Executive, 
the Group Finance Director, the Managing 
Director of VPS and Managing Director of 
Invibio. They are supported by the Group 
HR Director and the General Counsel and 
Company Secretary. This team is responsible 
for making recommendations to the 
Board on matters that are reserved for 
their decision such as strategy, corporate 
development and annual budgets. The 
ELT usually meets on a monthly basis.
Disclosure Committee
Chairman – Larry Pentz, David 
Hummel or Louisa Burdett
The Disclosure Committee’s 
responsibilities are to ensure that the 
Company’s obligations to make timely 
and accurate disclosure of information 
in accordance with any applicable law 
or regulation are met in circumstances 
where it is impractical for the Board, 
or any other Board Committee with 
delegated responsibility, to fulfil those 
obligations. In accordance with these 
responsibilities, the Committee may 
make disclosures on behalf of the 
Board. The Committee will take advice, 
including from the Company’s broker, 
external auditor and legal advisors, on 
the form and content of any disclosure 
under consideration.
The Committee comprises all Directors 
of the Company and the General Counsel 
and Company Secretary. The Chairman 
of each Committee meeting will be 
appointed on an ad hoc basis. Meetings 
of the Committee may be called by any 
member of the Committee on any period 
of notice provided that notice is given 
to all members. 
The terms of reference of the Nominations, Audit, Remuneration and 
Risk Management Committees are available on the Company’s 
website (www.victrexplc.com) and in paper form on request from 
the Registered Office of the Company.

Corporate governance
Board effectiveness
Composition, independence 
and diversity of the Board
Throughout the year, the Board comprised 
a non-executive Chairman, four other 
non-executive Directors and three executive 
Directors. Following the resignation of 
Anita Frew on 30 September 2014, the Board 
will comprise three executive Directors, three 
non-executive Directors and a Chairman. The 
Code requirement that at least half the Board 
should be independent non-executive Directors 
has continued to be met. The non-executive 
Directors (including the Chairman, Larry Pentz, 
upon his appointment) are all considered by 
the Board to be independent of management 
and free from any business or other relationship 
that could materially interfere with the exercise 
of their independent judgement. 
The composition of the Board is intended 
to ensure that its membership represents 
a mix of backgrounds and experience that 
will enhance the quality of its deliberations 
and decisions. Diversity in board composition 
is an important driver of board effectiveness. 
In looking for prospective Directors, there 
is regard to the skills of the Board at that 
time and the need to address longer-term 
succession and business priorities. The 
annual formal evaluation of the Board 
takes Board diversity into account and 
is instrumental in identifying any new 
skill requirements, as well as possible 
shortcomings, gaps or inefficiencies.
Our current female representation on 
the Board is 29% and therefore exceeds 
the minimum target representation level 
to be achieved by 2015 as recommended 
by the Davies Review. The Board recognises 
the importance of gender diversity at the 
level below the Board and is committed 
to ensuring an appropriate level of gender 
diversity, in particular at senior management 
level. There is a commitment in the Company 
to support women in overcoming barriers they 
face in rising to the top of the management 
structure. The female representation on the 
ELT is 25%. Further information on the total 
female representation on our workforce is 
provided in our Sustainability Report on 
page 20 to 31.
We also recognise the importance of 
diversity in general at Board level and our 
Board members comprise a number of 
different nationalities with a wide range of 
experience from a variety of business 
backgrounds. Further information on our 
Group HR policies, including those on equal 
opportunities and diversity, is set out on 
page 28.
In response to the Davies Report, the Board 
published a statement on Board diversity, 
which has been published on the investor 
section of our website.
Re-election of Directors
All Directors retire at each Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’) and may offer themselves 
for re-election by shareholders. Accordingly, 
all the Directors will retire at the AGM in 
February 2015 and the Notice of AGM on 
page 87 gives details of those Directors 
seeking re-election. Further information on 
both the appointment and replacement of 
Directors is given in the Directors’ Report 
on page 57.
Conflicts of interest
Under the Companies Act 2006, a director 
must avoid a situation where a direct or 
indirect conflict of interest may occur and 
procedures are in place to deal with any 
situation where a conflict may be perceived. 
The Board confirms that it has considered 
and authorised any conflicts or potential 
conflicts of interest in accordance with 
these procedures. The Board has specifically 
considered the other appointments held 
by Directors, details of which are contained 
in their biographies on page 32 and 33, and 
has confirmed that each is able to devote 
sufficient time to fulfil the duties required 
of them under the terms of their contracts 
or letters of appointment.
Board evaluation
The Board recognises that a rigorous 
performance evaluation is important to 
optimise Board effectiveness. A formal 
evaluation of the Board, Board committees 
and individual Directors’ performance is carried 
out annually. Given the appointment of Larry 
Pentz as the new Chairman, effective from 
1 October 2014, after careful consideration 
by the Board, the externally facilitated board 
evaluation was postponed until 2015. The 2014 
evaluation was therefore conducted internally 
and led by the incoming Chairman Larry Pentz. 
The review considered a range of factors 
including the balance of skills and experience, 
independence of the Board, board diversity, 
board agenda and relations between executive 
and non-executive Directors. The results of the 
review demonstrated improvements in areas 
identified in 2013, including devoting more 
Board time to discussing strategic matters 
and succession planning. The 2014 evaluation 
process concluded that the Board is effective 
in fulfilling its responsibilities appropriately and 
that each Director continues to demonstrate 
a valuable contribution.
Executive Directors’ performance is reviewed 
by the Remuneration Committee in conjunction 
with the Chief Executive, except in the case 
of his own performance review. The Chairman’s 
performance is reviewed by the Remuneration 
Committee in conjunction with the 
Chief Executive. 
During the year, pursuant to the Code, the 
Chairman met with the other non-executive 
Directors without the executive Directors 
present, and the Senior Independent Director 
met with the other non-executive Directors, 
without the Chairman present.
Future reviews
The 2015 board evaluation will be facilitated 
externally. The Board intends to undertake 
an externally facilitated evaluation process 
at least every three years, in line with the 
Code. In the intervening years, the review 
will be facilitated by the Chairman supported 
by the Senior Independent Director and 
Company Secretary, as outlined above.
The 2011 evaluation was the last externally 
facilitated Board evaluation.
Induction and training
All new non-executive Directors receive 
a personalised induction programme, 
tailored to their experience, background 
and particular area of focus. The programme 
has evolved over time to take into account 
feedback from Directors. It includes a wide 
range of meetings with other Directors and 
senior management, attending results and 
broker briefings and opportunities to visit 
the Group’s operations outside of the UK. 
New executive Directors also receive an 
induction focused on their new role and 
wider responsibilities and include briefings 
on areas such as Directors’ duties and 
corporate governance guidelines and 
best practice. Louisa Burdett received an 
appropriately tailored induction on joining 
the Company earlier this year.
Training (including social, environmental 
and ethical matters) is also provided. 
It is considered as part of the Board 
evaluation process and any specific 
training or development needs are 
addressed either individually or as part 
of the annual Director training session. 
In the current year, Directors’ training 
included recent updates to corporate 
governance best practice and cyber 
risk training. www.victrexplc.com

Corporate governance continued
Board effectiveness continued
Information and support
The Board receives sufficient management 
information and reports on the right strategic 
and operational matters on a timely basis. 
This normally includes comprehensive papers 
on matters where the Board is required 
to make a decision or give its approval in 
addition to detailed reports on the current 
trading of the two business units on a 
monthly basis. The Chief Executive also 
updated the Board on progress against the 
Group’s strategic plan. Briefings by 
operational management also take place 
regularly to enhance the Board’s 
understanding of the business. 
Directors can also take independent 
professional advice where necessary at 
the Company’s expense and have access 
to the services of the Company Secretary. 
The Company Secretary is responsible for 
ensuring that Board procedures are followed 
and providing advice to the Board on 
corporate governance. Both the appointment 
and removal of the Company Secretary are 
matters for the Board as a whole. 
Appropriate levels of insurance cover are 
obtained for all Directors and Officers of the 
Company. Further information on Directors’ 
indemnities is given in the Directors’ Report 
on page 57.
Accountability 
Financial and business reporting
The Board is responsible for presenting a fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment 
of the Group’s position and prospects. 
Reporting is at a business unit level with the 
head of each business unit reporting to the 
Board through a standardised reporting 
process. The Group has a comprehensive 
annual budgeting process and the annual 
budget is approved by the Board. 
Reforecasts are presented to the Board four 
times during the year. 
The statement that gives the reasons why 
the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis for preparing the financial 
statements is given in the Directors’ Report 
on page 58. 
Risk management 
and internal control procedures 
The Board, supported by the Audit 
Committee and ELT Risk Management 
Committee, is responsible for determining 
the nature and extent of the significant risks 
it is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives. It is ultimately responsible for 
maintaining sound risk management systems 
(including financial controls, controls in respect 
of the financial reporting process and controls 
of an operational and compliance nature). A 
sound system of internal control is designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can 
to implement the recommendations of the 
Turnbull Committee and by reporting in 
accordance with these recommendations.
Further details of the risk management 
framework operating at Victrex are given 
on pages 16 and 17.
Relations with shareholders
The Board as a whole has a responsibility 
for ensuring that satisfactory engagement 
with shareholders takes place, based on 
the mutual understanding of objectives. 
The Board achieves this through effective 
dialogue with shareholders and analysts, 
with the Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director and Head of Investor Relations 
leading these relationships.
The Board believes that appropriate steps 
have been taken during the year to ensure 
that the members of the Board, and in 
particular the non-executive Directors 
develop an understanding of the views of 
major shareholders on the Company. Such 
steps included, for example, analyst and 
broker briefings, consideration by the Board 
of monthly brokers’ reports and feedback 
from shareholder meetings on a six monthly 
basis. The canvassing of major shareholders’ 
views for the Board in a detailed investor 
survey is conducted twice a year by our 
brokers, J P Morgan. In addition, the 
Chairman is available to meet institutional 
shareholders. The Senior Independent 
Director and other non-executive Directors 
will attend meetings with major shareholders 
if requested. No such meetings were requested 
during the year. 
Institutional investor relations activity 
is normally concentrated in the periods 
following the announcement of the interim 
and final results. However, in 2014 Victrex 
increased the regularity of its meetings 
with investors through a number of 
conferences and a roadshow for prospective 
investors in the USA. More broadly based 
presentations and site visits are arranged 
when there is a sufficient demand to 
make them cost effective. The Board is 
also committed to the regularity of investor 
days to keep the market updated on our 
strategy and growth plans, alongside our 
financial reporting. 
All shareholders will have the opportunity 
to ask questions at the forthcoming AGM. 
The Chairs of the Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees will be available 
to answer questions at that meeting. Voting 
at the AGM is conducted by way of a show 
of hands in order to encourage questions 
from and interaction with private investors. 
Proxy votes lodged on each AGM resolution 
and are announced at the meeting and 
published on the Company’s website 
and announced via the Regulatory 
Information Service.
only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. In addition, the Board is responsible 
for establishing formal and transparent 
arrangements for considering how it 
should apply the corporate reporting, risk 
management and internal control principles 
and for maintaining an appropriate relationship 
with the Company’s auditor. The Board 
confirms that there is a framework of 
continuous and on-going processes in place 
for identifying, evaluating and management 
significant risks faced by the Company. 
These processes were reviewed by the Risk 
committee in the current year (together with 
its sub-committees) and by the Board. From 
October 2014, this will be undertaken by the 
ELT Risk Management Committee, with the 
Audit Committee taking responsibility for 
reviewing the risk management systems and 
the effectiveness of these systems. The Board 
will continue to review the principal risks 
faced by the Company at least twice a year.
The Board’s view of the key strategic and 
operational risks including environmental, 
social and governance (‘ESG’ risks) and how 
we seek to manage those risks is set out 
on pages 16 to 19.
The independent Business Assurance 
function supports the Board in its review of 
the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control. There is a rolling programme of 
business assurance review carried out across 
the Group, co-ordinated by the Head of 
Business Assurance, who independently 
reports to the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee in relation to business assurance 
matters. The Audit Committee reviews the 
annual business assurance plan, its findings, 
effectiveness, allocation of appropriate 
resources and risk management activities 
and priorities.
The Audit Committee oversees 
whistleblowing arrangements, by which 
staff may, in confidence, raise concerns 
about possible improprieties in matters of 
financial reporting or other matters. The 
Company continues to operate its Global 
Code of Conduct policy and has embedded 
this throughout the Company, following 
its launch in 2013. This policy includes 
important areas such as anti-bribery, data 
protection and conflicts of interest. It is a 
fundamental policy to upholding our good 
reputation as a business and one that can 
be trusted by all stakeholder groups. 
The Board and Audit Committee have 
reviewed the effectiveness of the internal 
control system, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls, and risk management 
in accordance with the Code. We confirm 
that the Group has complied with the Code 
provisions on internal control by operating 
throughout the year ended 30 September 
2014 (and up to the date of approval of this 
Annual Report) those procedures necessary  www.victrexplc.com

Corporate governance
Membership
The Nominations Committee comprises all 
of the non-executive Directors and is chaired 
by the Company Chairman Larry Pentz, 
following the resignation of Anita Frew 
from the Board on 30 September 2014.
The Committee met on two occasions 
during the year.
Responsibilities
The Committee is responsible for regularly 
reviewing the structure, size and composition 
of the Board, including Board diversity, 
succession planning and identifying and 
recommending appropriate candidates for 
membership of the Board when vacancies 
arise. The Committee has applied the UK 
Corporate Governance Code provisions 
in developing the Company’s policies on 
succession planning and appointment.
In considering an appointment, the 
Committee evaluates the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience of the Board 
and prepares a description of the role 
and capabilities required for a particular 
appointment. Internal candidates are 
considered where appropriate. 
The Nominations Committee also reviews 
the time required from each non-executive 
Director and any other significant 
commitments of the Chairman. The 2014 
review found the non-executives’ time 
commitments to be sufficient to discharge 
their responsibilities effectively.
Based on recommendations from the 
Nominations Committee, the Directors 
submit themselves for re-election at the 
AGM following their appointment and 
annually thereafter.
The Nominations Committee is also responsible 
for senior management succession planning 
to ensure the identification and development 
of senior management with potential for 
Board and ELT positions.
The main activities of the Nominations 
Committee during the financial year 
ended 30 September 2014 included 
leading the selection process for, and 
making recommendations to the Board 
regarding, the appointment to the role of 
Group Financial Director, an appropriate 
successor for our former Chairman, 
Anita Frew, and considering the contribution 
and commitment of the Directors standing 
for re-election. The Committee also 
strengthened and embedded the Company’s 
succession planning process.
A rigorous and transparent process was 
in place for the two Board appointments. 
External search consultancies were engaged 
for both appointments. Egon Zehnder, 
which has no other connection with the 
Company, assisted with the process to select 
a new Group Finance Director. JCA 
Consultants provided assistance with the 
selection process for the new Chairman. 
Anita Frew, the retiring Chairman, was not 
involved in the selection or appointment of 
her successor. This process was led by Giles 
Kerr, our Senior Independent Director at 
that time. JCA Consultants does not have 
any other connection with the Company.

Boardroom diversity
The Board’s Statement on Diversity, 
which has been published on our website, 
is as follows:
‘The Board of Victrex plc welcomed the 
publication in February 2011 of the Davies 
Review on Women on Boards. Our current 
female representation on the Board is 29% 
and is therefore aligned with that minimum 
representation level by 2015 as recommended 
by the Davies Review. We also recognise the 
importance of diversity in general at Board 
level and our Board members comprise a 
number of different nationalities with a 
wide range of experience from a variety 
of business backgrounds.’ www.victrexplc.com

Corporate governance continued
Membership
The Committee members have been selected 
with the aim of providing the wide range of 
financial and commercial expertise required 
to fulfil the Committee’s duties.
The Audit Committee is chaired by Giles Kerr, a 
qualified Chartered Accountant with significant 
relevant financial experience, and comprised 
Larry Pentz, Patrick De Smedt and Pamela 
Kirby. Following his appointment as Chairman 
of the Company, Larry Pentz has ceased to be 
a member of the Audit Committee. The 
qualifications of the Audit Committee 
members are outlined in the Directors’ 
biographies on page 32 and 33.
Committee meetings
Only Audit Committee members are entitled 
to attend a meeting. However, the Chairman, 
the Group Finance Director, the Group 
Financial Controller, the Head of Business 
Assurance and the External Audit Engagement 
Partner are normally invited to attend meetings. 
Others are also invited to attend certain 
meetings to provide training or further insight 
into specific issues and developments. During 
the period, the Audit Committee met on three 
occasions. A section of at least one meeting 
during the period took place without 
management present.
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee undertakes its 
activities in line with an annual predetermined 
programme of business based on its terms of 
reference as approved by the Board. The key 
responsibilities of the Committee are:
» » review the financial statements  
(interim and annual reports) and 
announcements relating to the financial 
performance of the Company;
» » monitor the financial reporting process;
External audit
Non-audit services
To further safeguard the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor, non-audit 
services provided by the external auditor, 
KPMG, were authorised in accordance with 
the non-audit services policy. This policy is 
outlined in an appendix to the Committee 
terms of reference, which are published on 
our website. This policy places constraints 
on the quantum and type of services 
undertaken by our auditor with the aim 
of protecting the independence and 
objectivity of our auditor. Non-audit fees 
for the year ended 30 September 2014 
were £58,000 (2013: £63,000). The 
non-audit fees related to taxation and 
pension compliance work. Alternative 
providers were considered but not deemed 
practical in the specific circumstances. 
No approval was given to any non-audit 
services not in accordance with the 
APB’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Appointment, independence 
and effectiveness
The Committee considers the re-appointment 
of the external auditor each year, whilst 
assessing its independence on an on-going 
basis. The external auditor is required to 
rotate the audit partner every five years.
KPMG was re-appointed as auditor at the 
2014 AGM. KPMG has been our auditor 
since 1993 (21 years) during which time the 
audit has not been to tender. There are no 
contractual obligations that restrict the 
Committee’s choice of external auditor.
The Audit Committee considers the 
effectiveness of the external audit process 
on an annual basis, reporting its findings 
to the board as part of its recommendation. 
This process is completed through completion 
of a detailed questionnaire (which includes 
consideration of the audit partner, the 
approach, communication, independence, 
» » review and challenge actions and 
judgements of management in relation 
to interim and annual statements;
» » review the effectiveness of the internal 
audit function;
» » reviewing the Company’s internal financial 
controls (that is, the systems established 
to identify, assess, manage and monitor 
financial risks) and the Company’s internal 
control management systems;
» » review the Committee’s terms of reference, 
carrying out an annual performance 
evaluation exercise and noting the 
satisfactory operation of the Committee;
» » all matters associated with the 
appointment, terms, remuneration and 
performance of the external auditor and 
for reviewing the scope and results of the 
audit and its cost effectiveness; and 
» » report to the Board on how it has discharged 
its responsibilities, including an assessment 
of whether the financial statements are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy. 
Effective October 2014, the Committee 
has taken on responsibility, from the Risk 
Management Committee, for the risk 
management systems, further details of 
which are included on pages 16 and 17.
Key objectives
To provide effective governance over the 
appropriateness of the financial reporting 
of the Company, including but not limited 
to the completeness of related disclosures, 
the performance of the external auditor, the 
internal audit function and the management 
of the Company’s internal control systems 
and related compliance operations.

objectivity and reporting). This is completed 
by members of the Committee and senior 
members of the finance team who regularly 
interact with the external auditor. The results 
of the questionnaire are reported to and 
discussed by the Committee. It also assessed 
the cost effectiveness and value for money 
aspect of the audit.
The Committee considered the length 
of KPMG’s tenure and the results of the 
detailed questionnaire when assessing their 
continued effectiveness, independence and 
re-appointment. The Committee continues 
to consider KPMG to be independent and 
effective in its role as auditor. Accordingly, 
the Committee has provided the Board with 
its recommendation to the shareholders 
to re-appoint KPMG as external auditor for 
the year ending 30 September 2015. When 
considering the most suitable timing for 
a future audit tender the Committee has 
considered FRC guidance concerning the 
alignment of the tender date with the 
rotation of the audit partner, the EU Regulation 
and the recommendations of the Competition 
and Markets Commission along with the 
latest views as to how the UK government 
will implement these. The current expectation 
of ten year mandatory rotation with transitional 
rules would result in a change of auditor no 
later than 30 September 2021. The current 
audit partner’s term finishes after the 
September 2017 year end accounts are 
signed. The timing of a competitive tender 
will continue to be assessed on an annual 
basis and consider the final position 
on the EU reforms adopted in the UK 
once published. 
Financial reporting
The primary role of the Committee in relation 
to financial reporting is to review with both 
management and the external auditor, and 
report to the Board where requested or 
required, the appropriateness of the half-year 
and annual financial statements concentrating 
on, amongst other matters: 
» » the quality and acceptability of 
accounting policies and practices;
» » the clarity of the disclosures and 
compliance with financial reporting 
standards and relevant financial and 
governance reporting requirements;
» » material areas in which significant 
judgements have been applied or 
there has been discussion with the 
external auditor; 
» » whether the Annual Report, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy; and
» » any correspondence from regulators 
in relation to our financial reporting. 
To aid our review, the Committee considers 
reports from the Group Finance Director and 
Group Financial Controller and also reports 
from the external auditor on the outcomes 
of its half-year review and annual audit. As a 
Committee we support KPMG in displaying 
the necessary independence and objectivity 
its role requires. In addition the Committee 
reviews and considers the draft Annual 
Report and Financial Statements in advance 
of final sign off.
The Committee discussed with management 
the key sources of estimation and critical 
accounting judgements outlined in note 19. 
The significant areas of focus considered 
by the Committee in relation to the 2014 
financial statements and how these have 
been addressed are listed below. In concluding 
that the below list represented the primary 
areas of judgement, the Audit Committee 
considered a report by management which 
referenced both quantitative and qualitative 
judgement factors across each significant 
account balance, assessing the impact on the 
user of the financial statements. These are 
also areas of higher audit risk and accordingly 
KPMG reported to the Committee on and 
the Audit Committee discussed these 
judgements.
» » Carrying value of inventory: the 
Committee reviews the nature of the 
costs absorbed into inventory and the 
reasons for movements in value period 
to period. The basis for and level of 
provisioning, including those areas which 
are judgemental, is presented to the 
Committee by management.
» » Defined benefit accounting: the 
valuation of the defined benefit scheme 
is dependent on a number of assumptions 
that are inherently judgemental. The Audit 
Committee assesses these judgements based 
on reports received from management 
and the Group’s actuarial advisors. 
Internal control and internal audit
The Audit Committee also considers the 
results of internal control reviews and reviews 
the effectiveness of the internal audit function. 
There is a rolling programme of internal

Directors’ remuneration report
Annual Statement
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for the year ended 30 September 2014. 
Our strategy
Our return to growth has been shaped by 
a strategy, which focuses on high volume 
and high value targets, and utilises our 
strong technical excellence, marketing 
know-how and innovation across our five 
chosen markets of Automotive, Aerospace, 
Electronics, Energy and Medical. This 
strategy has been underpinned by a clear 
and focused product leadership strategy, 
which keeps us well placed for further 
success over the longer term.
Paying for performance
In 2013, we focused on re-alignment of 
reward and strategic goals to ensure that pay 
at Victrex truly drives optimum performance 
for all our stakeholders. This included a 
re-alignment of our bonus structure, which 
was outlined in our Remuneration Policy 
last year. This year has been focused on 
embedding changes made in the previous 
year and evolving and strengthening our 
practices and approach to ensure that we 
continue to reward only for superior and 
sustained performance. 
We believe in rewarding our executives 
based on their individual performance and 
on the value created for our shareholders. 
The variable elements of executive 
remuneration are focused on simple and 
transparent measures of profit before tax, 
EPS growth and key strategic objectives. 
Our bonus and long-term incentive structures 
are based on challenging targets, which we 
believe are in line with market best practice. 
These are outlined on pages 45 to 47.
Key pay outcomes of 2014
As reported in 2013, salaries for 
the executive Directors were frozen 
and the bonus amounts were waived. 
The Long-Term Incentive Plan (“the LTIP”) 
vested in December 2013 at 16.56% of the 
maximum, primarily due to the threshold 
TSR target not being met. The 2014 
outcomes are as follows:
» » Basic salaries for executive directors will 
increase by 2.7% for 2015.
» » Annual bonuses are based on stretching 
targets. An award of 66.41% of salary was 
approved for D R Hummel, with awards of 
53.39% and 63.75% of salary approved for 
L S Burdett and T J Cooper respectively. 
This reflects the strong financial results 
the Company has achieved this year.
» » The LTIP, granted in December 2011, 
is due to vest in December 2014. These 
awards are based on the results the 
Company achieved in the year ended 
30 September 2014. Despite the strong 
results this year, the LTIP award has not 
achieved its TSR and EPS targets for the 
three year cumulative period and thus 
will lapse in full.
Despite the continued challenging 
environment, Victrex has delivered strong 
results in 2014 and the Remuneration 
Committee (“the Committee”) believes that 
the current year pay outcomes accurately 
reflect the current year’s performance.
Clarity and openness in disclosure
The Committee strives to operate and 
demonstrate best practice in the area 
of executive remuneration and disclosure 
and trust that our report demonstrates 
transparency and clarity in our disclosures. 
Our report has three sections as follows:
» » this Annual Statement, which summarises 
and explains the major decisions in 
respect of Directors’ remuneration;
» » our Directors’ Remuneration Policy, 
as approved at the last AGM; and 
» » the Annual Report on Remuneration, 
providing details of how the policy will 
operate in 2015 and the remuneration 
earned by the Company’s Directors 
in relation to the year ended 
30 September 2014.
At the forthcoming AGM on 4 February 2015, 
the Annual Report on Remuneration will be 
subject to an advisory shareholder vote. The 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved 
by our shareholders at the 2014 AGM and will 
be subject to a binding vote every three years 
(or sooner if changes are made to the policy).
Remuneration policy for 2015
The Committee continually reviews the 
senior executive remuneration policy to 
ensure it promotes the motivation and 
retention of the high quality executives 
who are the key to delivering sustainable 
earnings growth and shareholder return 
in the future. 
The Committee continues to believe 
that our current remuneration policy, 
as approved by the shareholders, remains 
appropriate and should continue to operate 
for 2015 without changes. 
Alignment with shareholders
We are mindful of our shareholders’ 
interests and are keen to ensure a 
demonstrable link between reward and 
value creation. Our staggered vesting of 
our LTIP, operation of a clawback provision 
and shareholding guidelines all foster an 
on-going commitment to the business from 
our executives and continued alignment 
of shareholder and executive objectives. 
Our Chief Executive’s significant shareholding 
also demonstrates his on-going commitment 
to the long-term success of the Company.
We are very proud of the support we have 
received in the past from our shareholders, with 
97.72% approval for our Remuneration Policy 
last year. We hope that we will continue to 
receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.

Directors’ remuneration policy (restated from Annual Report 2013)
In formulating the remuneration policy, full consideration has been given to the principles set out in the Code and the Committee regularly 
reviews the policy to ensure it takes due account of best practice and the particular circumstances of the Company. Consistent with the 
legislation, the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report, the policy for which will operate from 1 October 2013, was put to a binding 
shareholder vote and became formally effective at the 2014 AGM.
Policy overview
The Company aims to provide a remuneration structure that is aligned with shareholder interests and, as such, is competitive in the 
marketplace to retain and motivate executive Directors of superior calibre in order to deliver continued growth of the business.
Company policy is that performance related components should form a significant portion of the overall remuneration package, with 
maximum total potential rewards being earned through the achievement of challenging performance targets based on measures that 
represent the best interests of shareholders. 
Consideration of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year at a meeting immediately 
following the AGM. This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time, is then considered as part 
of the Company’s annual review of remuneration policy. In addition, the Remuneration Committee will seek to engage directly with major 
shareholders and their representative bodies should any material changes be made to the remuneration policy. 
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’s remuneration report and any matters discussed with shareholders 
during the year are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee considers the general basic salary increase for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary 
increases and remuneration for the executive Directors. Employees have not been consulted in respect of the design of the Company’s 
senior executive remuneration policy to date, although the Committee will keep this under review.
Summary remuneration policy
The table below summarises the Directors’ remuneration policy for 2014 onwards:
Element of 
remuneration Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum Performance targets

and the Group’ s financial 
circumstances, as well as 
comparing each executive 
Director’ s basic salary to

Group and relative to the 
external market
There is no prescribed 
maximum annual increase.

Notes
(1)  A description of how the Company intends to implement the policy set out in this table is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
(2)  The following differences exist between the Company’s policy for the remuneration of executive Directors as set out above and its approach to the 
payment of employees generally:
» » A lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity (or zero bonus opportunity) may apply to employees other than the executive Directors and certain 
senior executives.
» » Benefits offered to other employees generally comprise provision of healthcare and company car benefits where required for the role or to meet market norms.
» » The majority of employees participate in local defined contribution pension arrangements. A small number remain in the UK defined benefits section 
which closed to new entrants in 2002.
» » Participation in the LTIP is limited to the executive Directors and certain selected senior managers. Other employees are eligible to participate in the 
Company’s share option schemes.
  In general, these differences arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for the various categories of 
individuals. They also reflect the fact that, in the case of the executive Directors and senior executives, a greater emphasis tends to be placed on 
performance related pay. 
(3)  The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflect the Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should 
be appropriately challenging and tied to both the delivery of profit growth and specific individual objectives. 
(4)  The TSR and EPS performance conditions applicable to the LTIP were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they reward the delivery 
of long-term returns to shareholders and the Group’s financial growth and are consistent with the Company’s objective of delivering superior levels of 
long-term value to shareholders. The TSR performance condition is monitored on the Committee’s behalf by New Bridge Street whilst the Group’s EPS 
growth is derived from the audited financial statements.
(5)  The Committee operates share plans in accordance with their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC where relevant. 
The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of certain plans.
(6)  All employee share plans (SAYE and AESOP) do not operate performance conditions. Executive Directors do not participate in the Victrex 2005 Executive 
Share Option Plan (ESOP) (which is the primary share incentive arrangement for below Board executives). 
(7)  As highlighted above, the Company has a share ownership policy which requires the executive Directors to build up and maintain a target holding equal 
to 100% of base salary.
(8)  For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Directors’ Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into 
with current or former Directors (such as the payment of a pension or the vesting/exercise of past share awards). Details of any payments to former 
Directors will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. www.victrexplc.com

Illustrations of application of remuneration policy
The chart below illustrates how the composition of the executive Directors’ remuneration packages varies at different levels of performance 
under the policy, both as a percentage of total remuneration opportunity and as a total value:
Notes
(1) D R Hummel’s 2014 salary of $707,250 has been converted at the closing exchange rate of FY 13 of £1:$1.63.
(2)  The value of benefits receivable in 2014 is taken to be the value of benefits received in 2013 (as calculated under the Directors’ Remuneration table).
(3) The value of pension is as presented under the Directors’ Remuneration table.
(4)  The on-target level of bonus is taken to be 50% of the maximum bonus opportunity (125% of salary for D R Hummel and 100% of salary for A S Barrow 
and T J Cooper).
(5)  The on-target level of vesting under the LTIP is taken to be 61.25% (being part-way between threshold and maximum vesting) of the face value of the 
award at grant.
(6) The maximum value of the LTIP is taken to be 100% of the face value of the award at grant.
(7) No share price appreciation has been assumed for the deferred bonus shares and LTIP awards.
Service contracts for executive Directors
The service agreements of the executive Directors are not fixed term and are terminable by either the Company or the Director on twelve 
months’ notice and make provision, at the Board’s discretion, for early termination by way of payment of salary in lieu of twelve months’ 
notice. Incidental expenses may also be payable where appropriate. In calculating the amount payable to a Director on termination of 
employment, the Board would take into account the commercial interests of the Company. The Remuneration Committee reviews the 
contractual terms for new executive Directors to ensure these reflect best practice.
 Provision Detailed terms
Notice period 12 months
Termination payment Up to 12 months’ salary
Remuneration entitlements
A bonus may be payable (pro-rated where relevant) and outstanding 
share awards may vest

Corporate governance
Directors’ remuneration policy continued
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The remuneration package for a new executive Director – i.e. basic salary, benefits, pension, annual bonus and long-term incentive awards 
– would be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s prevailing approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment and 
would reflect the experience of the individual. The salary for a new executive may be set below the normal market rate, with phased 
increases over the first few years, as the executive gains experience in their new role. Annual bonus potential will be limited to 125% of 
salary and long-term incentives will be limited to 150% of salary (200% of salary in exceptional circumstances). In addition, the Committee 
may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company (and therefore 
shareholders) to take account of remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would where possible reflect the nature, 
time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the 
time of appointment. 
For an internal executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out 
according to its terms. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue, provided that 
they are put to shareholders for approval at the earliest opportunity. 
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation and/or incidental 
expenses as appropriate.
Approach to leavers
Annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the financial year served although it will be pro-rated for time and paid at the 
normal payout date. Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive Director under the Company’s share plans will be determined 
based on the relevant plan rules. The default treatment under the 2009 LTIP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill health, disability, retirement or other circumstances at the discretion of the 
Committee, ‘good leaver’ status may be applied. For good leavers, awards will normally vest on cessation, subject to the satisfaction of 
the relevant performance conditions at that time and reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served. 
However, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine that awards vest at a later date and/or to disapply time pro-rating. 
The default treatment for deferred bonus awards is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain 
‘good leaver’ circumstances (as described under the 2009 LTIP above), awards will normally vest in full on the date of cessation 
(unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise). 
The executive Directors may accept outside appointments, with prior Board approval, provided these opportunities do not negatively 
impact on the individual’s ability to perform his duties at the Company. Whether any related fees are retained by the individual or are 
remitted to the Company will be considered on a case by case basis.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors are appointed under arrangements that may generally be terminated at will by either party without compensation 
and their appointment is reviewed annually.

Annual Report on Remuneration
Implementation of the remuneration policy for the year ending 30 September 2015
A summary of how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be applied during the year ending 30 September 2015 is set out below.
Basic salary
Following a freeze in 2013, the Remuneration Committee agreed to the following increases for executive Director base salary levels for 2015.
2015 2014 % increase
D R Hummel $726,346 $707,250 2.7
L S Burdett (appointed 1 February 2014) £308,100 £300,000 2.7
T J Cooper £267,020 £260,000 2.7
The Group’s employees are, in general, receiving pay rises ranging from 2.7% to 5.0% depending on promotional increases and 
individual performance.
Pension arrangements
A S Barrow continued to participate in the defined benefit section of the Group’s UK pension scheme until 9 February 2014, as detailed on page 55. 
T J Cooper withdrew from participation in the defined contribution section of the Group’s UK pension scheme with effect from 
1 April 2014 as a consequence of the change in Lifetime Allowance effective at that date.
L S Burdett participates in the defined contribution section of the Group’s UK pension scheme.
Members of the UK pension scheme are entitled to life assurance cover of four times salary and a retirement pension subject to the scheme rules; 
if a member dies whilst in pensionable service, a surviving spouse and dependants are entitled to a pension subject to the scheme rules. D R Hummel 
will continue to participate in a defined contribution scheme and a life assurance plan operated in respect of the Group’s US employees. 
The Group’s contribution to his pension scheme and associated salary supplement remain at 25% of salary. Where the promised levels of benefits 
cannot be provided through the appropriate scheme, the Group will continue to provide benefits through the provision of salary supplements. 
Annual bonus
The maximum bonus potential for the year ending 30 September 2015 will remain at 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% 
of basic salary for the Group Finance Director and VPS Managing Director. Awards are determined based on a combination of both the 
Group’s financial results, being growth in Group profit before tax, and an executive’s personal performance achievement level. For the 
achievement of growth in Group profit before tax at or above the threshold target, a multiplier, based on personal performance, will apply to 
the outturn, which can either increase the pay-out level or reduce it to nil. Maximum bonus will only be payable when both the financial 
results of the Group and the Executive’s individual performance against objectives have significantly exceeded expectations. Any amount of 
bonus will only be payable if, in the opinion of the Committee, there is an improvement in the underlying financial and operating 
performance of the Group during the year ending 30 September 2015. Deferral into shares for any part of the Chief Executive’s bonus 
above 100% of salary and the claw back provisions for all executive Directors will continue to apply.
Long-term incentives
Consistent with past awards, the extent to which LTIP awards which will be granted in 2015 will vest will be dependent on two independent 
performance conditions – 50% determined by reference to the Company’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’) and 50% determined by 
reference to the Group’s earnings per share (‘EPS’), as follows:
» » the TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to the 
constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the beginning of that period. This element of the award is reduced to 
25% on a pro-rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance; and
» » the EPS element of an award will vest in full if EPS growth exceeds inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, by an average of 12% 
per annum or more over the three year period. This element of the award is reduced to 20% on a pro-rata basis if EPS growth exceeds 
inflation by an average of 5% per annum over the period and is reduced to nil if EPS growth fails to exceed inflation by 5% per annum.
As set out in the 2013 Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report, awards granted from December 2013 onwards are subject to a clawback provision.
Non-executive Directors
The Company’s approach to non-executive Directors’ remuneration is set by the Board with account taken of the time and responsibility involved 
in each role, including, where applicable, the Chairmanship of Board Committees. 
Fee increases are detailed below for the 2014/2015 financial year.
Provision 2015 2014 % increase
Chairman £157,900 £153,750 2.7
Base fee £45,300 £44,075 2.8
Additional fees:
Senior Independent Director £5,000 £4,000 25
Audit Committee Chair £9,000 £6,000 50
Remuneration Committee Chair £8,000 £6,000 33
The Committee Chair fees were reviewed with a view to adjusting them from being below lower quartile as benchmarked against other 
FTSE 250 companies, to below middle range but above lower quartile. www.victrexplc.com

4. Annual bonus payments 
The annual bonus outturn presented in the table below was based on performance against growth in Group profit before tax and an 
element of achievement against both shared and individual personal performance measured over the 2014 financial year.

T J Cooper 100 94.6 15 102.7 63.75
(1) The bonus for L S Burdett has been pro-rated for 2014.
Final bonus outcome is determined by calculating the pay-out based on achievement of PBT growth targets and personal performance based 
on the Committee’s assessment of achievement of personal objectives set at the beginning of the year. Personal objectives are set for each 
individual and relate to organisational development of the Group, acceleration of overall growth strategy, and development/strengthening of 
the management team. The bonus is not payable unless the underlying PBT growth targets are met, maximum bonus is only paid where both 
PBT growth and personal performance are at maximum. The Committee believes that this combination of financial and personal objectives 
strongly aligns with the organisation’s strategic goals and the determination of bonus outcomes elsewhere in the Group.
5. Vesting of LTIP awards
The LTIP award granted on 12 December 2011 was based on performance to the year ended 30 September 2014. The performance targets 
for this award and actual performance against those targets were as follows:
Metric Performance condition Threshold target Stretch target Actual % vesting
Earnings per share Normalised EPS growth of RPI 
+ 5% p.a. (10% vesting) to 
RPI + 12% p.a. (50% vesting)

Total shareholder return TSR against the constituents 
of the FTSE 250 index

12.5% vesting for median 
performance and 50% 
vesting for upper quartile 
performance or above. TSR 
measured over three financial 
years with a three month 
average at the start and end 
of the performance period

Executive Directors are required to hold shares in the Company worth 100% of salary and must retain 50% of the net of tax value of any 
vested LTIP shares until the guideline is met. The shareholding as a percentage is based on the average share price during September 2014 
of £16.949. 
Performance graph and table 
The following graph shows the cumulative total shareholder return of the Company over the last three financial years relative to the FTSE 
250 Index. The FTSE 250 Index has been selected for consistency as it is the index against which the Company’s total shareholder return is 
measured for the purposes of the LTIP. In addition, the Company is a constituent of the Index. TSR is a measure of the returns that a 
company has provided for its shareholders, reflecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends. Data is averaged 
over three months at the end of each financial year.

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
The Company’s approach to the Chairman’s and executive Directors’ remuneration is determined by the Board on the advice of the Committee. 
The members of the Committee (all of whom were independent non-executive Directors) during the year under review were as follows:
» » Patrick De Smedt (Remuneration Committee Chairman)
» » Pamela Kirby
» » Giles Kerr
» » Larry Pentz
Larry Pentz is no longer a member of the Committee following his appointment as Chairman of the Company on 1 October 2014. 
Biographical information on the Committee members and details of attendance at the Committee’s meetings during the year are set out 
on pages 32, 33 and 37.
The Committee has access to independent advice where it considers it appropriate. For the 2014 financial year, the Committee sought 
advice relating to executive remuneration from New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), part of Aon plc, whom the Committee appointed. NBS provides 
no other services to the Company, although another part of the Aon plc group provides insurance broking and consultancy services. The 
Committee is entirely comfortable that the provision of these services does not in any way prejudice NBS’s position as independent advisors 
to the Committee. From 1 October 2014, Towers Watson has been appointed to advise the Committee. Towers Watson is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and abides by the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct, which requires its advice to be 
objective and impartial.
The fees paid to NBS for providing advice in relation to executive remuneration over the financial year under review was £34,243.

Corporate governance
Directors’ responsibilities for the 
preparation of the Annual Report
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group and Parent Company financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union 
(‘EU’) and applicable law and have elected 
to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements on the same basis.
Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Parent Company and of their profit or loss 
for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
» » select suitable accounting policies and 
apply them consistently;
» » make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
» » state whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
EU; and
» » prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and Parent Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Parent Company and enable 
them to ensure that its financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to them 
to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations 
the Directors are also responsible for 
preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and Corporate Governance statement 
that comply with that law and those 
regulations. The Directors are responsible 
for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation 
in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Board considers that the Annual Report 
and financial statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy.

Directors’ responsibilities statement 
in respect of the Annual Report
We confirm that to the best of 
our knowledge:
» » the financial statements, prepared 
in accordance with the applicable 
set of accounting standards, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and 
profit or loss of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
» » the management report, which 
comprises the Directors’ Report and 
the Strategic Report, includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and 
position of the issuer and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks 
and the uncertainties that they face.
The Directors of Victrex plc are

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Victrex plc
Opinions and conclusions arising 
from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial 
statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial 
statements of Victrex plc for the year 
ended 30 September 2014 set out on 
pages 62 to 85. In our opinion: 
» » the financial statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Group’s and 
of the parent company’s affairs as at 
30 September 2014 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended; 
» » the Group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
» » the Parent Company financial 
statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU and as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006; and 
» » the financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on 
the financial statements the risks of material 
misstatement that had the greatest effect 
on the audit were as set out below. 
Valuation of inventories (£44.2 million)
Refer to page 43 of Audit Committee Report 
and note 11 on page 74 for accounting policy 
and financial disclosures
» » The risk – The Group has £44.2m of 
inventory and a number of estimates 
are involved in arriving at the valuation 
of inventories relating to fully absorbed 
manufacturing costs and the assessment 
of provisions against cost in respect of 
slow moving and obsolete inventories. 
Given the level of judgements and estimates 
involved this is considered to be a key 
audit risk.
» » Our response – In respect of adjustments 
relating to fully absorbed manufacturing 
costs our audit procedures included, 
among others: challenging the Group’s 
assessment of the normal levels of 
production for absorption costing 
purposes by comparison to actual 
and budgeted levels of production over 
the past two years; understanding and 
corroborating the impact of manufacturing 
variances in relation to production output 
and comparing actual production output 
levels to standard and historical levels; and 
recalculating purchase price variances by 
reference to actual purchase invoice costs.
In assessing provisions for slow moving 
and obsolete inventories our audit 
procedures included: testing the Group’s 
controls designed to identify slow moving 
and obsolete inventories; comparison, by 
product grade, of inventory levels to sales 
data to assess whether slow moving and 
obsolete inventories had been appropriately 
identified by the Group and provided 
for based on expected recoveries; and 
attending the year-end stock take to 
consider the extent of slow moving and 
obsolete inventories. We considered 
realisations of slow moving inventories 
during the year and post year end and 
compared these to the Group’s expected 
recoveries for slow moving inventories at 
the year-end date. We also considered 
the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
in respect of inventory.
Retirement benefit obligations 
(£7.8 million, net obligations)
Refer to page 43 of Audit Committee Report 
and note 14 of pages 78 to 80 for 
accounting policy and financial disclosures
» » The risk – A valuation of the scheme 
liabilities is provided by an external 
actuary on behalf of the Group based on 
various assumptions as set out in financial 
statements. Significant estimates are 
made in valuing the Group’s post-
retirement defined benefit schemes. 
Small changes in assumptions and 
estimates used to value the Group’s net 
pension deficit would have a significant 
effect on the results and financial position 
of the Group and therefore this is 
considered to be a key audit risk.
» » Our response – In this area our audit 
procedures included, testing of the 
controls over the maintenance of each 
scheme’s membership data as well as 
sample testing from those data to the 
source documentation establishing the 
obligation to members and vice versa. 
With the support of our own actuarial 
specialists, we then challenged the key 
assumptions applied to those data to 
determine the Group’s net deficit, being 
the discount rate, inflation rate, rate of 
future salary increases, and mortality/life 
expectancy. This included a comparison 
of these key assumptions against externally 
derived data. We also considered the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of the sensitivity of the deficits 
to these assumptions. 
3 Our application of materiality and 
an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole was set at £7.5m, 
determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Group profit before taxation (of which 
it represents 7.3%).
We report to the Audit Committee any 
corrected and uncorrected identified 
misstatements exceeding £370,000, in 
addition to other audit misstatements that 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We performed audits for Group reporting 
purposes at 7 of the Group’s 14 reporting 
components, and a review of financial 
information at a further one component 
in Japan. The latter was not individually 
significant enough to require an audit 
for group reporting purposes, but we 
performed a review due to its comparatively 
remote geographical location and its 
operational significance to the Group’s 
operations in the Asia Pacific region. 
The audits for Group reporting purposes 
covered 89% of Group revenue, 97% of 
profit before tax and 99% of total assets. 
In total, the audits for Group reporting 
purposes and further review of one component 
covered 95% of revenue, 97% of profit before 
tax and 100% of total assets. www.victrexplc.com
Annual Report 2014 / Victrex plc / 61 
Corporate governance
For the remaining components, we performed 
analytical procedures to re-examine our 
assessment that there were no significant 
risks of material misstatement within these.
The audits of components for group 
reporting purposes were performed by 
the Group audit team and the review was 
performed by component auditors. The 
Group team instructed the component 
auditors as to the significant areas to be 
covered (which included the relevant risks 
of material misstatement detailed above) 
and set out the information required to 
be reported back to the Group audit 
team. The Group audit team approved 
the component materiality, which ranged 
from £1.0m to £2.0m, having regard to 
the mix of size and risk profile of the 
businesses within the Group. 
4 Our opinion on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
is unmodified
In our opinion: 
» » the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and 
» » the information given in the Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements. 
5 We have nothing to report in respect 
of the matters on which we are required 
to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required 
to report to you if, based on the knowledge 
we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the annual 
report that contains a material inconsistency 
with either that knowledge or the financial 
statements, a material misstatement of fact, 
or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report 
to you if: 
» » we have identified material inconsistencies 
between the knowledge we acquired 
during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the 
Annual Report and financial statements 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy; or
» » the Audit Committee Report does not 
appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
» » adequate accounting records have 
not been kept by the Parent Company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or 
» » the Parent Company financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
» » certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or 
» » we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required 
to review: 
» » the Directors’ statement, set out on page 
58, in relation to going concern; and
» » the part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement on pages 35 to 43 relating 
to the Company’s compliance with the 
nine provisions of the 2010 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the 
above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement, set out on page 
59, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. A description of the scope of an 
audit of financial statements is provided on 
the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s

Financial statements
Notes to the financial statements
1. Basis of preparation
General information
Victrex plc (the ‘Company’) is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of its Registered 
Office is Victrex Technology Centre, Hillhouse International, Thornton Cleveleys, Lancashire FY5 4QD, United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 30 September 2014 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the ‘Group’).
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
These consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 8 December 2014.
Basis of preparation
Both the consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (‘endorsed IFRS’) and on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments are measured 
at their fair value.
The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 6 to 31. In addition, note 13 on financial risk management details the Group’s exposure to a variety of financial 
risks, including currency and credit risk.
The Group has significant positive cash balances and has a committed bank facility of £40m which expires in 2017. This facility was undrawn 
at 30 September 2014 and remained undrawn at 8 December 2014 when these consolidated financial statements were approved for issue 
by the Board of Directors.
The Directors have performed a robust assessment, including review of the budget for the year ended 30 September 2015 and longer term 
strategic forecasts and plans including consideration of the principal risks faced by the company, as detailed on pages 18 and 19. Following 
this review the Directors are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue to operate and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future, a period considered to be at least 12 months from the date of signing these financial 
statements. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis for preparing the financial statements. Details of the Group’s 
policy on liquidity risk and capital management are included in note 13 to the financial statements.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the consolidated financial statements, the Company is taking 
advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part 
of the approved financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with endorsed IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Details of significant estimates and assumptions are set out in note 19.
The accounting policies set out in these notes have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied by Group entities.
A number of new standards and amendments to existing standards are effective for the financial year ending 30 September 2014, including 
IAS 19 Revised. None of these have had a material impact and accordingly the 30 September 2013 comparatives have not been restated.
A number of standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued and endorsed by the EU but are not yet effective and 
accordingly the Group has not yet adopted. The cumulative impact of the adoption of these standards is not expected to be significant.
Effective for the Group’s financial year ending 30 September 2015:
  IFRS 10 – Consolidated Financial Statements; 
  IFRS 11 – Joint Arrangements; 
  IFRS 12 – Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities; 
  IAS 27 – Separate Financial Statements; 
  IAS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures; and
  Improvements to IFRSs:
 – IFRS 2 – Share-based Payment;
 – IFRS 8 – Operating Segments;
 – IFRS13 – Fair Value Measurement;
 – IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements; 
 – IAS 16 – Property, Plant and Equipment; 
 – IAS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentations; and 
 – IAS 34 – Interim Financial Reporting. www.victrexplc.com

2. Segment reporting
The Group complies with IFRS 8 – Operating Segments which requires operating segments to be identified and reported upon that are 
consistent with the level at which results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision 
maker for the Group is the Victrex plc Board. Information on the business units is the primary basis of information reported to the Victrex plc 
Board. The performance of the business units is assessed based on segmental operating profit.
The Group’s business is strategically organised as two business units (operating segments): Victrex Polymer Solutions, which focuses on our 
automotive, aerospace, electronics and energy markets, and Invibio Biomaterial Solutions, which focuses on providing specialist solutions 
for medical device manufacturers.

From 1 October 2014 the management of sales, marketing and administration functions servicing both business units were consolidated. 
Accordingly the information received by the chief operating decision maker presents segmental performance to the gross profit level with 
overheads reported at a Group level. Future segmental disclosures will therefore be to a gross profit level.
Entity wide disclosures
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the amounts receivable for the sale of goods, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales 
within the Group. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the buyer.
No revenue is recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due or associated costs.
Volume rebates are recognised as a deduction from gross sales as qualifying sales are made throughout the period. These rebates are 
accrued based on the maximum amount due to customers based on annualised sales, unless it is clear that maximum rebate conditions 
will not be met in a particular period.
Information about products
The Group derives its revenue from the sale of high performance thermoplastic polymers.
Information about geographical areas
The Group’s country of domicile is the United Kingdom. Revenues are attributed to customers based on the customer’s location.

5. Income tax expense
Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or equity as appropriate.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: 
goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries except to the extent that they will probably reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount 
of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using 
tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. www.victrexplc.com

7. Property, plant and equipment
Owned assets
All owned items of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment. 
The cost of self constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs 
and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Buildings    30–50 years
Plant and machinery   10–30 years
Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 5–10 years
Computers and motor vehicles  3–5 years
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed annually for continued appropriateness and indications of impairment, 
and adjusted if appropriate.
Depreciation on assets classified as in the course of construction commences when the assets are ready for their intended use, the point 
of which they are reclassified from assets under construction, on the same basis as other assets of that class.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in the income statement.

(see note 3).
8. Intangible assets
Goodwill
 £m 
Cost and carrying amount
At 1 October 2012, 30 September 2013 and 30 September 2014 10.1
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. 
Any impairment provisions that arose during impairment testing would not be reversed.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 October 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the net amount 
recorded previously under UK GAAP. In prior years the amortisation element of the deemed cost at 30 September 2004 was shown separately; 
in the current year this has been deducted from gross cost. In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 1 October 2004, goodwill 
represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment by reference to the estimated future cash flows of the relevant cash-generating unit (‘CGU’), 
discounted to their present value using risk adjusted discount factors to give its value in use. A CGU is the smallest identifiable asset group 
that generates cash flows that are largely independent from other assets and groups.
Impairment losses are recognised if the carrying amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated exceeds its value in use and are 
recognised in the income statement. 
Goodwill comprises £10.1m in Victrex Polymer Solutions relating to acquisitions associated with the supply of our key raw material BDF 
in 1999 and 2005 (£7.4m) and the residual balance of our Japanese joint venture in 2007 (£2.7m). The goodwill is measured against the 
discounted future cash flow projections of our Victrex Polymer Solutions business unit. The long-term average growth rate used was 2.0% 
(2013: 2.5%) and the risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate was 8.0% (2013: 8.0%). The impairment test results in more than 100% headroom 
and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, 
is recognised within the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred unless it meets all the criteria to be capitalised 
under IAS 38 – Intangible Assets.
Research and development expenditure of £15.7m (2013: £14.6m) was expensed to the income statement in the year within administrative expenses.
9. Investments
Investments
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any impairment in the value 
of the investment.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a 
shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable 
or convertible are considered in assessing control. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that 
control ceases. www.victrexplc.com

11. Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the first-in, first-out principle and 
includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. The cost of finished 
goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (allocated based 
on normal operating capacity). Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs 
of completion and selling expenses. Further details on inventory valuation and provisions are included in note 19.

13. Financial risk management
Group
Currency risk
Currently, the Group exports 97% of sales from the UK and also makes raw material purchases overseas.
Currency risk is managed by the Currency Committee, which is chaired by the Group Finance Director and comprises the Chief Executive 
and senior finance executives. It meets monthly to review and manage the Group’s currency hedging activities, in line with the hedging 
policy approved by the Board.
Group hedging policy is to defer the impact on profits of currency movements by hedging:
  a minimum of 90% and a maximum of 100% of projected transaction exposures arising from trading in the forthcoming six month 
period; and
  a minimum of 75% and a maximum of 100% of projected transaction exposures arising in the following six month period. 
Profitability can vary due to the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on the unhedged portion of the transaction exposures and from 
revised forecasts of future trading, which can lead to an adjustment of currency cover in place. 
In addition, the Group includes a number of foreign subsidiaries. As a result of these factors, the Group’s financial statements are exposed 
to currency fluctuations. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US Dollar, Euro and Yen. 
The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling/US Dollar, Sterling/Euro and Sterling/Yen rates on profit for 2014 is £5.5m, £4.2m 
and £0.7m respectively (2013: £4.2m, £3.8m and £0.7m). The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling/US Dollar, Sterling/Euro 
and Sterling/Yen rates on equity for 2014 is £2.4m, £0.6m and £0.4m (2013: £1.8m, £0.6m and £0.4m) respectively.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks. In accordance with its treasury policy, 
the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recognised at fair value. The method of recognising any gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value depends on whether 
the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items. The Group 
also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging 
transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
For derivatives not used in hedging transactions, the gain or loss on remeasurement of fair value is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. www.victrexplc.com
Annual Report 2014 / Victrex plc / 75 
Financial statements
13. Financial risk management continued
Cash flow hedges
The Group hedges a proportion of forecast sales, purchases and capital expenditure, denominated in a foreign currency. The Board is responsible 
for setting the hedging policy which is detailed on page 74. Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after 
the balance sheet date. The Group buys or sells foreign currency at spot where necessary to address any short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or 
a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating 
to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income 
statement in the periods when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.
Any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at the time when the forecast transaction occurs, or when a hedge no longer meets 
the criteria for hedge accounting, is recognised in the income statement. The timing of the gain or loss impacting the income statement 
is aligned to the timing of the hedged transaction impacting the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected 
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair value of the Group’s forward exchange contracts and swaps are as follows:

Current liabilities 65.6 (2.3) 12.3 (0.4)
 172.5 1.7 147.2 4.7
The fair values have been calculated by applying (where relevant), for equivalent maturity profiles, the rate at which forward currency contracts with 
the same principal amounts could be acquired at the balance sheet date. These are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
The following table indicates the periods in which cash flows associated with the maturity date of the forward foreign exchange contracts 
for which hedge accounting is applied are expected to occur:

Gains and losses deferred in the hedging reserve in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts at 30 September 2014 will be recognised 
in the income statement during the period in which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement which is typically 1–2 
months prior to the cash flow occurring. At 30 September 2014, there are a number of hedged foreign currency transactions which are 
expected to occur at various dates during the next 12 months. During the year, gains of £0.6m (2013: £0.5m) relating to forward exchange 
contracts on the balance sheet at 30 September 2014 were released to the income statement.
Gains and losses recognised in the income statement on contracts which are yet to settle are adjusted as a non cash movement on the cash 
flow statements. This equated to a gain of £0.1m in the year (2013: £0.5m loss). www.victrexplc.com

13. Financial risk management continued
Credit risk
The Group manages exposure to credit risk at many levels ranging from Board approval being required for the credit limits of larger customers, 
to the use of letters of credit and cash in advance where appropriate. Internal procedures require regular due consideration of credit ratings, 
payment history, aged items and proactive debt collection. All customers are assigned a credit limit which is subject to annual review.
Trade receivables can be analysed as follows:
2014 2013
As at 30 September £m £m
Amounts neither past due nor impaired 23.4 17.9
Amounts past due but not impaired:
– Less than 30 days 2.5 3.0

Amounts impaired 0.5 0.6
Impairment allowances (0.5) (0.6)
Carrying amount of impaired receivables — —
Trade receivables net of allowances 26.4 21.5
Trade receivables are considered to be impaired when the amount is in dispute, customers are believed to be in financial difficulty or if any 
other reason exists which implies that there is a doubt over the recoverability of the debt. No provision has been made in respect of the 
amounts shown as past due but not impaired as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still 
considered recoverable in full.

At beginning of year 0.6 0.7
Charge in the year — —
Release of allowance (0.1) (0.1)
At end of year 0.5 0.6
The credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties with 
significant balances are established, international banks whose credit ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances, call deposits and other short-term deposits with original maturities typically of three 
months or less.
As at 30 September 2014, the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits was £24.8m (2013: £26.1m) for the Group. As at 
30 September 2014, the largest mark to market exposure for gains on forward foreign exchange contracts to a single bank was £2.0m 
(2013: £2.7m). The amounts on deposit at the year end represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on cash and deposits.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective in terms of funding capacity is to ensure that it always has sufficient short-term and long-term funding available, 
either in the form of the Group’s cash resources or committed bank facilities. The Group has sufficient funds available in order to meet its 
current funding requirements for both revenue and capital expenditure. In order to further manage liquidity risk to an acceptable level, the 
Group has a committed bank facility of £40m, all of which was undrawn at the year end. This facility expires in September 2017.
As at 30 September 2014 the Group had a cash and cash equivalents balance of £89.6m. www.victrexplc.com
Annual Report 2014 / Victrex plc / 77

13. Financial risk management continued
Price risk
The Group’s products contain a number of key raw materials and its operations require energy, notably electricity and natural gas. Any 
increase or volatility in prices and any significant decrease in the availability of raw materials or energy could affect the Group’s results. 
Victrex strives to obtain the best prices and uses contractual means to benefit where appropriate and possible. The Group has a significant 
degree of control over its supply chain which enables it to effectively manage the risk in this area.
Capital management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total equity. The Group’s policy for managing capital is to maintain a strong 
balance sheet with the objective of maintaining customer, supplier and investor confidence in the business and to ensure that the Group 
has sufficient resources to be able to invest in future development and growth of the business.
The Board does not expect to make significant share repurchases in 2015, although there is a resolution proposed at each Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’) to authorise the Company to make one or more market purchases of its ordinary shares up to a maximum number of 
shares equal to 10% of its issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the AGM notice.

For trade and other payables there are no amounts due after one year, the majority falling due in 30 days or less.
Company
As a result of US Dollar denominated intragroup loans with subsidiary undertakings, the Company is exposed to currency fluctuations. 
The Company does not actively manage the risk of exchange rate movements given that the counterparty to the loans is a subsidiary of the 
Company and therefore any gains or losses would be eliminated at Group level. The impact of a 5% movement in the average Sterling/US Dollar 
rate on these loans is £1.0m.
These intragroup loans are financial assets designated as loans and receivables. As at 30 September 2014 the Company has intragroup 
loans outstanding totalling £19.9m (2013: £19.9m). These loans are over terms of 7–8 years at interest rates of 7.15–7.40%.
The only trade receivables of the Company are amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings. www.victrexplc.com

14. Retirement benefit obligations
Employee benefits
Defined contribution pension schemes
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the future 
benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods less the fair value of plan assets, together 
with adjustments for past service costs not yet recognised. The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and 
have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs 
and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions 
to the plan. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that 
apply. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan or on settlement of the plan liabilities. When 
the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in the profit or 
loss on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the 
expense is recognised in profit or loss.
Victrex has decided to take advantage of the option under IAS 19 (Revised) – Employee Benefits to recognise actuarial gains and losses 
through the statement of comprehensive income as opposed to the income statement.
Ongoing actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in full through the statement of comprehensive income.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes for its employees throughout the world. The majority of schemes outside the UK are 
defined contribution.
The principal scheme operated by the Group is a funded UK pension scheme in which employees of UK subsidiary undertakings participate. 
The scheme has two sections. One section provides benefits on a defined benefit basis with benefits related to final pensionable pay. 
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 31 December 2001. From this date new employees have been invited to join 
the second section that provides benefits on a defined contribution basis.

14. Retirement benefit obligations continued
Principal actuarial assumptions continued
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, inflation rate and expected salary 
increase. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end 
of the reporting period assuming that all other assumptions are held constant:
Change in assumption
Increase in fund deficit
as at 30 September 2014
Increase in fund deficit
as at 30 September 2013
Reduce discount rate by 1% p.a. £15.5m £12.4m
Increase inflation expectations by 1% p.a. £13.9m £10.3m
Increase salary inflation by 1% p.a. £3.2m £2.8m
In reality one might expect interrelationships between the assumptions, especially between discount rate and expected salary increases 
that both depend to a certain extent on expected inflation rates. The above analysis does not take the effect of these interrelationships 
into account.

16. Share-based payments
All options are settled by the physical delivery of shares. The terms and conditions of all the grants are as follows:
Victrex 2005 Executive Share Option Plan (‘ESOP’) 
All employees are eligible to participate. The Remuneration Committee currently excludes executive Directors from participating in this plan. 
Option awards are based on a percentage of basic salary, not exceeding 100% of salary in each financial year. The exercise price of the 
options is equal to the market price of the shares on the date of grant. ESOP options are conditional on the employee completing three 
years’ service (the vesting period) and achieving the performance condition. The level of awards vesting will vary depending on EPS growth. 
In order for awards to reach the threshold level of vest, the EPS growth of the Group must exceed the Retail Prices Index by 2% per annum. 
For awards over 33% of salary, the threshold increases to 3%, and then to 4% for awards over 66%. Straight line vesting will occur to the 
extent that EPS growth falls between these annual EPS growth targets. These options are exercisable from the date of vest to the seven 
year anniversary of the grant date.
Victrex 2005 Sharesave Plan
UK resident employees and full-time Directors of the Company or any designated participating subsidiary are eligible to participate. 
The exercise price of the granted Sharesave Plan options is equal to the market price of the ordinary shares less 20% on the date of grant.
Victrex 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
US based employees (including executive Directors) are eligible to participate. The price payable for each ordinary share shall be a price 
determined by the Board, provided that it shall not be less than 85% of the lower of the market value of an ordinary share on the date 
of grant or the date of purchase.
Awards may be granted over a number of ordinary shares determined by the amount employees have saved by the end of a one year 
savings period.
Victrex 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘2009 LTIP’)
The 2009 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGM and replaced the 1999 LTIP.
Each year executive Directors, and senior executives by invitation, are eligible to be awarded options to acquire, at no cost, market 
purchased ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum equivalent of 150% of basic salary. In exceptional circumstances, such 
as recruitment or retention, this limit is increased to 200% of an employee’s annual basic salary.
Details of the 2009 LTIP can be found within the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 46.

16. Share-based payments continued
Fair value of share options and assumptions
Share-based payment transactions and employee share ownership trusts (‘ESOT’)
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity. Share-based payment transactions are recharged from the Company to those subsidiaries benefiting from the service of 
the employees to whom options are granted.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the 
impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that 
are expected to vest and include employee service periods and performance targets which are not related to the Company’s share price, 
such as earnings per share growth. The fair value of the options is measured by the Stochastic model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the instruments were granted. At each balance sheet date the entity revises its estimates of the number of options 
that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and 
a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Any failure to meet market conditions, which includes performance targets such as share price or total shareholder return, would not result 
in a reversal of original estimates in the income statement.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable costs, are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the 
options are exercised.
The Group and Company provide finance to the ESOT to purchase Company shares in the open market. Costs of running the ESOT are charged 
to the income statement. The cost of shares held by the ESOT are deducted in arriving at equity until they are exercised by employees.
All share-based payment costs are recharged to the trading entities.

All share options are granted under a service condition and for ESOP and LTIP a non-market condition (EPS). Such conditions are not taken 
into account in the grant date fair value measurement of services received. In addition, the LTIP has a market condition (TSR), which is taken 
into account in the grant date measurement of fair value.

benefits and contributions to post-employment defined benefit plans, are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 44 to 56.
Directors of the Company control 3.8% of the voting shares of the Company, details of which are given on page 54.
Details of Directors’ indemnities are given on page 58.
19. Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that the Directors have made in the process of applying 
the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. 
Management has discussed these with the Audit Committee. These should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies 
provided in the notes to the financial statements.
Inventory valuation 
The valuation of inventory includes the absorption of directly attributable costs over a normal level of production. Judgement is used both 
in identification of directly attributable costs and normal production. The assessment of normal production considers actual, prior period 
and budgeted production when concluding on the appropriate level. Management use their detailed experience in this process. Inventory 
provisions are put in place where cost is considered to be higher than net realisable value, the latter being a judgement based on ageing, 
customer order profiles, scrap values and the option to re-process.  www.victrexplc.com
Annual Report 2014 / Victrex plc / 85 
Financial statements
19. Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Pension scheme
The valuation of pension scheme liabilities is calculated in accordance with Group policy. The valuation is prepared by independent 
qualified actuaries but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, 
the discount rate applied, investment returns and member longevity which underpin the valuations. Note 14 contains information about 
the assumptions relating to retirement benefit obligations.
Property, plant and equipment
In relation to property, plant and equipment, useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been established using historical 
experience and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved. Assets are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine whether 
circumstances exist that could lead to a change in the useful economic life or a potential impairment of the carrying value of such assets. 
Historically, changes in carrying value, useful lives or residual values have not resulted in material changes to either the carrying value 
of the Group’s assets or the annual depreciated expense.
Tax provisioning
The Group operates in a number of geographies and different tax jurisdictions. There is an inherent uncertainty in some of these jurisdictions 
requiring judgement at period ends over the amount of taxation payable. Management use their experience of each geography along with 
that of their advisors in estimating the tax charge for the period. 
Research and development expenditure
The Group incurs significant expenditure on research and development, both in respect of internal process improvement and product 
and application development. IAS 38 – Intangible Assets sets out strict criteria in respect of capitalising development costs which require 
an element of judgement to assess if these have been made. The nature of our business is such that new products and applications often 
need to go through lengthy client testing and regulatory approval, the success of which is inherently uncertain and therefore predicting 
the outcome requires a significant level of judgement. As such until these phases are complete the expenditure is not considered to meet 
the IAS 38 criteria, by which point the significant majority of development expenditure has been incurred. Accordingly no development 
expenditure has been capitalised in the current or prior years.
20. Exchange rates
Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operated (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, 
which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing on the dates of the transactions. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the retranslation to balance sheet date 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when 
deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges. In addition where an exchange difference arises on an intragroup monetary item that, in 
substance, forms part of the entity’s net investment in a foreign operation, these differences are recognised in other comprehensive income 
in the consolidated financial statements and accumulated in equity until the disposal of the foreign operation.
Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which have the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have 
a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
  income and expenses for each income statement are translated at weighted average exchange rates; and
  all resulting exchange differences, from 1 October 2004, are recognised as a separate component of equity.
The most significant Sterling exchange rates used in the financial statements under the Group’s accounting policies are:

Shareholder information
Notes
1.  Shareholders who are entitled to attend and vote at the meeting are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to 
attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the AGM 
provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. A proxy 
need not be a shareholder of the Company. 
2.  To be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM (and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the votes they may cast), 
shareholders must be registered in the Register of Members of the Company at 6pm on 2 February 2015 (or, in the event of any 
adjournment 6pm on the day two days prior to the adjourned meeting). Changes to the Register of Members after the relevant deadline 
shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting.
3.  A hard copy form of proxy (‘Form of Proxy’) which may be used to appoint a proxy and give instructions accompanies this Annual 
Report. To be valid, a Form of Proxy must be delivered to the Company’s Registrars, Equiniti at Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, 
West Sussex BN99 6GT, so as to be received by no later than 11am on 2 February 2015. Alternatively, shareholders may appoint a proxy 
online by following the instructions in note 4 below. Shareholders who hold their shares in uncertificated form may also use ‘the CREST 
voting service’ to appoint a proxy electronically as explained in notes 5 to 7 below. The return of a completed Form of Proxy, electronic 
proxy appointment instruction or any CREST Proxy Instruction will not prevent a shareholder attending the AGM and voting in person if 
he/she wishes to do so.
4.  Shareholders who prefer to register the appointment of their proxy electronically via the internet can do so through Equiniti’s website at 
www.sharevote.co.uk. Full details of the procedure are given on the website. The Voting ID, Task ID and Shareholder Reference Number 
printed on the Form of Proxy will be required in order to use this electronic proxy appointment system. Alternatively, members who have 
already registered with Equiniti’s online portfolio service, Shareview, can appoint their proxy electronically by logging onto their portfolio 
at www.shareview.co.uk and clicking on the ‘Vote Online’ link. The on-screen instructions give details of how to complete the proxy 
appointment process. A proxy appointment made electronically will not be valid if sent to any address other than those provided or if 
received after 11am on 2 February 2015. 
5.  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using 
the procedures described in the CREST Manual available via www.euroclear.com/crest. CREST personal members or other CREST 
sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
6.  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST 
Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications, and must contain 
the information required for such instruction, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the 
appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be 
transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent Equiniti (ID RA19) by 11am on 2 February 2015. For this purpose, the time of 
receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which 
the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of 
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
7.  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited

member is a CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the 
CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting system 
providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and 
timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.

(a ‘Nominated Person’) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, have a right 
to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the AGM. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment 
right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as 
to the exercise of voting rights.
  The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in note 1 above does not apply to Nominated 
Persons. Such rights can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.

Resolutions 12 and 13 – Appointment of auditor/auditor’s remuneration
At each meeting at which the Annual Report is laid, the Company is required to appoint an auditor to serve until the next such meeting. KPMG LLP 
have indicated their willingness to continue as the Company’s auditor. It is, therefore, proposed that KPMG LLP be re-appointed auditor of the 
Company to hold office from the conclusion of this meeting until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which accounts are laid before 
the Company. Resolution 13 is an Ordinary Resolution giving the Directors discretion to determine KPMG’s remuneration.
Resolution 14 – Authority to allot shares
The authority of shareholders is required to enable Directors to allot shares. Accordingly, in line with the Company’s usual procedure, which 
is also standard practice amongst other public companies, this Ordinary Resolution seeks authority for the Directors to issue shares until the 
conclusion of next year’s AGM of the Company or 31 March 2016, if sooner.
In accordance with guidance issued by the Investment Management Association, the proposed authority will allow the Directors to allot 
Ordinary Shares up to an amount of less than one third of the existing share capital as at 5 December 2014, plus, in the case of a rights 
issue only, a further amount up to an additional one third of the Company’s existing issued share capital.
The Directors have no current intention of exercising this authority. The Company held no treasury shares as at 5 December 2014.
Resolutions 15 to 17 – Renewal of employee share schemes
Three of the Company’s existing share schemes will soon expire following the ten year anniversary of their approval by shareholders. It is 
proposed that these schemes be renewed and that replacement schemes be approved by shareholders. Executive Directors will participate 
only in the Victrex plc 2015 UK Sharesave Plan and not in either the Victrex plc 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or the Victrex plc 2015 
Executive Share Option Plan. The main terms of each scheme are summarised in the Appendix to the Notice.
Resolution 18 – Permission to allot a limited number of shares other than to existing shareholders
When shares are issued for cash, they normally have to be offered first to existing shareholders in proportion to their current shareholding. 
Otherwise than in connection with a rights issue, open offer or other pre-emptive offer, this special resolution will enable the Directors 
to allot shares for cash up to a nominal amount of £42,598, representing approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital as at 
5 December 2014, other than to existing shareholders in order to take advantage of opportunities as and when they arise. The Directors 
have no current intention of exercising this authority and confirm their intention that not more than 7.5% of the issued ordinary share 
capital will be allotted on a non pre-emptive basis in any rolling three year period.
The authority will lapse at the earlier of the next AGM of the Company or 31 March 2016, if sooner.
Resolution 19 – Authority to purchase own shares
In certain circumstances, it might be advantageous to the Company to purchase its own shares. Resolution 20 specifies the maximum 
number of shares which may be acquired (less than 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 5 December 2014) and 
the maximum and minimum prices at which shares may be bought. 
The Directors intend to use the authority only if, in the light of market conditions prevailing at the time, they believe that the effect of such 
purchase would result in an increase in earnings per share and would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders generally. 
Other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the overall position of the Company will be taken into account in reaching such 
a decision. Any shares purchased in this way will either be cancelled and the number of shares in issue will be reduced accordingly, or be held 
as treasury shares. Shares held as treasury shares can in the future be cancelled, resold or used to provide shares for employee share schemes.
As at 5 December 2014, options over a total of 1,206,233 Ordinary Shares were outstanding and not exercised. That number of Ordinary 
Shares represents 1.42% of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital at 5 December 2014. It would represent 1.57% of the issued 
Ordinary Share capital if the authority to buy the Company’s own shares had been used in full that date. The authority will lapse at the 
earlier of the next AGM of the Company or 31 March 2016, if sooner.
Resolution 20 – Authority to hold general meetings (other than annual AGMs) on 14 clear days’ notice
This special resolution renews an authority given at last year’s AGM and is required as a result of section 307A of the 2006 Act. 
The Company is currently able to call general meetings (other than an AGM) on not less than 14 clear days’ notice and would like to 
maintain this ability. In order to do so, the Company’s shareholders must approve the calling of such meetings on not less than 14 clear 
days’ notice. Resolution 20 seeks such approval. If given, the approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM, when it is intended 
that a similar resolution will be proposed. The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings, but only 
where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole.
Recommendation
The Directors consider that all the proposed resolutions set out in the Notice of AGM are in the best interests of the Company and of its 
shareholders as a whole and they unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of them. www.victrexplc.com

Appendix
Summaries of the Victrex plc 2015 Executive Share Option Plan, the Victrex plc 2015 UK Sharesave Plan and the Victrex plc 2015 Employee 
Stock Purchase Plan Summaries of the principal terms of the Victrex plc 2015 Executive Share Option Plan (the “Option Plan”), the Victrex 
plc 2015 UK Sharesave Plan (the “Sharesave Plan” and, together with the Option Plan, the “UK Plans”) and the Victrex plc 2015 Employee 
Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP” and together with the UK Plans, the “Plans”), are set out below. Certain provisions which apply to both 
the UK Plans and all the Plans are summarised at the end of the specific summaries below. 
The Option Plan
1. Eligibility
Any employee (including an executive director) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in the Option Plan 
at the discretion of the Board. 
2. Form of awards
Awards under the Option Plan will be granted in the form of options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company (“Shares”) with an exercise 
price per Share equal to the market value of a Share shortly before the option is granted. The Option Plan includes an appendix under which it 
is proposed that options which satisfy the requirements of Schedule 4 to the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (“Qualifying Options”) 
can be granted. Qualifying Options offer beneficial tax treatment to the participant and the member (“Group Member”) of the Company’s 
group (“Group”) employing the participant. 
3. Performance conditions
Unless the Board determines otherwise, options will be subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition which will determine the 
proportion (if any) of the option which will vest following the end of a performance period. Unless the Board determines otherwise, the 
performance period will be at least three years long. The Board may amend a performance condition if an event has occurred which causes 
the Board reasonably to consider that the performance condition would not, without the amendment, achieve its original purpose and the 
amended performance condition would not be materially less difficult to satisfy then the unamended performance condition but for the 
event in question. 
4. Individual limits
Options will not be granted to a participant under the Option Plan over shares with a market value (as determined by the Board) in excess 
of 100% of his salary in respect of any financial year of the Company. In addition, employees may not be granted Qualifying Options 
in excess of the limit set by HMRC from time to time (currently £30,000).
5. Grant of options
Options may only be granted within the six week period following approval of the Option Plan by shareholders, the announcement of the 
Company’s results for any period, or, in relation to any person, the day on which that person first joins the Group or on any day on which 
the Board determines that exceptional circumstances exist. However, if the Company is restricted from granting options during any such 
period, options may be granted in the period of six weeks following the relevant restriction being lifted. 
6. Reduction for malus 
The Board may, in its absolute discretion, determine at any time prior to the delivery of Shares or cash under an option (other than 
a Qualifying Option) to: 
(a) reduce the number of Shares or cash to which an option relates;
(b) cancel an option; or
(c) impose further conditions on an option,
in the following circumstances or in circumstances which the Board considers to be similar in their nature or effect. These circumstances are:
(a) a material failure of risk management by a Group Member or a relevant business unit;
(b) serious reputational damage to a Group Member or a relevant business unit; 
(c) a material misstatement of a Group Member’s audited financial results;
(d)  an error in assessing a performance condition applicable to an option or the information or assumptions on which the option was 
granted or vests; or
(e) the individual’s misconduct.
In the circumstances referred to in (c), (d) or (e) above (or circumstances the Board considers to be similar in their nature or effect) the Board 
may also prior to the later of (i) the second anniversary of the vesting of an option and (ii) the publication of the Company’s second set of 
annual results following that vesting require the participant to make a cash repayment in respect of some or all of the shares or cash he 
received or return some or all of the shares under the option (which is not a Qualifying Option).
These provisions will, however, not apply following a change of control of the Company (which is not an internal reorganisation). www.victrexplc.com
94 / Victrex plc / Annual Report 2014
Appendix continued
The option plan continued
7. Vesting and exercise
Options that are subject to a performance condition will normally vest following the end of the relevant performance period 
(or if later on the third anniversary of the grant date) and then only to the extent that any performance condition has been 
satisfied. Where options are granted without a performance condition, they will usually vest on the third anniversary of the grant 
date (or on such other date as the Board determines). Options will then normally be exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the 
grant date (or such earlier date as the Board may determine prior to grant).
At any time before or after the point at which an option (other than a Qualifying Option) has been exercised, the Board may decide:
(a)  to transfer a number of Shares to the participant which are equal in value to the difference between the aggregate value 
of the Shares over which the option is exercised and the aggregate exercise price of the option that would have been payable 
for those Shares; or
(b)  to pay a participant a cash amount which is equal in value to the difference between the aggregate value of the Shares over 
which the option is exercised and the aggregate exercise price that would have been payable for those Shares. 
8. Cessation of employment
If a participant dies, any unvested option he holds will vest as soon as reasonably practicable after the participant’s death to the 
extent that the Board determines, taking into account the extent to which any performance condition has been satisfied and, 
unless the Board determines otherwise, the period of time that has elapsed from the date the option was granted to the date of 
death. Options (to the extent vested) will normally be exercisable for 12 months from the date of death. 
If a participant ceases to be an officer or employee of a Group Member by reason of ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, 
retirement or the sale of the entity that employs him out of the Group or for any other reason at the Board’s discretion (except 
where a participant is summarily dismissed), any unvested options he holds will vest as soon as reasonably practicable following 
the date on which the participant ceases to hold office or employment with the Group. 
The Board will decide the extent to which an unvested option vests in these circumstances, taking into account the extent to which 
any performance condition is satisfied and, unless the Board determines otherwise, the period of time that has elapsed from the 
date the option was granted to the date on which the participant ceases to be an officer or employee of a Group Member. 
Options (to the extent vested) will normally be exercisable for six months from the date of cessation (or such longer period as the 
Board may determine).
If a participant ceases to be an officer or employee with the Group in any other circumstances, any option he holds will lapse on 
the date on which he ceases to be an officer or employee of a Group Member. 
9. Corporate events
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the Board will determine the extent to which options will vest taking into 
account the extent to which any performance condition has been satisfied, and, unless the Board determines otherwise, the period 
of time which has elapsed from the date the option was granted to the relevant event. Options (to the extent vested) are then 
normally exercisable for a period of up to six months following vesting. Alternatively, the Board may permit or, in the case of 
an internal reorganisation or (except in the case of Qualifying Options) where the Board considers it appropriate, require options 
to be exchanged for equivalent options which relate to shares in another company. 
If other corporate events occur such as a winding-up of the Company, or a demerger, delisting or other event which, in the opinion 
of the Board may affect the current or future value of Shares, the Board may determine that options will vest taking into account 
the satisfaction of any relevant performance condition and, unless the Board determines otherwise, the period of time that has 
elapsed from the date on which the option has granted to the date of the relevant event. The Board will determine in these 
circumstances the length of time during which options can then be exercised.
The Sharesave Plan
1. General
The Sharesave Plan will give participating employees the opportunity to save up to £500 per month (or such other amount 
permitted under the relevant legislation from time to time) in accordance with a HMRC-approved savings contract for three or 
five years (a “Sharesave Contract”). The proceeds of the Sharesave Contract can be used to exercise an option to acquire Shares 
at an exercise price per Share which may not be less than 80% (or such other percentage as may be permitted by the relevant 
legislation) of the market value of a Share on the invitation date or such other date specified by the Board falling between the 
invitation date and the grant date of the option. 
The Sharesave Plan is proposed to satisfy the requirements of Schedule 3 to the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 
such that options granted under it will offer beneficial tax treatment to the participant and the Group Member employing 
the participant.
2. Eligibility
All UK tax-resident employees (including a full-time executive Director) of the Company, or any of its subsidiaries which participates 
in the Sharesave Plan, who have been in employment for a minimum period determined by the Board (not exceeding five years), 
and any other employees nominated by the Board may apply for an option on any occasion on which invitations are issued. 
3. Exercise of options
Ordinarily, an option may be exercised within six months of maturity of the Sharesave Contract. Options may only be exercised 
using the proceeds of the Sharesave Contract. www.victrexplc.com
Annual Report 2014 / Victrex plc / 95 
Shareholder information
The Sharesave Plan continued
4. Cessation of employment
Options may be exercised (for a period of six months following the individual’s cessation of employment) if a participant leaves employment 
by reason of injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or the sale of the entity that employs him out of the Group or, provided the option 
has been held for at least three years, any other reason apart from summary dismissal. 
If an individual dies, his option may be exercised for a period of 12 months from the maturity date of the Sharesave Contract if he dies 
within six months after the maturity date or 12 months from his death, if he dies before the maturity date.
If a participant ceases employment with the Group or an associated company of a Group Member in any other circumstances, any option 
he holds will lapse on the date on which the participant ceases employment. 
In all cases, options may only be exercised using monies saved under the Sharesave Contract at the date of exercise.
5. Corporate events
Options may be exercised early in the event of a change of control or voluntary winding-up of the Company to the extent they 
are exercisable using monies saved under the Sharesave Contract at the date of exercise. Alternatively, options may be exchanged 
(with the agreement of the acquiring company and the participant) for equivalent options in the new holding company. 
THE ESPP
The ESPP is an all-employee stock purchase plan designed to qualify under section 423 of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
(as amended) (the “Code”) giving employees based in the US and the Group Member that employs them tax and social security 
benefits on any gains made under the ESPP. 
1. Eligibility
Any employee of any subsidiary of the Company nominated by the Board who works more than 20 hours a week at least 5 months a year 
and who has been employed for not less than 90 days is eligible to participate in the ESPP.
2. Offering periods 
Under the ESPP participants make contributions to a savings account over a period not exceeding 27 months (normally a year, unless the 
Board determines otherwise). The total contributions a participant can make under the ESPP are limited to $875 per month or such other 
amount as the Board may determine. In any event, no rights to acquire Shares may be granted to an individual in a given calendar year over 
Shares worth in excess of $25,000 (at the time of grant). An individual’s participation will also be restricted if it would mean he would hold 
or be entitled to acquire 5% of the capital of the Company or any subsidiary. The maximum number of Shares that an individual may acquire 
in respect of each offering period is 5,000. An employee may decide to withdraw from participating in the ESPP during an offering period.
3. Plan limit
The maximum number of Shares which may be used in connection with the ESPP will be 1,000,000.
4. Acquisition price
The exact number of Shares to be acquired can be determined either at the start of the offering period based on the projected savings 
proceeds or at the end of the specified offering period based on the total contributions that an employee has made over that period. 
In either case, at the end of the offering period, Shares can be purchased using the savings that had been made. 
The price payable for each Share will be determined by the Board, provided that it is not less than the lower of 85% of the fair market value 
of a Share at the start and end of the relevant offering period. 
5. Acquisition of shares 
Provided that the individual is still an employee of the Group who satisfies the eligibility conditions referred to above at the end of the relevant 
offering period, he can generally acquire Shares at that time. If an individual ceases to be an eligible employee at least 30 days before the 
proposed purchase date, he will be automatically withdrawn from the ESPP and his savings contributions will be returned to him. If cessation 
of employment occurs within 30 days of the proposed purchase date, the individual’s contributions will be used to acquire Shares in the 
normal way.
An early acquisition of Shares is permitted in the event of a corporate transaction (within the meaning of the Code) affecting the Company, 
if the acquiring company does not exchange the existing rights to acquire Shares for equivalent new rights in the new holding company. 
Unless the Board determines otherwise, in the event the Company is wound up, any offering period then running would end and Shares 
may be purchased at that time. 
6. Adjustment of awards
If the Company pays a dividend or other distribution or if there is a merger, variation in the Company’s share capital or other transaction 
involving any securities in the Company or any other change in the Company’s structure then the Board may make such adjustment as it 
considers appropriate to the number or class of Shares that may be acquired, the acquisition price, and the maximum number of Shares 
that may be acquired in connection with the ESPP. www.victrexplc.com

Provisions which are common to the UK Plans
1.  Overall limits
The UK Plans are subject to the following overall limit. In any 10 year period, the number of Shares which may be issued under the relevant 
plan and under any other employee share plan adopted by the Company may not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company from time to time.
The Option Plan is subject to the additional following limit. In any 10 year period, the number of Shares which may be issued under the 
relevant plan and under any other discretionary share plan adopted by the Company (including the ESPP) may not exceed 5% of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time. 
Treasury Shares will be treated as newly issued for the purpose of these limits until such time as guidelines published by institutional investor 
representative bodies determine otherwise.
2.  Termination 
The UK Plans will usually terminate on the tenth anniversary of their approval by shareholders but the existing rights of participants will not 
be affected by any such termination. 
3. Adjustments
In the event of a variation of the Company’s share capital and (in the case of options granted under the Option Plan which are not 
Qualifying Options) a demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event, which may, in the Board’s opinion, affect the current or future 
value of Shares, the number of Shares subject to an option and/or any performance condition attached to options granted under the 
Option Plan and/or the exercise price applying to an option may be adjusted, provided that any adjustment to a Qualifying Option or 
an option under the Sharesave Plan may only be made in accordance with the requirements of the applicable tax legislation. 
Provisions which are common to the plans 
1. Terms of awards and options
Awards and options may be granted over newly issued Shares, treasury Shares or Shares purchased in the market. Awards and options are 
not transferable (other than on death). No payment will be required for the grant of an award or option. Awards and options will not form 
part of pensionable earnings. 
2. Operation
The operation of the Plans will be supervised by the Board or a duly authorised committee appointed by the Board.
3. Amendment 
The Board may amend the Plans at any time, provided that prior approval of the Company’s shareholders will be required for amendments 
to the advantage of eligible employees or participants relating to eligibility, limits, the basis for determining a participant’s entitlement to, 
and the terms of, the Shares or cash comprised in an option or award and the impact of any variation of capital. 
However, any minor amendment to benefit the administration of the Plans, to take account of legislative changes, or to obtain or maintain 
favourable tax treatment, exchange control or regulatory treatment may be made by the Board without shareholder approval.
4. Rights attaching to shares
Options will not confer any shareholder rights until the options have been exercised and the participants have received their Shares. Any 
Shares allotted when an option is exercised under the Plans will rank equally with Shares then in issue (except for rights arising by reference 
to a record date prior to their allotment). www.victrexplc.com

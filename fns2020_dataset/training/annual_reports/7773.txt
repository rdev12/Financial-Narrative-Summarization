For the year ended 31 October 2008 2 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
For the year ended 31 October 2008
I am pleased to report that we have made 
decisive progress in our aim to become a 
leading supplier of high-quality software 
and services to the public sector. Full-year 
revenues increased 65% to £34.0m, with 
profitability increasing even more strongly, 
up 267% to £6.6m.
 
Our increase in profitability resulted 
from good like-for-like organic growth 
in our main software business and from 
cost savings achieved by integrating the 
software activities of IDOX, CAPS Solutions 
and Plantech into a single unit. We expect 
this integration to deliver additional 
operational benefits and savings in the 
new financial year. 
Cash flow was strong, particularly in the 
first half of the year when we collected 
annual maintenance revenues, and we 
ended the year with net cash of £1.0m 
after acquisition costs and our first 
payments of corporation tax. We are 
proposing to increase our dividend to 
0.115p pence per share (2007: 0.1p). 
Despite the current economic conditions, 
demand in our core local government 
market remains robust. With more than 
330 local authorities using IDOX software, 
we are the leader in the supply of land and 
property solutions and a growing provider 
of software to revenues and benefits 
departments. 
Building on this market-leading position 
in land and property services, we have 
a growing capability to cross sell and to 
provide web-based public access services 
or portals across the entire range of local 
authority activities and potentially into the 
wider public sector as well. This is also true 
of our proprietary document management 
software.
Although our smallest business, consulting 
and content-based solutions, experienced 
a softening in revenues in the second 
half of the year, our recruitment business 
sustained the improvement seen in the 
first half of the year. 
We completed our management team by 
welcoming William Edmondson as our 
new Chief Financial Officer at the end 
of September 2008. Will was previously 
Finance Director for the Europe, Middle-
East, India & Africa Region of Autodesk 
Inc. (NASDAQ: ADSK), which experienced 
rapid growth in revenues during his tenure 
to $1bn and where he controlled a budget 
of $250m, in addition to integrating a 
number of acquisitions.
Having successfully integrated Plantech, 
which was acquired in February 2008, we

continue to look for suitable opportunities 
to acquire complementary businesses that 
will enable us to gain market share in the 
public sector, improve cross-selling and cut 
costs where necessary. 
IDOX ended its 2008 financial year as a 
larger and demonstrably more successful 
company and I would like to thank all of 
those who have worked so hard to make it 
possible.  
We have begun the new financial year 
well, with sales visibility ahead of 2008, 
a leading position in our core market, 
an excellent suite of products, strong 
recurring revenues and a healthy balance 
sheet. This is a good starting position from 
which to face a very challenging year for 
the UK economy.

strengthening of management and 
continuing improvements in processes and 
quality. The impact has been that major 
projects have been delivered on time but 
to an even higher quality.  
Our Glasgow office delivered the first part 
of a new planning and appeals portal for 
the Scottish Executive. This was IDOX’s 
largest contract to date, worth £2.3m over 
three years.
In addition, IDOX gained notable contract 
wins at authorities including Eastleigh, 
Sheffield, South Gloucester, Shropshire, 
West Lindsey and Westminster, with 
further development work completed 
for the Northern Ireland Planning 
Department. 
Our software development team has made 
considerable progress in improving quality 
control and resource planning, successfully 
delivering on schedule significant 
upgrades to all our product lines. Other 
achievements include the completion of 
a two year development of a new public 
access system, and a significant upgrade 
to our revenues & benefits document 
management and workflow solution that 
The market for software and services for 
local government has remained robust 
against a backdrop of difficult conditions 
in the wider economy. Driven by the need 
to improve services and become more 
accessible to their communities, local 
authorities are continuing to invest in 
software and services that deliver tangible 
benefits and a rapid return on investment. 
However, the consolidation of suppliers 
and IT platforms has changed the local 
government market significantly over 
the past year, reducing both choice and 
competition and leaving IDOX as the only 
quoted company in the sector.
With the addition of Plantech we now 
supply more than 71% of the UK’s local 
authorities with leading products that are 
fully integrated from public-access web 
pages through to back-end databases 
and case-management systems. From 
our leading position in segments such as 
land & property and revenues & benefits, 
we will build the IDOX business through 
product innovation, higher levels of cross 
selling and strategic acquisitions.
S o f t w a r e	b u s i n e s s
On a like-for-like basis revenues grew 9% 
year on year with a higher percentage 
of revenues coming from product 
and services and less from low margin 
contracted out backscanning or hardware 
purchases.
The Software business has undergone 
significant change in the past year, 
with the integration of Plantech, a

our own in-house technology, the 
Enterprise Management tool, to deliver 
improvements to the delivery process. 
After the roll out of this in the final 
quarter of the 2008 financial year, it is now 
being linked to a market leading software-
as-a-service CRM system to deliver 
end-to-end paperless processing.
S o l u t i o n s	b u s i n e s s
Demand for the Solutions business, which 
accounts for just 8% of Group revenues, 
has suffered from the economic downturn 
with key private-sector projects being 
delayed or postponed indefinitely. Because 
our consultancy business is involved in the 
early-stage design and architecture phases 
of major IT projects, it is therefore among 
the first to be affected.  In the public 
sector a number of managed content-rich 
web sites have been withdrawn due to 
changes in government policy. Overall 
revenues declined year on year by 22%.
However, we continue to see a steady 
flow of opportunities for consultancy, 
recruitment and training particularly from 
non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) 
and are addressing this by focusing on 
services connected with efficient and 
integrates with market-leading back-office 
systems from other vendors. The Group’s 
product portfolio has been further 
enhanced with the launch of Plantech’s 
Enterprise Management tool, which is 
being made available to our wider Uniform 
customer base.
We have merged the operations and 
customer support areas of the three 
software businesses and strengthened 
the business with management from 
across the Group. We have introduced

The Recruitment business, which 
accounts for 12% of Group revenues, 
increased turnover by 7% year on year 
through a growth in contract and interim 
staff services to the banking, legal 
and government sectors. Permanent 
placements have also held up despite 
the economic outlook. The recruitment 
market in the specialist area of knowledge 
and information management remains 
stable with continued demand for interim

Through a strategy of acquisition and 
reorganisation, IDOX has transformed 
itself into a leading force in local 
government software, with a reputation 
for delivering innovative products 
and services backed by high-quality 
implementation and support. At the 
same time, this transformation has 
delivered substantial cost savings and 
strong growth in revenues, profitability 
and cash generation, all underpinned 
by a high level of recurring licence and 
maintenance revenues. Though vigilant to 
the challenges ahead, we are cautious but 
confident about our future.

to be vigilant on our cost base going 
into 2009 and expect to incur a small 
restructuring charge in 2009 as we finalise 
the integration of our acquisitions.
Normalised pre-tax profits, excluding 
amortisation and share options costs and 
including capitalised R&D expenditure, 
increased almost threefold to £7.4m 
(2007: £2.5m). Pre-tax profits on an IFRS 
basis, which the Group has adopted in the 
current financial year, more than tripled 
to £6.6m (2007 (restated for IFRS): £1.8m). 
Further explanation on the impact of 
transition to IFRS was provided in our 2008 
interim report.
Segmental profit for the software division 
increased nearly fourfold to £7.5m (2007: 
£2.1m). The Solutions business fell into 
a small loss of £0.2m as a result of the 
downturn in consulting services during 
the year (2007: breakeven). As a result, 
decisive action has already been taken 
to return the division to profitability 
by reducing its cost base and driving 
operational efficiencies. The recruitment 
Revenues increased by 65% to £34.0m 
(2007: £20.7m) following robust organic 
growth, the maiden contribution of 
Plantech, acquired in February 2008, major 
contract wins across the business and the 
full-year impact of revenues from the 
Uniform product range.
  
The Software business doubled its revenue 
in the year and now accounts for 80% of 
Group revenues, or £27.1m (2007: 64%, 
£13.2m), while the Solutions business 
contributed £2.6m or 8% of Group 
revenues (2007: 16%, £3.3m). Revenues 
in the Recruitment business increased by 
7% to £4.4m, representing 13% of Group 
revenues (2007: 20%, £4.1m). 
Recurring revenues are a salient feature of 
our business, deriving from maintenance 
and subscription services linked to annual 
increases with inflation. Some 46% of our 
core Software revenues are recurring.
Gross margins have improved significantly 
as a result of the increasing proportion of 
software sales making up Group revenues. 
In 2008 the Group achieved a gross margin 
of 79% (2007: 74%).
Although operating costs increased as 
a consequence of the two acquisitions, 
the integration and cost-saving 
programmes undertaken resulted in a 
substantial improvement in EBITDA which 
increased threefold to £8.6m (including 
capitalisation of certain R&D costs as 
required by IFRS and excluding share 
option costs). The EBITDA margin was 
25% against 14% in 2007. We continue

The Group recognises and accepts its responsibilities for health, safety and the environment 
(H,S&E) and has a dedicated team which provides advice and support in this area.  The team 
members regularly attend external H,S&E courses and internal reviews are performed on a 
regular basis to ensure compliance with best practice and all relevant legislation.
E m p l o y e e	c o n s u l t a t i o n
The policy of informing and consulting with employees is maintained by means of 
regular team briefs and meetings.  Employees are encouraged to present their views and 
suggestions in respect of the Group’s performance.  In addition, the Group has an intranet 
which facilitates faster and more effective communication.
A Share Investment Plan is in place to allow employees a tax efficient way of investing in 
the Company. The Company purchases matching shares which become the property of the 
employee after a three year vesting period.

The Group uses various financial instruments which include cash, equity investments, 
bank loans and items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from 
its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the 
Group’s operations.  1 3 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
For the year ended 31 October 2008
D i r e c t o r s’	R e p o r t	c o n t ’ d
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and 
credit risk. The directors review these risks on an ongoing basis. This policy has remained 
unchanged from previous years.
C r e d i t	r i s k
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade debtors. The credit risk associated 
with cash is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international 
credit-rating agencies. The principal credit risk arises therefore from its trade debtors. 
In order to manage credit risk, the management review the debt ageing on an ongoing 
basis, together with the collection history and third party credit references where 
appropriate. 
l i q u i d i t y	r i s k
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet 
foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
I n t e r e s t	r a t e	r i s k
Any funds over and above the current working capital requirements of the Group are 
invested in high interest deposit accounts. The Group’s bank borrowings are split between 
those bearing interest at rates linked to the LIBOR, and those whose rate has effectively 
been fixed by the use of an interest rate swap arrangement.
P r i n c i p a l	r i s k s	a n d	u n c e r t a i n t i e s
The principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Group include the following:
• 	 P o l i t i c a l 	 – 	 t h e 	 G r o u p 	 ha s 	 a 	 l a r g e 	 c u s t o m e r 	 b a s e 	 i n 	 l o c a l 	 g o v e r n m e n t . 	 A 	 c ha n g e 	 i n 	 s p e n d i n g	
priorities by the current or a future Government could materially impact the Group.

affected by a slowdown in the economic environment.  However, some recruitment  
revenue streams may also benefit by such a slowdown. The software area of the business  
could be adversely affected if the government reduces the grants to local authorities  
in an economic downturn. However, all indications are that the government will 
maintain and may increase the grants during such a period. The Group has increased  
diversification through acquisitions to mitigate against economic risks.

The Remuneration Committee operates within defined terms of reference. The 
Remuneration Committee comprises the Chairman and two Non-Executive Directors. It is 
chaired by Christopher Wright.
R e m u n e r a t i o n	p o l i c y
The policy of the Group is to set levels of remuneration to attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors and key staff.  The packages are designed to be competitive in value 
to those offered to the Directors of similar sized public companies in related sectors. It is 
the Board’s policy also to align the interests of managers with those of our shareholders in 
the grant of option and other equity rewards which underlying securities grantees are very 
much encouraged to retain over the longer term.
The components of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages are currently a basic 
salary, bonus, money purchase pension contributions and benefits in kind.  The benefits 
include car allowance, private medical cover, life cover and critical illness cover.  The bonus 
elements are dependent on the Executive Directors achieving performance criteria set out 
by the Remuneration Committee.  The criteria include targets for turnover and profits as 
well as for cash balances.  In addition, the Group has introduced new share option schemes 
for the Executive Directors.

The Group is committed to applying the 
highest principles of corporate governance 
commensurate with its size. The Group has 
adopted the Quoted Company Alliance 
(QCA) Corporate Governance Guidelines 
for AIM Companies as published in July 
2005. The Group complies with the QCA 
Corporate Governance Guidelines except 
whereby:
 
•	 t h e	B o a r d	d o e s	n o t	c u r r e n t l y	u n d e r t a k e

number of Board meetings and of the 
Committees and individual Directors’    
attendance at them.
Internal controls
The Board takes responsibility for 
establishing and maintaining reliable 
systems of control in all areas of operation. 
These systems of control, especially 
of financial control, can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The key matters relating to the system of 
internal control are set out below:
•	 I D O X	p l c	h a s	e s t a b li s h e d	a n	o p e ra t i o n a l	 	 	 	 	 	
management structure with clearly    
defined responsibilities and regular   
performance reviews
•	 t h e	G r o u p	o p e ra t e s	a	c o m p r e h e n s i v e	
system for reporting financial and 
non-financial information to the Board 
including preparation and review of   
strategy plans and the preparation and 
review of annual budgets
•	 fi n a n c i a l	r e s u l t s	a r e	m o n i t o r e d	
against  budgets, forecasts and other 
performance indicators with action 
dictated accordingly at each meeting
•	 a	s t r u c t u r e d	a p p r o v a l	p r o c e s s	b a s e d	o n	
assessment of risk and value delivered
•	 s u f fi c i e n t	r e s o u r c e	i s	f o c u s e d	t o	
maintain and develop internal control 
procedures and information systems, 
especially in financial management.
The Board considers that there have been 
no substantial weaknesses in internal 
financial controls that have resulted in 
any material losses, contingencies or 
uncertainties which need to be disclosed in 
the accounts.
The Board has considered the need for 
an internal audit function and concluded 
that there is no current need for such a 
function within the Group. In the absence 
of a dedicated function, one member of 
staff has undergone internal audit training 
and ad hoc internal audit projects have 
been carried out cross-departmentally 
during the year. Furthermore in 
compliance with the Group’s quality 
standards, additional internal reviews are 
carried out. 
Following publication of Internal Control: 
Guidance for Directors on the Combined 
Code (the “Turnbull Guidance”), the Board 
confirms that there is an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Group, 
and that this process has been in place 
for the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts. This process is regularly 
reviewed by the Board and is consistent 
with the Turnbull Guidance. 
S t a t e m e n t	o f	d i r e c t o r s ’	r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s
Company law in the United Kingdom 
requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year which 
give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and the Group 
and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period.  In preparing those financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 s e l e c t	s u i t a b l e	a c c o u n t i n g	p o li c i e s	a n d	
then apply them consistently
•	 m a k e	j u d g e m e n t s	a n d	e s t i m a t e s	t h a t	
are reasonable and prudent
•	 s t a t e	w h e t h e r	a p p li c a b l e	U K	a c c o u n t i n g	
standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements
•	 prepare the financial statements      
     on the going concern basis unless it is 
     inappropriate to presume that the   
     Group will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for 
keeping proper accounting records, for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for ensuring 
that the Directors’ Report and other 
information included in the Annual Report 
is prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom company law. They are also 
responsible for ensuring that the Annual 
Report includes information required by 
the AIM Market Rules. 
The maintenance and integrity of the 
Group’s web site is the responsibility of 
the Directors; the work carried out by the 
auditors does not involve consideration 
of these matters and, accordingly, the 
auditors accept no responsibility for any 
changes that may have occurred to the 
information contained in the accounts 
since they were initially presented on the 
web site. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and the 
dissemination of the accounts and other 
information included in annual reports 
may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.  18 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008

required. The Board monitors exposure to 
key business risks and reviews the strategic 
direction of the Group, the annual budgets 
as well as their progress against those budgets.
The Board members and their roles are

IDOX plc is committed to open 
communication with all its shareholders. 
The Directors hold regular meetings 
with institutional shareholders to discuss 
and review the Group’s activities and 
objectives. Communication with private 
shareholders is principally through 
the Annual General Meeting, where 
participation is encouraged and where 
the Board is available to answer questions. 
IDOX plc maintains up-to-date information 
on the Investor Relations section of its 
website  www.IDOXplc.com.
Every shareholder is sent a full annual 
report each year end and at the half year 
end they are sent an interim report. Care 
is taken to ensure that any price sensitive 
information is released to all shareholders, 
institutional and private, at the same time 
in accordance with London Stock Exchange 
requirements. 
IDOX plc strives to give a full, timely and 
realistic assessment of its business in a 
balanced way, in all price-sensitive reports 
and presentations.

This report is made solely to the company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the company and the company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

The directors’ responsibilities for preparing 
the Annual Report and the group financial 
statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the group 
financial statements in accordance with 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to 
whether the group financial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether 
the group financial statements have 
been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the 
information given in the Directors’ Report 
is consistent with the financial statements.  
The information given in the Directors’ 
Report includes that specific information 
presented in the Chairman’s Statement 
and Chief Executive’s Report that is cross 
referred from the Business Review section 
of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our 
opinion, we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require 
for our audit, or if information specified by 
law regarding directors’ remuneration and 
other transactions is not disclosed. 
We read other information contained 
in the Annual Report and consider 
whether it is consistent with the audited 
group financial statements. The other 
information comprises only Chairman’s 
Statement, Chief Executive’s Report, 
the Chief Financial Officer’s Report, the 
Directors’ Report, the Remuneration 
Report, the Corporate Governance 
Report, and the Report of the Audit 
Committee.  We consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of 
any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the group financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not 
extend to any other information.
B a s i s	o f	a u d i t	o p i n i o n
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes 
examination, on a test basis, of evidence 
relevant to the amounts and disclosures 
in the group financial statements. It also 
includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgments made by the 
directors in the preparation of the group 
financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the 
group’s circumstances, consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit 
so as to obtain all the information and 
explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the group financial 
statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. In forming 
our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation 
of information in the group financial 
statements.

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board, and adopted by the European Union (EU) and the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS.  The financial statements for the year ended 31 October 2007 were prepared under UK GAAP.  The current year 
financial statements therefore present restated comparative figures.  The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK 
GAAP to IFRS are given in note 28.  
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets 
and liabilities, being derivative financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss.
As set out on page 18 of the Corporate Governance Report, the accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.

The Group has elected to adopt IFRS 8 Operating Segments early.  This standard replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting and aligns segment 
reporting with the requirements of the US standard SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.  The 
new standard requires a ‘management approach’, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal 
reporting purposes.

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards 
have been published that are mandatory for forthcoming financial periods, but which the Group has not adopted early.  Those which are

The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations will have no marked impact on the financial statements 
when they come into effect, other than in relation to IAS1 Presentation of financial statements which will lead to presentation and disclosure 
amendments. 27 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.  The resulting accounting estimates and assumptions will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results.  The Group has evaluated the estimates and assumptions that have been made in relation to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in these financial statements.  The estimates and assumptions which have the most significant 
impact on the accounts which are recognised in the financial statements are as follows:
(i) CAPS
Certain fair value adjustments, accruals and provisions were originally made as part of the initial accounting for the CAPS acquisition. The 
Group has been successful in resolving these matters within original estimates.  As such resolution occurred outside the period in which IFRS 3 
would permit the initial accounting to be adjusted, £0.6m has been released through the income statement in the current year.
(ii) Intangible assets
The Group recognises intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the date of acquisition.  The determination 
of these fair values is based upon management’s judgement and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future incremental cash 
flows generated by the assets and selection of an appropriate cost of capital.  Furthermore, management must estimate the expected useful 
lives of intangible assets and charge amortisation on those assets accordingly.  In determining the useful economic life of the intangible 
software assets, management has given consideration to the length of time that its own software is typically used within its market.  In 
addition, management reviewed competitor products and the length of time they had also been in use.
Consideration was also given as to the likelihood that a new competitor could enter the market with a new product.  This was considered 
unlikely due to the up-front capital investment which would be required to develop a new product, the requirement for reference sites to 
demonstrate the product, and the long life cycles which products have in the market.
(iii) Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to test, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.  The recoverable amount is determined based 
upon value-in-use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate 
in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows.  Actual outcomes could vary.
Estimation uncertainty over future operating cash flows arises in particular in relation to the assessment of the recoverable amount of TFPL’s 
goodwill.  Value in use calculations assume the recoverable amount is £3.1m which is £0.6m higher than the carrying value of goodwill.  Were 
related operating cash flows that underlie the value in use calculations, to fall by more than £70,000, an impairment loss would arise. The 
assessed value in use of £3.1m is based upon a gross margin of 40%. A change in this margin of 2% or greater would lead to an impairment 
loss arising.
(iv) Revenue recognition
The group recognises revenue on certain contracts such as work in progress, prior to an invoice being raised, where work has been completed 
and there is a high degree of certainty of the contract being completed and the invoice raised and cash received.
B a s i s	o f	c o n s o l i d a t i o n
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 October each year.  Subsidiaries 
are those entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies.  Over all its subsidiaries, IDOX plc 
obtains and exercises control through 100% of the voting rights.
The Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations prior to 1 November 2006.  
Accordingly the classification of the combination (acquisition, reverse acquisition or merger) remains unchanged from that used under UK 
GAAP.   28 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008

For the year ended 31 October 2008
Assets and liabilities are recognised at the date of transition if they would be recognised under IFRS, and are measured using their UK GAAP 
carrying amount immediately post-acquisition as deemed cost under IFRS, unless IFRS requires fair value measurement. Deferred tax is 
adjusted for the impact of any consequential adjustments after taking advantage of the transitional provisions.
All inter-company transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
The presentational currency of the group is £GBP sterling.
R ev e n u e
Revenue represents the amounts receivable in respect of goods and services provided during the year, stated net of value added tax.  Where 
work has been done, but a billing milestone has not been reached, the income has been accrued and included in amounts recoverable within 
trade and other receivables. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the right to consideration. The Group derives its revenue streams from software solutions, 
information solutions and recruitment services.  
IDOX software products revenue is recognised in stages based on contract signing, delivery, configuration and client acceptance. For 
small value orders, the whole invoice amount is recognised at the billing point. For larger value orders, revenue is reviewed to see if the 
appropriate amount of work has been completed. For the largest orders, the amount is revenue recognised is dependent on the percentage 
of completion of the Group’s contractual obligations.   Maintenance revenue is spread over the period of the agreement, which is typically 
one year.  
Revenue derived from information solutions content is recognised over the life of the subscription, which is typically one year.  Revenue from 
projects is recognised over the life of the project in accordance with the stage of completion.  Revenue from managed services is recognised 
on a usage basis as the service is performed.
Recruitment revenue from permanent placements is recognised in the month when the placement starts.  Revenue from contract recruitment 
is recognised as the service is performed.
C o n t r a c t	r e v e n u e
The amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long term contract is recognised only when the outcome of the contract 
can be foreseen with reasonable certainty. Revenue for such contracts is stated at the cost appropriate to their stage of completion plus 
attributable profits, less amounts recognised in previous years. Provision is made for any losses as they are foreseen.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade and other receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess of payments on account.
S e g m e n t a l	r e p o r t i n g
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.  The 
chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the steering committee that makes strategic decisions.
For the purposes of segment reporting the Group does not have separate geographical reporting segments.
G o o d w ill
Goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the group’s share of the identifiable 
net assets acquired is capitalised and reviewed annually for impairment.  Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.  
Negative goodwill is recognised immediately after acquisition in the income statement.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to date of transition to IFRS remains in reserves. There is no re-instatement of goodwill that was 
amortised prior to transition to IFRS.  Goodwill previously written off to reserves is not written back to profit or loss on subsequent disposal. 29 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008

Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives, which are reviewed on an annual basis.  Amortisation commences when the asset is available for use.  The residual values of 
intangible assets are assumed to be zero.

Expenditure on research (or the research phase of an internal project) is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.  
Development costs incurred are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:

Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.  The cost of an internally generated intangible 
asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce, and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner 
intended by management.  Amortisation commences upon completion of the asset, and is shown within other operating charges.
Careful judgement by the directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for development costs have been met.  
This is necessary as the economic success of any product development is uncertain and may be subject to future technical problems at the 
time of recognition.  Judgements are based on the information available at each balance sheet date.  In addition, all internal activities 
related to the research and development of new software products are continuously monitored by the directors.

Customer relationships represent the purchase price of customer lists and contractual relationships purchased on the acquisition of CAPS

I m p a i r m e nt
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
(cash-generating units).  As a result, some assets are tested individually for impairment and some are tested at cash-generating unit level.  
Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the related business combination and 
represent the lowest level within the group at which management monitors the related cash flows.

those intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually.  All other individual assets or cash-generating 
units are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount.  The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs to sell, and value in use based on an 
internal discounted cash flow evaluation.  Impairment losses recognised for cash-generating units, to which goodwill has been allocated, 
are credited initially to the carrying amount of goodwill.  Any remaining impairment loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in the cash 
generating unit.  With the exception of goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously 
recognised may no longer exist.

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement using the following rates and bases so as to write off the cost or valuation of items of 
property, plant and equipment over their expected useful lives.  The rates generally applicable are:
Computer hardware          50% and 100% straight line
Fixtures, fittings and equipment      25% straight line
Library books and journals        33 1/3% straight line

All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 November 2006 are recognised in the 
financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values.  Where employees 
are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value 
of the instrument granted to the employee.  This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the income statement with a corresponding credit to the 
share option reserve.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available 
estimate of the number of share options expected to vest.  Estimates are revised subsequently if there is any indication that the number 
of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates.  Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current 
period.  No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital, and where 
appropriate share premium. 31 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008

t axation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.  Current tax is charged to the income statement except to where it 
relates to tax on items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is charged to equity.
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on taxable profit for the year.  
Deferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences.  Deferred tax is generally provided on the 
difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial 
recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or 
affects tax or accounting profit.  Deferred tax on temporary differences associated with shares in subsidiaries and joint ventures is not 
provided if reversal of these temporary differences can be controlled by the group and it is probable that reversal will not occur in the 
foreseeable future.  In addition, tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income credits to the group are assessed for 
recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, with no discounting.  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able to be offset against future taxable income.  Current and deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided they are enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense in the income statement, except where they relate 
to items that are charged or credited directly to equity in which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity.
Operating leases
All leases are operating in nature.  Amounts paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over 
the lease term.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group has become a party to the contractual

Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are initially stated at their fair value, as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.  All receivables are considered for impairment.  Provision against trade receivables is made when there is objective 
evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due to is in accordance with the original terms of those receivables.  The 
amount of the write-down is determined as the difference between the asset’s carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows.

Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct transaction costs.  Such instruments are

The Group’s activities expose the entity primarily to interest rate risk.  The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to manage these 
exposures.  The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  The use of financial derivatives is governed 
by the Group’s policies approved by the board of directors, which provide written principles in the use of financial derivatives.  Derivative 
financial instruments are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.  The Group does not apply hedge accounting.  33 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008

As at 31 October 2008 the Group is primarily organised into three main business segments, which are detailed below.
Financial information is reported to the Board on a business unit basis with revenue and operating profits split by business unit.  Each 
business unit is deemed a reportable segment as each offer different products and services.

customers. 
Segment revenue comprises sales to external customers and excludes gains arising on the disposal of assets and finance income. Segment 
profit reported to the board represents the profit earned by each segment before the allocation of tax, interest payments and share option 
charges.  
All assets and liabilities are allocated to reportable segments in line with the percentage of total revenue.  
The Group does not place reliance on any specific customer and has no individual customer that generates 10% or more of its total Group revenue.
The Group generates all its revenue from UK domiciled customers and hence further geographical disclosure is not required.

In 2008, one reportable segment included costs for amortisation under UK GAAP.  Other adjustments relate to interest and share option 
expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments.
Segments used by management for internal reporting in 2007 were done so under UK GAAP and excluded all IFRS adjustments.  The 
reconciling items relate to the annual impairment review of the goodwill rather than an amortisation charge and the recognition of a 
deferred tax liability on the intangible assets.

Included within current goodwill additions is a fair value adjustment of £374k which has increased the value of goodwill attributed to 
the acquisition of CAPS Solutions Limited in June 2007.  Under IFRS 3 the previous period results have been restated as following a review 
by management an additional contract accrual was identified which existed during the post acquisition period.  Further information has 
clarified the position adopted at the time of the acquisition leading to the restatement of prior year figures.

During the year, goodwill was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of Assets.  No impairment charges 
(2007:  £400,000) arose as a result of this review.  
For this review goodwill was allocated to individual Cash Generating Units (CGU) on the basis of the Group’s operations.  The carrying value 
of goodwill by each CGU is as follows:

Nettgain 727 727
IIS 407 407
TFPL 2,490 2,490
18,733 16,674
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.  These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections 
based on financial budgets approved by management covering the next financial year.  Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using 
the estimated growth rates stated below.
The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on management’s best estimate of short term performance 
based on an assessment of market opportunities and macro economic conditions. In the year to 31 October 2008 the Weighted Average Cost 
of Capital for the Group has been used as an appropriate discount rate to apply to cash flows.  This represents the overall required return on 
the Group as a whole.  
The assumptions used for the CGU included within the impairment reviews are as follows:
2008 2007
Discount rate 12.5% 12.5%
Growth rate 2% 2%
These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each CGU. In addition to this an external valuation is obtained with regards to TFPL and 
is assessed in addition to the value-in-use calculations.
Furthermore, management has assumed that the TFPL consulting business generates a profitable outcome in 2009 through both revenue 
growth and an improvement in margin and that the IIS subscription business grows both its subscription and projects revenues as a result of 
new sales initiatives.  It has also been assumed that the three software CGUs; Plantech, CAPS and Nettgain continue to sell their portfolio of 
products and services into new and existing customers. 42 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008

At 31 October 492 472
The provision allowance in respect of trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery 
of the amount owing is possible. At that point the amounts are considered irrecoverable and are written off against the trade receivable 
directly. Where trade receivables are past due an assessment is made of individual customers and the outstanding balance. No provision is 
required in respect of amounts owed by group undertakings.
The credit quality of the holder of the Cash at bank is AA rated. None of the financial assets that are fully performing have been 
re-negotiated in the last year.

The average interest rate paid was 9.42% (2007: 9.62%). Bank borrowings of £6,696,000 (2007: £7,611,000) were arranged at floating interest 
rates. As discussed in note 19, the Group has entered into certain derivative hedges to fix interest rates paid on a portion of the loan.  Bank 
borrowings mature until 2012.
As security for the above loans, the Bank of Scotland holds a bond and floating charge over the assets of the Group, a composite guarantee 
supported by each Group company and a share pledge in respect of the entire issued share capital of each subsidiary company.
The loans are repayable in six monthly instalments. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears.  
The directors’ estimate that the fair value of the Group’s borrowing is not significantly different to the carrying value.

The fair value of the contract has been estimated using relevant market interest rates.
In the current year the Group has used interest rates swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings. 
Contracts with notional values of £3m fix interest payments at an average rate of 6.31% for periods up until 2011.
The fair value of swaps entered into at 31 October 2008 is estimated at £(96,000) (2007: £Nil).

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, cash flow interest rate risk and 
price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets 
and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance and to allow the Group to take advantage of new 
growth opportunities whilst maximising shareholder value.
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, short term deposits and bank borrowings. The main purpose 
of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group has other financial instruments which mainly comprise trade 
receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
Risk management is carried out by the finance department under policies approved by the board of directors. The Group finance department 
identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks. The board provides guidance on overall risk management including foreign exchange risk, 
interest rate risk, credit risk, and investment of excess liquidity.
The impact of the risks required to be discussed under IFRS 7 are detailed below: 47 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008

Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not 
the group’s functional currency. The Group has no exposure to foreign exchange risk.

The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk because no investments are held by the group. The group is not exposed to 
commodity price risk.

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of cash balances held with banks and other highly rated counterparties. 
The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.  Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow 
interest rate risk.  Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.  During 2008 and 2007, all the group’s 
borrowings were denominated in UK Sterling.
The group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.  Such interest rate swaps have the economic 
effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.  Generally, the group raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and 
swaps them into fixed rates that are lower than those available if the group borrowed at fixed rates directly.  Under the interest rate swaps, 
the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals (primarily quarterly), the difference between fixed contract rates and 
floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
At 31 October 2008, if interest rates on borrowings had been 1% higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the 
year would have been £73,000 (2007: £32,000) lower/higher, mainly as a result of higher/lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings; 
other components of equity would also have been £73,000 (2007: £32,000) lower/higher.

Credit risk is managed on a group basis. Credit risks arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, 
as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.  
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. It is the policy of the Group to present the amounts in the balance 
sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and the current economic 
environment. The Group reviews the reliability of its customers on a regular basis, such a review takes into account the nature of and the 
Group’s trading history with the customer.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are four banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international 
credit-rating agencies. Management does not expect any losses from non-performance of these counterparties.
None of the Group’s financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
l i q u i d i t y	r i s k
The Group closely monitors its access to bank and other credit facilities in comparison to its outstanding commitments on a regular basis to 
ensure that it has sufficient funds to meeting obligations of the group as they fall due.
The board receives regular debt management forecasts which estimate the cash inflows and outflows over the next twelve months, so that 
management can ensure that sufficient financing is in place as it is required.  Surplus cash within the Group is put on deposit in accordance 
with limits and counterparties agreed by the Board, the objective being to maximise return on funds whilst ensuring that the short-term 
cashflow requirements of the Group are met.
Detailed analysis of the debt facilities taken out and available to the group are disclosed in note 17.  In addition, interest rate swaps taken out 
by the Group to manage its exposure to fluctuating interest rates ensure that the group can manage cash outflows on interest payments closely. 49 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the company’s share price over the previous 3 years. The 
expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The company recognised total expenses of £108,000 (2007 - £359,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.

The fair value adjustment for the intangible assets relates to customer relationships, trade names and software.  A related deferred tax 
liability has also been recorded as a fair value adjustment.
Other adjustments were made to bring the carrying values of property, plant and equipment and trade receivables in line with their fair value.
The profit after taxation of Plantech Limited for the period from 1 May 07, the beginning of the subsidiary’s financial year, to the date of 
acquisition was £85,828.  The profit after taxation for the year ended 30 April 2007 was £294,056.
Residual goodwill comprises the workforce, any immaterial intangible asset values and a strategic premium paid to acquire the business.  
These do not form identifiable intangible assets under IFRS 3. The fair values are considered provisional.

As stated in the Basis of Preparation, this is the Group’s first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU.  The Group’s date of transition to IFRS was 1 November 2006. An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has 
affected the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows is set out below.
IFRS 1 permits companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS in the transition 
period. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of taking the following exemption:

a) Under IFRS goodwill is not amortised, but is subject to an annual impairment review.  Goodwill amortised of £1,439,000 for the year to 31 
October 2007 has been removed.  Further, when amortisation of goodwill was removed the carrying value in respect of TFPL Limited was not 
supportable by £400,000.
b) Following a fair value exercise on the company’s intangible assets, the newly created assets are now being amortised over 10-20 years.   
This has resulted in an amortisation charge of £362,000 for the period to 31 October 2007.
c) IAS 12 requires deferred tax to be provided on all taxable temporary differences.  The income earned whilst the intangible asset is used 
will be taxable and there will be no tax deductions against that income from the use of the asset. This results in a temporary difference equal 
to the carrying value of the asset on initial recognition in the consolidated accounts. The result of the adjustment is to increase the deferred 
tax liability and increase goodwill. As at 31 October 2007 the value of deferred tax liabilities was increased by £3,423,000 respectively. As the 
intangible asset is amortised, the temporary difference will decrease and there is a reduction in the deferred tax expense recognised in the 
consolidated income statement.  The recognition of this deferred tax credit to the income statement reduces the impact of the amortisation 
of the intangible asset on the profits for the year. 5 6 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008

a) Under IAS 38 Intangible Assets should not incur an amortisation charge, but should be subject to an annual impairment review.  As a result 
of this the intangible assets have been increased by the amortisation charge incurred, which at 31 October 2007 was £1,439,000.  This has 
been offset by an impairment charge of £400,000.
b) The Group acquired CAPS Solutions Limited on 7 June 2007.  Application of IFRS 3 to this business combination resulted in identification of 
intangible assets, being customer relationships, trade names and software. Under IFRS these have been recognised separately in the balance 
sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Under UK GAAP these intangible assets were subsumed within goodwill. The result of this 
adjustment is to decrease goodwill and increase intangible assets at the date of combination. At 31 October 2007 the value of intangible 
assets were increased by £11,410,000. A corresponding decrease in goodwill was also taken in the same period. The intangible assets are 
being amortised between 10 and 20 years. This has resulted in a charge for the period 31 October 2007 of £362,000.
c) As part of the fair value adjustment to intangibles a deferred tax liability was created which increases the value of the amount attributable 
to goodwill.  The amortisation charge for the year has resulted in a release of this deferred tax charge.
There are no material differences in the cash flow statement between that presented under IFRS and as previously presented under UK GAAP.

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s

The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, and the parent company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with relevant 
legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the parent 
company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in 
our opinion the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company financial statements.  The information given in the Directors’ Report 
includes that specific information presented in Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Report that is cross referred from the Business 
Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent company financial 
statements. This other information comprises only the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Report, the Board of Directors, the Directors’ 
Report, the Remuneration Report, the Corporate Governance Report, and the Report of the Audit Committee.  We consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
B a s i s	o f	a u d i t	o p i n i o n
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An 
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent company financial statements.  
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed.

The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and under the historical cost 
convention.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by s230(4) of the Companies Act, 1985.
I nves t m e nt s
Investments, held as non-current assets, are included at cost less amounts written off for any permanent diminution in value.

All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 November 2006 are recognised in the 
financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values.  Where employees 
are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined indirectly by reference to the fair value 
of the instrument granted to the employee.  This fair value is appraised at the grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets).
All equity-settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account with a corresponding credit to 
profit and loss reserves.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available 
estimate of the number of share options expected to vest.  Estimates are revised subsequently if there is any indication that the number 
of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates.  Any cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current 
period. No adjustment is made to any expense recognised in prior periods if share options that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital, and where 
appropriate share premium.
D e f e r r e d	t a x a t i o n
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Group an obligation to pay more tax in the 
future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date.  Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is more 
likely than not that they will be recovered.  Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
C o n t r i b u t i o n s	t o	d e fi n e d	c o n t r i b u t i o n	p e n s i o n	s c h e m e s
Contributions paid to private pension plans of certain employees are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they 
become payable. Contributions paid to the group personal pension plans of employees are charged to the profit and loss account in the 
period in which they become payable.
F i n a n c i a l	i n s t r u m e n t s
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt instrument, those 
financial instruments are classed as financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such in the balance sheet. Finance costs and gains  60 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
N o t e s 	 t o 	 t h e 	 C o m p a n y 	 F i n a n c i a l 	 S t a t e m e n t 	 c o n t ’ d
or losses relating to financial liabilities are included in the profit and loss account. Finance costs are calculated so as to produce a constant 
rate of return on the outstanding liability.
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a financial liability then this is classed as an 
equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited direct to equity.
The Group uses derivatives financial instruments to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. Interest and expenditure arising on 
financial instruments is recognised on the accruals basis and credited or charged to the profit and loss account in the financial period to 
which it relates. The Group does not apply FRS 26.
Operating leases
Amounts paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.

All share options are exercisable at a price equal to the average market price of the company’s shares on the date of grant. The vesting period 
is usually 1 to 3 years. The options are settled in equity once exercised.  Only those share options that were issued in the current  and prior 
years come within the measurement and recognition criteria of “FRS 20 (IFRS 2) Share Based Payments.”   64 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the company’s share price over the previous 3 years. The 
expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations. These share options have been limited to employees of subsidiary companies of IDOX plc.  
As such, share option expenses of £108,000 (2007: £359,000) have been added to the cost of investments in the parent company.

Strategic report | Chairman’s statement
Chairman’s statement
The strength and resilience of our business model combined 
with the execution of our consistent and proven strategy has 
once again delivered further growth.
Results
Although challenging macroeconomic 
conditions persisted in many of the countries 
in which we operate, particularly in Latin 
America and Australasia, and difficult market 
conditions continued to affect some of the 
sectors we serve, I am pleased to report 
another good set of results. Overall currency 
translation movements had a small positive 
impact on the Group’s revenue but reduced 
the growth rates for profits and earnings  
at actual exchange rates by between 1%  
and 2%. 
Group revenue increased to £6,489.7 million 
(2014: £6,156.5 million) and adjusted 
operating profit before intangible 
amortisation and acquisition related costs 
was £455.0 million (2014: £429.8 million). 
Adjusted earnings per share were 91.0p 
(2014: 86.2p).
At constant exchange rates revenue 
increased by 5% and adjusted operating 
profit rose by 7%. The Group operating 
margin improved from 6.9% to 7.0% at 
constant exchange rates with adjusted 
earnings per share up 7% on the  
same basis. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final  
dividend of 26.25p. This brings the total 
dividend for the year to 38.0p, up 7% 
compared to 2014. Shareholders will  
again have the opportunity to participate  
in our dividend reinvestment plan.
Strategy
We have continued to pursue our long-
established and successful strategy of 
developing the business through organic 
growth, consolidating our markets through 
focused acquisitions and continuously 
improving the efficiency of our operations. 
We seek to achieve organic growth by 
applying our resources and expertise to 
enable customers to reduce or eliminate the 
hidden costs of sourcing and distributing a 
broad range of goods not for resale. As a 
result they are able to focus on their core 
business and run their operations more  
cost-effectively by achieving purchasing 
efficiencies and savings, while at the same 
time freeing up working capital, improving 
their distribution capabilities, reducing 
carbon emissions and simplifying their 
internal administration. 
Acquisition activity continued at a record 
pace throughout 2015. We acquired 22 
businesses during the year with a total 
committed spend of £327 million, thereby 
adding annualised revenue of £324 million.  
These figures exclude Tillman which we 
agreed to acquire in December 2014 and 
completed at the beginning of January  
2015. The acquisitions made in 2015 have 
helped to strengthen our position in many  
of the markets that we serve and have  
also taken us into two new countries,  
Turkey and Austria. We now have  
operations in 29 countries.
Investment
Both organic growth and acquisitions require 
investment in the business to expand and 
enhance its asset base. During the year we 
have continued to extend and improve our 
warehouses and open new ones, both as a 
result of acquisitions and by consolidating 
our existing warehouse footprint. Systems 
are an important part of our ability to serve 
our customers in the most efficient and 
appropriate manner. By continuously 
upgrading our IT systems we are able to 
increase the functionality of our operations, 
thereby enhancing our customer offering. 
Together this investment enables us to  
retain a competitive advantage and thereby 
maintain our leading position in the 
marketplace.
Corporate responsibility
We continue to refine our sustainable 
business processes and operations to ensure 
improvements in this area. However, we also 
strive to assist both our customers and 
suppliers to improve the sustainability of 
their businesses. The nature of our business 
proposition, which allows our customers to 
consolidate both their purchasing 
requirements and product deliveries, is 
environmentally friendly and, in addition, we 
offer a full range of environmentally friendly 
products. During 2015, we once again  Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 05
Strategic report | Chairman’s statement
contacted our key suppliers to encourage 
them to adopt corporate responsibility 
policies similar to ours. Our quality 
assurance/quality control team based in 
Shanghai continues to refine our supplier 
audit process, undertaking audits of our  
key Asian suppliers to assist them in  
meeting our required standards. Integrity  
is imperative in running our business and 
building appropriate relationships and we 
have recently refreshed our whistle blowing 
programme and renewed the corporate 
responsibility training for all relevant 
employees.
Employees
Bunzl’s decentralised organisation structure 
encourages fast decision making at the local 
level. This allows us to understand our 
customers’ needs and provide great service. 
Many new people have joined Bunzl through 
acquisitions during the past year and this 
provides us with a stream of new ideas to 
improve our business and strengthens our 
talent pipeline. As a service oriented 
company we continue to rely on the quality 
and efficiency of our employees across the 
world. We very much appreciate their hard 
work and loyalty which are key to the ongoing 
growth and success of Bunzl.

Board
As reported in the 2014 Annual Report, Peter 
Johnson, who had served as a non-executive 
director since 2006 and was both Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee and senior 
independent director, retired from the Board 
in April 2015. David Sleath, who was 
appointed as a non-executive director in 
September 2007 and is Chairman of the  
Audit Committee, assumed the role of senior 
independent director and Vanda Murray, who 
joined the Board as a non-executive director 
in February 2015, succeeded Peter as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
As reported on 14 January 2016, after more 
than 10 years in the role, Michael Roney has 
decided to retire as Chief Executive of the 
Company. He will stand down from his 
position and the Board following the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to 
be held on 20 April 2016. I would like to thank 
Mike for his outstanding contribution to 
Bunzl. Under his careful stewardship the 
Group has gone from strength to strength 
and grown significantly with sustained 
increases in the Company’s earnings, 
dividends and share price. Mike will leave  
the Board with our very best wishes and  
our sincere thanks and appreciation for 
everything he has achieved. 
Mike will be succeeded by Frank van Zanten 
who is currently the Managing Director of  
the Continental Europe business area.  
Frank joined the Board at the beginning  
of February and will assume his new role 
upon Mike’s retirement. He has extensive 
knowledge and experience of our business 
gained over many years and has a successful 
track record of implementing the Company’s 
strategy to develop and expand the Group. 
His appointment will provide continuity for 
the business as well as its customers and 
employees going forward.

Business model and strategy
For many years we have followed a well-established and successful  
business model and pursued a consistent and proven strategy in order  
to create value for our stakeholders. By doing so we have delivered  
strong growth across our selected international markets as we have  
looked to develop both in existing and new geographies.
Our business model 
Strength and resilience through our scale, balance and diversity 
We have a geographically balanced and diversified business portfolio 
operating across 29 countries, serving six core fragmented market  
sectors, many of which are growing and resilient to challenging economic 
conditions. This allows us to withstand shifts and changes in demand.

Our sources of competitive advantage
Global scale
Relationships with both multinational and local suppliers  
provide us with a very broad range of products. Our extensive 
delivery networks mean we can distribute to customers on a 
local, regional, national and international basis, giving them 
complete flexibility.
Operational focus
With a decentralised operational structure, our experienced 
management teams are able to focus on our customers’  
needs while retaining full responsibility for the financial 
performance of their businesses.
Strong financial discipline
Since 2004 we have delivered consistently good results with  
high returns on capital and operating cash flow conversion.
Acquisition track record
We have a strong track record of successfully integrating 
acquisitions, helping us to extend our geographic footprint while 
at the same time enabling our acquired businesses to continue  
to feel ‘local’.
  To find out how we are making progress on our strategic priorities 
through our key performance indicators, see pages 14 and 15
We source
We source and procure branded, 
own brand and unbranded products 
globally, working with both 
multinational and local suppliers,  
to give our customers access to the 
best and most suitable products to 
meet their needs.
We consolidate
By applying our resources and 
consolidating a broad range of 
products into our extensive 
warehousing infrastructure, we are 
able to offer our customers an efficient 
one-stop-shop solution, thereby 
allowing them to focus on their core 
businesses more effectively. 
We deliver
Our delivery options include 
direct store delivery, cross-dock 
and warehouse replenishment 
programmes on a local, regional, 
national and international basis  
to get products to our customers 
when and where they are needed.

Customer benefits
Our customers benefit from  
a lower cost of doing business  
by reducing or eliminating many  
of the hidden costs of in-house 
procurement and distribution  
and reducing carbon emissions.
Employee benefits
We provide our employees with 
career development opportunities 
and meet their training needs  
while providing opportunities for 
advancement within the business.
Environmental awareness

sustainable products and  
business practices.
Shareholder returns
We seek to deliver good returns  
for our shareholders over time  
with sustained improvement in 
profits and earnings which drive 
long term growth in Bunzl’s share

Strategic report | Business model and strategy
Growing Bunzl organically, either by 
expanding and developing our business 
with existing customers or by gaining new 
business with additional customers, is an 
integral part of our strategy to enhance 
shareholder value.
organic 
growth
Building relationships
One of the greatest opportunities for organic sales growth 
comes from building long term relationships with existing 
customers. By being both flexible and reliable and by 
providing excellent levels of service, we gain our customers’ 
trust and confidence to meet their future needs over a 
sustained period of time through a broad and effective 
product and service offering.
Acquiring new customers
We are constantly striving to expand and gain market 
share by winning business with new customers. Our  
well-established business model allows us to show potential 
customers that we can apply our resources and expertise 
to reduce or eliminate many of the hidden costs of in-house 
procurement and distribution or satisfy their requirements 
more cost-effectively than their current suppliers.
Expanding our offering
Once we have established a good relationship with a 
particular customer, we endeavour to increase our level  
of business with that customer. This can be achieved by 
expanding our offering to parts of their operations where  
we might not have previously been a recognised supplier  
or by increasing the type and variety of products that are 
available, whether branded or own brand. We do this either  
by extending the range of products within a particular 
category or adding new categories of products to those 
already supplied, often by optimising cross-selling 
opportunities across other Bunzl businesses.
Organic growth through 
development of customer 
relationships and maximisation  
of cross-selling opportunities. 10 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015
Expanding and developing the Group through 
acquiring businesses is also a key component of our 
growth strategy. Historically, approximately two 
thirds of our year-on-year increase in earnings has 
been achieved through an ongoing programme of 
focused and targeted acquisitions in both new and 
existing market sectors and geographies.
acquisition 
growth
Key acquisition parameters
In considering potential acquisition 
opportunities, we only target those 
businesses that meet the specific parameters 
that fit our business model and growth 
strategy. These include businesses: 
• that sell business to business (‘B2B’);
• with a consolidated ‘not-for-resale’  
product offering;
• in resilient and growing markets; 
• with a fragmented customer base; 
• that operate in markets with scope for 
further consolidation and synergies; 
• whose products represent a small 
percentage of total customer spend; 
• that have opportunities for own label 
products; and 
• with attractive financial returns.
Acquisition types
There are two different types of acquisition that 
we undertake depending on whether we are 
already present in the country or market sector 
in which the target business is operating:
• Anchor
 − new geographies; or
 − new market sectors.
• Bolt-on
 − existing geographies; or
 − existing market sectors. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 11
Growth in existing countries 
Unlike many industries that are 
characterised by a relatively small number  
of large businesses, the markets in which  
we compete are very fragmented. As a 
result, there are numerous opportunities 
for us to develop through acquisitions in 
those countries where we already have a 
presence. We do this either by extending our 
existing operations in a particular market 
sector or by acquiring a business in a sector 
in which we do not currently operate within  
that country.
Growth in new countries
We are now a truly international business 
with operations in 29 countries but there  
are a number of potentially attractive 
countries where we do not yet have a 
presence. In evaluating whether to enter a 
new country through acquisition, we consider 
a number of different criteria including a 
detailed analysis of our market sectors, the 
local macroeconomic indicators and the ease 
of doing business in, and the political risks 
and business practices associated with,  
the particular country under review.

We are continually looking to refine 
and develop our processes and 
procedures to make our operations

able to gain a competitive advantage, 
by offering our customers more 
cost-effective solutions, while at the 
same time improving our profitability.

efficiencies
Consolidating warehouses
As warehouse lease terms come to an 
end, we are often able to consolidate 
our warehouse footprint in a particular 
area by closing a number of smaller 
and less efficient facilities and 
relocating our operations into a single, 
larger and more efficient building.
Sharing best practice
As we have continued to expand 
internationally, we are increasingly 
making use of our collective 
resources, experience and expertise 
to share best practice across the 
Group and collaborate between our 
different businesses.
Routing and safety systems
By installing state-of-the-art routing 
and safety systems in our facilities and 
delivery vehicles, we are able to plan 
our delivery routes to minimise the 
distances travelled and encourage 
safe and efficient driving practices, 
thereby reducing fuel and other 
transport costs.
Global purchasing
With the annual cost of the goods we 
sell exceeding £4.9 billion, our global 
scale provides substantial purchasing 
synergies with our international 
suppliers that we are able to share 
with our customers in the form of 
more competitive selling prices.
IT systems
Systems are an important part of  
our ability to serve our customers in 
the most cost-effective and efficient 
manner and accordingly we are 
continually improving and upgrading 
our IT systems in order to increase 
functionality and enhance 
customer service.
Warehouse lighting
Recent improvements in lighting 
technology have meant we are  
able to make significant savings in 
electricity costs by installing energy 
efficient and environmentally 
friendly lighting systems.

Strategic report | Chief Executive’s review
Chief Executive’s review
A combination of record acquisition spend during the  
year, the impact of prior year acquisitions and some  
organic growth has allowed us to develop both in existing 
and new geographies.
Operating performance
The overall translation effect of currency 
movements has once again affected the 
reported Group growth rates with the 
average US dollar stronger against sterling 
than in 2014 but the average Canadian dollar, 
euro, Brazilian real and Australian dollar all 
weaker than the prior year. As in previous 
years, the operations, including the relevant 
growth rates and changes in operating 
margins, are therefore reviewed below at 
constant exchange rates to remove the 
distorting impact of these currency 
movements. Changes in the level of revenue 
and profits at constant exchange rates have 
been calculated by retranslating the results 
for 2014 at the average rates used for 2015. 
Unless otherwise stated, all references in 
this review to operating profit are to adjusted 
operating profit (being operating profit 
before intangible amortisation and 
acquisition related costs). 
Revenue increased 5% (5% at actual 
exchange rates) to £6,489.7 million 
principally due to the positive impact of 
acquisitions together with some organic 
growth, which continues to be affected by 
price declines on plastic resin-based 
products, particularly in North America. 
Operating profit was £455.0 million, an 
increase of 7% (6% at actual exchange rates). 
The percentage growth in operating profit 
was greater than that of revenue due to  
the impact of higher margin acquisitions, 
resulting in an improvement in the Group 
operating margin by 10 basis points to 7.0% 
(unchanged at actual exchange rates).
In North America revenue rose 5% (11% at 
actual exchange rates) principally due to the 
impact of acquisitions completed in both 2014 
and 2015, while operating profit increased 
9% (16% at actual exchange rates) as the 
operating margin improved 30 basis points  
to 6.5% (20 basis points at actual exchange 
rates). Revenue in Continental Europe rose 
7% (down 2% at actual exchange rates) as a 
result of organic revenue growth and the 
impact of acquisitions, with operating profit 
up 10% (1% at actual exchange rates) and the 
operating margin up 20 basis points to 9.3% 
(30 basis points at actual exchange rates).  
In UK & Ireland revenue was up 3% (2% at 
actual exchange rates) due to the impact of 
both organic revenue growth and 
acquisitions, and operating profit rose 6% at 
both constant and actual exchange rates as 
the operating margin improved by a further 
30 basis points during the year to 7.7%.  
In Rest of the World revenue increased 6% 
(down 8% at actual exchange rates) but 
operating profit was down 11% (24% at  
actual exchange rates). Margins came  
under pressure due to the challenging 
macroeconomic conditions and some 
negative foreign exchange transaction 
impact of weaker local currencies in the 
relevant markets in both Latin America and 
Australasia, with the business area operating 
margin down 160 basis points (170 basis 
points at actual exchange rates) to 8.2%.
Basic earnings per share were 10% higher 
(at both constant and actual exchange rates) 
at 71.0p. Adjusted earnings per share,  
after eliminating the effect of intangible 
amortisation and acquisition related costs, 
were 91.0p, an increase of 7% (6% at actual 
exchange rates). The return on average 
operating capital decreased from 57.7% to 
55.5% principally due to reduced returns in 
the underlying business and the mix impact 
of recent, lower return acquisitions. The 
return on invested capital was 17.1%, down 
from 17.6% in 2014.
Highlights
Record acquisition spend of 
£327 million on 22 businesses  
with entry into two new countries.

Strategic report | Chief Executive’s review
The operating cash flow continued to be 
strong with the ratio of operating cash flow 
before acquisition related costs to operating 
profit at 97%. The ratio of net debt to EBITDA 
calculated at average exchange rates 
increased to 2.1 times, which is at the lower 
end of our target range, compared to 1.8 
times as at the end of 2014. The increase is 
principally due to the significant acquisition 
spend during the year. 
Corporate responsibility remains intrinsic  
to the effective running of our business. We 
are continually seeking ways to ensure the 
sustainability of our business by developing 
our processes in this area. During the year 
we have focused further on our supply chain 
and its impact on our business. As a result, 
we are disclosing for the first time 
information on our Scope 3 carbon emissions 
comprising emissions from third party 
carriers, business flights, waste disposal 
and electricity transmission losses. In 
addition, we are completing a further 
risk assessment of our supply chain with 
regard to social issues and we are also 
undertaking a pilot project for closed loop 
recycling in conjunction with one of our  
existing suppliers. 
Acquisitions
Acquisitions are a key component of the 
Group’s growth strategy. Our committed 
spend in 2015 was a record £327 million  
as we completed 22 transactions in total, 
excluding Tillman which we agreed to 
acquire in December 2014 and completed  
at the beginning of January 2015.
In addition to Tillman, we completed the 
acquisition of two further businesses in 
January. Quirumed, which had revenue  
of £15 million in 2015, represents our first 
move into the healthcare sector in Spain, 
while Jan-Mar, based in Toronto with revenue 
of £6 million in 2015, has further extended 
our cleaning & hygiene supplies business  
in Canada.
Three acquisitions were completed in  
March. Janssen Packaging is engaged in the 
distribution of specialist packaging materials 
for the e-commerce, fashion and fulfilment 
sectors in the Netherlands. It complements 
and expands our retail supplies business 
thereby providing access to an extended 
range of innovative packaging solutions to 
both new and existing customers in this 
market. Revenue in 2015 was £6 million. 
In Canada we purchased two separate 
businesses at the end of the month. 
Emballages Maska is engaged in the sale of 
cleaning and hygiene supplies to distributors 
throughout Quebec and eastern Ontario. 
Revenue in 2015 was £16 million. Prescott 
distributes cleaning and hygiene products  
to a variety of end users in the construction, 
property management and healthcare 
sectors, as well as to some distributors, 
throughout the Montreal area of Quebec. 
Revenue in 2015 was £9 million. 
Ligne T, a distributor of personal protection 
equipment, principally workwear, based in 
Montauban, France, was purchased at the 
end of May. The business supplies a variety 
of end user customers throughout the 
south-west region of France and had 
revenue of £4 million in 2015. Also at the  
end of May we completed the acquisition  
of Istanbul Ticaret, a business engaged  
in the sale of a variety of personal protection 
equipment to both end users and other 
distributors throughout Turkey. Revenue  
in 2015 was £24 million. This is an exciting 
development for us as it represents our first 
acquisition in Turkey which is an important 
G20 economy that has grown steadily over 
recent years. The business has a broad 
range of both branded and own brand 
products and an excellent reputation for 
quality and service. It will provide a good 
platform from which to develop a significant 
business in Turkey.

Strategic report | Chief Executive’s review
ICB Cleaning Supplies in New Zealand, with 
revenue of £2 million in 2015, and Cemelin  
in Spain, with revenue of £3 million in 2015, 
are both distributors of cleaning and hygiene 
supplies and were acquired at the end of 
October and early November respectively. 
Casa do Epi, an important acquisition for  
our safety business in Brazil, was also 
purchased in November. The business is 
principally engaged in the sale of a wide 
range of personal protection equipment to 
end user customers in the mining, 
construction and manufacturing sectors. 
Revenue in 2015 was £16 million. At the end 
of November we acquired DPS, a distributor 
of catering disposables and a variety of 
cleaning, safety and packaging products 
based in Santiago with a number of other 
locations throughout Chile. Revenue in 2015 
was £25 million. The Company’s business in 
Spain was expanded at the end of November 
with the purchase of Faru. Based in Zaragoza, 
the business is engaged in the sale of personal 
protection equipment, including fall arrest 
and head protection products and safety 
shoes, to distributors throughout Spain. 
Revenue in 2015 was £3 million. 
At the beginning of December we purchased 
Comatec, which is engaged in the distribution 
of high-end, innovative single-use tableware 
to restaurants and hotels throughout France 
but also exports products to a large number 
of distributors in a number of countries 
worldwide. Revenue in 2015 was £14 million. 
We also acquired Dental Sorria in December. 
Based in Belo Horizonte in the State of Minas 
Gerais and with revenue of £6 million in 2015, 
the business has expanded our operations  
in Brazil into the dental supplies sector.
Since the year end we have agreed to acquire 
two further businesses. At the beginning  
of February 2016 we purchased Earthwise 
Bag Company, a distributor of reusable bags 
to supermarkets and other retailers in the 
US, which has expanded our offering of 
environmentally friendly products to the 
grocery and retail sectors. Revenue in 2015 
was £12 million. We also entered into an 
agreement in February relating to the 
proposed acquisition of Bursa Pazari,  
which had revenue of £31 million in 2015.  
It represents our second step in Turkey  
and extends our operations there into the 
foodservice and healthcare sectors. 
Completion of the acquisition is subject to 
clearance of the transaction by the Turkish 
competition authority.
GF, a distributor of industrial packaging, 
warehouse supplies and equipment which  
is based in Calgary, Canada, was acquired  
at the beginning of June. The business has  
a large and diverse base of end user 
customers in western Canada and had 
revenue in 2015 of £42 million. 
At the end of June we added two further 
businesses to the Group’s portfolio. Solmaq, 
based in Bogota, supplies a complete  
range of head-to-toe personal protection 
equipment and other welding and industrial 
consumables to distributors, retailers and 
end users throughout Colombia. Revenue 
was £14 million in 2015. It further extends 
our safety business in Colombia, being a 
market that we entered with the purchase  
of Vicsa at the end of 2012. Cordova Safety 
Products, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is 
engaged in the sale of a variety of personal 
protection equipment, principally gloves,  
to distributors throughout the US. Most 
products supplied are own label. Revenue  
in 2015 was £55 million.
We acquired three businesses in July. 
Steiner, which had revenue of £12 million  
in 2015, has further expanded our safety 
business in the US while Bidvest Hospitality 
Supplies and Delta Hospitality Supplies,  
each with revenue of £5 million in 2015,  
have added additional scale to our catering 
consumables and equipment business  
in Australia. 
The acquisition of Meier Verpackungen, 
which distributes customer specific 
packaging products to food processors and 
had revenue of £29 million in 2015, was 
completed in September and represents our 
first step into Austria, complementing our 
existing business in Switzerland. Planet 
Clean, which is based in Vancouver and  
is principally engaged in the sale and 
distribution of cleaning and hygiene supplies 
and equipment to a variety of customer 
markets throughout western Canada, was 
also acquired in September and had revenue 
in 2015 of £13 million. It is the seventh 
acquisition we have made in Canada since 
November 2013, as a result of which we have 
developed a national business there with 
annual revenue in excess of £340 million.
Prospects
Against the background of variable economic 
conditions, Bunzl’s strong competitive 
position, the impact of the significant 
acquisition spend in 2015 and the 
opportunities to consolidate our fragmented 
markets further are together expected to 
lead to continued growth in 2016.
In North America, the combination of recent 
acquisitions and underlying volume growth 
should result in a good performance despite 
the impact of price declines in plastic 
resin-based products. In Continental  
Europe, we expect to see a further strong 
performance due to both organic growth and 
the effect of recent acquisitions. In UK & 
Ireland, progress in 2016 will be held back 
principally due to pressure in the business 
serving the grocery and retail sectors. Rest 
of the World will see a strong benefit from 
recent acquisitions, although the outlook  
for both economic growth in the relevant 
markets and for exchange rates, particularly 
in Brazil, remains uncertain.
The pipeline of potential acquisitions remains 
promising. Discussions are continuing with  
a number of potential targets and we expect 
to complete further transactions as the  
year progresses.
The Board believes that the prospects of the 
Group are positive due to its strong market 
position and our ability to grow the business 
both organically and through acquisition.

Strategic report | Chief Executive’s review
Our ability to find the right targets in the 
right markets at the right time has enabled 
us to build a substantial international 
business and establish a strong base  
for continued further growth.
Since 2004 the Group has made more than 120 acquisitions, at a 
total cost of more than £2.2 billion, all of which have been self-
funded. In doing so, over this period we have increased the number 
of countries in which we operate from 14 to 29 and added annualised 
revenue in excess of £3.2 billion.
As part of the pre-acquisition process the Company adopts a 
disciplined approach with rigorous analysis and due diligence  
being carried out on the target businesses to ensure that they  
meet Bunzl’s criteria for acceptable financial returns.
Turkey
The acquisition of Istanbul Ticaret  
in May 2015 was an important development  
for the Group as it represented Bunzl’s first 
acquisition in Turkey which is an important G20 
economy that has grown steadily over recent 
years. The business has a broad range of both 
branded and own brand safety products, which 
it sells to end users and other distributors, and 
an excellent reputation for quality and service.  
It has provided a good platform from which to 
develop a significant business in Turkey.
Austria
The purchase of Meier Verpackungen in 
September 2015 was the Company’s second 
entry into a new country during the year. The 
business has a good position in the local market  
due to its ability to provide customer specific 
packaging products and complex packaging 
solutions in compliance with stringent food 
regulations at competitive prices, combined 
with high levels of customer service. The 
acquisition has improved the Group’s technical 
know-how in a specialist market sector.

North America
In North America, revenue increased by  
5% to £3,751.8 million principally due to the 
impact of the three acquisitions made in 2014 
and the seven further businesses acquired 
during 2015. These acquisitions have enabled 
us to extend our product and service 
offerings and further consolidate the 
markets we serve. Although sales volumes 
increased, organic revenue growth was held 
back primarily due to deflationary pressures 
caused by price declines of plastic resin-
based products and the net impact of some 
lost business. As a result of recent 
acquisitions having higher operating margins 
than the underlying businesses, operating 
profit increased 9% to £244.0 million with  
the business area operating margin at 6.5%, 
an increase of 30 basis points at constant 
exchange rates.
Our largest business serving the grocery 
sector was adversely affected by deflationary 
pressures and some lost business but we 
gained some new accounts and renewed 
some large contracts with existing 
customers. We have taken steps to reduce 
operating costs further and improve 
efficiencies by continuing to invest in new 
high-tech distribution facilities. We continued 
to use our ‘Think Big’ marketing campaign  
to promote our ability to help food retailers 
improve their profitability in the fresh food 
areas of their stores using our category 
management techniques. By employing our 
flexible store delivery programmes, retailers 
are able to provide exceptional customer 
service with new, innovative packaging while 
reducing their expenses, improving their 
asset utilisation and ensuring that  
they have an optimal supply of the  
products they require.
Our objective is to give our 
customers a competitive 
edge and to improve the 
efficiency of their operations 
by offering them greater 
choice and excellent service 
throughout the supply chain 
from the initial order to the 
final delivery.

Highlights
• Revenue increase principally from recent acquisitions with operating 
margin* up 30bp at constant exchange rates to 6.5%. 
• Grocery and redistribution businesses impacted by price declines  
in plastic products and some lost business. 
• Three safety acquisitions (Tillman, Cordova and Steiner) significantly 
enhance growing portfolio of own brand products.
• Recent acquisition activity in Canada creates national distribution 
platform in cleaning & hygiene.
• Strong revenue and profit growth in businesses serving food  
processor and agriculture sectors.
 North America is Bunzl’s largest  
and longest-established business  
area, having started in 1981 with the 
acquisition of Jersey Paper Company  
in the US. The revenue of the business 
area that year was £20 million. Over  
the last 35 years the operations have 
grown substantially throughout the  
US while at the same time have 
expanded into Canada, Mexico and 
Puerto Rico to become the market-
leading business that it is today with 
revenue of £3.8 billion.

Strategic report | Chief Executive’s review
In the retail sector, we gained several major 
new accounts and expanded our business 
with existing customers. We have continued 
to seek opportunities to grow our materials 
consolidation and custom fulfilment 
business in this sector and to expand this 
concept into the grocery and convenience 
store sectors. These services, combined  
with our expertise in store supplies, décor 
and branded packaging, further enhance  
the capabilities we are able to offer to 
retailers. We also continue to target the 
growing online retailing market with our 
efficient and cost-effective packaging 
solutions. We believe that the depth and 
breadth of our operational and merchandising 
offering for our customers enables us to 
provide an end-to-end solution that is 
unmatched in the retail sector. The recent 
purchase of Earthwise Bag Company has 
further extended our product offering to 
grocers and retailers.
Although we have also experienced the 
impact of deflationary pressures and some 
lost accounts in our redistribution business, 
we have continued to expand our category 
management programme with our 
foodservice distributor customers who 
increasingly see the value of partnering  
with us to fulfil their janitorial, sanitation and 
food packaging requirements. The ongoing 
investment in digital capabilities benefits  
our businesses serving all sectors but 
particularly in redistribution where 
customers use our digital tools to sell to 
their own customers. Our central warehouse 
network enables us to purchase inventory 
and supply janitorial and sanitation products 
more efficiently to our local branches and 
customers. This enhances our ability to 
provide our redistribution customers with 
access to a wider range of products, which  
in turn allows them to use us as their ‘virtual 
warehouse’ to improve their sales and 
profitability without having to invest in 
additional space and inventory.
In our business serving the safety sector,  
in addition to Tillman, which we agreed to 
acquire in December 2014 and completed at 
the beginning of January 2015, we purchased 
two further companies during the year, being 
Cordova Safety Products and Steiner. All 
three businesses are based in the US and 
supply industrial distributors with a range  
of personal protection equipment, including 
safety gloves and workwear, with Tillman 
and Steiner specialising in products for the 
welding industry. Their combined expertise 
in imports and product development will 
help us to enhance our growing portfolio  
of own brand safety products.
Customer consolidation in the food 
processor sector continues to present 
challenges as well as potential opportunities 
for business growth. We have experienced 
both revenue and profit growth in the sector 
as a result of our national account strategy 
and investment in additional resources which 
together have enabled us to improve our 
account penetration. Additionally we have 
expanded our own label product offering 
including our new line of Clarity vacuum 
pouches, shrink bags and bin liners.
We have seen strong sales and profit growth 
in our business that supplies the agriculture 
sector and we have expanded our presence 
and capabilities in Mexico in order to meet 
demand in the region. To improve both 
collaboration and efficiency, all of our 
businesses serving in this sector are 
operating on a new IT system. We continue  
to develop innovative products to meet the 
demands of our customers. For example, 
Destiny Packaging has introduced the ‘grab & 
steam’ product, a retail version of a zippered 
microwavable cooking bag featuring steam 
valve technology.
In other product developments, FoodHandler 
has expanded its marketing of the ‘oneSAFE’ 
single-use glove dispensing system for the 
foodservice and healthcare sectors that 
significantly reduces cross-contamination 
and thereby improves food safety standards.  
A dedicated ‘oneSAFE’ website has been 
developed featuring educational materials 
designed to position the system as a leading 
product in food and health safety.
Despite the challenges presented as a 
result of continued customer consolidation 
in the convenience store sector, we have 
achieved steady profit growth as we have 
worked with our key wholesale partners 
to execute a pull-through strategy with 
key convenience store retailers. With our 
supplier managed inventory services, our 
wholesale partners are able to reduce their 
working capital and warehouse space needs 
while benefiting from excellent fill rates and 
just-in-time delivery.
Finally, we have acquired five businesses in 
Canada during the year, four of which operate 
in the cleaning & hygiene sector, that have 
enabled us to establish a truly national 
distribution platform in this important 
market. Our most recent acquisition, Planet 
Clean in September, specialises in offering 
environmentally friendly and sustainable 
cleaning and hygiene products. With our 
purchase of GF in June, we have entered into 
the industrial packaging sector and further 
expanded our offering of products and 
services for our customers. Additionally,  
we have combined several of our businesses 
in Winnipeg into one large facility to drive 
greater efficiencies and productivity. We will 
continue to use this method of consolidation 
throughout the North America business area 
where we have multiple business units

Continental Europe
Continental Europe developed strongly with 
revenue rising by 7% to £1,121.0 million  
and operating profit up 10% to £104.5 million 
despite the slow macroeconomic recovery in 
many of the countries in which we operate. 
Gross margins came under pressure from 
the strength of the US dollar against the 
euro, thereby increasing the cost of our 
imports, but careful management of the cost 
base enabled the underlying business to 
maintain its profitability. This has been 
supplemented by the full year impact of the 
four 2014 acquisitions and the part year 
contribution of the eight acquisitions 
completed in 2015, with the operating margin 
rising by 20 basis points at constant 
exchange rates to 9.3%. In a significant 
development, we entered two new countries 
during the year with the acquisition of 
Istanbul Ticaret, a personal protection 
equipment distribution business, in Turkey at 
the end of May and Meier Verpackungen, 
which distributes packaging products for 
food processors, in Austria at the beginning 
of September. Both businesses are 
integrating well into the Group. Today we 
have announced our second step into the 
Turkish market with the proposed acquisition 
of Bursa Pazari which will extend our 
operations there into the foodservice and 
healthcare sectors.
In France, sales at our cleaning & hygiene 
business declined slightly due to continuing 
pressure in the contract cleaning sector in 
particular. However cost reduction measures 
mitigated this decline with profits improving 
in the year. Our personal protection 
equipment business also recorded lower 
sales, the impact of which could only partly 
be offset by lower costs. Ligne T, the 
specialist safety business acquired in May 
2015, has traded in line with expectations  
and is integrating well. At the beginning  
of December we acquired Comatec which 
We have a broad product 
range and a wide geographic 
spread across a variety 
of market sectors which 
continue to position us well 
to meet our customers’ 
demands in the future.

Highlights
• Strong constant exchange revenue and profit growth with operating 
margin* up 20bp at constant exchange rates to 9.3%.
• Entry into two new countries, Turkey and Austria.
• Impact of lower sales in France offset by continued cost  
reduction measures.
• Good growth in the Netherlands driven by acquisitions and progress  
in the safety, healthcare, retail and food processor sectors.
• Significant profit growth in Denmark.
• Further improvement in Spain and central Europe.
 Bunzl acquired its first business in 
Continental Europe with the purchase  
of Hopa Disposables in the Netherlands  
in 1994. This was followed by acquisitions 
in Germany, Denmark and France in 
1997, 2000 and 2004 respectively. By 
2010 the business had expanded through 
acquisition into a further eight countries 
and today operates in 14 countries 
across the continent.

specialises in the distribution of high-end, 
innovative single-use tableware to hotel, 
restaurant and catering (‘horeca’) 
customers. This is a significant addition to 
our operations in France and expands our 
business there in the foodservice sector.
In the Netherlands, sales grew well in the 
healthcare, food processor and retail 
sectors, more than offsetting lower sales  
in the horeca, grocery, cleaning & hygiene 
and government sectors. Although gross 
margins are under pressure, costs remain 
tightly managed. Allshoes and De Ridder 
have both integrated successfully into the 
Group and performed ahead of our initial 
expectations. Janssen Packaging, the 
distributor of specialist packaging for the 
e-commerce, fashion and fulfilment sectors 
which was acquired in March 2015, had a 
very successful year due in particular to its 
exposure to the e-commerce sector. It has 
now been fully integrated into our existing 
retail business. The Majestic personal 
protection equipment business generated 
good sales growth overall and margins 
improved despite the strength of the US 
dollar as sales of own brand products 
continued to grow. 
In Belgium, strong sales growth in the 
cleaning & hygiene sector came both from 
significant volume increases with a number 
of larger customers as well as from winning 
new customers, which more than offset 
slightly lower sales in the grocery and food 
processor sectors. Margins were down due 
to the impact of new, lower margin business 
while costs remained carefully controlled.
In Germany, sales grew well with regional 
accounts and also in the hotel sector 
although margins were lower than the  
prior year. The main business has 
successfully implemented our Microsoft 
Dynamics AX ERP system. Our safety 
business reported good sales growth and  
the cleaning & hygiene business grew 
significantly, having won a large new 
customer during the year. 
In Switzerland, revenue was up in the 
industrial sector which offset a decline in  
the retail sector. Sales were broadly flat in 
the medical and horeca sectors. The local 
economy continues to suffer from the 
strength of the Swiss franc which has 
adversely affected both tourism and  
exports. Profits were also at a similar  
level to last year.
In Denmark, revenue increased strongly  
with a particularly good performance  
in sales to the public sector and to 
redistributors. Growth in sales to the retail 
sector remained low but significant gains 
were made in selling personal protection 
equipment. Together with careful margin  
and cost management, this led to a 
significant rise in profit.
In Spain, sales grew well, especially of 
personal protection equipment, as the  
local economy has continued to improve. 
Although margins remained under  
pressure, in particular due to the strength  
of the US dollar, profits increased strongly. 
Quirumed, the healthcare products business 
acquired in January 2015, was particularly 
affected by the weak euro, which increased 
the costs of imports, but the business is 
integrating well. The integration process is 
also under way at Cemelim and Faru, both 
acquired in the last quarter of the year.
In Israel, sales increased in the bakery 
sector and were flat in the horeca sector. 
Margin pressure due to the weakening 
shekel was offset by tight cost control  
with profits ahead of last year.
In central Europe, revenue rose strongly in 
Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic 
with increased sales in both the retail and 
industrial sectors. Margins were lower  
given the high levels of growth with larger 
customers but overall profits in the region 
increased significantly. 26 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

UK & Ireland
In UK & Ireland revenue increased 3% to 
£1,102.4 million and operating profit rose  
6% to £84.9 million. Our constant focus on 
reducing operating costs and managing 
margins led to our operating margin 
improving to 7.7%, up 30 basis points on 
the previous year. This is a very creditable 
performance in a market with noticeably 
increased competition and also an 
unprecedented level of tender activity  
from many of our customers. 
Our safety business has performed well, 
with revenue and profits both up, having 
successfully integrated the two acquisitions 
from 2014 and continued to build the own 
label programme with new products and 
ranges being introduced in footwear, gloves 
and clothing. To optimise the cost base, the 
branch network has been consolidated 
further, resulting in the closure and 
integration of three locations. Our cleaning  
& hygiene supplies business continues to 
provide a very good service to the major 
facilities management companies in the UK 
and profits increased as we continued to help 
our customers mobilise new projects both 
rapidly and effectively.
In retail supplies, a recent account loss has 
given rise to a reorganisation of the business 
which we believe is now well positioned for 
the future and this has been supported by the 
successful retention of our largest customer 
just before the year end. Although the 
government-imposed tax on single-use 
plastic carrier bags introduced in early 
October has reduced sales of those products, 
we anticipated this change and have 
continued to develop our offering of Bags for 
We have continued to 
improve our operational 
efficiency through good 
margin management and 
careful control of costs while 
continuing to invest in new 
facilities and technology.

Life which has offset some of this lost 
revenue. While also in a very competitive 
trading environment, Keenpac, our branded 
retail packaging business, has had a very 
successful year with some good account 
wins and has achieved good growth.
Our marketing services business has  
proven to be a valuable addition to the Group. 
In 2015 we had good success in renewing 
customer contracts and winning new 
business. This, together with the synergy 
benefits of merging our three businesses 
into one, has made us the clear market 
leader in this area.
Our hospitality businesses have performed 
well and benefited from a year of increased 
consumer activity and investment by many  
of our customers. The catering disposables 
business increased both revenue and profits 
as a consequence of the continued focus on 
account management, service, tailored 
solutions, product category management 
and a comprehensive own label programme. 
All of this is supported by an operational 
platform which continues to improve its 
efficiency and quality of service. Our  
catering equipment business has also  
had a very successful year. Investment by 
customers has resulted in growth in activity 
of kitchen design services and the increased 
supply of heavy catering equipment. 
Concentrated efforts to build a direct 
marketing offering has successfully targeted 
and grown new and smaller customers.  
The own brand programme has had ongoing 
investment and the development during  
the year included new ranges of crystal 
glassware, plastic glassware, cutlery and 
porcelain. At the end of the year we opened 
an innovation centre in London to showcase 
our ranges of branded and own brand 
products and the project to relaunch our 
website will be completed in the first half  
of 2016. We continue to invest in the  
growth of this business and will shortly  
be commissioning a new warehouse  
facility to consolidate our imported  
own label products. 
The healthcare business has had a 
successful year, especially in an environment 
where there have been customer spending 
constraints and an exchange rate impact on 
imports. Sales growth has come from acute 
hospitals looking to save money on the cost 
of goods and services who see the advantage 
in utilising our efficient, high-service 
platform. As there is ongoing pressure  
on prices, we are concentrating our efforts 
on the overseas sourcing of items and 
looking to consolidate supply from fewer 
suppliers in the Far East.
In Ireland, the domestic economy has improved 
and the renewed consumer confidence has had 
an impact on retail activity and tourism, both of 
which are drivers of activity in our businesses 
there. Despite the adverse impact of the 
weakening euro, a number of initiatives 
undertaken with both suppliers and 
customers have helped to produce a very 
good result in this progressively improving 
area of our business.
During the year we continued to invest  
in our digital capabilities. Converting more 
customers onto electronic ordering 
platforms has been a priority which has 
delivered positive results. We have three  
new websites in cleaning and safety with  
a new one being launched in catering 
equipment shortly. One of our coffee shop 
chain customers now utilises our bespoke 
smartphone app to place orders. This offers 
significant benefits to the customer and will 
provide a strong platform for other high 
street customers to transition to the app 
in due course. Electronic proof of delivery 
systems are now in place in a number  
of our businesses and will be rolled out  
further. We also hold significant volumes  
of transaction data in our businesses  
which record the ordering behaviour of our 
customers and our service delivery. Our 
ability to analyse this data and share it with 
our customers and suppliers is of great 
benefit to them and is serving to enhance our 
reputation and the value of what we can offer. 28 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

Rest of the World
In Rest of the World revenue increased  
6%to £514.5 million but operating profit  
fell 11% to £42.1 million as margins came 
under pressure due to the challenging 
macroeconomic conditions and the impact  
of significant currency weakness in both 
Latin America and Australasia which have 
particularly affected those businesses  
that import large volumes of products.
The economies in Latin America have 
suffered a number of strong headwinds 
during the year. In particular a very 
depressed commodity market, combined 
with significant exchange rate depreciation 
and intense economic pressure and political 
volatility in Brazil, have created challenging 
market conditions across the region.
In Brazil, our largest market in Latin 
America, the political uncertainty regarding 
the current government administration, 
combined with steep interest rate increases 
to curb inflationary pressures, created a 
deep recession with a consequential adverse 
impact on industrial production. Our safety 
business was particularly affected by this 
decline in output and increased levels of 
unemployment leading to a significant fall in 
profitability. The acquisition in November of 
Casa do EPI, which is based in the State of 
Minas Gerais and has a good reputation and 
an excellent customer portfolio, will help 
strengthen our position in a region where we 
were previously under-represented. We have 
been able to pass on some of the exchange 
rate impact through price increases and 
changes in the product mix and will continue 
to focus on this going forward in order to 
mitigate the impact of these market 
pressures. However, due to the continued 
weakness in the Brazilian real, combined 
with a long lead time for imported products, 
it will take some time before we begin to  
see a recovery in operating margins. 
Nonetheless, this disruption in the supply 
chain is providing some opportunities in  
the marketplace as a result of our well-
established infrastructure and extensive 
product portfolio.
Our cleaning & hygiene business in Brazil 
has expanded following the successful 
integration of JPLUS, acquired in 2014, and 
we have been able to increase revenue in our 
healthcare business although margins in 
both businesses also came under pressure. 
We acquired Dental Sorria, a market leader 
in the supply of dental products in the State 
of Minas Gerais, in December 2015 which has 
further enhanced our product offering in the 
healthcare sector in Brazil. 
Highlights
• Margins under pressure due to challenging macroeconomic conditions 
and currency weakness affecting product purchase prices.
• Latin America
 − Weaker performance at Brazil safety with significant fall  
in profitability.
 − Other businesses trading broadly in line with expectations.
• Australasia
 − Market position further consolidated in consumables.
 − Industrial and safety adversely impacted by slowdown

 The current operations of the Group  
in Rest of the World started in 1983 
with the acquisition of United  
Suppliers based in Sydney, followed  
by the purchase of a number of other 
businesses throughout Australia and 
New Zealand over the next 30  
years. The Group’s first move into  
Latin America was in 2008 with the 
acquisition of Prot Cap in São Paulo 
since when the business has expanded 
both within Brazil and into five other 
countries in the region.

In the rest of Latin America, the picture is 
mixed with softer demand and pressure on 
margins in almost all of our markets. Despite 
this, our businesses are trading broadly in 
line with our expectations. We have also 
been able to acquire some excellent 
businesses across different sectors and 
geographies which will further strengthen 
our market position in Latin America and 
provide a solid platform for future growth  
as trading conditions improve.
In Chile, we acquired DPS at the end of 
November. The business provides catering 
disposables and a variety of cleaning, safety 
and packaging products to wholesalers  
and distributors as well as to restaurants, 
supermarkets and other end users. This  
is our third acquisition in Chile and has 
bolstered our position in the market there. 
Vicsa and Tecno Boga faced challenging 
conditions, caused primarily by the reduction 
in mining investment as a result of the  
weak Chilean economy and the continuing 
pressure on commodity prices, but despite 
this both businesses held up well.
In Colombia, our business has been  
enhanced significantly by the acquisition  
of Solmaq at the end of June which has 
further consolidated our product and  
service offering there. The business  
supplies a complete range of personal 
protection equipment and welding and  
other consumables to customers  
throughout the country. 
In Mexico, our safety business, which 
incorporates both Espomega and Vicsa 
Mexico, had a good year with revenue and 
profits both improving strongly despite the 
pressures caused by currency fluctuations. 
In Australasia, the business environment 
continued to be challenging with ongoing 
contraction and slowdown in the resources 
sector and declining commodity prices 
impacting market conditions. Compounding 
this, the weakening of the Australian dollar 
has increased the cost of imports thereby 
increasing margin pressures at a time when 
businesses were looking for cost reductions 
to offset the softer market conditions.
Although adversely impacted by the market 
downturn and margin pressures, our largest 
business, Outsourcing Services, which 
supplies the healthcare, cleaning, catering 
and retail sectors, nevertheless delivered a 
solid performance. The business strategy to 
develop a strong and sustainable position in 
the more resilient market sectors places the 
business well for future growth and should 
result in an improved performance as the 
market recovers. To support this strategy the 
business made three acquisitions during the 
year, Bidvest Hospitality Supplies in 
Adelaide, Delta Hospitality Supplies in 
Brisbane and ICB Cleaning Supplies in 
Auckland, New Zealand. The purchase of the 
two catering businesses creates additional 
scale and capability as we continue to build 
our national footprint in this sector and ICB 
Cleaning Supplies brings further knowledge 
and expertise into our New Zealand business 
as we continue to develop our position in  
this market.
Our food processor business continued to 
build momentum with another improved 
performance. The business is developing its 
position as a leading supplier to the 
Australian and New Zealand food industries. 
Our strategy to diversify into non-meat food 
processors, supported by specialist and 
technical resources, also continues to 
develop well. This is creating a solid 
foundation which should deliver strong 
growth prospects for the future. Our 
investment, continued focus and development 
of our specialist resources has helped to 
build creditability and scale in this market. 
This strategy will continue as we look for 
additional opportunities to develop and 
enhance our position further in this sector. 
Our customers rely on our 
sourcing expertise and 
the deep knowledge of our 
product offering to ensure 
that they get the items 
that they need, where and 
when they are required.

Kim Hetherington
Managing Director Australasia
Our industrial and safety supplies  
business has been the most affected by  
the slowdown in the resources sector.  
We have endeavoured to offset the impact  
of the downturn by consolidating facilities 
and making structural changes to reorganise  
the business to fit the current market 
environment. In order to reposition the 
business for future growth, we have invested 
in technology, processes and operational 
initiatives to enhance our competitive 
position and create efficiencies. We are  
also focused on developing new product 
innovations and redesigning our current 
product range to create a point of difference 
with improved safety, comfort and 
performance characteristics. A number  
of these initiatives will be launched in the 
first half of 2016 which should create 
additional business opportunities going 
forward. Although trading conditions have 
been challenging, the business has been 
successful in winning a number of new 
customers which has strengthened  
our market position and enabled us  
to diversify into more resilient market 
sectors and regions. 30 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

Retaining former owners
Our business model is capital light and

The acquisition of businesses is a crucial 
part of our strategy to grow and develop 
and post-acquisition it is important that 
we retain the former owners and other

ongoing customer relationships 
are maintained.
One of the key reasons 
we sold our business to 
Bunzl was to benefit from 
the skills and experience 
that they could provide to 
help us grow our business 
faster. We were initially a 
little nervous about joining 
a big company and whether 
we would lose all control

Group performance
Overall currency translation movements 
had a small positive impact on the Group’s 
revenue but had a 1% to 2% adverse impact 
on profits and earnings due to the weakening 
of sterling against the US dollar and the 
strengthening of sterling against the euro, 
the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar 
and the Brazilian real.
Revenue increased to £6,489.7 million 
(2014: £6,156.5 million), up 5% at both 
constant exchange and actual exchange 
rates, reflecting the benefit of acquisitions 
and some growth in the underlying 
businesses. Adjusted operating profit  
(being operating profit before intangible 
amortisation and acquisition related  
costs) increased to £455.0 million (2014: 
£429.8 million), an increase of 7% at constant 
exchange rates and 6% at actual exchange 
rates. At constant exchange rates, the 
adjusted operating profit margin increased 
from 6.9% to 7.0% due to the impact of higher 
margin acquisitions. Intangible amortisation 
and acquisition related costs were up 
£0.5 million to £88.5 million due to a £4.9 
million increase in intangible amortisation, 
partly offset by a £4.4 million decrease in 
acquisition related costs. The net interest 
charge of £43.8 million was £1.8 million 
higher than in 2014 at actual exchange rates 
but up only £0.1 million at constant exchange 
rates with the impact of a higher average net 
debt from the funding of acquisitions offset 
by the effect of lower average interest rates. 
Adjusted profit before income tax (being 
profit before income tax, intangible 
amortisation and acquisition related costs) 
was £411.2 million (2014: £387.8 million), 
up 8% at constant exchange rates and 6% 
at actual exchange rates, principally due 
to the growth in adjusted operating profit.
Tax
A tax charge at a rate of 27.5% (2014: 27.4%) 
has been provided on the adjusted profit 
before income tax. Including the impact of 
intangible amortisation of £66.8 million, 
acquisition related costs of £21.7 million and 
the associated deferred and current tax of 
£23.1 million, the overall tax rate is 27.9% 
(2014: 29.7%). The underlying tax rate of 
27.5% is higher than the nominal UK rate of 
20.25% for 2015, principally because many 
of the Group’s operations are in countries 
with higher tax rates.
Profit for the year
Profit after tax of £232.7 million was up 
£22.0 million, primarily due to a £24.7 million 
increase in operating profit offset by a 
£1.8 million increase in the net interest 
charge and a £0.9 million increase in the 
tax charge.
Our long term track record of strong cash generation 
has enabled us to pay a growing dividend over the past

acquisitions and reinvesting in the underlying business.

trust. Earnings per share were 71.0p, up 10% 
on 2014 at constant exchange rates and 10% 
at actual exchange rates. After adjusting for 
intangible amortisation, acquisition related 
costs and the associated tax, adjusted 
earnings per share were 91.0p, an increase 
on 2014 of 7% at constant exchange rates 
and 6% at actual exchange rates. 
Intangible amortisation, acquisition related 
costs and associated tax are items which are 
not taken into account by management when 
assessing the results of the business as they 
do not relate to the underlying operating 
performance. Accordingly, such items are 
removed in calculating the adjusted earnings 
per share on which management assesses 
the performance of the Group. For further 
details of this and other non-GAAP measures 
see Note 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements on page 95. 
Dividends
An analysis of dividends per share for the 
years to which they relate is shown below:
2015 2014 Growth
Interim dividend (p) 11.75 11.0 7%
Final dividend (p) 26.25 24.5 7%
Total dividend (p) 38.00 35.5 7%
Dividend cover 
(times)* 2.4 2.4
* Based on adjusted earnings per share.
The Company’s practice has been to pay  
a progressive dividend with the aim of 
delivering year-on-year increases in 
dividends, growing at approximately the 
same rate as the growth in adjusted earnings 
per share. The 2015 dividend is 7% higher 
than the 2014 dividend, comparable to the 
adjusted earnings per share which have 
grown by 7% at constant exchange rates  
and 6% at actual exchange rates. Bunzl  
has sustained a growing dividend to 
shareholders over the past 23 years. 
Before approving any dividends, the Board 
considers the level of borrowings of the 
Group by reference to the ratio of net debt  
to operating profit before depreciation, 
intangible amortisation and acquisition 
related costs (‘EBITDA’), the ability of the 
Group to continue to generate cash and the 
amount required to invest in the business,  
in particular into future acquisitions. The 
Company’s long term track record of strong 
cash generation, coupled with the Group’s 
substantial borrowing facilities, provides  
the Company with the financial flexibility  
to enable dividends to be funded. 
The risks and constraints to maintaining  
a growing dividend are principally those 
linked to the Company’s trading performance 
and liquidity, as described in the Principal 
risks and uncertainties on pages 36 to 38.  
The Group has substantial distributable 
reserves within Bunzl plc and there is  
a robust process of distributing profits 
generated by subsidiary undertakings  
up through the Group to Bunzl plc. At  
31 December 2015 Bunzl plc had sufficient 
distributable reserves to cover more than 
three years of dividends at the cost of the 
2015 dividends, which is expected to be 
approximately £125 million. 
Acquisitions
We completed 22 acquisitions in total  
in the year ended 31 December 2015, 
excluding Tillman which we agreed to 
acquire in December 2014 but completed  
at the beginning of January 2015. Including  
Tillman, the estimated annualised revenue 
and adjusted operating profit of the 
businesses acquired were £389.5 million  
and £49.1 million respectively. A summary  
of the effect of acquisitions is as follows:

Total cash outflow in respect 
of acquisitions 371.2
*  Cash flow on acquisition related costs relates to 
£8.5 million of transaction costs paid and £34.2 million 
from payments relating to the retention of former owners.
Cash flow
Cash generated from operations before 
acquisition related costs was £465.0 million, 
a £33.4 million increase from 2014, primarily 
due to a £25.2 million increase in adjusted 
operating profit. The Group’s free cash flow 
of £310.2 million was up £33.7 million from 
2014, primarily due to the £33.4 million 
increase in cash generated from operations, 
partly offset by a £2.7 million increase in the 
cash outflow relating to tax. After payment of 
dividends of £116.1 million in respect of 2014 
(2014: £105.6 million in respect of 2013), 
an acquisition cash outflow of £371.2 million 
(2014: £168.1 million) and a £29.5 million 
outflow on employee share schemes 
(2014: £21.8 million), the net cash outflow

Balance sheet
Return on average operating capital 
decreased to 55.5% from 57.7% in 2014, 
driven by the impact of the lower return 
on operating capital from acquisitions and 
also a decrease in the return on operating 
capital in the underlying business. Return 
on invested capital of 17.1% was down from 
17.6% in 2014 due to lower returns on recent 
acquisitions and in the underlying business, 
partly offset by favourable exchange rate 
movements. Intangible assets increased by 
£153.2 million to £1,632.0 million, reflecting 
goodwill and customer relationships arising 
on acquisitions in the year of £281.2 million, 
partly offset by an amortisation charge of 
£66.8 million and a reduction of £61.2 million 
due to exchange. The Group’s net pension 
deficit of £40.0 million at 31 December 2015 
was £30.3 million lower than at 31 December 
2014, largely due to an actuarial gain of 
£27.0 million. The actuarial gain arose as 
a result of the impact of a £33.3 million 
decrease in the present value of scheme 
liabilities from changes in assumptions, 
principally higher discount rates, partly 
offset by the actual return on scheme assets 
being £6.3 million lower than expected.
Net debt to EBITDA calculated at average 
exchange rates, increased to 2.1 times 
(2014: 1.8 times), principally as a result of the 
significant acquisition spend during the year. 
The movements in shareholders’ equity and 
net debt during the year were as follows:
Shareholders’ equity £m
At 1 January 2015 983.9
Profit for the year 232.7

Group tax strategy
The Group’s tax strategy is principally 
focused on ensuring compliance with the 
legal obligations of all countries in which 
it operates. This extends to filings, payments 
and disclosures to tax authorities. In alignment 
with the commercial and economic activity 
of the business, the Group manages its taxes 
so as to create value for its shareholders  
in a way that does not adversely impact 
its reputation as a responsible taxpayer. 
The Group’s tax strategy and tax risks are 
regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee.
Capital management
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong 
capital base so as to maintain investor, 
creditor and market confidence and to 
sustain future development of the business.
The Group monitors the return on average 
operating capital employed and the return 
on invested capital as well as the level of 
total shareholders’ equity and the amount 
of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders. 
The Group funds its operations through a 
mixture of shareholders’ equity and bank 
and capital market borrowings. All of the 
borrowings are managed by a central 
treasury function and funds raised are 
lent onward to operating subsidiaries as 
required. The overall objective is to manage 
the funding to ensure the Group has a 
portfolio of competitively priced borrowing 
facilities to meet the demands of the 
business over time and, in order to do so, 
the Group arranges a mixture of borrowings 
from different sources with a variety of 
maturity dates.
The Group’s businesses provide a high and 
consistent level of cash generation which 
helps fund future development and growth. 
The Group seeks to maintain an appropriate 
balance between the higher returns that 
might be possible with higher levels of 
borrowings and the advantages and security 
afforded by a sound capital position.
There were no changes to the Group’s 
approach to capital management during 
the year and the Group is not subject to any 
externally imposed capital requirements.
Treasury policies and controls
The Group has a centralised treasury 
department to control external borrowings 
and manage liquidity, interest rate and 
foreign currency risks. Treasury policies 
have been approved by the Board and cover 
the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the 
types of financial instruments that may be 
employed and the criteria for investing and 
borrowing cash. The Group uses derivatives 
to manage its foreign currency and interest 
rate risks arising from underlying business 
activities. No transactions of a speculative 
nature are undertaken. The treasury 
department is subject to periodic 
independent review by the internal audit 
department. Underlying policy assumptions 
and activities are periodically reviewed by 
the executive directors and the Board. 
Controls over exposure changes and 
transaction authenticity are in place.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates derivatives which 
qualify as hedges for accounting purposes 
as either (a) a hedge of the fair value of  
a recognised asset or liability; (b) a hedge  
of the cash flow risk resulting from changes 
in interest rates or foreign exchange rates; 
or (c) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign 
operation. The accounting treatment for 
hedges is set out in the financial instruments 
accounting policy in Note 2 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 
94. The Group tests the effectiveness of 
hedges on a prospective and retrospective 
basis to ensure compliance with IAS 39.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will 
not be able to meet its financial obligations 
as they fall due. The Group continually 
monitors net debt and forecast cash flows 
to ensure that sufficient facilities are in place 
to meet the Group’s requirements in the 
short, medium and long term and, in order 
to do so, arranges borrowings from a variety 
of sources. Additionally, compliance with 
the Group’s biannual debt covenants is 
monitored on a monthly basis and formally 
tested at 30 June and 31 December. The 
principal covenant limits are net debt, 
calculated at average exchange rates, 
to EBITDA of no more than 3.5 times and 
interest cover of no less than 3.0 times. 
Sensitivity analyses using various scenarios 
are applied to forecasts to assess their 
impact on covenants and net debt. During 
2015 all covenants have been complied with  Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 35
Strategic report | Financial review
and based on current forecasts it is expected 
that such covenants will continue to be 
complied with for the foreseeable future.
The Group has substantial borrowing facilities 
available comprising multi-currency credit 
facilities from the Group’s banks and US 
private placement notes denominated in  
US dollars, sterling and euros. During 2015 
the Group agreed an issue of fixed interest 
rate US private placement notes in respect  
of which drawings of $225 million and 
€67 million were made during the year and 
the remaining notes of €133 million and 
£97 million are due to be drawn in March 
2016. At 31 December 2015 the nominal total 
of US private placement notes outstanding 
was £1,001.9 million (2014: £793.2 million) 
with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2028.  
During the year the Group also refinanced  
or agreed new banking facilities totalling 
£133.1 million. The Group’s committed bank 
facilities mature between 2016 and 2021. At 
31 December 2015 the available committed 
bank facilities totalled £969.0 million (2014: 
£917.0 million) of which £154.9 million (2014: 
£136.5 million) was drawn down. The 
committed facilities maturity profile at 31 
December 2015 is set out in the chart above.
Interest rate risk
The Group is funded by a mixture of fixed 
and floating rate debt. In addition, interest 
rate swaps and interest rate caps are used 
to manage the interest rate risk profile.  
At 31 December 2015 fixed rate debt of 
£679.4 million (2014: £635.7 million) related 
to fixed rate US private placement notes 
denominated in US dollars, sterling and 
euros was stated at amortised cost with 
maturities ranging from 2016 to 2024.
At 31 December 2015, floating rate debt was 
comprised of £160.0 million floating rate 
bank loans (2014: £138.5 million) and £339.5 
million of fixed rate US private placement 
notes with maturities ranging from 2025 to 
2028 which have been swapped to floating 
rates using interest rate swaps (2014: £173.6 
million). Bank loans are drawn for various 
periods of up to three months at interest 
rates linked to LIBOR. The interest rate 
swaps reprice every three or six months.
The interest rate risk on the floating rate 
debt is managed using interest rate options. 
Borrowings with a notional principal of 
£154.9 million were capped at 31 December 
2015 (2014: £45.5 million). Hedge accounting 
is not applied to the interest rate caps since 
the majority of their value is related to time 
value. The strike rates of these options are 
based on LIBOR repricing every three months. 
Foreign currency risk
The majority of the Group’s sales are made 
and income is earned in US dollars, euros 
and other foreign currencies. The Group 
does not hedge the impact of exchange 
rate movements arising on translation of 
earnings into sterling at average exchange 
rates. For the year ended 31 December 2015, 
a movement of one cent in the US dollar and 
euro average exchange rates would have 
changed profit before income tax by 
£1.1 million and £0.3 million respectively 
(2014: £0.9 million and £0.4 million) and 
adjusted profit before income tax by 
£1.2 million and £0.5 million respectively 
(2014: £1.0 million and £0.6 million).
The majority of the Group’s transactions 
are carried out in the respective functional 
currencies of the Group’s operations and so 
transaction exposures are usually relatively 
limited. Where they do occur the Group’s 
policy is to hedge significant exposures of 
firm commitments for a period of up to one 
year as soon as they are committed using 
forward foreign exchange contracts and 
these are designated as cash flow hedges. 
However, the economic impact of foreign 
exchange on the value of uncommitted  
future purchases and sales is not hedged.  
As a result, sudden and significant 
movements in foreign exchange rates can 
impact profit margins where there is a delay 
in passing on to customers the resulting 
price increases. For the year ended 31 
December 2015 all foreign exchange cash 
flow hedges were effective with a gain of 
£2.0 million recognised in equity (2014:  
gain of £3.0 million) which will affect the  
income statement during 2016.
The majority of the Group’s borrowings 
are effectively denominated in US dollars, 
sterling and euros, aligning them to the 
respective functional currencies of the 
component parts of the Group’s EBITDA. 
This currency profile is achieved using short 
term foreign exchange contracts and foreign 
currency debt. This currency composition 
minimises the impact of foreign exchange 
rates on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss in relation to 
a financial asset due to non-payment by 
the relevant counterparty. The Group’s 
objective is to reduce its exposure to 
counterparty default by restricting the 
type of counterparty it deals with and by 
employing an appropriate policy in relation 
to the collection of financial assets.
The Group’s principal financial assets are 
cash at bank and in hand, derivative financial 
instruments and trade and other receivables 
which represent the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk in relation to financial 
assets. The maximum exposure to credit 
risk for these financial assets is their 
carrying amount.
Dealings are restricted to those banks with 
the relevant combination of geographic 
presence and suitable credit rating. The 
Group continually monitors the credit ratings 
of its counterparties and the credit exposure 
to each counterparty.
For trade and other receivables, the amounts 
represented in the balance sheet are net 
of allowances for doubtful receivables, 
estimated by the Group’s management based 
on prior experience and their assessment 
of the current economic environment.
At the balance sheet date there were no 
significant concentrations of credit risk.

Strategic report | Principal risks and uncertainties
Principal risks and uncertainties
Bunzl has an extensive risk management framework designed to identify and assess  
the likelihood of risks arising, and the consequences of them doing so, and subsequently  
to manage the actions necessary in order to mitigate their impact to acceptable levels. 
It also identifies the assurance activities relating to the relevant mitigating actions. 
Risk overview
The effective identification, management and 
mitigation of risks and uncertainties across 
the Group are an integral part of successfully 
delivering the Group’s strategic objectives. 
The ‘Risk management and internal control’ 
section of the Corporate governance report 
on pages 53 and 54 includes further 
information on the specific procedures 
designed to identify, manage and mitigate 
business risk which could have a material 
impact on the Group’s business, financial 
condition or results of operations. 
The Company’s risk management framework 
provides a consistent methodology by which 
every business and business area, the 
Executive Committee and ultimately the 
Board assess the risks that the Group faces 
against a defined set of probability and 
impact criteria. In assessing impact,  
the following criteria are considered: 
business continuity; health, safety and the 
environment; regulatory; reputational; and 
financial. The probability and impact of each 
risk is assessed on two bases. The first, 
defined as Gross Risk, is the probability and 
impact of a risk if none of the mitigating 
actions or internal controls designed to 
reduce either the probability or the impact  
of a risk occurring were in place. The  
second, defined as Net Risk, is the residual 
probability and impact of a risk assuming 
that the mitigating actions and internal 
controls operated as intended in an  
effective way.
Using this framework, every business 
documents their key risks in a consistent 
reporting format which specifically identifies 
the mitigating activities, relevant controls 
and related assurance activities for each 
significant risk. Management then 
consolidates the risk information at both a 
business area and Group level using the 
same reporting format, culminating in the 
Group risk assessment. The Executive 
Committee then reviews the Group risk 
assessment, the relevant controls and other 
steps taken to mitigate the risks identified 
and the assurance procedures in place over 
such controls with a view to determining any 
further actions required in order to reduce 
the levels of risk to acceptable levels. The 
risk assessment is then submitted for review 
and approval by the Board. The Audit 
Committee also reviews the process for the 
management of risk and the assurance 
procedures over controls designed to 
manage key risks. Accordingly, the directors 
confirm that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group, including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity.
The risk profile
The Group operates in many business 
environments and across a number of 
geographies in which risks and uncertainties 
exist, not all of which are necessarily within 
the Company’s control. The risks identified  
in the 2014 Annual Report remain those of 
most concern to the business at the end  
of 2015. In addition, this year the Company 
has determined that there is an additional 
financial risk relating to taxation, details  
of which are set out on page 38. 
In accordance with the provisions of the 
Corporate Governance Code, the directors 
have taken account of the Group’s principal 
risks in assessing the prospects of the 
Company when considering whether there is 
a reasonable expectation that the Company 
will be able to continue operations and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment. The principal risks and 
uncertainties faced by the Group and the 
steps taken to mitigate such risks and 
uncertainties are summarised below.  
The risks identified do not comprise all  
of the risks that the Group may face and 
accordingly this summary is not intended to 
be exhaustive and is not presented in order 
of potential probability or impact. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 37
Strategic report | Principal risks and uncertainties
Market risks
Risk Description Mitigating factors
Competitive 
pressures
The Group operates in highly competitive markets and faces 
competition from international companies as well as national, 
regional and local companies in the countries in which it 
operates. Increased competition and unanticipated actions by 
competitors or customers could lead to an adverse effect on 
results and hinder the Group’s growth potential. This could 
result from: customer pressure on sales volumes or margins; 
the loss of customers due to service or pricing issues; increased 
price competition; customers and suppliers dealing directly  
with one another; or unforeseen changes in the competitive 
landscape due to the introduction of disruptive technologies  
or changes in routes to market.
The Group seeks to remain competitive by maintaining  
high service levels and close contacts with its customers  
to ensure that their needs and demands are being met 
satisfactorily, developing a national presence in the  
markets in which the Group operates and maintaining  
strong relationships with a variety of different suppliers, 
thereby enabling the Group to offer a broad range of  
products to its customers, including own brand products.  
The Group also regularly reviews the competitive 
environment in which it operates.
Product price 
changes
The purchase price of products distributed by the Group can 
fluctuate from time to time, thereby potentially affecting the 
results of operations. There could be significant increases in  
the cost of specific products leading to a diminution in margins  
if cost increases cannot be passed on in full to customers or 
substitute products sourced from elsewhere. Potential causes 
could include changes in the input costs of products purchased 
through commodity price inflation. In addition, a period of 
commodity price deflation may lead to reductions in the price 
and value of the Group’s products where sales prices are indexed 
or if competitors reduced their selling prices. If this was to  
occur, the Group’s revenue and, as a result, its profits, could  
be reduced and the value of inventory held in stock may not  
be fully recoverable.
The Group endeavours, whenever possible, to pass on price 
increases from its suppliers to its customers and to source 
its products from a number of different suppliers so that it is 
not dependent on any one source of supply for any particular 
product. Increased focus on the Group’s own import 
programmes and brands, together with the reinforcement of 
the Group’s service and product offering to customers, helps 
to minimise the impact of price deflation. The Group also 
mitigates against the risk of holding overvalued inventory  
in a deflationary environment by managing stock levels 
efficiently and ensuring they are kept to a minimum.
The Group uses its considerable experience in sourcing and 
selling products to manage prices during periods of both 
inflation and deflation in order to minimise the impact on 
operating margins.
Economic 
environment
The Group’s business is partially dependent on general economic 
conditions in the US, the UK, France and other important 
markets. A significant deterioration in these conditions could 
have an adverse effect on the Group’s business and results  
of operations.
The Group’s operations and its customer base are diverse, 
with a variable and flexible cost base, and many of the sectors 
in which it competes are traditionally, by their nature, 
relatively resilient to economic downturns.
Financial risks
Risk Description Mitigating factors
Foreign 
exchange
The majority of the Group’s sales are made and income is  
earned in US dollars, euros and other foreign currencies.  
The Group does not hedge the impact of exchange rate 
movements arising on translation of earnings into sterling at 
average exchange rates. As a result, movements in exchange 
rates may have a material translation impact on the Group’s 
reported results.
The Group is also subject to transaction exposures where 
products are purchased in one currency and sold in another.  
As a result, movements in exchange rates may also adversely 
impact both operating margins and the value of the Group’s  
net assets.
The Group believes that the benefits of its geographical 
spread outweigh the associated risks.
The majority of the Group’s transactions are carried out in  
the functional currency of the Group’s operations. As a result, 
transaction exposures are usually limited and exchange rate 
fluctuations have minimal effect on the quality of earnings 
unless there is a sudden and significant adverse movement  
of a foreign currency in which products are purchased which 
may lead to a delay in passing on to customers the resulting 
price increases. The Group undertakes some forward 
purchasing of foreign currencies for identified exposures  
to reduce the impact of short term volatility.
The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and  
related hedging activity is regularly monitored by senior 
management. The Group’s approach to managing foreign 
exchange risk is reviewed annually by the Board. 
Financial 
liquidity and 
debt covenants
The Group needs continuous access to funding in order to meet 
its trading obligations, to support investment in organic growth, 
to make acquisitions when appropriate opportunities arise, and 
to pay dividends to shareholders. There is a risk that the Group 
may be unable to obtain the necessary funds when required or 
that such funds will only be available on unfavourable terms.
The Group’s borrowing facilities include a requirement to comply 
with certain specified covenants in relation to the level of net 
debt and interest cover. A breach of these covenants could result 
from a significant and rapid deterioration in the business’s 
performance, foreign exchange rate fluctuations or the failure  
to manage working capital levels. Ultimately this could result  
in a significant proportion of the Group’s borrowings becoming 
repayable immediately.
The Group arranges a mixture of borrowings from different 
sources and continually monitors net debt and forecast cash 
flows to ensure that it will be able to meet its financial

Taxation
In an increasingly complex corporate tax environment, it is 
possible that changes in tax law, including those that might  
arise from the OECD’s current Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 
project, may lead to higher effective tax rates for many 
international businesses, thereby adversely affecting  
the Group’s future cash flows.
Oversight of the Group’s tax strategy is within the remit of  
the Board. The Group seeks to plan and manage its tax affairs 
efficiently but also responsibly with a view to ensuring that  
it complies fully with the relevant legal obligations in the 
countries in which the Group operates while endeavouring to 
manage its tax affairs to protect value for the Company’s 
shareholders in line with the Board’s broader fiduciary duties.
The Group manages and controls these risks through an 
internal tax department made up of experienced tax 
professionals who exercise judgement and seek appropriate 
advice from specialist professional firms. At the same time 
the Group monitors international developments in tax law and 
practice, adapting its approach where necessary to do so.  
Tax risks are assessed by the Audit Committee and are also 
incorporated within the Group risk assessment reviewed by 
the Board as part of the formal governance process  
relating to risk management.
Operational risks
Risk Description Mitigating factors
Acquisitions 
A significant portion of the Group’s historical growth has been 
achieved through the acquisition of businesses and the Group’s 
growth strategy includes additional acquisitions. Although the 
Group operates in a number of fragmented markets which 
provide future acquisition opportunities, there can be no 
assurance that the Group will be able to make acquisitions in the 
future. There is also a risk that not all of the acquisitions made 
will be successful due to the loss of key people or customers 
after the acquisition, deterioration in the economic environment 
of the acquired business or the failure to perform adequate 
pre-acquisition due diligence or appropriately manage the 
post-acquisition integration of the business. 
In the longer term, if an acquisition consistently underperforms 
compared to its original investment case, there is a risk that this 
will lead to a permanent impairment in the carrying value of the 
intangible assets attributed to that acquisition.
The Group’s acquisition strategy is to focus on those 
businesses which operate in sectors where it has or can 
develop competitive advantage and which have good growth 
opportunities. The Group continually reviews acquisition 
targets and has established processes and procedures with 
regard to detailed pre-acquisition due diligence and post-
acquisition integration.
The Group endeavours to maximise the performance of an 
acquisition through the recruitment and retention of high 
quality and appropriately incentivised management combined 
with effective strategic planning, investment in resources and 
infrastructure and regular reviews of performance by both 
business area and Group management.
Business 
continuity
The Group would be adversely affected if any of its major 
distribution facilities was destroyed or damaged or there was a 
significant failure of its information systems resulting from 
either hardware failure or a cybersecurity breach. 
The Group seeks to reduce the impact of destruction of, or 
damage to, facilities through the use of multi-site facilities 
with products stocked in more than one location. The impact 
of information systems’ failure is mitigated through regular 
renewal of hardware, layered security measures and disaster 
recovery plans which are periodically tested and which would 
be implemented in the event of any such failure.
Laws and 
regulations
The international nature of the Group’s operations exposes it to 
potential claims as the Group is subject to a broad range of laws 
and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
In addition the Group faces potential claims from customers 
in relation to the supply of defective products or breaches of 
their contractual arrangements. The sourcing of products 
from lower cost countries increases the risk of the Group being 
unable to recover any potential losses relating thereto from the 
relevant supplier.
Although the Group does not operate in particularly litigious 
market sectors, it has in place processes to report, manage 
and mitigate against third party litigation using external 
advisers where necessary. 
The use of reputable suppliers and internal quality assurance 
and quality control procedures reduces the risks associated 
with defective products.
The Financial review on pages 32 to 35 and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements include information relating to the Group’s risk 
management policies so far as they relate to financial instruments. Strategic report | Corporate responsibility

Corporate responsibility
We continue to conduct our operations in a sustainable manner 
while also seeking to encourage our suppliers to maintain high 
levels of corporate responsibility within their own businesses. 
Highlights
• All directors, managers, sales representatives and purchasing staff 
once again undertook corporate responsibility training.
• Our supplier audit team, based in China, continued to grow and refine 
its CR audit programme.
• We have for the first time provided information on our Scope 3 
emissions comprising emissions from third party carriers, business 
flights, waste and electricity transmission losses.

Business context
We are a focused and successful 
international distribution and outsourcing 
group with operations across the Americas, 
Europe and Australasia. By outsourcing  
the purchasing, consolidation and delivery  
of a broad range of everyday items, our 
customers are able to focus on their core 
businesses, achieve purchasing efficiencies 
and savings, free up working capital,  
improve distribution capabilities, reduce 
carbon emissions and simplify their  
internal administration.
We do not manufacture any products but  
as part of our business strategy we source 
and procure branded, own brand and 
unbranded products globally. These 
products are then consolidated into our 
extensive global warehouse infrastructure, 
giving our customers a one-stop-shop 
solution to help reduce or eliminate the 
hidden costs of self-distribution and reduce 
their environmental impact. We also offer 
several delivery options to ensure our 
customers get their products when  
and where they are needed.
Sourcing
We source everyday essential non-food  
items for a number of market sectors 
including foodservice, grocery, cleaning  
& hygiene, retail, safety and healthcare.  
We liaise closely with our suppliers so that 
we are able to offer a full range of items 
which satisfy our customers’ demands, 
including offering alternative products which 
reduce their environmental impact and, as a 
result, their effect on climate change. Our 
quality assurance/quality control department 
based in Shanghai monitors and works with 
our key suppliers in Asia to ensure that 
appropriate corporate responsibility (‘CR’) 
standards are in place.
Consolidation
We have an extensive footprint of warehouse 
facilities across four continents. Our broad 
range of products are therefore never far 
from where they need to be, allowing us  
to facilitate our customers’ needs quickly  
and easily, as well as reducing the number  
of deliveries to our customers, thereby 
cutting fuel usage, carbon emissions  
and administration.  40 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015
Distribution
With our fleets of delivery vehicles and third 
party carriers, we are able to get products  
to our customers in a timely manner.  
Our flexible delivery service allows our 
customers to increase the efficiency and 
competitiveness of their operations.
As well as day-to-day operations, our 
business relies on developing strong and 
stable relationships with all of our 
stakeholders. We believe in managing our 
business with integrity, making sustainable, 
long term decisions.
Strategy, framework and materiality 
We believe that positive actions with respect 
to CR are not only desirable in their own  
right but are also of potential economic and 
commercial benefit to the Group. A strong 
reputation for CR can provide business 
advantage and contribute to shareholder 
value. Conversely, perceived weakness in  
CR may damage our reputation and cause 
risks. Bunzl’s good practice in sustainability 
has been recognised by its FTSE4Good 
listing and CDP score. Details of our strategy 
and framework in relation to CR can be found 
on the Bunzl plc website in the Responsibility 
section at www.bunzl.com.
Where it has been shown to be 
cost-effective, we have installed 
energy efficient lighting, making 
use of technical advancements 
available which reduces our 
energy consumption.
We continue to increase waste 
segregation facilities and staff 
are encouraged to work towards 
zero waste to landfill both in 
warehouses and offices. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 41
Strategic report | Corporate responsibility
Materiality
Understanding our material issues is 
important to enable us to manage our  
CR related impacts and stakeholder 
relationships effectively. It also helps to 
focus our resources, engagement and 
reporting activities by addressing those 
issues most material to our business.  
Our current areas of focus are:
• business conduct/code of ethics:  
training to ensure everyone understands 
our standards;
• employees: engaging through clear 
communication using a variety of channels, 
as well as provision of training and 
development opportunities;
• health & safety: improving safety in our 
warehouses and on our vehicles and 
ensuring that everyone takes personal 
responsibility for this;
• environment/climate change: reducing  
our and our customers’ impacts on the 
environment by reducing carbon emissions 
and promoting the reduction of waste and 
providing innovative products to meet our 
customers’ needs, for example 
environmentally friendly packaging; 
• community: providing support by 
encouraging employee fundraising, 
donating to charitable projects that  
benefit our employees and the 
communities we work in and by donating 
stock and cash to charitable organisations 
and good causes; and
• suppliers: responsible sourcing,  
working as partners with our suppliers  
to encourage high levels of CR and ethical 
trading initiatives.
These issues are governed by a policy 
framework, which is approved and monitored 
by the Board, with implementation at a 
business area level.
Business conduct/code of ethics
The Group’s business conduct/code of ethics 
policy is disseminated to every employee as a 
guide to how employees are expected to 
conduct themselves both from a corporate 
and individual perspective. The policy clearly 
states that employees should avoid conflicts 
of interest, provides guidance on the giving 
and receiving of gifts and entertainment, 
prohibits illegal payments as well as political 
donations and reinforces the need to comply 
with laws, rules and regulations, protect 
confidential information and company assets 
and maintain high standards in relationships 
with our customers and suppliers. 
No material breaches of our business 
conduct/code of ethics policy were recorded 
in 2015. However, some minor incidents 
relating to employee conduct, such as theft 
or misuse of the Group’s property, did occur 
and were dealt with during the normal 
course of business using Group human 
resources (‘HR’) policies and procedures.  
17 (2014: nine) calls/letters were received 
through our confidential whistle blowing 
process, ‘Speak Up’, none of which raised  
any issues of material concern.
During 2015, all directors, managers, sales 
representatives and purchasing staff once 
again undertook all of the CR e-learning 
modules which had been developed and 
enhanced since their original launch. There 
are now a total of 11 modules which provide 
an overview of the business conduct/code of 
ethics policy and anti-bribery issues such as 
facilitation payments and gifts and 
entertainment, and include two new modules 
on competition law and cybersecurity. In 
addition we refreshed the posters which are 
displayed in all our locations to advertise our 
whistle blowing process – ‘Speak Up’.
Sustainable business 
practice is important to  
Bunzl and we continue to 
refine our processes and 
operations to ensure  
ongoing improvements in this 
area. Our ability to measure 
the improvement in our 
performance relies on the 
availability of high quality 
data for our key indicators.

Employees
Bunzl currently operates in 29 countries 
worldwide. We are a service provider, not  
a manufacturer and, as such, our business 
relies heavily on the skills and experience  
of our employees. We pride ourselves on  
the fact that we run our businesses locally  
with local managers. We do not unfairly 
discriminate and we respect human rights. 
We seek to recruit the right people who are 
passionate about our business and to provide 
opportunities for people to progress within 
the organisation on the basis of their skills, 
experience and aptitude. We believe that  
to get the best from people we need to 
respect each other and encourage honest, 
straightforward communication. Our 
acquisition pipeline continues to be a 
valuable source of management talent for 
the Group and the completion of a number  
of acquisitions during the year has brought 
further highly skilled people into Bunzl. 
Details of the Group’s workforce diversity  
at 31 December 2015 are set out in the  
charts opposite.
Human rights
Bunzl adheres to the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights (‘UDHR’) and upholds the 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work 
policies, defined by the International Labour 
Organization, as well as local laws. The 
majority of countries in which Bunzl operates 
have their own laws banning child and forced 
labour and promoting human rights. We 
monitor the age of our workforce across the 
world to ensure compliance and identify any 
potential succession issues. In the US some 
of our operations, particularly in the north 
east, are represented by trade unions with 
which we have negotiated pay contracts. 
Bunzl does not restrict any of its employees 
in any of the countries in which it operates 
from joining a trade union if they wish to  
do so. We also work closely with our 
suppliers to ensure that they at least  
meet internationally recognised minimum 
requirements for workers’ welfare and 
conditions of employment, as defined by  
the International Labour Organization or  
the Ethical Trading Initiative, and do not  
use any forced labour.

Strategic report | Corporate responsibility
Corporate responsibility continued
depends on leadership that promotes safe 
working practices and we have introduced 
a number of activities to demonstrate this. 
Bunzl has developed a Safety Guide for 
Managers based on Bunzl’s accident history, 
an app which can be accessed via tablets or 
mobile phones to assist senior managers 
in raising safety issues while visiting sites. 
Further, substantial investment was 
approved for our web-based accident 
reporting system in order to provide 
improved analysis and management reports. 
The Safety Observations Programme, 
mentioned in last year’s report, has been 
implemented in North America and UK & 
Ireland and is also being adopted in 
Continental Europe. Investment in additional 
Environment, Health & Safety management 
resource has occurred in Continental Europe 
which has resulted in safety improvement 
programmes being implemented in each 
company based on self-assessment. North 
America has launched Safety Call to Action, 
a communication programme led by Division 
Presidents to enhance safety behaviours  
of all staff. In addition, UK & Ireland has 
developed a series of bespoke safety  
posters with supporting Tool-box Talks.  
In Australasia the Safety Walk programme is 
aimed at promoting a safe working culture by 
demonstrating the engagement of business 
leaders. The programme involves senior 
managers visiting sites and talking with 
individual employees about safety related 
matters that affect their particular site. 
The Bunzl Risk Management Committee, 
which reviews Group safety performance 
on a quarterly basis, will focus on this issue 
going forward. Details of our performance 
from 2012 to 2015 are provided in the bar 
charts below. The accident data provided is 
for the whole Group including acquisitions 
made during the relevant reporting period.
Environment/ 
climate change
We seek to minimise the contribution of 
Bunzl operations to climate change and to 
prevent other harmful effects of Bunzl’s 
operations on the environment. Our facilities 
operate worldwide to Group standards and 
we promote environmental awareness 
throughout the business. Our branch 
network serves to minimise the effects  
of extreme local climate conditions. Bunzl 
had no significant environmental incidents  
in 2015.
Direct water usage is not a significant 
environmental impact for our business as  
it is principally confined to staff hygiene and 
workplace cleaning purposes. We continue  
to measure water across a sample of our 
sites worldwide and our usage per employee 
is largely unchanged. As we do not 
manufacture any of the goods we sell, water 
discharges, apart from internal sanitation, 
are limited to rainwater run-off from the 
yards of Group locations where the water  
is treated by interceptors in accordance  
with local legislation.
Our reported environmental data includes  
all businesses that are subsidiaries of the 
Group for financial reporting purposes,  
with the exception of those recent 
acquisitions where there has been 
insufficient opportunity for the businesses  
to adopt our reporting guidelines, in which 
case the revenue from the businesses is  
not included when calculating the indexed 
emissions. We integrate our environmental 
reporting with our financial reporting 
through the annual budget review. 
Businesses provide commentary on their 
environmental performance and set targets 
for the following year. Environmental data  
is reviewed and agreed by the relevant  
Finance Directors. 
The EU Energy Efficiency Directive came 
into effect during 2015. UK & Ireland 
appointed Lead Assessors in May 2015 and 
the Company’s submission was completed 
ahead of the deadline. Recommendations 
for energy reductions are currently under 
review and the findings will be shared 
across the Group through the Bunzl Risk 
Management Committee. We have completed 
a review of the businesses in Continental 
Europe within the scope of the Directive 
and plans are in place to comply with the 
Health & safety
Health and safety remains a priority for 
Bunzl and it is our aim that no employee or 
other person should be injured as a result of 
our operations. Incidents relating to manual 
handling, slipping and tripping and impact 
with equipment/objects remain the highest 
causes of accidents and days lost. Together 
these three hazards represent 90% of 
incidents and 82% of days lost. Regretfully  
in the 2015 reporting period there were two 
fatalities (2014: two) both resulting from 
impact with Bunzl vehicles. One incident 
involved the death of a delivery driver who 
was struck by a reversing vehicle on Bunzl 
premises and the other was the death of a 
third party whose vehicle was in collision 
with an overturned Bunzl trailer. We continue 
to invest in premises and equipment to 
improve the safety of our employees and 
others. The majority of the vehicles in our 
commercial fleet already have on-board 
telematics that enable us to improve  
safety. We are currently piloting the use of 
telematics in France Hygiene’s commercial 
fleet which is the largest fleet in Continental 
Europe. Following a successful pilot study, 
UK & Ireland is fitting its commercial fleet 
with cameras and audible turn left and 
reversing warnings with audible/visual side 
sensors. It is expected that the fitting of such 
devices will significantly improve safety and 
reduce vehicle damage.
Many of the incidents we experience  
result from human error and/or failure to 
implement identified safe working practices. 
We recognise that world-class safety 
Incidence and severity rates for previous years have been restated to address inconsistencies in the definition of 
employee numbers. The number of time lost accidents and days lost are unchanged from those previously reported.

requirements of the relevant legislation  
in each country. A number of locations in  
UK & Ireland, Australasia and Continental 
Europe renewed their ISO 14001 
accreditation. Currently, measured by 
revenue, approximately 27% of the Group’s 
operations are ISO 14001 accredited.
All acquisitions made prior to the 2015 
reporting year are now providing 
environmental data. Revenue relating  
to more recent acquisitions which are not  
yet reporting emissions is excluded. The 
reported data covers around 98% of the 
Group by revenue. 
Scope 1: Fuel for transportation remains  
our highest source of CO
2
e emissions 
contributing c. 84% of Scope 1 and 61% of 
combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Of those 
emissions relating to transportation, more 
than 75% are generated by our fleet of 
commercial vehicles. We continually review 
the performance of the fleet as part of our 
operational efficiency strategy. This includes 
regular replacement and maintenance  
of vehicles, mapping of customers against 
the branch network and optimising routing, 
the use of vehicle telematics and driver 
training programmes. At Group level  
diesel consumed by our commercial fleet 
decreased by c. 1%. Reductions in UK & 
Ireland and Australasia were partially offset 
by slight increases in North America and 
Continental Europe where fleet sizes have 
increased due to a combination of acquisition 
and organic growth. We have considered the 
use of bio fuels in UK & Ireland but it is not 
currently viable due to the requirement to 
install on-site fuel tanks and concerns about 
compatibility with Euro 6 engines. France 
Hygiene, which operates the largest 
commercial fleet in Continental Europe, is 
piloting the use of vehicle telematics which 
can encourage more fuel efficient driving. 
Fuel consumption in Latin America has 
increased by 18% as a result of acquisitions. 
Consumption of gas during the year fell  
by 5% as slight increases in UK & Ireland  
and Continental Europe, due primarily  
to acquisitions, were more than offset  
by reductions in North America because  
of the less harsh winter weather compared 
with 2014. 
Scope 2: As a result of our ongoing 
acquisition programme and extensions  
to existing sites and operating hours to 
service growth within the business, units of 
electricity consumed across the Group have 
increased. North America has seen a 9% 
increase in electricity consumption resulting 
from a combination of extensions to a 
number of sites, longer operating hours and 
the purchase of new materials handling 
equipment to reduce manual handling risks. 
In Australasia, Bunzl Industrial Services 
(‘BIS’) has reported for the first time. BIS is 
made up of a number of smaller sites which 
is less energy efficient, and accounted for 
34% of electricity consumed in Australasia 
during the year. Despite some lighting 
renewal projects in Continental Europe, both 
Continental Europe and Latin America have 
increased consumption due to the effect of 
acquisitions, together with some increases 
in the number or size of sites to provide 
extra capacity. In UK & Ireland there was 
a reduction in consumption as a result 
of site consolidations and some lighting 
improvement programmes in office areas. 
Lighting is our highest area of electricity 
consumption and we continue to review the 
return on investment on low energy lighting 
at all our sites worldwide as the technology 
progresses and continues to improve the 
efficiency of such lighting.
Scope 3: We have for the first time provided 
information on our Scope 3 emissions 
comprising emissions from third party 
carriers, business flights, waste and 
electricity transmission losses. We are 
aware that there is still work to be done  
to refine the data which is provided for 
transparency of our emissions, particularly 
in relation to the distribution of products.  
The majority of the businesses which have 
been acquired since 2010 do not have their 
own fleet. In addition all our businesses, 
irrespective of whether they have their own 
fleet, will distribute a proportion of goods by 
third party carriers where it is more efficient 
and cost-effective to do so. The bar graph 
below shows that third party carriers 
produce the largest part of our Scope 3 
emissions. Bunzl is an international company 
with an active global acquisition programme 
and business flights are essential for the 
effective management and growth of our 
business. We increasingly use alternative 
means of communication such as video  
and telephone conferencing and flights  
are justified by business needs and subject  
to authorisation by senior management. 
Reduction and segregation of waste 
continues to be an area of focus and the  
data provided covers approximately 96%  
of the Group by revenue. Although we have 
included this in our Scope 3 calculation, we 
have for transparency continued to provide 
waste data separately as well. UK & Ireland 
has successfully launched initiatives in the 
hospitality and catering sector to improve 
recovery and recycling of waste generated  
by our customers, including disposable 
products that we have supplied, by 
partnering with our customers and waste 
management contractors who specialise  
in recycling.

Strategic report | Corporate responsibility
Corporate responsibility continued
To assist the business areas, we have our 
own quality assurance/quality control 
department based in Shanghai whose main 
aim is to perform regular audits of our 
suppliers in Asia to ensure that they meet 
international standards, as well as testing 
the factories’ production capabilities and 
their quality assurance and quality control 
systems. Employees’ terms and conditions of 
work, customer service capabilities, hygiene 
management systems and their policies and 
practices on environmental issues are also 
checked. Our policy is that all our suppliers 
meet internationally recognised minimum 
requirements for workers’ welfare and 
conditions of employment, as defined by the 
International Labour Organization or the 
Ethical Trading Initiative. During 2015 the 
team has continued to grow and has further 
refined its CR audit programme to categorise 
suppliers appropriately in relation to their 
standards and practices. 
Suppliers who are unable to meet all the 
requirements after an initial assessment/
audit are given the opportunity to comply 
fully within a period which is deemed 
appropriate for the circumstances. If a 
serious breach is identified following 
assessment, an action plan is documented 
and the supplier is expected to commit to 
addressing all the areas where 
discrepancies have been identified. The 
process of improvement via this method is 
principally reliant on the commitment of the 
supplier’s management team/owner/agent  
to ensure that all areas are addressed. If we 
have reason to believe that the supplier is  
not making sufficient or committed progress, 
this could lead to a suspension in the 
relationship until such time that we are 
confident that all areas are being 
satisfactorily addressed. Bunzl companies 
reserve the right to cease a relationship with 
a supplier if it is found that unacceptable 
practices are being employed at any sites 
used for producing or sourcing Bunzl 
products. Such practices include use of child 
labour, forced or bonded labour as well as 
physical abuse or discipline and intimidation, 
illegal discrimination, wages not meeting 
local minimum requirements and not 
providing adequate days of rest. Since 2015, 
in order to enhance the processes further, 
any suppliers that are being monitored and 
assessed due to identification of a serious 
breach are now reported to and reviewed  
by the Board.
We continue to liaise with suppliers and 
have refined and introduced a process  
to ensure that any paper or wood based 
products are manufactured from sustainable 
sources in compliance with the relevant 
timber regulations.
Suppliers
Price is only one factor in our purchasing 
decisions and matters such as quality, 
availability, our customers’ preferences and 
our policies are also taken into account. The 
vast majority of our products are sourced 
locally by our businesses but many products 
are sourced elsewhere if it is appropriate to 
do so. In 2015 less than 20% of our products 
were sourced from lower cost countries. 
Each business area is responsible for 
implementing appropriate processes to 
assess key suppliers’ compliance with the 
relevant CR standards and to monitor 
performance and improvements against 
such standards. Bunzl focuses on its key 
suppliers to ensure that they meet the same 
CR standards we have set for ourselves. We 
periodically write to those suppliers that 
provide us with 50% of our products by value 
to update them on our CR aspirations and to 
encourage them to adopt a similar approach.
We continue to support our employees  
in their charitable fundraising, for example  
a cycle challenge raising money for  
Northern Ireland Hospice, as well as 
supporting projects for healthcare and 
environmental charities, such as sponsoring 
Kew Gardens’ Millennium Seed Bank field 
trips to the Atacama Desert in Chile to 
collect seeds from rare plants flowering  
due to unusual weather conditions. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 47
Strategic report | Corporate responsibility
External assurance
We engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(‘PwC’) to undertake a limited assurance 
engagement, reporting to Bunzl plc only, 
using International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (‘ISAE’) 3000 (Revised): 
‘Assurance Engagements Other Than 
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information’ and ISAE 3410: ‘Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas 
Statements’ over the three KPIs on page 15 
and the data on pages 44 and 45, in each 
case that has been highlighted with the 
symbol ‘†’. They have provided an unqualified 
opinion in relation to the relevant KPIs and 
data and their full assurance opinion is also 
available in the Responsibility section of our 
website, www.bunzl.com.
A limited assurance engagement is 
substantially less in scope than a reasonable 
assurance engagement in relation to both 
the risk assessment procedures, including 
an understanding of internal control, and  
the procedures performed in response  
to the assessed risks. In order to reach  
their opinion, PwC performed a range of 
procedures including making enquiries of 
relevant Bunzl management, and evaluating 
the design of the key structures, systems, 
processes and controls for managing, 
recording and reporting the selected 
information. This included analysing and 
testing over three sites selected on the basis 
of their inherent risk and materiality to the 
Group, to understand the key processes  
and controls for reporting site performance 
data and to obtain supporting information. 
Finally PwC performed limited substantive 
testing on a selective basis of the selected 
information in relation to one site in Bunzl UK 
& Ireland and multiple sites across Bunzl 
North America to check that data had been 
appropriately measured, included, collated 
and reported.
Non-financial performance information, 
including greenhouse gas quantification in 
particular, is subject to more inherent 
limitations than financial information. It is 
important to read the selected corporate 
responsibility information contained in this 
Annual Report in the context of PwC’s full 
limited assurance opinion and the Company’s 
Corporate Responsibility Performance 
Reporting Guidelines which are also 
available in the Responsibility section  
of our website.
Community
Although Bunzl’s operations are 
international, our strength is in the local 
nature of our businesses. In keeping with  
this ethos, we particularly support the 
fundraising activities championed by our 
employees locally. This is supplemented  
by donations made at Group level to charities 
predominantly in the fields of healthcare  
and the environment to support projects 
often in the communities where our 
operations are based. Where possible and 
appropriate, Bunzl also looks to donate stock 
free of charge (‘in-kind’). Group wide, Bunzl 
donated a total of £631,000 to charitable 
causes during 2015 (2014: £572,000). This 
does not include in-kind donations or 
employee fundraising. 
For more information on all of Bunzl’s  
CR policies and activities please visit  
the Responsibility section of our  
website, www.bunzl.com.
 Risk Mitigating factors
CR compliance failures
Lack of adherence to the Group’s CR policies could result in a variety  
of issues including those relating to inappropriate business practices, 
accidents at work and increased levies due to levels of waste or  
carbon emissions.
The Group has comprehensive CR policies and procedures (including those 
relating to anti-bribery and corruption) in place throughout the business as 
well as an established reporting framework. Regular training in all areas  
of CR takes place using our suite of e-training modules.
Loss of key employees
The Group is not capital intensive but the business is based on strong 
customer and supplier relationships which are built up locally. Stability  
of key relationship roles amongst the Group’s employees is therefore 
important.
The Group seeks to secure key staff with appropriate incentive packages, 
development opportunities and career progression. Voluntary staff 
turnover and sickness absence is measured on a monthly basis and 
employee age profiles are reviewed annually, which enables any issues  
to be identified and resolved.
Loss of operating facilities/unavailability of staff
Climate change may result in higher frequency of extreme weather 
conditions. This could result in some of the Group’s facilities being affected 
or employees being unable to attend for work.
The Group has multi-site facilities with products stocked in more than one 
location, as a result of which the Group usually has the ability to distribute 
products from nearby facilities. Business continuity plans are in place to 
minimise the impact of any such issues.
Suppliers’ non-compliance with good CR practices
The Group is not a manufacturer and has many international suppliers 
across the world. The failure of one of the Group’s key suppliers to adhere 
to recognised CR standards could affect the Group’s reputation.
The Group’s key suppliers are principally publicly owned multinational 
organisations with high standards of operations. Suppliers are monitored 
by the Group’s purchasing departments and the quality assurance/quality 
control department based in China audits key suppliers throughout Asia. 
The top 50% of suppliers by value of Bunzl spend are made aware of the 
Group’s CR aspirations.
These risks are seen to be outweighed by a variety of opportunities that arise as a consequence of CR and its impact on the business 
environment as previously outlined in this report.
Risks
The Principal risks and uncertainties section on pages 36 to 38 details the principal risks and uncertainties which could have a material 
impact on the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Although many CR risks are not seen as principal risks to the 
Group, as part of the Group risk analysis a number of CR risks which could impact the Group’s business have been identified and these are 
set out below together with the steps taken by management to mitigate such risks. 48 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

Corporate governance report
Chairman’s introduction
As a Board we are committed to maintaining 
the highest standards of corporate 
governance and one of my key responsibilities 
as Chairman is to ensure that we continue  
to do so. Bunzl’s corporate governance 
framework is designed to facilitate effective, 
entrepreneurial and prudent management 
that can safeguard shareholders’ and other 
stakeholders’ interests while at the same 
time sustain the continued success of the 
Company over the longer term. 
One of the key aspects of good governance  
by any Board is to develop and maintain a 
comprehensive strategy and plan for future 
management succession. In this regard, with 
help from the Nomination Committee, we 
have undertaken an extensive search and 
selection process to identify Michael Roney’s 
successor as Chief Executive following 
Mike’s decision to retire from the Board after 
more than 10 years in the role. In January 
2016 we announced the appointment of Frank 
van Zanten, who is currently the Managing 
Director of our Continental Europe business 
area. Frank joined the Board on 1 February 
2016 and will succeed Mike as Chief 
Executive following the conclusion of the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on  
20 April 2016.
In September 2014 the Financial Reporting 
Council published the latest edition of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’), a 
copy of which is available at www.frc.org.uk. 
This contains broad principles together  
with more specific provisions which set  
out standards of good practice in relation  
to Board leadership and effectiveness, 
accountability, remuneration and relations 
with shareholders. The new version of the 
Code incorporates a number of changes to 
the previous edition including amendments 
to the principles and provisions relating  
to directors’ remuneration and risk 
management and internal control. It has  
also introduced a new requirement for 
Boards to make an annual viability 
statement. The report that follows provides 
an overview of the work undertaken by the 
Board and its Committees in fulfilling our 
governance responsibilities and describes 
how the principles of the Code have been 
applied by the Company during the year 
ended 31 December 2015.
Philip Rogerson
Chairman
29 February 2016
Compliance statement
It is the Board’s view that for the year ended 
31 December 2015 the Company has been 
fully compliant with all of the relevant 
provisions set out in the Code applicable  
to this reporting period. The Company’s 
auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,  
are required to review whether this 
statement reflects the Company’s 
compliance with those provisions of the  
Code specified for their review by the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority  
and to report if it does not reflect such 
compliance. No such report has been made. 
Board composition
As at 31 December 2015, the Board was 
made up of nine members comprising a 
Chairman, a Chief Executive, two other 
executive directors and five non-executive 
directors. As at the date of this report the 
Board was made up of 10 members following 
the appointment of Frank van Zanten as a 
director with effect from 1 February 2016. 
Michael Roney, who has been Chief Executive 
since 2005 having previously joined the 
Board as a non-executive director in 2003, 
will retire from the Board following the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting on 20 
April 2016. Brief biographical details of the 
directors are given on pages 48 and 49. None 
of the Company’s non-executive directors 
had any previous connection with the 
Company or its executive directors on 
appointment to the Board and all of them are 
considered by both the Board and the criteria 
set out in the Code to be independent. The 
Chairman and each of the non-executive 
directors have a breadth of strategic, 
management and financial experience gained 
in each of their own fields in a range of 
multinational businesses. In accordance with 
the terms of the Code each of the directors, 
with the exception of Michael Roney who 
retires at the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting, will be subject to re-
election at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting.
The role of the Board
To ensure directors maintain overall control 
over strategic, financial and operational  
and compliance issues, the Board meets 
regularly throughout the year and has 
formally adopted a schedule of matters 
which are required to be brought to it for 
decision. Key aspects of the Board’s  
role include:
• setting the Group’s strategic aims and 
ensuring that the Company has the 
necessary capabilities to deliver the 
Group’s strategy;
• reviewing the Group’s operating 
performance and approving the Group’s 
financial results;
• reviewing and approving larger capital 
expenditure and acquisition/divestment 
proposals and material increases in 
borrowing and loan facilities; and
• overseeing the Group’s risk management 
and internal controls processes and 
procedures.
There is a clear division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive which is set out in writing and has 
been agreed by the Board and encompasses 
the following parameters:
• the primary job of the Chairman is to be 
responsible for the leadership of the Board 
and ensuring its effectiveness in all 
aspects of its role while the Chief 
Executive is responsible for the leadership 
and the operational and performance 
management of the Company within the 
strategy agreed by the Board.
• the Chairman is viewed by investors  
as the ultimate steward of the business 
and the guardian of the interests of all  
the shareholders. 
• the Chairman:
 − takes overall responsibility for the 
composition and capability of the Board 
and its Committees;
 − consults regularly with the Chief 
Executive and is available on a flexible 
basis to provide advice, counsel and 
support to the Chief Executive; and 
 − ensures corporate governance is 
conducted in accordance with current 
best practice, as appropriate to  
the Group.
• the Chief Executive:
 − manages the executive directors and the 
Group’s management and day-to-day 
activities;
 − prepares and presents to the Board the 
strategy for growth in shareholder value;
 − sets the operating plans and budgets 
required to deliver the agreed strategy;
 − ensures that the Group has in place 
appropriate risk management and 
control mechanisms; and
 − communicates with the Company’s 
shareholders and analysts on a day-to-
day basis as necessary (subject to an 
overview of such matters by the 
Chairman). Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 51
Directors’ report | Corporate governance report
The Chief Executive is also the designated 
member of the Board responsible for 
environmental, social and governance 
matters and reports to the Board in relation 
to such matters.
David Sleath is currently the senior 
independent director and is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which 
contact through the normal channels of 
Chairman, Chief Executive or Finance 
Director has failed to resolve or for which 
such contact is inappropriate. He is also 
available to the other directors should they 
have any concerns which are not appropriate 
to raise with the Chairman or which have not 
been satisfactorily resolved by the Chairman.
The non-executive directors play a key role in 
corporate governance and accountability 
through both their attendance at Board 
meetings and their membership of the 
various Board Committees. The non-
executive directors bring a broad and diverse 
range of business and financial expertise and 
experience to the Board which complements 
and supplements the experience of the 
executive directors. This enables them to 
evaluate information provided and 
constructively challenge management’s 
viewpoints, assumptions and performance.
The Board has appointed Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees, 
all of which comply with the provisions of the 
Code and play an important governance role 
through the detailed work they carry out to 
fulfil the responsibilities delegated to them. 
Briefing papers are prepared and circulated 
to Committee members in advance of each 
meeting and, in respect of the Audit 
Committee, made available to the other 
directors. Further information relating to  
the Board Committees is set out below.
Information and support
Board agendas are set by the Chairman in 
consultation with the Chief Executive and 
with the assistance of the Company 
Secretary, who maintains a rolling 
programme of items for discussion by the 
Board to ensure that all matters reserved  
for the Board and other key issues are 
considered at the appropriate time. The 
Board is supplied with full and timely 
information, including detailed financial 
information, to enable the directors to 
discharge their responsibilities. To enable 
informed decision making, briefing papers 
are prepared and circulated to directors 
approximately one week before the 
scheduled Board meeting. All directors  
have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary who is tasked with 
ensuring that Board procedures are 
complied with and the Board is fully briefed 
on relevant legislative, regulatory and 
corporate governance developments. 
Directors may also take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense where they judge this to be 
necessary in the furtherance of their  
duties to discharge their responsibilities  
as directors. 
The Board meets formally at least seven 
times a year and the Board calendar is 
planned to ensure that the directors discuss 
a wide range of topics throughout the year. 
Normally at least two Board meetings a year 
are held at or near Group locations in the UK 
and overseas where the directors have the 
opportunity to meet and interact with senior 
executives from different businesses within 
the Group’s portfolio as well as observe the 
operations in situ. During 2015 a number  
of the Group’s senior executives made 
presentations to the Board about a variety  
of different and diverse topics including 
reviews of potential acquisition opportunities, 
the post-acquisition performance of 
businesses acquired in prior years, the 
Group’s financing facilities and treasury 
policies, cybersecurity risks and controls, 
supplier audits carried out and health and 
safety performance metrics. 
In addition to regular Board meetings,  
the directors meet annually to review and 
discuss the Group’s overall strategy. As part 
of this process, presentations are made by 
the Chief Executive and the heads of each of 
the business areas together with the Director 
of Corporate Development. 
All new directors receive a tailored induction 
on joining the Board, including meetings  
with senior management and visits to  
some of the Group’s locations. They also 
receive a detailed information pack which 
includes details of directors’ duties and 
responsibilities, procedures for dealing 
in Bunzl’s shares and a number of other 
governance related issues. Directors  
are continually updated on the Group’s 
businesses and their markets and the 
changes to the competitive and regulatory 
environments in which they operate.
Training and development needs of the Board 
are kept under review and directors attend 
external courses where it is considered 
appropriate for them to do so.
Conflicts of interest
The directors are required to avoid situations 
where they have, or could have, a direct or 
indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly 
may conflict, with the Company’s interests. 
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, 
the Company’s Articles of Association allow 
the Board to authorise potential conflicts of 
interest that may arise and to impose such 
limits or conditions as it thinks fit.
Directors are required to give notice of any 
potential situational and/or transactional 
conflicts which are then considered by  
the Board and, if deemed appropriate, 
authorised accordingly. A director is not 
however permitted to participate in such 
considerations or to vote in relation to their 
own conflicts.
The Board has considered and authorised a 
number of potential situational conflicts all  
of which relate to the holding of external 
directorships and have been entered on  
the Company’s conflicts register. No actual 
conflicts have been identified during the year. 
The Board considers that these procedures 
operate effectively.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises all of the 
independent non-executive directors and  
is chaired by David Sleath who, as Chief 
Executive and formerly Group Finance 
Director of SEGRO plc and as a fellow of the 
ICAEW, is considered by the Board to have 
recent and relevant financial experience  
as required by the Code. While the other 
directors are not members of the 
Committee, they normally attend meetings of 
the Committee by invitation together with the 
Head of Internal Audit and representatives 
from the external auditors. The Secretary  
to the Committee is Paul Hussey, Company 
Secretary. Further details about the Audit 
Committee and the work undertaken by it 
during the year and prior to the publication of 
the Group’s results for 2015 are set out in the 
Audit Committee report on pages 56 to 59. 
Members’ attendance at the Committee 
meetings held during the year is set out in 
the table on page 52. The terms of reference 
of the Committee, which were reviewed 
during the year by both the Committee and 
the Board, are available on the Company’s 
website, www.bunzl.com.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises  
all of the independent non-executive 
directors and is currently chaired by Vanda 
Murray, who was appointed Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee in April 2015 upon 
Peter Johnson’s retirement. While neither 
the Chairman of the Company nor the Chief 
Executive are members of the Committee, 
they normally attend meetings by invitation 
except when the Committee is considering 
matters concerning themselves. The 
Secretary to the Committee is Celia Baxter, 
Director of Group Human Resources. Further 
details of the Remuneration Committee, the 
Company’s remuneration policy and how it is  52 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

remuneration report on pages 60 to 81. 
Members’ attendance at the Committee 
meetings held during the year is set out in 
the table below. The terms of reference of 
the Committee, which were reviewed by the 
Board during the year, are available on the 
Company’s website.
Nomination Committee 
Composition
The Nomination Committee comprises the 
Chairman of the Company, who chairs the 
Committee (unless the Committee is dealing 
with the matter of succession of the 
Chairman of the Company), the Chief 
Executive and all of the non-executive 
directors. In accordance with the provisions 
of the Code, the majority of the members are 
independent non-executive directors. The 
Secretary to the Committee is Paul Hussey, 
Company Secretary.
Role
The Committee’s principal role is to consider, 
and make recommendations to the Board 
concerning, the composition of the Board  
and its Committees including proposed 
appointees to the Board, whether to fill  
any vacancies that may arise or to change  
the number of Board members. It is the 
Committee’s role to ensure that the  
Board and its Committees maintain the 
appropriate balance of skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity to ensure their 
continued effectiveness. 
The Committee’s responsibilities include:
• reviewing the structure, size and composition 
(including the skills, knowledge, experience 
and diversity) of the Board and making 
recommendations to the Board with regard 
to any proposed changes;
• nominating, for the approval of the Board, 
appropriate individuals to fill Board 
vacancies as and when they arise having 
considered candidates with relevant 
experience from a wide range of 
backgrounds; and
• succession planning, taking into account 
the challenges and opportunities facing 
the Company and the background, skills 
and expertise that will be required on the 
Board in the future, and reviewing annually 
management succession planning 
processes in relation to the Company’s 
senior executives.
The Committee meets as necessary 
throughout the year to discharge its 
responsibilities. An external search 
consultancy which does not have any other 
connection with the Company is retained by 
the Company to assess potential candidates 
to be considered as prospective non-
executive directors and, when appropriate, 
executive directors. This process was 
adopted both in relation to the appointment 
of Vanda Murray as a non-executive director 
with effect from 1 February 2015 and of 
Frank van Zanten to succeed Michael Roney 
as Chief Executive with effect from 20 April 
2016. Details of the process followed in 
relation to Vanda Murray’s appointment are 
set out in the Corporate governance report 
included in the 2014 Annual Report and 
further information relating to Frank van 
Zanten’s appointment is set out below.
Activities
The Committee met on seven occasions 
during 2015. Members’ attendance at those 
meetings is set out in the table below.
As mentioned above, one of the Committee’s 
main responsibilities during the year related 
to the process of identifying and selecting a 
new Chief Executive to succeed Michael 
Roney upon his retirement as Chief Executive 
in April 2016. Having taken account of the 
challenges and opportunities facing the 
Company currently and in the future and 
after identifying the background, skills, 
knowledge and experience that will be 
required of the Chief Executive in the future, 
the Committee prepared and agreed a 
detailed specification for the role and 
appointed an external search consultancy, 
The Zygos Partnership, to assist them in the 
recruitment process. The Zygos Partnership 
does not provide any other services to, or 
have any connection with, the Company. In 
particular the Committee was keen to find a 
successful senior business executive with 
extensive management experience of an 
international distribution business. We 
carried out an extensive search and selection 
process overseen by a sub-committee of the 
Committee and a number of both internal 
and external candidates were considered.  
All members of the Committee had the 
opportunity to meet the shortlisted 
candidates following which the 
recommendation was made to the Board, 
which was subsequently unanimously 
approved, that Frank van Zanten be 
appointed as the Company’s new Chief 
Executive. He has extensive knowledge and 
experience of the Company’s business 
gained over many years and has a successful 
track record of implementing the Company’s 
long-standing strategy for developing and 
expanding the Group both organically and by 
acquisition. His appointment will provide 
continuity for the business as well as its 
customers and employees going forward.
During the year the Committee also reviewed 
and took account of the balance of skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity of the 
Board, the time commitment expected of the 
non-executive directors and the conclusions 
of the formal evaluation process which  
was carried out when considering and 
recommending the nomination of directors 
for re-election at the 2016 Annual General 
Meeting. In particular the Committee 
reviewed the performance of David Sleath, 
who was appointed to the Board in 
September 2007. The Committee believes 
that he continues to be effective and to 
demonstrate strong independence in

1 February 2016 and will become Chief Executive following Michael Roney’s retirement on 20 April 2016. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 53
Directors’ report | Corporate governance report
character and judgement in the manner in 
which he discharges his responsibilities as  
a director. Consequently the Committee is 
satisfied that, despite his length of tenure,  
he remains independent. 
The Chief Executive presented his annual 
management succession plan to the 
Committee. The Company recognises that 
having the right directors and senior 
management is crucial for the Group’s 
success and it is a key task of the Committee 
to ensure that the Company has a robust and 
continuous succession planning process over 
both the medium to long term to ensure that 
there is the right mix and skills available as 
the Company evolves. 
As part of the review of the composition of 
the Board and the succession planning 
process, both the Board and the Committee 
recognise the importance of gender diversity 
throughout the Group. As at the date of this 
report, two of the 10 Board members 
(moving to two of the nine Board members 
following Michael Roney’s retirement in  
April 2016) and one of the five Executive 
Committee members are female. The 
Committee aims to have a Board with a 
broad range of skills, backgrounds, 
experience and diversity and, while the 
Committee will continue to follow a policy of 
ensuring that the best people are appointed 
for the relevant roles, the Committee 
recognises the benefits of greater diversity 
and will continue to take account of this when 
considering any particular appointment. 
However, the primary responsibility of the 
Committee in selecting and recommending 
candidates to the Board when making new 
appointments is to ensure the strength of the 
Board’s composition and the overriding aim 
is to always select and recommend the  
best candidate for the position. Further 
information about the Company’s workforce 
diversity is set out on page 43.
The terms of reference of the Committee, 
which have recently been reviewed and 
amended by the Board, are set out on the 
Company’s website. 
Performance evaluation
The Company has a formal performance 
evaluation process for the Board, its 
Committees and individual directors 
overseen by the Chairman. This includes 
individual discussions between the Chairman 
and each director when their individual 
training and development needs are 
reviewed. Led by the senior independent 
director, the non-executive directors also 
meet without the Chairman present at least 
annually to appraise the Chairman’s 
performance including a review of his other 
commitments to ensure that he is able to 
allocate sufficient time to the Company to 
discharge his responsibilities effectively. The 
Chairman also periodically holds meetings 
with the non-executive directors without the 
executive directors present. All of these 
processes were carried out satisfactorily 
during the year. 
In accordance with the requirements of the 
Code an external performance evaluation 
was first carried out in 2012 and the results 
were subsequently presented to the Board. 
The facilitator of the external evaluation, 
Lintstock, does not provide any other 
services to, or have any other connection 
with, the Company. Although the Code only 
requires that the evaluation of the Board and 
its Committees should be externally 
facilitated at least every three years, the 
Board has decided to appoint Lintstock to 
carry out an annual performance evaluation 
and accordingly external evaluations have 
been completed each year since 2012. By 
doing so, the Board is able to ensure that 
there is consistency and continuity in the 
evaluation process and the presentation of 
the results from one year to the next. 
Following the evaluation which was carried 
out in 2015, the Board once again identified a 
number of key priorities in order to improve 
the Board’s performance, including:
• continuing to focus on the key strategic 
issues facing the Group both as part of the 
Board’s annual strategy review and at 
other times of the year as appropriate;
• ensuring the smooth succession of the new 
Chief Executive, providing the appropriate 
level of support as necessary;
• continuing the focus of the Nomination 
Committee on the management 
succession plans for the Group, including 
in particular maintaining the Board’s 
exposure to the Group’s senior 
management below Board level; and 
• maintaining the focus on both the 
opportunities and threats presented by 
future developments in technology and 
digital marketing activities and how these 
might best be developed in order to ensure 
the continuing success of the Group.
As a result of the overall performance 
evaluation process carried out in 2015,  
the Board concluded that both it and its 
Committees are operating effectively. 
Financial and business reporting
The responsibilities of the directors in 
respect of the preparation of the Group and 
parent company financial statements are set 
out on page 133 and the auditors’ report on 
pages 134 to 139 includes a statement by the 
external auditors about their reporting 
responsibilities. As set out on page 91,  
the directors are of the opinion that it  
is appropriate to continue to adopt the  
going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. 
The process of preparing the Annual Report 
has included the following:
• comprehensive reviews undertaken at 
different levels in the Group in order to 
ensure the accuracy, consistency and 
overall balance of the Annual Report; and
• procedures to verify the factual accuracy 
of the Annual Report.
From the information and assurance 
provided by the ongoing work of the internal 
audit department, the reviews conducted by 
the external auditors in relation to both the 
half year and full year results, the Board’s 
understanding of the Group’s business and 
the information provided by the senior 
executive management team, the Board 
considers that the Annual Report, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model 
and strategy.
Risk management and internal 
control
The directors acknowledge that they have 
overall responsibility for identifying, 
evaluating, managing and mitigating the 
principal risks faced by the Group and for 
monitoring the Group’s risk management 
and internal control systems. However, such 
systems are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. In 
accordance with Principle C.2 of the Code 
and the related guidance, the Company has 
established the procedures necessary to 
ensure that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating, managing and 
mitigating the principal risks faced by the 
Group and for determining the nature and 
extent of the principal risks it is willing to 
take to achieve its strategic objectives.  
The directors confirm that such procedures 
have been in place for the year ended 
31 December 2015 and up to the date of 
approval of these financial statements and 
that the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems have been 
monitored during the year. 54 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ report | Corporate governance report
Corporate governance report continued
A summary of the principal control 
structures and processes in place across  
the Group is set out below and further 
information relating to how the directors 
maintain overall control over all significant 
strategic, financial, operational and 
compliance issues is set out in the ‘Role of 
the Board’ section on page 50.
The Board has delegated to an Executive 
Committee, consisting of the Chief Executive, 
Finance Director and other functional 
managers, the initial responsibility for 
identifying, evaluating, managing and 
mitigating the risks facing the Group and for 
deciding how these are best managed and  
to establish a system of internal control 
appropriate to the business environments  
in which the Group operates. The principal 
features of this system include:
• a procedure for monitoring the 
effectiveness of the internal control 
system through a tiered management 
structure with clearly defined lines of 
responsibility and delegation of authority;
• clearly defined authorisation procedures 
for capital investment and acquisitions;
• strategic plans and comprehensive 
budgets which are prepared annually by 
the business areas and approved by the 
Board;
• formal standards of business conduct 
(including a code of ethics and whistle 
blowing procedure) based on honesty, 
integrity, fair dealing and compliance with 
the local laws and regulations of the 
countries in which the Group operates;
• a well-established consolidation and 
reporting system for the statutory 
accounts and monthly management 
accounts;
• continual investment in IT systems to 
ensure the production of timely and 
accurate management information  
relating to the operation of the Group’s 
businesses; and
• detailed manuals covering Group 
accounting policies and policies and 
procedures for the Group’s treasury 
operations supplemented by internal 
control procedures at a business  
area level.
Some of the procedures carried out in order 
to monitor the effectiveness of the internal 
control system and to identify, manage and 
mitigate business risk are listed below:
• central management holds regular 
meetings with business area management 
to discuss strategic, operational and 
financial issues including a review of the 
principal risks affecting each of the 
business areas and the policies and 
procedures by which these risks are 
managed; 
• the Executive Committee meets twice  
per month and also reviews the outcome  
of the discussions held at business area 
meetings on internal control and risk 
management issues;
• the Board in turn reviews the outcome of 
the Executive Committee discussions on 
internal control and risk management 
issues which ensures a documented and 
auditable trail of accountability;
• each business area, the Executive 
Committee and the Board carry out an 
annual fraud risk assessment;
• actual results are reviewed monthly 
against budget, forecasts and the previous 
year and explanations obtained for all 
significant variances;
• all treasury activities, including in relation 
to the management of foreign exchange 
exposures and Group borrowings, are 
reported and reviewed monthly;
• the Group’s bank balances around the 
world are monitored on a weekly basis  
and significant movements are reviewed 
centrally;
• the internal audit department periodically 
reviews individual businesses and 
procedures, makes recommendations to 
improve controls and follows up to ensure 
that management implements the 
recommendations made. The internal audit 
department’s work is determined on a risk 
assessment basis and their findings are 
reported to Group and business area 
management as well as to the Audit 
Committee and the external auditors;
• an annual self-assessment of the status  
of internal controls measured against a 
prescribed list of minimum standards is 
performed by every business and action 
plans are agreed where remedial action  
is required; 
• the Audit Committee, which comprises  
all of the independent non-executive 
directors of the Company, meets regularly 
throughout the year. Further details of the 
work of the Committee, which includes  
a review of the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal financial controls and 
the assurance procedures relating to the 
Company’s risk management system, are 
set out in the Audit Committee report on 
pages 56 to 59;
• regular meetings are held with insurance 
and risk advisers to assess the risks 
throughout the Group;
• a management committee, which oversees 
issues relating principally to environment, 
health & safety, insurance and business 
continuity planning matters, sets relevant 
policies and practices and monitors their 
implementation;
• risk assessments, safety audits and a 
regular review of progress against 
objectives established by each business 
area are periodically carried out; and
• developments in tax, treasury and 
accounting are continually monitored by 
Group management in association with 
external advisers.
The directors confirm that they have 
reviewed the effectiveness of the Company’s 
risk management and internal control 
systems in operation during 2015.
The external auditors are engaged to express 
an opinion on the financial statements. The 
audit includes a review and evaluation of the 
system of internal financial control and the 
data contained in the financial statements to 
the extent necessary for expressing an audit 
opinion on the truth and fairness of the 
financial statements.
Assessment of the prospects of the 
Company and its viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
Code, the directors set out below how  
they have assessed the prospects of the 
Company, over what period the prospects 
have been assessed and the Company’s 
formal viability statement. 
The context for and period over which  
the prospects of the Company have  
been assessed
To consider the prospects of the Company 
and determine an appropriate time frame  
for the purpose of making a statement  
on the Company’s longer term viability,  
the directors have taken into account  
various factors including the nature of the 
Company’s business, its business model  
and strategy and the existing planning 
periods. In particular: 
• Bunzl has a geographically balanced and 
diversified business portfolio operating in 
29 countries; 
• the Company operates across six core, 
fragmented market sectors, many of which 
are growing and resilient to challenging 
economic conditions; and Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 55
Directors’ report | Corporate governance report
• the business model and strategy minimise 
the volatility of the Company’s results, 
enabling Bunzl to deliver consistently good 
results with high returns on capital and 
operating cash flow conversion.
With regards to the time frame specifically, 
the directors considered the above factors  
as well as the Group’s strategic planning 
process. Comprehensive budgets are 
prepared annually by the business areas  
and approved by the Board. Strategic plans 
covering a period of two years beyond the 
forecast for the current year are also 
prepared annually and reviewed by the 
Board. While the directors have no reason to 
believe the Company will not be viable over a 
longer period, given the inherent uncertainty 
involved, the period over which the directors 
consider it possible to form a reasonable 
expectation as to the Group’s longer term 
viability is the three year period to 
31 December 2018.
How the prospects of the Company and its 
longer-term viability have been assessed
In making a viability statement, the directors 
are required to consider the Company’s 
ability to meet its liabilities in full as they  
fall due, taking into account the Company’s 
current position and principal risks. The 
Company has significant financial resources 
including committed and uncommitted 
banking facilities and US private placement 
notes, further details of which are set out  
in Note 13 to the consolidated financial 
statements. As a result, the directors believe 
that the Company is well placed to manage 
its business risks successfully. 
The resilience of the Group to a range of 
possible scenarios, in particular the impact 
on key financial ratios and its ongoing 
compliance with financial covenants, was 
factored into the directors’ considerations 
through stress testing current financial 
projections. These included the following: 
• an adverse but plausible deterioration in 
revenue and operating profit combined 
with the adverse impact of a number of 
acquisitions underperforming and a 
significant increase in working capital;
• the impact that the materialisation of the 
market, operational and tax related 
principal risks may have on the Company’s 
longer term viability, in particular on its 
financial liquidity and debt covenants  
risk, both with and without mitigating 
actions; and 
• a reverse stress test scenario which 
identified what would need to happen to 
cause the Company to fail, which for this 
purpose is taken to mean an unavoidable 
breach of financial covenants. The 
conditions required to create this situation 
were so severe that it was considered to  
be implausible.
In all scenarios it has been assumed, based 
on past experience and all current indicators, 
that the Company will be able to refinance  
its banking facilities and US private 
placement notes as and when they mature. 
The directors consider that the stress testing 
based assessment of the Company’s 
prospects, building on the results of the 
robust assessment of the principal risks to 
the business and the financial implications  
of them materialising, confirms the 
resilience of the Group to severe but 
plausible scenarios and provides a 
reasonable basis on which to conclude  
on its longer term viability. 
Confirmation of longer term viability 
Taking into account the Company’s current 
position and principal risks and the 
assessment performed of the prospects  
of the Company, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the three 
year period to 31 December 2018. 
Relations with shareholders
As required by the relevant law and 
regulations, the Company reports formally  
to shareholders twice a year with the half 
year results announced normally at the end 
of August and the annual results announced 
normally at the end of February. In addition 
the Company has published two trading 
statements during the year on a voluntary 
basis in order to keep the Company’s 
shareholders and the financial markets 
periodically updated on the Company’s 
trading performance outside of the 
regulatory announcements made in relation 
to the half year and annual results.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director 
have regular meetings with representatives 
of institutional shareholders and report to 
the Board the views of major shareholders. 
Additional forms of communication include 
presentations of the half year and annual 
results. The Chairman and the senior 
independent director and the other non-
executive directors are available to meet 
with major shareholders on request.  
The Board also periodically reviews and 
discusses analysts’ and brokers’ reports and 
surveys of shareholder opinions conducted 
by the Company’s own brokers.
Notice of the Annual General Meeting is sent 
to shareholders at least 20 working days 
before the meeting. All shareholders are 
encouraged to participate in the Annual 
General Meeting, are invited to ask questions 
at the meeting and are given the opportunity 
to meet all of the directors informally. 
Shareholders unable to attend are 
encouraged to vote using the proxy card 
mailed to them or electronically as detailed 
in the Notice of Meeting. Shareholders are 
given the option to withhold their vote on the 
proxy form. As in previous years, at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting each  
of the resolutions put to the meeting will be 
taken on a poll rather than on a show of 
hands as directors believe that a poll is more 
representative of shareholders’ voting 
intentions because shareholder votes are 
counted according to the number of shares 
held and all votes tendered are taken into 
account. The results of the poll will be 
publicly announced and made available  
on the Company’s website as soon as 
practicable following the Annual  
General Meeting.

Audit Committee report
Statement from David Sleath, 
Chairman of the Audit Committee
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present our Audit Committee report for 2015, 
the purpose of which is to give shareholders 
an overview of the role of the Committee and 
to report on the work it has carried out 
during the past year.
The UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
‘Code’) issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council includes a number of provisions 
relating to the role and reporting 
requirements of audit committees and 
accordingly this report has been prepared  
in accordance with the relevant provisions  
of the revised 2014 edition of the Code  
which applied to the financial year ended 
31 December 2015.
Once again our activities continued to be 
focused on the integrity of the Company’s 
financial reporting and the related controls. 
The Committee has a clearly defined role in 
the corporate governance framework of 
listed companies and acts independently  
of management to ensure that the interests 
of our shareholders are properly protected 
through the Committee’s oversight of the 
Company’s financial management and 
reporting processes and procedures. There 
are a number of key aspects to this including 
the use of appropriate accounting policies 
and practices, supported by the 
implementation of a robust assurance 
framework in which the risk management 
and internal control systems, the internal 
and external audit functions and the regular 
internal reporting of the Company’s 
performance against budgets, forecasts and 
prior year results are all very important.  
In particular, this year the Committee has 
considered and approved the process by 
which the Board is able to meet its new 
responsibility under the terms of the Code  
in relation to the ‘viability statement’. This 
specifically requires the Board to assess the 
prospects of the Company over an agreed 
period of time and to state whether the Board 
has a reasonable expectation that the 
Company will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of the Board’s assessment. 
Further details of the viability statement, 
including how the appropriate period has 
been determined and the prospects of the 
Company have been assessed, are set out  
in the Corporate governance report on  
pages 54 and 55.
The significant accounting matters 
considered by the Committee in relation  
to the 2015 financial statements were the 
accounting for business combinations,  
the carrying value of goodwill and other 
intangible assets, taxation, defined benefit 
pension schemes, supplier rebates and 
provisions. These are discussed in detail in 
the report that follows and the Committee is 
satisfied that these matters have been 
properly recorded in the Company’s books 
and records and accounted for appropriately.
As a Committee we will continue to keep our 
activities under review to ensure that we are 
able to maintain high standards of financial 
governance in line with the regulatory 
framework and market practice for audit 
committees going forward.
Role
The Committee’s principal role is to ensure 
that the Company has effective governance 
over the Group’s financial reporting, 
including the adequacy of related 
disclosures, the performance of both the 
internal and external audit functions and  
the management of the Group’s systems of 
internal control, business risks and related 
compliance activities. In particular the 
Committee is responsible for:
• monitoring and reviewing the integrity  
of the financial statements of the Group 
and the significant financial reporting 
judgements contained in them;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal financial controls;
• reviewing the process for the management 
of risk and reviewing the assurance 
procedures over controls designed to 
manage key risks;
• overseeing the Company’s internal audit 
activities;
• making recommendations to the  
Board in relation to the appointment, 
re-appointment and removal of the 
external auditors; 
The Committee has a key role to play in overseeing the 
interests of shareholders by focusing on the integrity of our 
financial reporting and ensuring that the Company maintains 
clearly defined and established risk management and 
internal control processes and procedures.  Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 57
Directors’ report | Audit Committee report
• reviewing the appropriateness of the 
Company’s relationship with the external 
auditors, including monitoring the 
auditors’ independence and objectivity;
• agreeing the scope of, and the terms  
of engagement and fees for, the  
statutory audit; 
• initiating and supervising a competitive 
tender process for the external audit as 
may be required from time to time; and
• developing and implementing a policy on 
the engagement of the external auditors  
to supply non-audit services.
Pursuant to the terms of the Competition  
& Markets Authority Order, which was 
introduced with effect from 1 January 2015, 
the Committee is now solely responsible for 
negotiating and agreeing the external 
auditors’ fee, the scope of the statutory audit 
and initiating and supervising a competitive 
tender process for the external audit where  
it is appropriate to do so and to make 
recommendations to the Board as to the 
external auditors’ appointment pursuant  
to any such process. The Company has 
complied with the provisions of this Order for 
the 2015 financial year. The current version  
of the Committee’s terms of reference, which 
were reviewed by both the Committee and 
the Board in 2015, is available on the 
Company’s website, www.bunzl.com.
In the performance of its duties, the 
Committee has independent access to the 
services of the Company’s internal audit 
function and to the external auditors and  
may obtain outside professional advice as 
necessary. Both the Head of Internal Audit 
and the external auditors have direct access 
to me as the Chairman of the Committee and 
I held a number of meetings with each of 
them during the year outside formal 
Committee meetings.
Activities
As Chairman of the Committee, I hold 
preparatory discussions with the Company’s 
senior management, the Head of Internal 
Audit and the external auditors prior to 
Committee meetings to discuss the items  
to be considered at the Committee meetings. 
In addition, separate discussions are held 
between the Committee and the Head of 
Internal Audit and the external auditors 
without management present. I also attend 
the Annual General Meeting to respond to 
any shareholder questions that might be 
raised on the Committee’s activities. The 
Committee met on four occasions during  
the year and members’ attendance at those 
meetings is set out in the table on page 52. 
The Committee’s activities included:
• making recommendations to the Board 
concerning the re-appointment of the 
external auditors and approving the 
remuneration and terms of engagement  
of the auditors including the audit strategy 
and planning process for the current 
financial year; 
• receiving and considering reports from 
management and the external auditors in 
relation to the half yearly financial report 
and the annual financial statements;
• reviewing the half yearly financial report 
and the annual financial statements and 
the formal announcements relating 
thereto;
• receiving and considering reports from  
the Head of Internal Audit in relation to  
the work undertaken by the internal audit 
function and reviewing and approving the 
internal audit work programme for  
the year;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal financial controls and 
the assurance procedures relating to the 
Company’s risk management systems;
• reviewing the arrangements by which staff 
may, in confidence, raise concerns about 
possible improprieties in matters of 
financial reporting or other matters and 
receiving periodic reports relating to the 
matters raised through such 
arrangements;
• reviewing the Committee’s terms of 
reference;
• reviewing the Committee’s effectiveness 
following an externally facilitated 
performance evaluation;
• reviewing the effectiveness of both the 
external auditors and the internal audit 
function following completion of detailed 
questionnaires by both the Board and 
senior management within the Company;
• reviewing and approving the level and 
nature of non-audit work which the 
external auditors performed during the 
year, including the fees paid for such work; 
• reviewing the principal tax risks applicable 
to the Company and the steps taken to 
manage such risks; 
• as part of an ongoing programme to  
review specific areas relating to financial 
reporting matters within the Group’s 
businesses, receiving and considering a 
presentation about the finance function 
and control environment within the Group’s 
operations in both North America and 
Continental Europe; and 
• reviewing the process to be used in 
supporting the Board’s assessment of  
the Company’s longer term viability as 
required by a new provision of the Code. 
Following each Committee meeting, I report 
any significant findings to the Board and 
copies of the minutes of the Committee 
meetings are circulated to all of the directors 
and to the external auditors.
During the year the Financial Reporting 
Council’s Audit Quality Review team carried 
out a review of the external auditors’ audit 
files relating to the year ended 31 December 
2014, the results of which were subsequently 
discussed by the Committee with the 
external auditors. Although there were no 
significant findings to report, the Committee 
is satisfied that the appropriate follow-up 
actions identified in the review have now 
been addressed.
Financial statements and significant 
accounting matters
During the year and prior to the publication  
of the Group’s results for 2015, the Audit 
Committee reviewed the 2015 half yearly 
financial report and related news release, 
the 2015 Annual Report (including the 
financial statements), the 2015 annual 
results news release and the reports from 
the external auditors on the outcomes of 
their half year review and the audit relating  
to 2015. 
As part of its work, the Committee 
considered the following significant 
accounting issues in relation to the  
Group’s financial statements:
Accounting for business combinations
For business combinations, the Group has a 
long-standing process for the identification 
of the fair values of the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed including separate 
identification of intangible assets using 
external valuation specialists where 
required. The Committee reviewed this 
process and discussed with management 
and the external auditors the methodology 
and assumptions used to value the assets 
and liabilities of the acquisitions completed 
in 2015. The Committee concluded that it was 
satisfied with management’s valuations of 
these assets and liabilities, including the 
degree to which such valuations are 
supported by professional advice from 
external advisers. 58 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ report | Audit Committee report
Audit Committee report continued
The carrying value of goodwill and other 
intangible assets
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating  
units (‘CGUs’) and is tested annually for 
impairment. The Committee critically 
reviewed and discussed management’s 
report on the impairment testing of the 
carrying value of goodwill and other 
intangible assets of each CGU (including  
the sensitivity of the outcome of impairment 
testing to the use of different discount rates) 
and considered the external auditors’  
testing thereof. After due challenge and 
debate, the Committee concluded that  
it was satisfied with the assumptions and 
judgements applied in relation to such 
testing and agreed that there was no 
impairment to goodwill or other intangible 
assets. Details of the key assumptions and 
judgements used are set out in Note 9 to  
the consolidated financial statements.
Taxation
The Committee reviewed a report and 
received a presentation from the Head of Tax 
highlighting the principal tax risks that the 
Group faces, the tax strategy and a detailed 
risk assessment relating to the tax risks 
identified including the judgements 
underpinning the provisions for potential tax 
liabilities. The Committee also reviewed the 
results of the external auditors’ assessment 
of provisions for income taxes and, having 
done so, was satisfied with the key 
judgements made by management. 
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Committee considered reports from 
management and the external auditors in 
relation to the valuation of the defined benefit 
pension schemes and reviewed the key 
actuarial assumptions used in calculating 
the defined benefit pension liabilities, 
especially in relation to discount rates, 
inflation rates and mortality/life expectancy. 
The Committee discussed the reasons for 
the decrease in the net pension deficit and 
was satisfied that the assumptions used 
were appropriate and were supported by 
independent actuarial experts. Details of the 
key assumptions used are set out in Note 20 
to the consolidated financial statements.
In addition to the matters above, which  
are referred to in the Critical accounting 
judgements, estimates and assumptions 
section of Note 2 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Committee also considered 
the following, significant accounting issues  
in relation to the financial statements:
Supplier rebates
The Group has various rebate arrangements 
with a number of suppliers. Some of these 
arrangements are based on the volume of 
products purchased and others are based  
on the volume of products sold. The 
recognition of supplier rebate income from 
the arrangements based on the volume of 
products purchased may involve the 
requirement for some estimates to be made 
about whether certain conditions related to 
such rebate income have been, or will be, 
met. In reviewing the consolidated financial 
statements, the Committee considered a 
report from management in relation to the 
key financial controls over supplier rebates, 
the accounting treatment for each type of 
rebate, the value of the different types of 
rebates in the income statement for the year 
and the value of supplier rebate income 
receivables at the year end. The Committee 
discussed the findings of the external 
auditors in this area and discussed with 
management the supplier rebate accounting 
process. Having done so, the Committee 
concluded that it was satisfied with the 
Group’s supplier rebate accounting process 
for the year and with the value of rebate 
income recognised. 
Provisions
The Group holds a number of provisions 
relating to properties (including liabilities  
for onerous lease commitments, repairs  
and dilapidations) and actual and anticipated 
legal, environmental and other claims.  
The Committee reviewed reports from 
management and the external auditors 
concerning provisions with notable 
movements and those requiring a greater 
degree of judgement. The Committee 
considered the background to such 
provisions and discussed with management 
the judgements applied in determining their 
value. The Committee concluded that it was 
satisfied with the value of provisions carried.
External auditors’ independence 
and effectiveness
The Committee ensures that the external 
auditors remain independent of the Company 
and receives written confirmation from the 
external auditors as to whether they consider 
themselves independent within the meaning 
of their own internal and the relevant 
regulatory and professional requirements. 
Key members of the audit team rotate off  
the Company’s audit after a specific period  
of time.
In order to ensure that the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors is  
not compromised, the Committee has  
also pre-approved the non-audit service 
categories that can be provided by the 
external auditors and agreed monetary 
amounts for each service category that can 
be provided by them, subject to a maximum 
individual engagement value. Certain 
categories of services are prohibited under 
the ethical standards of the Accounting 
Practices Board. A permitted service 
requires specific authorisation from the 
Committee or myself as the Committee 
Chairman where it does not fall within the 
pre-approved categories or where its value 
exceeds the maximum pre-approved 
individual engagement value. Such non-audit 
service categories which are pre-approved 
principally comprise tax services and further 
assurance services relating to pre-
acquisition due diligence and other duties 
carried out in respect of acquisitions and 
disposals of businesses. It is the Company’s 
policy to assess the services required on a 
case-by-case basis to ensure that the most 
appropriate adviser is retained. As a result 
the Committee believes that it is sometimes 
appropriate for this additional work to be 
carried out by the Company’s auditors. 
However other firms are also used by the 
Company to provide non-audit services if 
such other firms are thought to be best 
placed to undertake the work involved. 
Details of the fees paid to the external 
auditors in 2015 in respect of the audit  
and for non-audit services are set out in  
Note 4 to the consolidated financial 
statements. The ratio of the fees relating to 
non-audit services to audit services in 2015 
was 18%.
Following the adoption of the EU Audit 
Directive and Regulation in 2014, the 
Financial Reporting Council has carried out 
two consultation exercises as to how it 
intends to implement the Directive and 
Regulation in the UK. It is expected that the 
final rules relating to such implementation 
will be published during the first half of 2016 
and that the changes will apply to listed 
companies for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 17 June 2016 (i.e. the 2017 
financial year in the case of the Company). 
The new rules will include regulations to 
determine what type of non-audit services 
may be provided by the auditors of a 
company, introduce a statutory cap on the 
level of non-audit fees which may be billed  
by the auditors and implement changes to 
the Code and accompanying guidance which 
will be of particular relevance to audit 
committees. As a result, as part of the 2016 
review of both its terms of reference and  
the Company’s policy for the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditors, 
the Committee will ensure that such terms  
of reference and policy are fully compliant 
with the new regulations.
During 2015 the Committee carried out a 
review of the effectiveness of the external 
audit process carried out in relation to the 
audit of the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2014. As part of this 
review, the Committee considered feedback  Directors’ report | Audit Committee report
Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 59
on the audit gathered through a detailed 
survey which was completed by each of the 
directors and members of the Company’s 
senior management team at both Group and 
business area levels. The survey covered  
a total of 24 different aspects of the audit 
process grouped under four separate 
headings; the robustness of the audit 
process, the quality of delivery, the quality  
of people and service and the quality of 
reporting. Each respondent was asked to 
award a rating on a scale of 1 to 5 for each 
aspect reviewed and to provide any additional 
comments they wished to make in relation to 
the questions raised. The Committee 
discussed the findings of the survey and their 
overall assessment of the work of the 
auditors. Having done so, the Committee 
confirmed that it was satisfied with the 
effectiveness of the external audit process. 
The Committee will carry out a similar 
effectiveness review in 2016 in relation to  
the audit of the financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2015.
Auditors’ re-appointment
In considering whether to recommend to the 
Board the appointment or re-appointment of 
the external auditors, the Committee takes 
into account the tenure of the auditors in 
addition to the results of its review of the 
effectiveness of the external auditors and 
considers whether there should be a full 
tender process either as a result of that 
review or as may be required by the relevant 
regulations. There are no contractual 
obligations restricting the Committee’s 
choice of external auditors.
As reported last year, following a detailed 
tender process in 2014, the Committee 
subsequently recommended to the Board 
that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) 
be appointed as the external auditors to 
replace KPMG Audit Plc who, together with 
their predecessor firms, had been the 
Company’s external auditors since 1986. 
Accordingly PwC carried out the statutory 
audit for the year ended 31 December 2014 
and were subsequently re-appointed as the 
Company’s external auditors for the 2015 
financial year following the passing of the 
relevant resolution by shareholders at the 
2015 Annual General Meeting.
As a consequence of its satisfaction with the 
results of its review of the external auditors’ 
activities during the year, the Committee has 
again recommended to the Board that a 
resolution proposing the re-appointment of 
PwC as external auditors for the year ending 
31 December 2016 be put to shareholders at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Internal control and  
risk management
As mentioned above, the Committee is 
responsible for reviewing on behalf of the 
Board the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal financial controls and the assurance 
procedures relating to the Company’s risk 
management system. These controls and 
procedures are designed to manage, but not 
eliminate the risk of failure of the Company 
to meet its business objectives and, as such, 
provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement  
or loss. During the year, the Committee 
monitored the effectiveness of the internal 
financial controls framework through 
reports from the Finance Director, the Head 
of Internal Audit and the external auditors.  
In particular the Committee considered  
the scope and results of work of the internal 
audit function, the findings of the external 
auditors in relation to the year end audit,  
the assessment of fraud risk carried out  
by management, the controls over the 
Company’s financial consolidation and 
reporting system, the treasury controls,  
the tax risks and the processes for setting 
strategic plans and budgets and for 
monitoring the ongoing performance  
of the Company. 
In relation to the risk management system, 
the Committee reviewed the process by 
which significant risks had been identified by 
management and the Board, the key controls 
and other processes designed to manage  
and mitigate such risks and the assurance 
provided by the internal audit function, the 
external auditors and other oversight from 
management and the Board.
Internal audit
The Company has an internal audit 
department which comprises eight in-house 
auditors, including the Head of Internal  
Audit who reports jointly to me, in my 
capacity as Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, and the Finance Director. The 
scope of work of the internal audit function 
covers all systems and activities of the 
Group. Work is prioritised according to the 
Company’s risk profile with the annual audit 
plan being approved by the Committee each 
year. Internal audit reports are regularly 
provided to the Committee which include 
details of the audit findings, and the relevant 
management actions required in order to 
address any issues arising therefrom, as 
well as updates on the progress made by 
management in addressing any outstanding 
recommendations from previously reported 
findings. In addition, the internal audit 
function reports on any significant issues 
relating to the processes for controlling the 
activities of the Group and the adequacy and 
effectiveness of such processes. Together 
the work of the internal audit function 
provides the Committee with a further 
means of monitoring the processes and 
actions to manage and mitigate those risks 
identified as posing the greatest threat to  
the Company.
A review by the Committee of the 
effectiveness of the internal audit function 
was carried out during the year. The 
Committee considered the results of a 
detailed questionnaire completed by each  
of the directors and those members of the 
senior management team who interact with 
the internal audit department and discussed 
generally the work of the internal audit 
department, the adequacy of resources and 
the skills and capabilities of the internal 
audit team. The Committee remains satisfied 
with the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
internal audit function. In order to 
benchmark the internal audit department 
against best practice, an external 
assessment of the function is currently 
being conducted and overseen by the 
Institute of Internal Auditors. Once finalised, 
the outcome of the assessment will be 
considered and reviewed by the Committee.

Directors’ report | Directors’ remuneration report
Directors’ remuneration report
Statement from Vanda Murray, 
Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee
This is my first statement as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, having succeeded 
Peter Johnson who retired from the Board  
in April 2015. On taking up this role I was 
conscious of the long and successful tenure 
of the leadership team, who together have 
created a high-performance culture which 
focuses on building shareholder value. 
The competitiveness of the remuneration 
package has been a crucial element in the 
attraction of key talented individuals into  
the business, whether by recruitment or 
acquisition, along with their subsequent 
retention. The remuneration framework is 
structured in a way that allows us to compete 
for key talent across multiple geographies 
while also complying with UK corporate 
governance good practice.
The business strategy has remained constant 
during 2015 with the Group continuing to grow 
both organically and by acquisition while 
continuously improving the efficiency of our 
operations. The Committee is satisfied that 
the remuneration framework reinforces the 
link between pay and performance and 
rewards senior executives appropriately. 
Therefore, no major changes have been 
made during the year to the current 
remuneration arrangements and no changes 
are being proposed to the current policy at 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
The current remuneration policy was 
approved at the 2014 AGM for a period of 
three years until April 2017. Once again we 
have included the policy in the 2015 Annual 
Report although, in accordance with the 
Regulations, at the 2016 AGM we will only be 
inviting shareholders to approve the Annual 
Report on remuneration for 2015. 
During the year the Committee reviewed its 
stance with regard to the disclosure of annual 
bonus targets for the executive directors. The 
policy of the Committee is ‘not to disclose 
specific targets while still commercially 
sensitive’. After full discussion the Committee 
has agreed that, although we would continue 
not to disclose the specific targets for the 
year in which they operate, the specific 
bonus targets for the year being reported on 
will now be disclosed retrospectively. A new 
table providing this information can be seen 
on page 72. The Committee considers that 
This report has been prepared on behalf of,  
and has been approved by, the Board. It complies 
with the Large and Medium-sized Companies  
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 (the ‘Regulations’), the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the Financial 
Conduct Authority Listing Rules and takes  
into account the accompanying Directors’ 
Remuneration Reporting Guidance and the 
relevant policies of shareholder representative 
bodies. This report is presented in three main 
sections: an annual statement from the Chairman 
of the Committee; the Directors’ remuneration 
policy as approved by shareholders at the 2014 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’); and the Annual 
report on remuneration for 2015. The report also  
contains information relating to the directors’ 
remuneration for 2016 and additional 
information on directors’ share interests.
the key performance indicators (‘KPIs’) for 
the annual bonus, being adjusted earnings 
per share and return on average operating 
capital performance for the year relative to  
a target level of return, are still appropriate 
and that the target levels are stretching 
without encouraging inappropriate levels  
of risk. 
The Committee also considers that the 
out-turn of our incentive plans appropriately 
reflects Bunzl’s performance in 2015. 
Bunzl’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’) 
performance continued to outperform the 
FTSE Support Services sector and the share 
price reached another all-time high. Against 
this performance, the Chief Executive’s 
annual bonus was 64% of the maximum 
opportunity, which equated to 74% of his 
annual salary. In addition, 100% of his 
executive share options and 69% of his 
performance shares vested during the year. 
The Committee has not exercised any 
discretion to adjust the relevant performance 
conditions as a result of events that have 
taken place during the year.
The policy relating to the recruitment of 
executive directors was used as the basis for 
determining the remuneration package of 
the new Chief Executive, Frank van Zanten, 
as detailed on page 79. After running an 
extensive internal and external search 
process, this was an internal appointment 
and the remuneration package that the 
Committee has put in place is in accordance 
with the approved remuneration policy. This 
package is substantively the same as that 
provided to the retiring Chief Executive, 
Michael Roney, but with a reduced salary and 
pension allowance. Frank van Zanten is 
currently based in Amsterdam and will be 
moving with his family to London so a 
relocation package, including assistance with 
accommodation, removal costs and school 
fees has also been put in place in accordance 
with the approved remuneration policy. 
Finally, the Committee, within the terms of 
the approved remuneration policy and having 
given due consideration to the policy on 
payment for departure from office and the 
long and successful tenure of Michael Roney 
as Chief Executive for more than 10 years, 
agreed the treatment of his unvested 
deferred shares under the Deferred Annual 
Share Bonus Scheme (‘DASBS’) and the Long 
Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) awards following 
his retirement in April 2016. The details are 
shown on page 78. No payment in lieu of 
notice will be made, no bonus payment will 
be made for service during 2016 and no long 
term incentives will be granted in 2016.

Directors’ remuneration policy report
At Bunzl we continue to pursue our well defined strategy of developing the business through organic growth, consolidating the markets 
in which we compete through focused acquisitions in both existing and new geographies and continuously improving the efficiency of our 
operations. Bunzl’s business model relies on excellent customer and supplier relationships and the skills, knowledge and experience of its 
directors and employees. The Company’s remuneration policy supports this strategy by ensuring that the overall remuneration package is 
set at a competitive level while ensuring that additional reward is paid for high performance over a sustained period. This policy is designed 
to ensure the recruitment, retention and motivation of the executive directors and other senior executives over the long term.
The performance related elements of the remuneration package are designed to incentivise executives to meet key performance metrics 
which align their interests and remuneration with those of shareholders, for example targets relating to earnings per share and TSR. 
In setting such targets the Committee takes due account of the potential effect such targets could have on the attitude and behaviour of 
executives to risk within the business. In addition the Committee has the discretion to take into account performance on environmental, 
social and governance matters.
The following table summarises the policy for the remuneration of executive directors approved at and effective from the 2014 AGM which 
is binding until the AGM to be held in 2017. 
 Salary
Purpose • recognise knowledge, skills and experience as well as reflect the scope and size of the role
• reward individual performance without encouraging undue risk
• promote the importance of environmental, social and governance issues
Operation • paid in 12 equal monthly instalments during the year
• reviewed annually, normally in December (with any changes usually effective from January)
• taking into consideration individual and Group performance, salary increases across the Group are 
benchmarked for appropriate salary levels using a comparator group of similarly sized companies with  
a large international presence
• pensionable
Maximum potential 
value
• salary increases are normally considered in relation to the salary increases of other employees in the  
Group and performance of the individual unless there has been a major change in role or responsibility  
or major market movement. The annual salaries for the executive directors for 2015 and 2016 are on  
pages 71 and 77 respectively
Performance 
metrics
• individual performance in the role, as well as the performance of the Group and achievements related to 
environmental, social and governance issues, are all taken into consideration
 Annual bonus
Purpose • incentivise the attainment of annual corporate targets
• retain high performing employees
• align with shareholders’ interests
Operation • annual award based on financial targets set by the Committee at the beginning of the year
• at the end of the performance period, which is the Group’s financial year from 1 January until 31 December, the 
Committee assesses the extent to which the performance measures have been achieved. The level of bonus for 
each measure is determined by reference to the actual performance relative to that measure’s performance 
targets, on a pro rata basis
• any bonus is paid as 50% in cash and 50% in shares (with the shares normally deferred for three years under  
the DASBS) 
• a clawback facility is in operation by which part or the full deferred bonus award may be reduced or cancelled  
to the extent that the value of the bonus originally awarded is subsequently found to have been overstated as  
a result of a material misstatement of the financial accounts by which the bonus was originally determined
• non-pensionable
Maximum  
potential value
• the annual on target bonus opportunity for Michael Roney and Brian May is 70% of salary with a threshold award 
of 49% of salary and a maximum award of 115% of salary and for Patrick Larmon is 70%* of salary with a 
threshold award of 31% of salary and a maximum award of 110% of salary 
*  Patrick Larmon’s annual on target bonus opportunity has been 70% of salary since 2009. Although correctly disclosed in the remuneration overview section of the directors’ 
remuneration policy report in the 2013 and 2014 Annual Reports, the target award level as shown in this table has been amended to 70% as it was incorrectly shown as 65%  
in such Annual Reports. 62 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

Performance 
metrics
• the principal measure for performance is the growth at constant exchange rates in the Company’s earnings per 
share adjusted to exclude items which do not reflect the Company’s underlying financial performance (‘eps’) 
against the relevant target
• the bonus derived from constant exchange rate eps performance will be increased or decreased according to 
the Company’s performance against the target return on average operating capital (‘RAOC’), referred to as the 
RAOC modifier 
• the use of eps and RAOC measures are seen as appropriate as they are two of Bunzl’s KPIs. The use of eps 
growth aligns the executive directors’ interests with those of the shareholders and the RAOC modifier ensures 
the continued focus on working capital management together with profit growth 
• bonus awards are at the Committee’s discretion and may take into account performance on environmental, 
social and governance matters as appropriate 
• Patrick Larmon has additional measures based on the profit before interest and tax (‘pbit’) and working capital 
employed in the business area, both measures on a constant currency basis for which he has direct 
responsibility (North America). The additional measures relating to pbit and working capital are relevant for 
Patrick Larmon as these are both KPIs of the business area he is responsible for running and these measures, 
together with other performance measures, are used to incentivise the management group in North America
• the performance metrics and targets are reviewed annually to ensure they remain appropriate. The Committee 
retains the discretion to set alternative metrics as appropriate
• the current relevant performance metrics are: threshold (which must be exceeded to attract any payment of 
bonus); target; and maximum amount (the level at which the bonus is capped). These performance metrics are 
determined at the start of the year by reference to the Group’s annual budget. No elements of the bonus are 
guaranteed. As in previous years, the specific targets will not be disclosed while still commercially sensitive
 Long term incentives
Purpose • incentivise growth in longer term eps and TSR
• align with shareholders’ interests
• recruit and retain senior employees
Operation • discretionary biannual grants of executive share option awards and performance share awards which vest 
subject to performance conditions measured over three years and subject to continuous Company service. 
There is no opportunity to retest
• a clawback facility is in operation under which part or the full amount of a vested award may be recovered,  
by reduction in the amount of any future bonus, subsisting award, the vesting of any subsisting award or future 
share awards and/or a requirement to make a cash payment, to the extent that the value of a vested award is 
subsequently found to have been overstated as a result of a material misstatement of the financial accounts  
by which the vesting was determined
• all awards are subject to the discretions contained in the relevant plan rules
Maximum

Executive share options
• maximum annual award of 250% of salary

 All employee share plans
Purpose • encourage employees including the executive directors to build a shareholding through the operation of all 
employee share plans such as the HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’) tax advantaged Sharesave Scheme in the 
UK and the Internal Revenue Service (‘IRS’) approved Employee Stock Purchase Plan (US) (‘ESPP’) in the US 
Operation • the Sharesave Scheme has standard terms under which participants can normally enter into a savings contract, 
over a period of either three or five years, in return for which they are granted options to acquire shares at a 
discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing on the day immediately preceding the date of invitation to 
apply for the option. Options are normally exercisable either three or five years after they have been granted
• the ESPP provides an opportunity for employees in the US to purchase the Company’s shares in the market at a 
15% discount to the market price. The purchase of the shares is funded by after tax payroll deductions from the 
employee with the employing company contributing the 15% discount 
• rules of both of the above plans were approved by shareholders at the 2011 AGM
Maximum  
potential value
• in the UK, the Sharesave Scheme is linked to a contract for monthly savings within the HMRC limits over a period 
of either three or five years (currently £500 per month) 
• in the US, the ESPP allows the purchase in the market of shares within IRS limits (currently up to an annual 
maximum of 10% of remuneration or US$25,000 worth of shares, whichever is lower)

Performance measures and targets
The key measures used by the Committee for incentivising the executive directors are eps modified by RAOC for the annual bonus and eps 
and relative TSR for the 2014 LTIP. The Committee considers that all of these measures are appropriate for incentive purposes. 
• Eps is one of Bunzl’s KPIs. The use of eps aligns the executive directors’ interests with those of shareholders. In addition, one of the 
executive directors, Patrick Larmon, President and Chief Executive Officer of North America, also has part of his annual bonus 
determined by additional measures relating to pbit and working capital which are relevant as these are two of the KPIs of the business 
area he is responsible for running.
• RAOC is another of Bunzl’s KPIs. The RAOC modifier ensures continued focus on working capital and profit growth by rewarding efficient 
profit generation, taking into account acquisitions once they are established, and uses average capital employed rather than only capital  
at the end of the period.
• Relative TSR provides an external assessment of the Company’s performance against similar sized companies listed in the UK. It also 
aligns the rewards received by executives with the returns received by shareholders.
This combination of performance measures provides an important balance relevant to the Group’s business and market conditions as well 
as providing a common goal for the executive directors, senior management and shareholders. The Committee does not feel that the 
introduction of non-financial measures for the executive directors is appropriate at this time.
The Committee reviews performance targets on an annual basis taking into account the Company’s annual budgeting process, the economic 
environment in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates and external expectations.
Changes to the remuneration policy
A number of changes to the Company’s remuneration policy were implemented following the 2014 AGM in accordance with the remuneration 
policy approved by shareholders to bring the arrangements in line with best practice. No changes to this remuneration policy are proposed 
for 2016.
Differences in remuneration policy for executive directors and employees in general
The main difference in remuneration policy between the executive directors and employees in general is the split of fixed and performance 
related pay such as bonus and long term incentives. Overall the percentage of performance related pay, in particular longer term incentive 
pay, is greater for the executive directors. This reflects that executive directors have more freedom to act and the consequences of their 
decisions are likely to have a broader and more far reaching time span of effect than those decisions made by employees with more limited 
responsibility. As a consequence only executive directors, Executive Committee members and other key employees (currently 26 people) are 
granted both executive share option and performance share awards. Approximately 370 senior managers are granted executive share option 
awards on an annual basis, which helps to provide a common focus for management in the Company’s decentralised organisation structure, 
whereas the annual bonuses are related to the performance of individual operating units.
Bonus arrangements vary throughout the Group and are related to the specific role and the country in which the employee operates. 
The majority of bonus plans have quantitative targets but the performance measures and targets vary according to each specific role. 
Sales representatives often have high levels of annual bonus payments which may be commission based.
When there is a critical mass of employees within a country to make it cost-effective to do so, to encourage wider employee share 
ownership, an all employee share plan is offered. Currently plans are offered to all employees based in Australia, Canada, Germany, 
Ireland, the Netherlands, US and UK. In France employees take part in profit sharing arrangements in accordance with local regulations. 
Retirement and other benefits offered to employees across the Group differ according to the country in which the job is based, as social 
provision and market norms differ, and the function and seniority of the relevant role.  66 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ report | Directors’ remuneration report

Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee is provided annually with information on the salaries and proposed increases for the Executive Committee members and 
other senior direct reports of the Chief Executive, as well as data on the average salary increases within each geographical region within  
the Group. In addition the Committee reviews and agrees all grants of executive share option and performance share awards.
In 2016 employees across the Group have received, on average, salary increases in the range of 1.5% – 3.0%, dependent on geographical 
location with the exception being those employees based in Turkey, Latin America and China where, due to inflation, current market salary 
increases are much higher. The actual increases received by employees have been based on each individual’s contribution and performance 
as well as the market competitiveness of the salary.
The Company did not consult with employees when drawing up the directors’ remuneration policy set out in this part of the report.
Recruitment of executive directors – approach to remuneration
For the ongoing stability and growth of the Group, it is important to secure, as necessary, the appointment of high calibre executives  
to the Board by either external recruitment or internal promotion. The overarching principles applied by the Committee in developing  
the remuneration package will be to set an appropriate base salary together with benefits and short and long term incentives taking into 
consideration the skills and experience of the individual, the complexity and breadth of the role, the particular needs and situation of the 
Group, internal relativities, the marketplace in which the executive will operate and an individual’s current remuneration package and 
location. In addition, the Committee recognises that it may need to meet certain relocation expenses as appropriate. 
To ensure consistency across the Board, the expected components of the package would be in line with the remuneration policy as set out on 
pages 61 to 64. In order to provide the Company with sufficient flexibility on the recruitment of an executive director, the Committee has set 
the maximum level of variable remuneration on recruitment at 427.5% of annual salary. This covers the maximum annual bonus, including 
the deferred annual share bonus award, and the maximum face value of any long term incentive awards. 
For an external appointment, the Committee may consider offering additional cash and/or share based elements to the remuneration 
package when it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Such elements, as appropriate, would be 
made under Section 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules and take account of any remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and 
would reflect the nature, time horizons and performance requirements attaching to that remuneration. Shareholders will be informed of  
any such payments at the time of appointment.
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element or benefit awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed to remain in place 
according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the new appointment. 
Executive directors’ service contracts
It is the Company’s policy that executive directors are normally employed on contracts that provide for 12 months’ notice from the Company 
and six months’ notice from the executive. For Michael Roney and Brian May there is no predetermined compensation for termination of 
these contracts. Patrick Larmon’s contract provides that on termination by the Company without cause he is entitled to receive payment  
of 12 months’ base salary plus health insurance coverage, reduced by any interim earnings. The date of each service contract is noted  
in the table below.
Date of service contract

Policy on payment for departure from office
On termination of an executive director’s service contract, the Committee will take into account the departing director’s duty to mitigate his 
loss when determining the amount of compensation. The Committee’s policy in respect of the treatment of executive directors leaving the 
Group is described below and is designed to support a smooth transition from the Company taking into account the interests of shareholders:

holidays pro rated to such date. In the case of ill health,  
a payment in lieu of notice may be made and, according to  
the circumstances, may be subject to mitigation. In such 
circumstances some benefits such as company car or medical 
insurance may be retained until the end of the notice period

advantaged share options will normally be retained by the 
individual for the remainder of the vesting period and remain 
subject to the relevant performance conditions. However in the 
case of the death of an executive, the Committee will determine 
the extent of vesting within 12 months of the date of death

termination date and be exercisable for the following 12 months after which any unexercised options will lapse.
b) The Committee will have the authority to settle any legal claims against the Company, e.g. for unfair dismissal etc, that might arise on termination.
Discretions retained by the Committee in operating the incentive plans
The Committee operates the Group’s various incentive plans according to their respective rules and in accordance with HMRC and IRS rules 
where relevant. To ensure the efficient administration of these plans, the Committee may apply certain operational discretions. These 
include the following:
• selecting the participants in the plans;
• determining the timing of grants and/or payments;
• determining the quantum of grants and/or payments (within the limits set out in the policy table above);
• adjusting the constituents of the TSR comparator group;
• determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment of performance; 68 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ report | Directors’ remuneration report
Directors’ remuneration report continued
• determining ‘good leaver’ status and the extent of vesting in the case of the share based plans;
• determining the extent of vesting of awards under share based plans in the event of a change of control;
• making the appropriate adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events, variation of 
capital and special dividends); and
• under the annual review of weighting of performance measures, setting targets for the annual bonus plan and 2014 LTIP from year to year.
The Committee may vary the performance conditions applying to share based awards if an event occurs which causes the Committee to 
consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance conditions, provided the Committee considers the varied conditions are  
fair and reasonable and not materially less challenging than the original conditions would have been but for the event in question.
Remuneration overview
The remuneration package comprises both core fixed elements (base salary, pension and other benefits) and performance based variable 
elements (cash bonus, the DASBS and the LTIP). The Committee has set a guideline that for on target performance approximately half of the 
remuneration package should be performance related. The structure of the remuneration packages for on target and stretch performance 
for each of the executive directors is illustrated in the bar charts below.

Notes
a)  Salary represents annual salary for 2016. Patrick Larmon’s salary is paid in US dollars but has been translated at the exchange rate of £1: US$1.53. Benefits such as a car  
or car allowance and private medical insurance are as shown on page 71.
b)  Pension represents the cost of pension accrued in 2015 in the Defined Benefit Section of the Bunzl Pension Plan for Brian May, the value of the annual pension allowance for 
Michael Roney and Brian May, the contributions to the Defined Contribution Section of the Bunzl Pension Plan for Michael Roney and the total of Company contributions to 
Patrick Larmon’s 401K Plan and Retirement Savings Benefit (the ‘RSB’). No further contributions were made through the Defined Contribution Senior Executive Retirement 
Agreement (‘SERA’), further details of which are shown on page 73. Although there has been no change to the remuneration policy related to Patrick Larmon, the effect of  
the cessation of payments to the SERA has been to alter the relevant percentages of his remuneration package shown above.
c)  Below threshold performance comprises salary, benefits and pension only with no bonus awarded and no LTIP awards vested.
d)  Target performance comprises annual bonus awarded at target level (i.e. 70% of base salary comprised of 50% cash and 50% deferred shares under the DASBS) and,  
for the LTIP, an assumption that 50% of performance shares will vest and that 50% of the share options will vest and deliver 30% of their face value in gain to the executives.
e)  Stretch performance comprises annual bonus awarded at maximum level (i.e. 115% of base salary for Michael Roney and Brian May and 110% of base salary for Patrick 
Larmon comprised of 50% cash and 50% deferred shares under the DASBS) and, for the LTIP, an assumption that 100% of performance shares will vest delivering 100%  
of their face value in gain to the executive directors and 100% of share options will vest which will deliver 30% of their face value in gain to the executives. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 69

Legacy arrangements
The Remuneration policy report was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and, by doing so, authority was given to the Company to 
honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors (that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration 
reports) or internally promoted future directors (in each case, such as the payment of a pension or the unwind of legacy share plans). Details 
of any payments to former directors will be set out in the Remuneration report as they arise.
Policy of executive directors’ external appointments
With the specific approval of the Board in each case, executive directors may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of 
other companies and retain any related fees paid to them. 
Non-executive directors’ terms of appointment
On appointment of a new Chairman of the Board or non-executive director, the fees will be set taking into account the experience and calibre 
of the individual and the prevailing fee rates of the other non-executive directors at that time.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the Company but instead have letters of appointment. The date of 
appointment and the most recent re-appointment and the length of service for each non-executive director are shown in the table below.

Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each year and guidance from shareholder representative 
bodies more generally. In addition the Committee consults proactively with its major shareholders prior to making significant changes to its 
policy. There have been no significant changes to policy since 2013 when consultation was conducted with 19 major shareholders and two 
shareholder representative bodies with regard to the proposed changes to the remuneration policy and the introduction of a new long term 
incentive plan. This policy and the 2014 LTIP were approved at the 2014 AGM.  70 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

The Secretary to the Committee is Celia Baxter, Director of Group Human Resources. No director plays any part in determining his or her 
remuneration. During the year ended 31 December 2015, both the Chief Executive and the Chairman were consulted and invited to attend 
meetings of the Committee but were not present during any part of the meeting when their own remuneration was under consideration.
The terms of reference of the Committee have been formally adopted by the Board and are available for inspection in the Investor Centre 
section of the Company’s website, www.bunzl.com. The key responsibilities of the Committee include:
• ensuring that executive directors and senior executives are properly incentivised to attract, retain and fairly reward them for their 
individual contribution to the Company and having due regard to the policies and practices applied to the rest of the employees within  
the Group;
• determining the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman and the executive directors of the Board including 
setting their individual remuneration packages as well as their level of remuneration and overseeing all the Company’s long term 
incentive plans;
• ensuring that remuneration is aligned with and supports the Company’s strategy and performance, having due regard to the  
shareholders and to the financial and commercial health of the Company, while at the same time not encouraging undue risk taking; and
• communicating and discussing any remuneration issues with the Company’s stakeholders as and when appropriate.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
In carrying out these responsibilities, the Committee seeks external remuneration advice as necessary. During the year the Committee 
received advice from PwC and New Bridge Street. PwC provided external survey data on directors’ remuneration and benefit levels. New 
Bridge Street provided information to determine whether, and if so to what extent, the performance conditions attached to existing share 
option and performance share awards under the LTIP had been satisfied. The fees payable to each adviser, based on hourly rates, were: 
£13,290 (PwC) and £11,415 (New Bridge Street) for such work undertaken in 2015. In addition to the work undertaken on behalf of the 
Committee, PwC, who are the Company’s external auditors, also provide the Company with some pre-acquisition due diligence and IT 
security services and tax advice. New Bridge Street may from time to time also provide services to the Company on remuneration and 
benefit related matters that are not subject to review by the Committee. The Committee remains satisfied that the provision of these other 
services does not in any way compromise the independence of their advisers.
Statement of voting at the 2015 AGM
Last year the remuneration report received a 96.43% shareholder vote in favour as set out below:

Notes
a)  The figures above represent remuneration earned as directors during the relevant financial year including the bonus of which the cash element, 50% of the bonus, is paid in  
the year following that in which it is earned. The other 50% of the bonus shown above is deferred and conditionally awarded as shares under the rules of the DASBS. Shares 
relating to the 2014 deferred bonus were awarded in 2015 as shown in the table on page 79 and the shares relating to the 2015 deferred bonus will be awarded in 2016.
b)  Benefits provided for all executive directors are a car or car allowance and medical insurance coverage for them and their families. In addition to these benefits Patrick 
Larmon’s club fees are paid by the Company.
c)  The long term incentives are in the form of awards under the 2004 LTIP which were granted in 2012 and 2013. Long term incentive figures exclude any gain from the purchase 
of shares by Patrick Larmon through the ESPP described on page 63. 
d)  The figures shown in relation to 2014 for the LTIP have been restated from those figures shown in the 2014 Annual Report to reflect the difference between the relevant grant 
price and the value of the LTIP awards on the actual date of vesting on 1 March 2015 and 31 August 2015 at the closing mid-market share price of 1,896p and 1,739p 
respectively. Consequently the 2014 total figures have also been restated to reflect the change in the LTIP valuations.
e)  The remuneration for Patrick Larmon is determined and paid in US dollars and has been translated at the average exchange rates for the year of £1: US$1.53 in respect of 2015 
and £1: US$1.65 in respect of 2014.
f)  Peter Johnson retired from the Board on 15 April 2015. Vanda Murray joined the Board on 1 February 2015 and took over as Remuneration Committee Chairman on 16 April 
2015. David Sleath became the senior independent director on 16 April 2015.
g)  There were no payments made to former directors during the year and no payments were, or are due to be, made in respect of loss of office.

Performance against annual bonus targets (audited information) 
The annual bonus plan and DASBS operate as set out in the policy section on pages 61 and 62. All of Michael Roney’s and Brian May’s and 
25% of Patrick Larmon’s bonus potential in 2015 related to the growth in the Company’s constant exchange rate eps relative to budget which 
was modified by the achievement of the Group’s RAOC relative to budget. For Patrick Larmon, a further 75% of his bonus potential related to 
the pbit performance of North America which was modified by the achievement of North America’s return on average operating capital 
relative to the target set and measured on a constant exchange rate basis. The results for 2015 against the targets set were as follows:

Notes
a)  Annual on target bonus opportunity for Michael Roney and Brian May is 70% of salary with a threshold award of 49% of salary and a maximum award of 115% of salary and  
for Patrick Larmon is 70% of salary with a threshold award of 31% of salary and a maximum award of 110% of salary.
  Threshold award was 95% of target and the maximum bonus award would have been paid out at 110% of the target for Group performance and 107.5% of target  
for NA performance.
b)  The bonuses derived from the primary measures shown above are increased, decreased or remain unchanged according to the actual performance against the relevant 
modifier. The modifier is unlikely to change the bonus determined by the primary measure by more than 5% up or down.
c)  At target exchange rates the adjusted eps for 2015 was 94.7p.

LTIP grants/awards with performance periods ending in 2015 (audited information)
Executive share options – LTIP Part A
Executive share option awards, granted three years previously, are due to vest on 28 February 2016 and 30 August 2016. The Committee 
assessed the relevant performance of the Company against the performance conditions. Eps (restated on adoption of IAS 19 (revised 2011)) 
growth was 28.9% for the three years ended 31 December 2015 which compared to an increase in RPI of 5.59% over the same period. Since 
the performance condition would have been satisfied if eps had grown by at least 14.86% over the period, all of the options will vest. Included 
in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 71 is the estimated value of these awards based on the difference between the grant 
price and the average of the Company’s closing mid-market share price for the three month period ended 31 December 2015 (1,861p).
Performance shares – LTIP Part B
Awards of performance shares were made to the executive directors on 5 April 2012 and 8 October 2012 with the three year performance 
periods being completed on 31 March 2015 and 30 September 2015 respectively. The Committee subsequently assessed the performance  
of the Company against the relevant performance conditions. The extent to which half of the awards would vest was subject to a performance 
condition based on eps growth relative to RPI. Eps growth was 27.52% for the three years ended 31 December 2014 compared to an increase 
in RPI of 7.56% over the same period. A quarter of the award would have been exercisable if eps had grown by at least 20.05% over the period 
and the whole award would have been exercisable if eps had grown by at least 40.66%. As a result of the Company’s actual growth in eps 
over the period, 52.18% of this part of the awards vested (26.09% of the full awards).
The extent to which the other half of the awards vested was based on the Company’s TSR performance against the relevant comparator 
group. For the April 2012 award, the Company ranked eighth out of the remaining 40 companies in the comparator group of companies, as a 
result of which 100% of this part of the award vested (50% of the full award) for performance above the upper quartile. For the October 2012 
award, the Company ranked twelfth out of the remaining 38 companies in the comparator group of companies, as a result of which 73.53%  
of this part of the award vested (36.77% of the full award) for performance between the median and upper quartile.
Accordingly 76.09% of the total performance shares awarded in April and 62.86% of the total performance shares awarded in October  
2012 vested in April and October 2015 respectively. Included in the single total figure of remuneration table on page 71 is the value of  
these vested awards at the closing mid-market share price on the dates of vesting, 8 April 2015 and 8 October 2015, which were 1,888p  
and 1,861p respectively.

Patrick Larmon 65 – – £14,330 £14,330
Notes
a)  Michael Roney receives a pension allowance of 30% of base salary. He has chosen to join the Defined Contribution Section of the Bunzl Pension Plan (‘BPP’) and his 
contribution of 5% of base salary, up to the pensionable salary cap (notionally £149,500 for tax year 2015/2016 and £145,800 for tax year 2014/2015) is matched by the Company. 
During 2015 such contributions amounted to £7,425 (2014: £7,230) and this amount was deducted from his pension allowance. 
b)  Brian May, who joined the Group in the UK prior to the closure of the defined benefit sections of the BPP, is a member of the Bunzl Senior Pension Section of the BPP. 
His pension accrues at the rate of 2.4% per annum up to two thirds of the pensionable salary cap, as described above. The employee contribution rate is currently 9% of 
pensionable salary. 
c)  In addition to benefits from the BPP, Brian May receives a pension allowance of 30% of base salary above the pensionable salary cap which permits him to make provision, 
of his own choice, in respect of that part of his salary which exceeds the cap.
d)  Patrick Larmon originally joined the US Plan, subject to IRS limits, which accrued at a rate of 1.67% per annum up to 50% of the five year average pensionable salary less 
the primary social security benefit, with a normal retirement age of 65 years. Pensionable salary in the US Plan is capped at US$140,000. On closure of the US Plan, Patrick 
Larmon chose to freeze his benefit and no further benefits have accrued. Patrick Larmon is currently a member of a defined contribution plan, the Retirement Saving Benefit 
(‘RSB’). Contributions to the RSB are fully funded by the employer on a sliding scale that is age related. The contributions are a percentage of base salary (maximum 5%) which 
is capped at US$200,000 per annum. The Company made contributions in respect of Patrick Larmon in 2015 of £6,536 (2014: £6,061). 
e)  In addition, Patrick Larmon receives a supplementary pension through a defined benefit Senior Executive Retirement Agreement (‘SERA’). Patrick Larmon’s SERA, which 
became fully accrued in 2012, provides for a lifetime pension of US$100,000 per annum, payable upon retirement. In 2015 the Company paid all necessary expenses, due to 
changes in assumptions and other factors outside of the Company’s control such as change in market conditions, on actuarial advice, to the SERA which amounted to £45,007 
(2014: £47,268). In 2007, this SERA arrangement was closed to new entrants and existing members’ benefits were frozen. A new defined contribution SERA (‘DC SERA’) was put 
in place for Patrick Larmon and the final contribution was paid to the DC SERA in 2013. 
f)  Patrick Larmon also participates in the Bunzl USA, Inc Deferred Savings (401k) Plan. The Company makes matching contributions to this Plan. During 2015 contributions for 
Patrick Larmon amounted to £7,794 (2014: £7,091). 74 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

Note
The face value of the awards is calculated using the closing mid-market share price on the day prior to the grant of the award. Options were awarded under the 2014 LTIP Part A 
on 26 February 2015 and on 27 August 2015 at a value of 1,920p and 1,687p per share respectively. Performance shares were awarded under the 2014 LTIP Part B on 2 April 2015 
and on 5 October 2015 at a value of 1,840p and 1,804p per share respectively.
Performance conditions for 2015 awards
The performance conditions for the executive share options and performance shares awarded under the 2014 LTIP to the Company’s 
executive directors, Executive Committee members and selected key employees in 2015 were as detailed below.
Executive options – LTIP Part A
Executive share options may vest based solely on the Company’s eps growth (adjusted to exclude items which do not reflect the Company’s 
underlying financial performance) over three years, based on the following sliding scale:
Absolute annual growth in the Company’s eps over a three year period Proportion of share option awards exercisable
Below 5% Nil
5% 25%
Between 5% and 8% Pro rata between 25%–100%
8% or above 100%
Performance share awards – LTIP Part B
The extent to which half of the awards may vest is subject to a performance condition based on the Company’s eps growth (adjusted to 
exclude items which do not reflect the Company’s underlying financial performance) over three years, based on the following sliding scale:
Absolute annual growth in the Company’s eps over a three year period Proportion of performance share awards exercisable
Below 6% Nil
6% 25%
Between 6% and 12% Pro rata between 25%–100%
12% or above 100% Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 75
Directors’ report | Directors’ remuneration report
The extent to which the other half of the performance share awards may vest is subject to the Company’s TSR performance, a combination  
of both the Company’s share price and dividend performance during the three year performance period, relative to the TSR performance of 
a specified comparator group of similarly sized companies with large international presence. These performance share awards may vest 
based on the following sliding scale:
TSR Proportion of performance share awards exercisable
Below median Nil
Median 25%
Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 25%–100%
Upper quartile or above 100%
The applicable comparator group for the 2015 awards were those companies in the FTSE 50 – 150 with significant international operations, 
excluding companies in the financial services, oil & gas and natural resources sectors.
Shareholder dilution
In accordance with The Investment Association Principles of Remuneration, the Company can satisfy awards to employees under all  
its share plans with new issue shares or shares issued from treasury up to a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital (adjusted for  
share issuance and cancellation) in a rolling 10 year period. Within this 10% limit, the Company can only issue (as newly issued shares  
or from treasury), 5% of its issued share capital (adjusted for share issuance and cancellation) to satisfy awards under executive 
(discretionary) plans.
As well as the LTIP, the Company operates various all employee share schemes as described on page 63. Newly issued shares are currently 
used to satisfy the exercise of options under the Sharesave Scheme and the International and Irish Sharesave Plans. Awards under the LTIP 
of executive options and performance shares are principally satisfied by shares delivered from the Employee Benefit Trust which buys 
shares on the market, unless security laws in relevant jurisdictions prevent this.

Percentage change in Chief Executive’s remuneration
The table below sets out the increase in the salary, benefits and bonus of the Chief Executive and that of a Bunzl UK and US management 
population. This population has been selected for this comparison because it is considered to be the most relevant as these countries have 
the Group’s largest concentration of employees with a similarly structured remuneration package. Employees from businesses acquired by 
Bunzl in 2015 and leavers and joiners in either year have been removed from the data to prevent distortion.

2016 bonus targets
The structure for Brian May’s and 25% of Patrick Larmon’s annual bonus for 2016 is described on pages 61 and 62. Due to Michael Roney’s 
retirement he will not be eligible for a bonus in 2016. The threshold for bonus payments on growth in constant exchange rate eps has been 
set above the actual result achieved in 2015 on a constant exchange rate basis. For Patrick Larmon the other 75% of his bonus will relate to 
the attainment of pbit performance of North America relative to budget which will be modified, positively or negatively, by the achievement  
of North America’s return on average operating capital relative to the target set. The relevant performance points are: threshold (which 
must be exceeded to attract any payment of bonus); target; and maximum amount (the level at which the bonus for that measure is capped). 
These performance points are determined at the start of the year by reference to the Group’s annual budget. No elements of the bonus are 
guaranteed. As in previous years, the specific performance points will not be disclosed while still commercially sensitive.
Performance measures for long term incentives to be awarded in 2016
Grants of executive share options and performance shares awarded to executive directors and senior executives in 2016 will be subject  
to the same performance conditions as those executive share options and performance share awards granted in 2015 as detailed  
on pages 74 and 75.

Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 
The Park Suite, The Dorchester, Park Lane, 
London W1K 1QA on Wednesday 20 April 
2016 at 11.00 am. The Notice convening the 
Annual General Meeting is set out in a 
separate letter from the Chairman to 
shareholders which explains the items of 
business which are not of a routine nature.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 11.75p was paid on  
4 January 2016 in respect of 2015 and the 
directors recommend a final dividend of 
26.25p, making a total for the year of 38.0p 
per share (2014: 35.5p). Dividend details are 
given in Note 17 to the consolidated financial 
statements. Subject to approval by the 
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
on 20 April 2016, the final dividend will be 
paid on 1 July 2016 to those shareholders  
on the register at the close of business on 
20 May 2016.
Share Capital
The Company has a single class of share 
capital which is divided into ordinary shares 
of 32
1
⁄ 7p each which rank pari passu in 
respect of participation and voting rights. 
The shares are in registered form, are fully 
paid up and are quoted on the London Stock 
Exchange. In addition, the Company operates 
a Level 1 American Depositary Receipt 
programme with Citibank N.A. under which 
the Company’s shares are traded on the 
over-the-counter (OTC) market in the form  
of American Depositary Receipts.
Details of changes to the issued share capital 
during the year are set out in Note 16 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 31 December 2015 the directors had 
been notified by the following shareholders 
that they were each interested in 3% or more 
of the issued share capital of the Company.
As at 29 February 2016 no further 
notifications have been received since the 
year end.
Bunzl Group General Employee 
Benefit Trust
Bunzl Employee Trustees Limited is trustee 
of the Bunzl Group General Employee  
Benefit Trust (‘the EBT’) which holds shares 
in respect of employee share options and 
awards that have not been exercised or 
vested. The current position is that the EBT 
abstains from voting in respect of these 
shares. The trustee has agreed to waive the 
right to dividend payments on shares held 
within the EBT. Details of the shares so held 
are set out in Note 16 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Rights and obligations attaching  
to shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006 and without prejudice to any rights 
attached to any existing shares, the Company 
may resolve by ordinary resolution to issue 
shares with such rights and restrictions as 
set out in such resolution or (if there is no 
such resolution or so far as it does not make 
specific provision) as the Board may decide. 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006 and of any resolution of the 
Company passed pursuant thereto and 
without prejudice to any rights attached to 
existing shares, the Board is duly authorised 
to issue and allot, grant options over or 
otherwise dispose of the Company’s shares 
on such terms and conditions and at such 
times as it thinks fit. If at any time the share 
capital of the Company is divided into 
different classes of shares, the rights 
attached to any class may be varied or 
abrogated by special resolution passed at  
a separate general meeting of such holders. 
Subject to the rights attached to any existing 
shares, rights attached to shares will be 
deemed to be varied by the reduction of 
capital paid up on the shares and by the 
allotment of further shares ranking in 
priority in respect of dividend or capital  
or which confer on the holders more 
favourable voting rights than the first-
mentioned shares, but will not otherwise  
be deemed to be varied by the creation or 
issue of further shares.
Power to issue and allot shares
The directors are generally and 
unconditionally authorised under the 
authorities granted at the 2015 Annual 
General Meeting to allot shares or grant 
rights to subscribe for or to convert any 
security into shares of the Company up  
to a maximum nominal amount of £35.87 
million. At the same meeting authority  
was also granted to the directors to allot  
the Company’s shares for cash, up to a 
maximum nominal amount of approximately 
£5.38 million, without regard to the pre-
emption provisions of the Companies Act 
2006. No such shares were issued or allotted 
under these authorities in 2015, nor is there 
any current intention to do so, other than to 
satisfy share options under the Company’s 
share option schemes and, if necessary, to 
satisfy the consideration payable for 
businesses to be acquired.
These authorities are valid until the 
conclusion of the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. The directors again 
propose to seek equivalent authorities  
at such Annual General Meeting.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
Dealings in the Company’s ordinary shares 
by its directors, persons discharging 
managerial responsibilities, certain 
employees of the Company and, in each case, 
their connected persons, are subject to the 
Company’s dealing code which adopts the 
Model Code of the Listing Rules published  
by the Financial Conduct Authority.
Certain restrictions, which are customary for 
a listed company, apply to transfers of shares 
in the Company. The Board may refuse to 
register an instrument of transfer of any 
share which is not a fully paid share and of a 
certificated share at its discretion unless it is:
• lodged, duly stamped or duly certified, at 
the offices of the Company’s registrar or 
such other place as the Board may specify 
and is accompanied by the certificate  
for the shares to which it relates and  
such other evidence as the Board may 
reasonably require to show the right of  
the transferor to make the transfer;
• in respect of only one class of shares; and
• in favour of not more than four 
transferees.
Registration of a transfer of an uncertificated 
share may be refused in the circumstances 
set out in the uncertificated securities rules, 
and where, in the case of a transfer to joint 
holders, the number of joint holders to whom 
the uncertificated share is to be transferred 
exceeds four.

Directors’ report | Other statutory information
In addition, no instrument of transfer for 
certificated shares shall be registered if the 
transferor has been served with a restriction 
notice (as defined in the Company’s Articles 
of Association (the ‘Articles’)) after failure  
to provide the Company with information 
concerning certain interests in the 
Company’s shares required to be provided 
under the Companies Act 2006, unless the 
transfer is shown to the Board to be pursuant 
to an arm’s length sale. The Board has the 
power to procure that uncertificated shares 
are converted into certificated shares and 
kept in certificated form for as long as the 
Board requires.
The Company is not aware of any agreements 
between shareholders that may result in  
any restriction of the transfer of shares or 
voting rights.
Restrictions on voting rights
A member shall not be entitled to vote, 
unless the Board otherwise decides, at any 
general meeting or class meeting in respect 
of any shares held by them if any call or other 
sums payable remain unpaid. Currently, all 
issued shares are fully paid. In addition, no 
member shall be entitled to vote if he has 
been served with a restriction notice after 
failure to provide the Company with 
information concerning certain interests  
in the Company’s shares required to be 
provided under the Companies Act 2006. 
Votes may be exercised in person or by proxy. 
The Articles currently provide a deadline for 
submission of proxy forms of 48 hours before 
the relevant meeting, 24 hours before a  
poll is taken if such poll is taken more than 
48 hours after it was demanded or during  
the meeting at which the poll was demanded  
if the poll is not taken straight away but  
is taken not more than 48 hours after  
it was demanded.
Purchase of own shares
At the 2015 Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders gave the Company authority to 
purchase a maximum of 33,475,000 ordinary 
shares. During the year ended 31 December 
2015 the Company did not purchase any of its 
own shares pursuant to this authority or the 
authority granted at the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting and no shares have been purchased 
between 31 December 2015 and 29 February 
2016. The Company is therefore currently 
authorised to buy back 33,475,000 of its  
own shares pursuant to the existing 
shareholders’ authority which is due to 
expire at the conclusion of the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. The directors again 
propose to seek the equivalent authority at 
such Annual General Meeting.
Directors
Directors may be elected by ordinary 
resolution at a duly convened general 
meeting or appointed by the Board. Under 
the Articles, the minimum number of 
directors shall be two and the maximum 
shall be 15. In accordance with the Articles, 
each director is required to retire at the 
Annual General Meeting held in the third 
calendar year after which he or she was 
appointed or last appointed and any director 
who has held office with the Company, other 
than employment or executive office, for a 
continuous period of nine years or more at 
the date of the Annual General Meeting is 
subject to annual re-appointment. The Board 
may also appoint a person willing to act as a 
director during the year either to fill a 
vacancy or as an additional director but so 
that the total number of directors shall not at 
any time exceed 15. However such appointee 
shall only hold office until the next Annual 
General Meeting of the Company.
In addition to any power to remove a director 
from office conferred by company law, the 
Company may also by special resolution 
remove a director from office before the 
expiration of his or her period of office  
under the Articles.
The office of a director shall also be vacated 
pursuant to the Articles if the director:
• resigns by giving notice to the Company  
or is asked to resign by all of the other 
directors who are not less than three in 
number; or
• is or has been suffering from mental or 
physical ill health and the Board resolves 
that his or her office be vacated; or
• is absent without permission from Board 
meetings for six consecutive months and 
the Board resolves that his or her office  
be vacated; or
• becomes bankrupt or compounds with  
his or her creditors generally; or
• is prohibited by law from being a  
director; or
• ceases to be a director by virtue of any 
provisions of company law or is removed 
from office pursuant to the Articles.
Biographical details of all the directors who 
served throughout the year are set out on 
pages 48 and 49. Vanda Murray and Frank 
van Zanten were appointed to the Board with 
effect from 1 February 2015 and 1 February 
2016 respectively but all of the other 
directors served throughout the year. 
Notwithstanding the retirement by rotation 
provisions in the Articles, each of the 
directors will retire and offer themselves  
for re-election at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting in accordance with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code apart  
from Michael Roney who retires from the 
Board at the conclusion of the Annual  
General Meeting.
Directors’ interests in ordinary shares are 
shown in Note 19 to the consolidated 
financial statements. None of the directors 
was materially interested in any contract of 
significance with the Company or any of its 
subsidiary undertakings during or at the end 
of 2015. Information relating to the directors’ 
service agreements and their remuneration 
for the year and details of the directors’ 
share options under the Company’s share 
option schemes and awards under the  
Long Term Incentive Plan and Deferred 
Annual Share Bonus Scheme are set out  
in the Directors’ remuneration report on 
pages 60 to 81.
Powers of the directors
Subject to the Articles, the Companies  
Act 2006 and any directions given by the 
Company by special resolution, the business 
of the Company is managed by the Board 
who may exercise all powers of the Company. 
The Board may, by power of attorney or 
otherwise, appoint any person or persons  
to be the agent or agents of the Company  
for such purposes and on such conditions  
as the Board determines.
Directors’ indemnities
Indemnities were in force throughout 2015 
and remain in force as at the date of this 
report under which the Company has agreed 
to indemnify the directors and the Company 
Secretary, in addition to other senior 
executives who are directors of subsidiaries 
of the Company, to the extent permitted by 
law and the Articles in respect of all losses 
arising out of, or in connection with, the 
execution of their powers, duties and 
responsibilities as a director or officer  
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 84 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ report | Other statutory information
Other statutory information continued
Amendment of articles
Any amendments to the Articles may be 
made in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006 by way of special 
resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
Environmental and  
social responsibility
The directors recognise that the Company is 
part of a wider community and that it has a 
responsibility to act in a way that respects 
the environment and social and community 
issues. Further information relating to the 
Company’s approach to these matters is set 
out in the Corporate responsibility report on 
pages 39 to 47.
Employment policies
The employment policies of the Group have 
been developed to meet the needs of its 
different business areas and the locations  
in which they operate worldwide, embodying 
the principles of equal opportunity. The 
Group has standards of business conduct 
with which it expects all its employees  
to comply. Bunzl encourages involvement  
of its employees in the performance of  
the business in which they are employed  
and aims to achieve a sense of shared 
commitment. In addition to a regular 
magazine and the Company’s intranet,  
which provide a variety of information  
on activities and developments within the  
Group and incorporate half year and annual 
financial reports, announcements are 
periodically circulated to give details of 
corporate and staff matters together with  
a number of subsidiary or business area 
publications dealing with activities in specific 
parts of the Group.
It is the Group’s policy that disabled 
applicants should be considered for 
employment and career development on  
the basis of their aptitudes and abilities. 
Employees who become disabled during 
their working life will be retained in 
employment wherever possible and given 
help with rehabilitation and training.
Significant agreements
The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, 
Bunzl Finance plc, has a number of bilateral 
loan facilities with a range of different 
counterparties, all of which are guaranteed 
by the Company, are in substantially the 
same form and are prepayable at the option 
of the lender in the event of a change of 
control of the Company. Similar change of 
control provisions in relation to the Company 
are included in the US dollar, sterling and 
euro US private placement notes which have 
been entered into by Bunzl Finance plc and 
the Company and are also guaranteed by  
the Company.
Political donations
During 2015 no contributions were made  
for political purposes.
Disclosures required under UK 
listing rule 9.8.4
Apart from the dividend waiver which has 
been issued in respect of shares held by the 
Bunzl Group General Employee Benefit Trust 
referred to in Note 16 to the consolidated 
financial statements on page 112, there are 
no disclosures required to be made under  
UK Listing Rule 9.8.4.
External auditors
Each of the directors at the date of approval 
of this report confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is  
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the director has taken all steps that he  
or she ought to have taken as a director 
in order to make the director aware of  
any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors  
are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions 
of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Resolutions are to be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting for the 
re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP as auditors of the Company at a rate  
of remuneration to be determined by  
the directors.
Strategic report and  
Directors’ report
Pages 1 to 47 inclusive consist of the 
Strategic report and pages 48 to 84 inclusive 
consist of the Directors’ report. These 
reports have been drawn up and presented 
in accordance with, and in reliance upon, 
applicable English company law and any 
liability of the directors in connection with 
these reports shall be subject to the 
limitations and restrictions provided by  
such law.
Under the Companies Act 2006, a safe 
harbour limits the liability of directors in 
respect of statements in and omissions from 
a strategic report and a directors’ report. 
Under English law, the directors would be 
liable to the Company, but not to any third 
party, if the Strategic report or the Directors’ 
report contain errors as a result of 
recklessness or knowing misstatement or 
dishonest concealment of a material fact,  
but would not otherwise be liable.
The Strategic report and the Directors’ 
report were approved by the Board on 
29 February 2016.

1 Basis of preparation
Bunzl plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company listed on the London Stock Exchange incorporated and domiciled in the  
United Kingdom.
(i) Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been approved by the directors. They are prepared 
in accordance with (i) EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and interpretations of the International Financial 
Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using IFRS and (ii) 
International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). They are prepared under 
the historical cost convention with the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value as described in the accounting policies 
below. The directors consider that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. 
(ii) New accounting standards and interpretations
There are no new standards issued by the IASB that are effective for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015. The Group has 
adopted all relevant amendments to existing standards issued by the IASB that are effective from 1 January 2015 with no material impact 
on its consolidated results.
The Group is currently assessing the potential impact of other new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the IASB that will be 
effective from 1 January 2016 and beyond. Based on the analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate that these will have a material impact 
on its consolidated results.
2 Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated 
financial statements.
a Basis of consolidation 
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is either exposed or has rights to variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are included in 
the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. A list of all of Bunzl plc’s 
subsidiary undertakings is included in the Related undertakings note in the Shareholder information section on pages 141 to 143 and is 
subject to audit. The results of all of the subsidiary undertakings are included in full in these consolidated financial statements.
(ii) Business combinations
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date. The consideration paid 
or payable in respect of acquisitions comprises amounts paid on completion and deferred consideration, excluding payments which are 
contingent on the continued employment of former owners of businesses acquired. The excess of the consideration (excluding payments 
contingent on future employment) over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Payments that are 
contingent on future employment and transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are charged to the income statement.
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
b Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at that date. Foreign exchange 
differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement, unless they qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge 
accounting treatment, in which case the effective portion is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses 
of foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates. All resulting exchange differences, including exchange differences arising 
from the translation of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such balances, are recognised directly in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve. Differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date 
of transition to IFRS, are presented in this separate component of equity. 92 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

2 Accounting policies continued
c Revenue
The Group is engaged in the delivery of goods to customers. Revenue from a sale is recognised in the income statement upon delivery of the 
relevant goods, which is the point in time at which the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred. Revenue is 
not recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the consideration due.
Revenue is valued at invoiced amounts, excluding sales taxes, less estimated provisions for returns and trade discounts where relevant. 
Returns provisions and early settlement discounts are based on experience over an appropriate period whereas volume discounts are  
based on agreements with customers.
d Cost of goods sold 
Cost of goods sold consists of the cost of the inventories sold or disposed of in the period, where the cost of inventories is net of supplier 
rebate income related to those inventories. 
e Supplier rebates
The Group has various rebate arrangements with a number of suppliers. Some of these arrangements are based on the volume of products 
purchased and others are based on the volume of products sold. Supplier rebate income is recognised in cost of goods sold concurrent 
with the sale of the inventories to which it relates and is calculated by reference to the expected consideration receivable from each rebate 
arrangement. Supplier rebate income is not recognised if there is significant uncertainty regarding recovery of the amount due. Supplier 
rebate income accrued but not yet received is included in other receivables. 
f Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity settled share based payment compensation plans. Details of these plans are outlined in Note 16 and 
the Directors’ remuneration report. The total expected expense is based on the fair value of options and other share based incentives on the 
grant date calculated using a valuation model which is spread over the expected vesting period with a corresponding credit to equity. 
g Leases
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets are classified 
as finance leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that 
of the buildings due to the indefinite life of land. 
h Income tax
Income tax in the income statement comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or recoverable on the taxable income or loss for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustments in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method providing for temporary differences arising between tax bases and carrying 
amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of 
assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent 
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. 
i Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. The carrying values 
of property, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying values may not be recoverable. Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are 
accounted for as separate items. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 93
Financial statements | Notes
2 Accounting policies continued
j Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis to write off cost less estimated residual value over the assets’ estimated 
remaining useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Buildings 2% (or depreciated over life of lease if shorter than 50 years)
Plant and machinery 8%–33%
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 8%–33%
Freehold land Not depreciated
Assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
k Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method. As permitted by IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards’, the Group has chosen to apply IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ from 1 January 2004 and has elected not to restate previous 
business combinations. For acquisitions made before 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount previously recorded under UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘UK GAAP’). For acquisitions that occurred between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, 
goodwill represents the cost of the business combination in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired. For acquisitions that have occurred on or after 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the cost of the business combination 
(excluding payments contingent on future employment and other acquisition related costs) in excess of the fair value of the identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is tested annually for impairment. 
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised immediately in the income statement.
(ii) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised on acquisition and recorded at fair value. These principally relate to 
customer relationships and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the 
income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic lives (which range from 10 to 19 years). 
l Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed annually to determine if there is any indication of impairment. If any such  
indication exists, the assets’ recoverable amounts are estimated. The recoverable amounts of assets carried at amortised cost are 
calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at appropriate pre-tax discount rates. The recoverable amounts 
of other assets are the greater of their fair value less the costs of disposal and the value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present values using appropriate pre-tax discount rates. Impairment losses are recognised when 
the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, with impairment losses being recognised in the 
income statement. 
m Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories comprises the purchase price, net of any related 
supplier volume rebates, plus import duties and other taxes, inbound freight and haulage costs and other related costs incurred to bring the 
product into its present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the 
estimated cost of completion and estimated cost necessary to make the sale.
n Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition these assets are measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses. A provision for impairment is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables or 
uncertainty as to whether the Group will be able to collect all such amounts. 
o Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition 
these liabilities are measured at amortised cost.  94 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015
Financial statements | Notes

2 Accounting policies continued
p Financial instruments 
Under International Accounting Standard (‘IAS’) 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, financial instruments are 
initially measured at fair value with subsequent measurement depending upon the classification of the instrument. IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value 
Measurement’ defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. Other financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost unless they are in 
a fair value hedging relationship. Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposures to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
(i) Fair value hedge
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated and qualifies as a hedge of a recognised asset or liability, all changes in the fair value 
of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement. The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair 
value that is attributable to the risk being hedged with changes recognised in the income statement. 
(ii) Cash flow hedge
Where a derivative is designated and qualifies as a hedge of a forecast transaction, any effective portion of the change in fair value  
is recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts 
accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the period when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
(iii) Hedge of a net investment in foreign operations
Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in foreign 
operations are recognised directly in equity to the extent the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective such differences 
are recognised in the income statement.
q Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents, as reported in the cash flow statement, comprises cash at bank and in hand and bank overdrafts. Cash at bank 
and in hand includes cash balances and short term deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date the deposit is made. 
r Net debt
Net debt is defined as interest bearing loans and borrowings and the fair value of interest rate swaps on fixed interest rate borrowings,  
less cash and cash equivalents.
s Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event that 
can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is 
material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable costs of meeting the Group’s obligations under the contract.
t Investment in own shares
The cost of shares held either directly (treasury shares) or indirectly (employee benefit trust shares) is deducted from equity. Repurchased 
shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity. When treasury shares are subsequently sold 
or reissued, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is recognised 
in retained earnings. 
At each reporting date the Group remeasures the value of the shares held in the employee benefit trust to present them in the own shares 
reserve at the market value of those shares at the reporting date. This is done through a reclassification from retained earnings to the own 
shares reserve. This movement has no effect on the actual numbers of shares held by the employee benefit trust. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 95

u Retirement benefits
(i) Defined contribution pension schemes
A defined contribution pension scheme is a post-employment benefit scheme under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a 
separate fund and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay 
all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution 
pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.
(ii) Defined benefit pension schemes
A defined benefit pension scheme is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution pension scheme. Defined benefit 
pension schemes are recognised on the balance sheet as a defined benefit pension asset or a defined benefit pension liability based on  
the difference between the fair value of pension scheme assets and the present value of pension scheme liabilities.
The present value of pension scheme liabilities are calculated by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method by estimating the 
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted using the rate 
applicable to AA rated corporate bonds that have a similar maturity and currency to the pension scheme liabilities. The fair value of any 
pension scheme assets (at bid price) are deducted from the present value of pension scheme liabilities to determine the net deficit or 
surplus of each scheme. Remeasurements arising from defined benefit pension schemes comprise actuarial gains and losses of pension 
scheme liabilities and the actual return on pension scheme assets excluding amounts already included in net interest. The net actuarial  
gain or loss for the year is recorded in full in the statement of comprehensive income.
Current service cost, past service cost or gain and gains and losses on any settlements and curtailments are credited or charged to the 
income statement. Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent benefits are already vested. Net interest on the net defined 
benefit pension liability or asset is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit pension scheme deficit or 
surplus at the beginning of the year to the net defined benefit pension liability or asset at the beginning of the year. Net interest is recorded 
within finance cost in the income statement.
When the valuation of a defined benefit pension scheme results in a surplus, the recognised defined benefit pension asset is limited to the 
present value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the pension scheme or reductions in future contributions and takes 
into account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.
v Dividends
The interim dividend is recognised in the statement of changes in equity in the period in which it is paid and the final dividend in the period 
in which it is approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
w Non-GAAP measures
Further to the various performance measures defined under IFRS, the Group reports a number of additional performance measures that 
are designed to assist with the understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and its businesses. These measures are not 
defined under IFRS and, as a result, do not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (known as ‘non-GAAP measures’) and  
may not be directly comparable with other companies’ non-GAAP measures. They are not designed to be a substitute for any of the IFRS 
measures of performance. The principal additional performance measures used within the consolidated financial statements include:
• adjusted operating profit;
• adjusted profit before income tax;
• adjusted profit for the year;
• adjusted earnings per share; and
• adjusted diluted earnings per share.
These measures exclude the charge for intangible amortisation, acquisition related costs and, where relevant, the associated tax. Intangible 
amortisation, acquisition related costs and the associated tax are items which are not taken into account by management when assessing 
the results of the business as they do not relate to the underlying operating performance. Accordingly, these items are removed in 
calculating the profitability measures by which management assess the performance of the Group. 
Acquisition related costs comprise transaction costs and expenses, deferred consideration payments relating to the retention of former 
owners of businesses acquired and adjustments to previously estimated earn outs.
The Group’s key performance indicators are set out and defined on pages 14 and 15. A number of these are based on, or derived from, 
the non-GAAP measures noted above. 96 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the choice and 
application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from those derived from the application of such judgements, estimates and assumptions, in particular those which involve anticipating 
future events. Accordingly, the judgements, estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with the impact of any revisions 
considered necessary being recognised prospectively thereafter.
The key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have most risk of causing material adjustment to 
the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 are noted below 
and explained more fully in the referenced Notes. The directors believe that the judgements, estimates and assumptions applied in the 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements are appropriate. Where relevant and practicable, sensitivity analysis is disclosed  
in the relevant Notes to demonstrate the impact of changes in estimates or assumptions used.
a Defined benefit pension schemes
The measurement of the present value of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities involves the use of various actuarial assumptions, the 
selection of which is judgemental. The Group uses independent actuarial experts to assist with the measurement of defined benefit pension 
scheme liabilities but the actual liabilities could be materially different. The main risks to which the Group is exposed in relation to the 
valuation of the defined benefit pension schemes are described in Note 20. The judgement made in relation to the application of IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) 14 ‘The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’, is also 
described in Note 20.
b Accounting for business combinations
Part of the Company’s strategy is to grow through acquisitions. Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method as described in 
the Business combinations accounting policy, Note 2 a(ii), and the Goodwill accounting policy, Note 2 k(i). This includes the determination of 
fair values for assets and liabilities acquired, including the separate identification of intangible assets, which use assumptions and estimates 
and are therefore subjective. The Group has developed a process to meet the requirements of IFRS 3, including the separate identification  
of customer relationship intangible assets based on forecast performance and estimated customer attrition rates. External valuation 
specialists are used where appropriate. The process applied is described in Note 24.
c Recoverability of intangible assets
As noted above, part of the Company’s strategy is to grow through acquisitions which has led to material goodwill and customer 
relationships intangible assets being recognised on the balance sheet. Goodwill is tested annually to determine if there is any indication  
of impairment. The allocation of goodwill to cash generating units (‘CGUs’) is a judgement made by management. Assumptions are then 
used to determine the recoverable amount of each CGU, principally based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Actual 
performance may differ from management’s expectations. The judgements made and assumptions used in performing impairment testing 
are described in Note 9. The useful economic lives of customer relationships intangible assets are also reviewed at least annually, with any 
revisions to the original estimated useful economic lives accounted for prospectively.
d Taxation
The Group operates in many countries and is therefore subject to income taxes in a number of different tax jurisdictions. The amount of tax 
payable or receivable on profits or losses for the period is subject to the agreement of the tax authority in each respective jurisdiction and 
the tax liability or asset position is open to review for several years after the accounting period ends. In determining the provisions for 
income taxes, management is required to make judgements and estimates based on interpretations of tax statute, case law and prior 
experience. The provisions are based on management’s best estimate of the tax amounts expected to be paid or received. The ultimate 
amounts payable or receivable may differ from the amounts of any provisions recognised in the consolidated financial statements as a  
result of the estimates and assumptions used. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 97

The Group results are reported as four business areas based on geographic regions, which are reviewed monthly by the Company’s  
chief operating decision maker, the Board of Directors. The principal results reviewed for each business area are revenue and adjusted 
operating profit. 
Reportable segments are determined based on quantitative thresholds in accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. The three business 
areas of North America, Continental Europe and UK & Ireland are operating segments that meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable

individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure as reportable segments. Rest of the World is therefore an ‘other’ 
segment that is disclosed above as a reportable segment as this information is considered to be useful to users of the financial statements 
and it also helps to reconcile the results of the reportable segments to the Group’s consolidated and business area results.  98 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

3 Segment analysis continued
Information related to each reportable segment is set out above. The revenue presented relates to external customers. Sales between 
the business areas are not material. Each of the business areas supplies a range of products to customers operating primarily in the 
foodservice, grocery, cleaning & hygiene, retail, safety and healthcare market sectors, but results are not monitored on this basis.  
The performance of the four business areas is assessed by reference to adjusted operating profit and this measure also represents the 
segment results for the purposes of reporting in accordance with IFRS 8. Debt and associated interest is managed at a Group level and 
therefore has not been allocated across the business areas. 
There are no customers who account for more than 10% of Group revenue. Customer dependencies are regularly monitored.
As noted above, the businesses within each operating segment operate in a number of different countries and sell products across a range 
of market sectors. The table below provides a breakdown of revenue by market sector. The other category covers a wide range of market 
sectors, none of which is sufficiently material to warrant separate disclosure.

Non-audit services principally comprise tax services and further assurance services relating to pre-acquisition due diligence and other 
duties carried out in respect of acquisitions and disposals of businesses. It is the Company’s policy to assess the services required on a 
case-by-case basis to ensure that the most appropriate adviser is retained. As a result, it is sometimes appropriate for this additional work 
to be carried out by the Company’s auditors. However other firms are also used by the Company to provide non-audit services if such other 
firms are thought to be best placed to undertake the work involved.
The Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent non-executive directors, reviews and approves the level and type of non-audit 
work which the external auditors perform, including the fees paid for such work, to ensure that the auditors’ objectivity and independence 
are not compromised. Further information is set out in the Audit Committee’s report on pages 56 to 59.

Factors affecting the tax charge for the year
The Group operates in many countries and is subject to income tax in many different jurisdictions. The expected tax rate is calculated as 
a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The adjustments to the tax charge at the weighted 
average rate to determine the income tax on profit are as follows:

Both goodwill and customer relationships have been acquired as part of business combinations. Customer relationships are amortised over 
their estimated useful lives which range from 10 to 19 years.
Impairment tests
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across cash generating units (‘CGUs’) and is tested annually for impairment.
A description of the Group’s principal activities is set out in the Chief Executive’s review. There is no significant difference in the nature 
of activities across different geographies. The identification of CGUs reflects the way in which the business is managed on a geographical 
basis. Given the similar nature of the activities of each CGU, a consistent methodology is applied across the Group in assessing CGU 
recoverable amounts. The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less the costs of disposal. The value in 
use is the present value of the cash flows expected to be generated by the CGU over a projection period together with a terminal value.  
The projection period is the time period over which future cash flows are predicted. The Group’s methodology is to use a projection period  
of five years consisting of detailed cash flow forecasts for the first two years and CGU specific growth assumptions for years three, four and 
five. For periods after this five year period, the methodology applies a long term growth rate specific to the CGU to derive a terminal value. 
Cash flow expectations exclude any future cash flows that may arise from restructuring or other enhancements to the cash generating 
activities of the CGU and reflect management’s expectations of the range of economic conditions that may exist over the projection period. 
The value in use calculations are principally sensitive to revenue growth, including any significant changes to the customer base, 
achievability of future profit margins and the discount rates used in the present value calculation. The information used for valuation 
purposes takes into consideration past experience and the current economic environment with regard to customer attrition rates and 
additions to the customer base, the ability to introduce price increases and new products and experience in controlling the underlying 
cost base. This provides a long term growth rate which is consistent with the geographic segments in which the Group operates and 
management’s assessment of future operating performance and market share movements. The discount rates used are determined  
with assistance provided by external valuation specialists.
At 31 December 2015 North America, France Hygiene, UK Hospitality and the Netherlands carried a significant amount of goodwill in 
comparison with the total value of the Group’s goodwill. At 31 December 2015 the carrying value of goodwill in respect of North America 
was £295.1m (2014: £245.2m), France Hygiene was £72.5m (2014: £76.5m), UK Hospitality was £62.5m (2014: £62.5m) and the Netherlands 
was £62.8m (2014: £65.5m). At 31 December 2015 the aggregate amount of goodwill attributable to the Group’s CGUs, excluding North 
America, France Hygiene, UK Hospitality and the Netherlands, was £506.4m (2014: £472.6m). The remaining goodwill relates to CGUs  
which are not individually significant.
For North America, France Hygiene, UK Hospitality and the Netherlands the weighted average long term growth rate used in 2015 was 
2.5% (2014: 2.5%) reflecting anticipated revenue and profit growth. A discount rate of 8% (2014: 9%) has been applied to the value in use 
calculations representing a pre-tax rate reflecting market assessments of the time value of money at the balance sheet date. Similar 
assumptions have been applied to the other CGUs but where appropriate the directors have considered alternative market risk assumptions 
to reflect the specific conditions arising in individual countries with long term growth rates ranging from 2.5%–6.9% (2014: 2.5%–7.2%) 
and discount rates ranging from 8%–19% (2014: 9%–18%).  104 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions
Impairment testing is dependent on management’s estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash 
flows, the discount rates selected and expected long term growth rates. A key assumption on which value in use calculations are dependent 
relates to revenue growth including the impact of changes to the underlying customer base. This assumption is sensitive to customer 
attrition and the rate at which new customer relationships are introduced and established. 
Based on past experience and taking into account current market conditions, management has concluded that it is reasonable to assume 
that there will be no material deterioration in the customer base over the projection period which will significantly impact future cash flows 
and that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions would result in impairment in any of the Group’s CGUs. Should such a change 
occur, this would represent a triggering event to indicate that an impairment review may be necessary. In accordance with IAS 36 
‘Impairment of Assets’, a full impairment review would then be undertaken on the relevant assets within the CGU. Any such changes 
are monitored through normal monthly procedures.

Capital management
The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future 
development of the business. The Group monitors the return on average operating capital employed and the return on invested capital as 
well as the level of total shareholders’ equity and the amount of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders. For the year ended 31 December 
2015, the return on average operating capital employed was 55.5% (2014: 57.7%), the return on invested capital was 17.1% (2014: 17.6%), 
the level of total shareholders’ equity at 31 December 2015 was £1,016.3m (2014: £983.9m) and the amount of dividends paid in the year 
ended 31 December 2015 was £116.1m (2014: £105.6m).
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of shareholders’ equity and bank and capital market borrowings. All of the borrowings 
are managed by a central treasury function and funds raised are lent onward to operating subsidiaries as required. The overall objective 
is to manage the funding to ensure the Group has a portfolio of competitively priced borrowing facilities to meet the demands of the business 
over time and, in order to do so, the Group arranges a mixture of borrowings from different sources with a variety of maturity dates.
The Group’s businesses provide a high and consistent level of cash generation which helps fund future development and growth.  
The Group seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings  
and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There were no changes to the Group’s approach to capital management during the year and the Group is not subject to any externally 
imposed capital requirements.
Treasury policies and controls
The Group has a centralised treasury department to control external borrowings and manage liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency 
risks. Treasury policies have been approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of financial 
instruments that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash. The Group uses derivatives to manage its foreign 
currency and interest rate risks arising from underlying business activities. No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken. The 
treasury department is subject to periodic independent review by the internal audit department. Underlying policy assumptions and 
activities are periodically reviewed by the executive directors and the Board. Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity 
are in place.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either (a) a hedge of the fair value of a recognised 
asset or liability; (b) a hedge of the cash flow risk resulting from changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates; or (c) a hedge of a net 
investment in a foreign operation. The accounting treatment for hedges is set out in the financial instruments accounting policy in Note 2p. 
The Group tests the effectiveness of hedges on a prospective and retrospective basis to ensure compliance with IAS 39.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group continually monitors net 
debt and forecast cash flows to ensure that sufficient facilities are in place to meet the Group’s requirements in the short, medium and long 
term and, in order to do so, arranges borrowings from a variety of sources. Additionally, compliance with the Group’s biannual debt 
covenants is monitored on a monthly basis and formally tested at 30 June and 31 December. The principal covenant limits are net debt, 
calculated at average exchange rates, to operating profit before depreciation, intangible amortisation and acquisition related costs 
(‘EBITDA’) of no more than 3.5 times and interest cover of no less than 3.0 times. Sensitivity analyses using various scenarios are applied  
to forecasts to assess their impact on covenants and net debt. During 2015 all covenants have been complied with and based on current 
forecasts it is expected that such covenants will continue to be complied with for the foreseeable future. 
The Group has substantial borrowing facilities available comprising multi-currency credit facilities from the Group’s banks and US private 
placement notes denominated in US dollars, sterling and euros. During 2015 the Group agreed an issue of fixed interest rate US private 
placement notes in respect of which drawings of $225m and €67m were made during the year and the remaining notes of € 133m and  
£97m are due to be drawn in March 2016. At 31 December 2015 the nominal total of US private placement notes outstanding was £1,001.9m 
(2014: £793.2m) with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2028. During the year the Group also refinanced or agreed new banking facilities 
totalling £133.1m. The Group’s committed bank facilities mature between 2016 and 2021. At 31 December 2015 the available committed  
bank facilities totalled £969.0m (2014: £917.0m) of which £154.9m (2014: £136.5m) was drawn down.  106 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

In addition the Group maintains overdraft and uncommitted facilities to provide short term flexibility. At 31 December 2015 there were no 
loans secured by fixed charges on property (2014: £0.8m).
The contractual maturity profile of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities at 31 December is set out in the tables below. The amounts 
disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and therefore include interest cash flows (forecast using LIBOR interest rates at 
31 December in the case of floating rate financial assets and liabilities). Derivative assets and liabilities have been included within the tables 
since they predominantly relate to derivatives which are used to manage the interest cash flows on the Group’s debt. Bank loans have been 
drawn under committed facilities and can be refinanced on maturity from these same facilities. Accordingly they have been aged based on 
the maturity dates of the underlying facilities.

All financial assets and liabilities stated as being measured at fair value in the tables above (including all derivative financial instruments) 
have carrying amounts where the fair value is, and has been throughout the year, a level two fair value measurement. Level two fair value 
measurements use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the relevant asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The fair 
values of financial assets and liabilities stated at fair value have been determined by discounting expected future cash flows, translated at 
the appropriate balance sheet date exchange rates and adjusted for counterparty or own credit risk as applicable.
For financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value, including trade receivables, trade payables, other current payables 
and non-current payables, their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due to their short term nature. However, within 
other current payables there is £3.8m (2014: £8.0m) related to earn outs on businesses acquired which are recorded at fair value. This is a 
level three fair value measurement based on the expected future profitability of the businesses acquired. 108 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

Interest rate risk
The Group is funded by a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are used to manage 
the interest rate risk profile. At 31 December 2015 fixed rate debt of £679.4m (2014: £635.7m) related to fixed rate US private placement 
notes denominated in US dollars, sterling and euros was stated at amortised cost with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2024.
At 31 December 2015 floating rate debt was comprised of £160.0m floating rate bank loans (2014: £138.5m) and £339.5m of fixed rate US 
private placement notes with maturities ranging from 2025 to 2028 which have been swapped to floating rates using interest rate swaps 
(2014: £173.6m). Bank loans are drawn for various periods of up to three months at interest rates linked to LIBOR. The interest rate swaps 
reprice every three or six months.
The interest rate risk on the floating rate debt is managed using interest rate options. Borrowings with a notional principal of £154.9m were 
capped at 31 December 2015 (2014: £45.5m). Hedge accounting is not applied to the interest rate caps since the majority of their value is 
related to time value. The strike rates of these options are based on LIBOR repricing every three months.
After taking account of hedge relationships, a change of 1% in the interest rate forward curves on 31 December would have affected profit 
before tax and equity for the year by the amounts shown below as a result of changes in the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities at 
that date:

Foreign currency risk
The majority of the Group’s sales are made and income is earned in US dollars, euros and other foreign currencies. The Group does not 
hedge the impact of exchange rate movements arising on translation of earnings into sterling at average exchange rates.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year:
Average rate Closing rate
 2015 2014 2015 2014
US dollar 1.53 1.65 1.47 1.56
Euro 1.38 1.24 1.36 1.29
For the year ended 31 December 2015, a movement of one cent in the US dollar and euro average exchange rates would have changed profit 
before income tax by £1.1m and £0.3m respectively (2014: £0.9m and £0.4m) and adjusted profit before income tax by £1.2m and £0.5m 
respectively (2014: £1.0m and £0.6m). Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 109
Financial statements | Notes
13 Risk management and financial instruments continued
The majority of the Group’s transactions are carried out in the respective functional currencies of the Group’s operations and so transaction 
exposures are usually relatively limited. Where they do occur the Group’s policy is to hedge significant exposures of firm commitments for 
a period of up to one year as soon as they are committed using forward foreign exchange contracts and these are designated as cash flow 
hedges. However, the economic impact of foreign exchange on the value of uncommitted future purchases and sales is not hedged. As a 
result, sudden and significant movements in foreign exchange rates can impact profit margins where there is a delay in passing on to 
customers the resulting price increases. For the year ended 31 December 2015 all foreign exchange cash flow hedges were effective 
with a gain of £2.0m recognised in equity (2014: gain of £3.0m) which will affect the income statement during 2016.
The majority of the Group’s borrowings are effectively denominated in US dollars, sterling and euros, aligning them to the respective 
functional currencies of the component parts of the Group’s EBITDA. This currency profile is achieved using short term foreign exchange 
contracts and foreign currency debt. This currency composition minimises the impact of foreign exchange rates on the ratio of net debt  
to EBITDA.
The currency profile of the Group’s net debt at 31 December is set out in the table below:
 2015 
£m
 2014 
£m
US dollar 563.5 398.6
Sterling 302.3 261.7
Euro 190.9 133.9
Other 50.5 83.2
1,107.2 877.4
If a 10% strengthening or weakening of sterling had taken place on 31 December it would have increased/(decreased) profit before tax and 
equity for the year by the amounts shown below. The impact of this translation is much greater on equity than it is on profit before tax since 
equity is translated using the closing exchange rates and profit before tax is translated using the average exchange rates for the year. As a 
result the value of equity is more sensitive than the value of profit before tax to a movement in exchange rates on 31 December and the 
resulting movement in profit before tax is due solely to the translation effect on monetary items. This analysis assumes that all other 
variables, and in particular interest rates, remain constant.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss in relation to a financial asset due to non-payment by the relevant counterparty. The Group’s objective is to 
reduce its exposure to counterparty default by restricting the type of counterparty it deals with and by employing an appropriate policy 
in relation to the collection of financial assets.
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash at bank and in hand, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables which represent 
the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. The maximum exposure to credit risk for cash at bank and in 
hand (Note 23), derivative financial instruments (see page 106) and trade and other receivables (Note 11) is their carrying amount. 
Dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographic presence and suitable credit rating. The Group 
continually monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties and the credit exposure to each counterparty.
For trade and other receivables, the amounts represented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated 
by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment. Note 11 sets out an 
analysis of trade and other receivables and the provision for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivables.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. 110 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

The properties provision includes provisions for vacant properties where amounts are held against liabilities for onerous lease 
commitments, repairs and dilapidations. These provisions cover the relevant periods of the lease agreements, which typically extend from 
one to 10 years, up to the earliest possible termination date. 
The Group has provisions for expected legal, environmental and other claims based on management’s best estimate of the liability at the 
balance sheet date. It expects that these amounts, which are based on detailed plans or other known factors and take account of past 
experience for similar items, will be settled within the next one to five years.
The Group is a defendant in a number of legal proceedings incidental to its operations. While any litigation has an element of uncertainty, 
management does not expect that the actual outcome of any such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will be materially 
different to the amounts provided.

Except as noted below, deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using the tax rate of the country 
of operation.
The Company is able to control the dividend policy of its subsidiaries and, therefore, the timing of the remittance of the undistributed 
earnings of overseas subsidiaries. In general, the Company has determined either that such earnings will not be distributed in the 
foreseeable future or, where there are plans to remit those earnings, no tax liability is expected to arise. A deferred tax liability of  
£3.3m (2014: £3.0m) has been recognised in exceptional cases where distribution of earnings is both planned and expected to result  
in a tax liability. 
Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences have only been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences 
where it is probable that these assets will be realised. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unutilised tax losses of £9.1m 
(2014: £8.6m).
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of unutilised capital losses of £96.2m (2014: £96.2m) as it is not considered probable that 
there will be suitable future taxable profits against which they can be utilised. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 111

The Company operates the following share plans for the benefit of employees of the Company and its subsidiaries relating to the acquisition 
of shares in the Company. Further details of the share plans operated by the Company are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report.
Sharesave Scheme (2011) 
The Sharesave Scheme (2011), approved by shareholders at the 2011 Annual General Meeting, is an HM Revenue & Customs (‘HMRC’) tax 
advantaged scheme in the UK and is open to all UK employees, including UK based executive directors, who have completed at least three 
months of continuous service. It is linked to a contract for monthly savings of up to £500 per month (2014: £250 per month) over a period of 
either three or five years. Under the Sharesave Scheme (2011) options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of 
the market price prevailing shortly before the invitation to apply for the option. Options are normally exercisable either three or five years 
after they have been granted.
The Sharesave Scheme (2011) replaced the Sharesave Scheme (2001) which was approved by shareholders at the 2001 Annual General 
Meeting. The Sharesave Scheme (2001) operates on a similar basis to the Sharesave Scheme (2011). Although there are a small number of 
options outstanding under the Sharesave Scheme (2001), no further options have been granted under this Scheme since it expired in May 2011. 
International Sharesave Plan 
The International Sharesave Plan was introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme (2001) by shareholders and was extended 
following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme (2011). The plan operates on a similar basis to both the Sharesave Scheme (2001) and the 
Sharesave Scheme (2011) as described above except that it is linked to a contract for monthly savings of approximately £500 per month 
(2014: £250 per month) (being the equivalent value in other currencies) over a period of three years.
Irish Sharesave Plan 
The Irish Sharesave Plan was also introduced following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme (2001) by shareholders and was extended 
following the approval of the Sharesave Scheme (2011). It is approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners and operates on a similar basis 
to both the Sharesave Scheme (2001) and the Sharesave Scheme (2011) as described above except that it is linked to a contract for monthly 
savings of up to €500 per month (2014: €300 per month) over a period of three years.
Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 (‘2004 LTIP’)
The 2004 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and expired in May 2014. No further share options 
or performance share awards have been granted under the 2004 LTIP since that date. The 2004 LTIP is divided into two parts.
Part A of the 2004 LTIP allowed the Remuneration Committee of the Board to grant market priced executive share options. In normal 
circumstances options granted are only exercisable if the relevant performance condition has been satisfied. Share options granted up to 
April 2014 have a performance condition attached based on the Company’s adjusted earnings per share growth exceeding UK RPI inflation 
over three financial years by a specified margin.
Part B of the 2004 LTIP allowed the Remuneration Committee of the Board to grant performance share awards which are conditional rights 
to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration. A performance share award will normally vest (i.e. become exercisable) on the third 
anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance condition has been satisfied. The extent to which performance share 
awards granted vest is normally partly subject to the Company’s total shareholder return performance relative to a comparator group of 
companies over a three year period and partly subject to the Company’s adjusted earnings per share growth exceeding UK RPI inflation 
over three years by a specified margin. 112 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

Long Term Incentive Plan 2014 (‘2014 LTIP’)
The 2014 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting and replaced the 2004 LTIP. The 2014 LTIP is also divided 
into two parts. 
Part A of the 2014 LTIP allows the Remuneration Committee of the Board to grant market priced executive share options. In normal 
circumstances options granted are only exercisable if the relevant performance condition has been satisfied. The performance condition 
for the share options granted to date is based on the Company’s adjusted earnings per share growth over three financial years meeting 
certain specified targets. 
Part B of the 2014 LTIP allows the Remuneration Committee of the Board to grant performance share awards which are conditional rights 
to receive shares in the Company for nil consideration. A performance share award will normally vest (i.e. become exercisable) on the third 
anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance condition has been satisfied. The extent to which performance share 
awards granted vest is normally partly subject to the Company’s total shareholder return performance relative to a comparator group of 
companies over a three year period and partly subject to the Company’s adjusted earnings per share growth over three financial years 
meeting certain specified targets. 
Investment in own shares
The Company holds a number of its ordinary shares in an employee benefit trust. The principal purpose of this trust is to hold shares in 
the Company for subsequent transfer to certain senior employees and executive directors relating to options granted and awards made 
in respect of market purchase shares under the 2004 LTIP, the 2014 LTIP and the Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme (‘DASBS’). Details 
of such plans are set out above and in the Directors’ remuneration report. The assets, liabilities and expenditure of the trust have been 
incorporated in the consolidated financial statements. Finance costs and administration charges are included in the income statement on  
an accruals basis. At 31 December 2015 the trust held 6,307,153 (2014: 6,527,329) shares, upon which dividends have been waived, with an 
aggregate nominal value of £2.0m (2014: £2.1m) and market value of £118.9m (2014: £115.1m). 
IFRS 2 disclosures
Options granted during the year have been valued using a stochastic model. The fair value per option granted during the year and the

20 Retirement benefits 
The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes in the US and in Europe, including the UK, France, the Netherlands and the 
Republic of Ireland, including both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. The funds of the principal defined benefit schemes are 
administered by trustees and are held independently from the Group. Pension costs of defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance 
with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries. Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice 
and local conditions and practices. Scheme assets for the purpose of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ are stated at their bid value.
Characteristics of defined benefit pension schemes
Europe
In Europe, the Group’s principal defined benefit pension scheme is the UK scheme. The UK defined benefit scheme is a contributory defined 
benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. The scheme has been closed to new members since 2003. The 
valuation of the UK defined benefit pension scheme has been updated to 31 December 2015 by the Group’s actuarial experts. 
The UK scheme is an HMRC registered pension scheme and is subject to standard UK pensions and tax law. This means that the payment 
of contributions and benefits are subject to the appropriate tax treatments and restrictions and the scheme is subject to the scheme funding 
requirements outlined in section 224 of the Pensions Act 2004.
In accordance with UK trust and pensions law, the pension scheme has a corporate trustee. Although the Company bears the financial cost 
of the scheme, the responsibility for the management and governance of the scheme lies with the trustee, which has a duty to act in the best 
interest of members at all times. The assets of the scheme are held in trust by the trustee who consults with the Company on investment 
strategy decisions. 
A de-risking strategy has been agreed for the scheme to reduce the mismatch between the assets and liabilities, whereby investments  
are switched from return seeking assets to liability matching assets as the funding improves, based on pre-agreed triggers. 
The last full triennial valuation on the UK defined benefit pension scheme was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 5 April 2012 and 
showed that there was a deficit on the agreed funding basis. To address the deficit, the Company has agreed to contribute an additional 
£5.5m per year from April 2013 to March 2019. The latest triennial valuation as at April 2015 is ongoing. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 115
Financial statements | Notes
20 Retirement benefits continued
US
The principal US defined benefit pension scheme is a non-contributory defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on  
final pensionable pay. The scheme has been closed to new members since 2003. The assets of the scheme are held in trust by an 
independent custodian. 
The US scheme is a qualified pension scheme and is subject to standard regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 
the Pension Protection Act 2006 and the Department of Labor and Internal Revenue reporting requirements. The scheme pays annual 
premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insure the benefits of the scheme.
The Company has established a Retirement Scheme Investment Committee. The members of the Committee are the scheme fiduciaries 
and, as such, are ultimately responsible for the management of the scheme assets. The Committee performs the oversight function and 
delegates the day-to-day management process to appropriate staff. A registered investment adviser advises the Committee regarding the 
investment of scheme assets. 
A de-risking strategy has been agreed for the scheme to reduce the mismatch between the assets and liabilities, whereby investments are 
switched from return seeking assets to liability matching assets as the funding improves, based on pre-agreed triggers.
In 2014, a lump sum payment option was offered to deferred vested and retired participants in the scheme in satisfaction of their future 
entitlements under the scheme. The total payment made to the eligible participants who elected to take the lump sum payment option was 
£25.3m as a result of which the scheme assets and liabilities reduced by this amount. The scheme rules were changed during 2015 such that 
all active members will be offered a similar lump sum payment option on retirement.
Annual actuarial valuations are performed on the US defined benefit scheme. The last annual review was carried out by a qualified actuary 
as at 1 January 2015 and showed that there was a required annual contribution of $4.7m. The Group plans to contribute $8.0m for the 2015 
plan year to cover prudently this required contribution and anticipate future funding needs. In the 2014 plan year, the Group also paid a 
contribution of $8.0m. The annual review as at 1 January 2016 is ongoing.
Risks
The main risks to which the Group is exposed in relation to the defined benefit pension schemes are described below:
• Inflation risk — the majority of the UK scheme’s liabilities increase in line with inflation and, as a result, if inflation is greater than expected 
the liabilities will increase. The impact of high inflation is capped each year for the UK scheme’s benefits. The US scheme‘s liabilities are 
not directly tied to inflationary increases.
• Interest rate risk — a fall in bond yields will increase the value of the schemes’ liabilities. A proportion of both the UK and US schemes’ 
assets are invested in liability matching assets to mitigate the interest rate and also the inflation risk.
• Mortality risk — the assumptions adopted by the Group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy. However, if life 
expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would result in greater payments from the schemes and consequently increases  
in the schemes’ liabilities. The mortality assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis to minimise the risk of using an inappropriate 
assumption.
• Investment risk — the schemes invest in a diversified range of asset classes to mitigate the risk of falls in any one area of the investments. 
In the UK, the trustee implements partial currency hedging on the overseas assets to mitigate currency risk.
The risks mentioned above could lead to a material change to the deficit or surplus of the pension schemes. Given the long term time horizon 
of the schemes’ cash flows, the assumptions used can lead to volatility in the scheme valuations from year to year. The Company and the 
trustees seek to mitigate actively the risks associated with the schemes.
A higher defined benefit obligation could lead to additional funding requirements in future years. Any deficit measured on a funding valuation 
basis, which may differ from the actuarial valuation under IAS 19, will generally be financed over a period that ensures the contributions are 
appropriate to the Group and in line with the relevant regulations.

recognised as a defined benefit asset because the Group considers that it has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus from the  
UK scheme.

The Group expects to pay approximately £14.1m (expected as of 2014: £14.4m) in contributions to the defined benefit pension schemes  
in the year ending 31 December 2016.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit pension scheme liabilities at 31 December 2015 was approximately 18.5 years  
(2014: 20.8 years) for Europe and 12.5 years (2014: 15.0 years) for the US.
The total defined benefit pension scheme liabilities are divided between active members (£144.6m (2014: £172.8m)), deferred members 
(£126.6m (2014: £134.2m)) and pensioners (£146.0m (2014: £128.8m)).

24 Acquisitions 
Acquisitions involving the purchase of the acquiree’s share capital or, as the case may be, the relevant assets of the businesses acquired, 
have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Part of the Group’s strategy is to grow through acquisition. The Group 
has developed a process to assist with the identification of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the 
separate identification of intangible assets in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. This formal process is applied to each 
acquisition and involves an assessment of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with assistance provided by external valuation 
specialists where appropriate. Until this assessment is complete, the allocation period remains open up to a maximum of 12 months from 
the relevant acquisition date. At 31 December 2015 the allocation period for all acquisitions completed since 1 January 2015 remained open 
and accordingly the fair values presented are provisional. 
Adjustments are made to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the allocation period to the extent that further information and 
knowledge come to light that more accurately reflect conditions at the acquisition date. To date the adjustments made have impacted assets 
acquired to reflect more accurately the estimated realisable or settlement value. Similarly, adjustments have been made to acquired 
liabilities to record onerous commitments or other commitments existing at the acquisition date but not recognised by the acquiree. 
Adjustments have also been made to reflect the associated tax effects.
The consideration paid or payable in respect of acquisitions comprises amounts paid on completion, deferred consideration and payments 
which are contingent on the retention of former owners of businesses acquired. IFRS 3 requires that any payments that are contingent on 
future employment, including payments which are contingent on the retention of former owners of businesses acquired, are charged to 
the income statement. All other consideration has been allocated against the identified net assets, with the balance recorded as goodwill. 
Transaction costs and expenses such as professional fees are charged to the income statement. The acquisitions provide opportunities for 
further development of the Group’s activities and create enhanced returns. Such opportunities and the workforces inherent in each of the 
acquired businesses do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets but do represent much of the assessed value that supports 
the recognised goodwill.  120 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

Financial statements | Notes to the Company financial statements
Notes to the Company financial statements
1 Basis of preparation
Bunzl plc (the 'Company') is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. These financial statements present information 
about the Company as an individual undertaking and not about its Group. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit 
and loss account of the Company has not been separately presented in these financial statements. The financial statements of the Company 
have been prepared on a going concern basis.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (‘FRS 101’) 
and the Companies Act 2006. In the transition to FRS 101 from existing UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (‘GAAP’), the Company 
has applied International Financial Reporting Standard (‘IFRS’) 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ while 
ensuring that its assets and liabilities are measured in compliance with FRS 101. An explanation of how the transition to FRS 101 has 
affected the reported financial position and performance of the Company is provided in Note 15.
In preparing these financial statements the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
• a cash flow statement and related notes;
• comparative period reconciliations for share capital and tangible fixed assets;
• disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries and also in respect of capital management;
• the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs;
• an additional balance sheet for the beginning of the earliest comparative period following the retrospective change in accounting policy; 
and
• disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel.
As the consolidated financial statements of Bunzl plc include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also applied the exemptions 
available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
• certain disclosures required by IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payments’ in respect of Group settled share based payments; and
• certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ and disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments’.
2 Accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered 
material to all periods presented in these financial statements and in preparing an opening FRS 101 balance sheet at 1 January 2014 for the 
purposes of the transition to FRS 101.
a Tangible fixed assets
All tangible fixed assets are included at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. The carrying values of 
tangible fixed assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values 
may not be recoverable. Where parts of an item of tangible fixed assets have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items. 
Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis to write off cost less estimated residual value over the assets’ estimated 
remaining useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Short leasehold improvements  The lower of 50 years and the life of the related lease
Fixtures, fittings and equipment  3–10 years 
Assets’ residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
b Investment in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less any provision for impairment. 
c Share based payments
The Company operates a number of equity settled share based payment compensation plans. Details of these plans are outlined in Note 16 
to the consolidated financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration report. The total expected expense is based on the fair value of 
options and other share based incentives on the grant date calculated using a valuation model which is spread over the expected vesting 
period with a corresponding credit to equity.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its individual financial 
statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity settled share based payment charge recognised 
in its consolidated financial statements, with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity. The expense is not recharged to 
the relevant subsidiaries. 126 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

d Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method providing for temporary differences arising between tax bases and carrying 
amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences 
when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is not recognised for differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
forseeable future. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the temporary difference can be utilised. 
e Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is 
material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.
f Retirement benefits
(i) Defined contribution pension schemes 
A defined contribution pension scheme is a post-employment benefit scheme under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a 
separate fund and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay 
all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution 
pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. 
(ii) Defined benefit pension scheme 
A defined benefit pension scheme is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution pension scheme. The defined benefit 
pension scheme is recognised on the balance sheet as a defined benefit pension asset or defined benefit pension liability based on the 
difference between the fair value of pension scheme assets and the present value of pension scheme liabilities. 
The present value of pension scheme liabilities are calculated by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method by estimating the 
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, discounted using the rate 
applicable to AA rated corporate bonds that have a similar maturity and currency to the pension scheme liabilities. The fair value of any 
pension scheme assets (at bid price) are deducted from the present value of pension scheme liabilities to determine the net deficit or 
surplus of the scheme. Remeasurements arising from defined benefit pension schemes comprise actuarial gains and losses of pension 
scheme liabilities and the actual return on pension scheme assets excluding amounts already included in net interest. The net actuarial 
gain or loss for the year is recorded in full in other comprehensive income.
Current service cost, past service cost or gain and gains and losses on any settlements and curtailments are credited or charged to profit 
for the period. Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent benefits are already vested. Net interest on the net defined benefit 
pension liability or asset is calculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit pension scheme deficit or surplus 
at the beginning of the year to the net defined benefit pension liability or asset at the beginning of the year. Net interest is recorded within 
profit or loss for the period.
When the valuation of a defined benefit pension scheme results in a surplus, the recognised defined benefit asset is limited to the present 
value of benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the pension scheme or reductions in future contributions and takes into 
account the adverse effect of any minimum funding requirements.
The Company is the sponsoring company of the UK defined benefit pension scheme. As there is no contractual agreement or stated Group 
policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of the scheme to participating subsidiaries, the net defined benefit pension cost or benefit is 
recognised fully by the Company. The contributions paid by the participating subsidiaries other than the Company are credited to profit or 
loss of the Company where the amounts relate to service and are independent of the number of years of service, or to other comprehensive 
income if not linked to service. 
g Investment in own shares
The cost of shares held either directly (treasury shares) or indirectly (employee benefit trust shares) is deducted from equity. Repurchased 
shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity. When treasury shares are subsequently sold  
or reissued, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is recognised 
in retained earnings. At each reporting date the Company remeasures the value of shares held in the employee benefit trust to present them 
in own shares reserve at the market value of those shares at the reporting date. This is done through a reclassification from retained 
earnings to the own share reserve. This movement has no effect on the actual number of shares held by the employee benefit trust. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 127

h Dividends
The interim dividend is included in the statement of changes in equity in the period in which it is paid and the final dividend in the period  
in which it is approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
i Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the 
Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee 
contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the 
guarantee.
j Leases
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term  
of the relevant lease. 
Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the choice and 
application of the Company’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and profit or loss. Actual results may differ 
from those derived from the application of such judgements, estimates and assumptions, in particular those which involve anticipating future 
events. Accordingly, the judgements, estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with the impact of any revisions 
considered necessary being recognised prospectively thereafter.
The key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have most risk of causing material adjustment to 
the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 are noted below and explained 
more fully in the referenced Notes. The directors believe that the judgements, estimates and assumptions applied in the preparation of these 
financial statements are appropriate. Where relevant and practicable, sensitivity analysis is disclosed in the relevant Notes to demonstrate 
the impact of changes in estimates or assumptions used.
a Recoverability of investments
The carrying amounts of the Company’s non-financial assets, including investments in subsidiary undertakings, are reviewed annually  
to determine if there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the assets’ recoverable amounts are estimated. The 
recoverable amounts of assets are the greater of their fair value less the costs of disposal and their value in use. In assessing the value  
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using appropriate pre-tax discount rates. Impairment losses 
are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount with impairment losses being recognised  
in profit or loss.
b Defined benefit pension schemes
The measurement of the present value of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities involves the use of various actuarial assumptions,  
the selection of which is judgemental. The Company uses independent actuarial experts to assist with the measurement of defined benefit 
pension scheme liabilities but the actual liabilities could be materially different. The main risks to which the Company is exposed in relation 
to the valuation of the defined benefit pension schemes are described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. The judgement 
made in relation to the application of IFRS Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) 14 ‘The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding 
Requirements and their Interaction’, is described in Note 9.

Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method. Following the enactment of legislation in the UK, the 
corporation tax rate will be reduced from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 18% from 1 April 2020. Accordingly, the 
UK tax rate used for measuring deferred tax reflects the rate expected to be applied when the temporary differences reverse. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are offset as they both relate to the same tax jurisdiction and will be settled on a net basis. It is probable that the 
deferred tax assets recognised will be realised. The recovery of the net deferred tax asset will be over more than one year. No deferred  
tax asset has been recognised in respect of unutilised capital losses of £70.6m (2014: £70.5m).

Explanation of material adjustments between UK GAAP and FRS 101
The most significant adjustment relates to the recognition of the position of the Company’s defined benefit pension scheme on the Company 
balance sheet. Previously, under UK GAAP, a multi-employer exemption was applied which meant that the deficit on the pension scheme 
was not recorded on the balance sheet of any of the participating employer companies. As the Company is the sponsoring company for the 
pension scheme and as there is no contractual agreement or stated Group policy for charging the net defined benefit pension scheme cost to 
participating subsidiaries, the cost or benefit of the pension scheme (and the closing deficit or surplus on the defined benefit pension 
scheme) is recognised fully by the Company. The accounting valuation is consistent between the Company and the Group as described in 
Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. A deferred tax asset has also been recorded on the newly recognised defined benefit 
pension liability as well as in relation to certain share based payment arrangements for the Company’s employees. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 133
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Financial statements | Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
the directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards (UK GAAP), 
including Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ (FRS 101) and applicable law.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and 
of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing both the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 
101 have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the parent company financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a strategic report, directors’ report, 
directors’ remuneration report and corporate governance 
statement that comply with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Annual Report and financial statements comply with the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom’s Financial 
Conduct Authority in respect of the requirement to produce an annual 
financial report.
We confirm on behalf of the Board that to the best of our knowledge:
•  the Group and parent company financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting 
standards and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the Annual Report and financial statements include a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

Financial statements | Independent auditors’ report to the members of Bunzl plc
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) ('ISAs (UK & Ireland)').
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk 
of material misstatement due to fraud.
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as 'areas of focus' in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order 
to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read 
in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee report), page 93 (Accounting policies) and pages 103 and 104 (Note 9).
The Group has material goodwill balances of £999.3m (2014: 
£922.3m) and customer relationship intangible assets of £632.7m 
(2014: £556.5m) spread across multiple geographies and relating 
to multiple cash generating units ('CGUs'). 
In assessing whether the carrying amount of these assets has 
been impaired, management considers forecast cash flows of the 
individual CGUs which are identified on a market or geographical 
basis.
We focused on the CGUs with the highest goodwill and intangible 
balances (the most material being North America, France Hygiene, 
the Netherlands and UK Hospitality) as well as the CGUs where 
there were smaller goodwill and intangibles balances but lower 
levels of headroom.
Management’s impairment assessment involves significant 
estimation, principally relating to short and long term revenue 
growth, future profitability and discount rates. Due to the 
acquisitive nature of the Group and the magnitude of the 
aggregated related goodwill and intangible assets, together  
with the subjectivity of the principal assumptions, a significant 
amount of audit effort was required, particularly as some of  
these assumptions are dependent on economic factors and 
trading conditions specific to overseas territories. 
In our testing of management’s annual goodwill and other intangible 
assets impairment calculations, we used valuation experts to assist 
our evaluation of the appropriateness of the models and the key 
assumptions used by management.
We evaluated the reasonableness of the directors’ cash flow 
forecasts by comparing the assumptions made to internal and 
external data.
In particular:
• we compared short term revenue growth rates to the latest 
strategic plans and found them to be consistent;
• we determined that long term growth rates are generally 
consistent when compared to third party nominal GDP rates;
• we found the achievability of future margins to be plausible based 
on past and current performance and consistent with budgets; and
• we challenged the discount rate used to determine the present 
value by assessing the cost of capital for the Company and 
comparable organisations and considered them to be reasonable.
Furthermore, we obtained evidence to assess adequate historical 
accuracy in management’s forecasting process. 
As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, 
management concluded that, based on their own sensitivity 
calculations, no reasonable change in assumptions would lead to an 
impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.
Having ascertained the extent of changes in key assumptions either 
individually or collectively that would be required for goodwill and 
other intangible assets to be materially impaired, we considered 
such a change in those key assumptions to be unlikely. 136 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Corporate tax exposures 
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee report), page 92 (Accounting policies) and pages 100 and 101 (Note 6).
The Group operates in a number of international territories with 
complex taxation rules and regulations. The interpretation of 
these complex regulations and the unknown future outcome of 
pending judgements by the tax authorities result in the need to 
provide against a number of uncertain tax positions.
We focused on this area because of the risk surrounding the level 
of estimation and judgement that is necessary in determining the 
provisions required.
We discussed with management their assessment of uncertain 
tax positions and used our taxation specialists to assist us in 
challenging the appropriateness of management’s judgements 
in relation to these positions. These procedures assisted in our 
corroboration of management’s position on the amount of significant 
tax exposures and the provisions and disclosures made in the 
financial statements.
In assessing the adequacy of the tax provisions, we also considered 
factors such as possible penalties and interest. Furthermore, we 
determined that the calculations were in line with the accounting 
standards and that the methodology and principles had been 
applied consistently.
We consider the current level of tax provision to be reasonable. 
Supplier rebate accounting – purchase volume based rebates 
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee report) and page 92 (Accounting policies).
We focused on this area as purchase volume based rebate income 
from suppliers is material to the Consolidated financial statements.
Given the degree of estimation involved in accounting for purchase 
volume based supplier rebates, we focused our audit procedures 
on the accuracy, occurrence and cut-off of these transactions and 
the valuation of amounts held on the balance sheet.
We evaluated the processes in place across the Group for the 
recognition of purchase volume based supplier rebates and found 
these to be consistently applied. We agreed the nature of rebate 
arrangements to contracts or other supporting agreements and 
agreed the rates indicated in the agreements with those used in 
the calculations. We also reperformed rebate calculations and 
assessed management’s estimates of purchases. 
No material exceptions were noted from this testing.
Where appropriate, we also agreed the post year end settlement 
of year end receivable amounts included in the opening and closing 
Consolidated balance sheets to bank receipts, with no material 
exceptions noted.
Defined benefit pension schemes 
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee report), page 95 (Accounting policies) and pages 114 to 118 (Note 20).
The Group has defined benefits pension schemes (with material 
schemes in the US and the UK) with a net deficit of £40.0m at the 
current year end (2014: £70.3m), which is material in the context 
of the Consolidated balance sheet.
Management estimation is required in relation to the measurement 
of pension scheme obligations, and management employs 
independent actuarial experts to assist it in determining 
appropriate assumptions such as inflation levels, discount rates, 
salary increases and mortality rates.
Movements in these assumptions can have a material impact on the 
determination of the liability and, therefore, the extent of any 
surplus or deficit.
We used our own actuarial experts to satisfy ourselves that the 
assumptions used in calculating the US and UK pension scheme 
liabilities are appropriate, including confirming that salary increases 
and mortality rate assumptions were consistent with relevant 
national and industry benchmarks. We determined that the discount 
and inflation rates used in the valuation of the pension scheme 
liabilities were consistent with our internally developed benchmarks 
and, where available, with those disclosed in the published financial 
statements of other companies as at 31 December 2015. In each 
case we considered the assumptions made by management to be 
reasonable in light of the available evidence.
Business combinations
Refer to page 57 (Audit Committee report), page 91 (Accounting policies) and pages 119 to 122 (Note 24).
Given that the Group continues to make significant investment in 
acquisitions, accounting for business combinations is an area of 
focus due to the level of judgement involved.
Business combinations can involve judgements in relation to the 
value of assets and liabilities that are recognised on acquisition, 
particularly the allocation of purchase consideration to goodwill 
and separately identified intangible assets. Any misstatement 
made in the identification and/or valuation of acquired intangibles 
gives rise to an equal, compensating misstatement in goodwill.
Management relies on external valuation specialists to value 
significant intangibles acquired in business combinations. Where 
management has relied on such specialists, we assessed their 
competency and tested the results of their work and found no 
material issues.
We used our own valuation experts to challenge the methodology 
and key assumptions used in determining the value of the customer 
relationship assets for the more significant acquisitions. We 
determined that the cash flows applied within the valuation models 
and the key assumptions such as the discount rates, growth rates, 
customer attrition and period for amortisation, were appropriate. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 137
Financial statements | Independent auditors’ report to the members of Bunzl plc
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
Group operates.
The Group is organised geographically into four business areas, being North America, Continental Europe, UK & Ireland and Rest of the World.
We identified one financially significant component, being North America, where a full scope audit has been performed. In addition to this, 
we identified eight components across Continental Europe, UK & Ireland and Rest of the World for which a full scope audit of their financial 
information was required. In order to satisfy the request of the Audit Committee and management, we performed full scope audits on a 
further 67 components. The components where we performed audit procedures covered over 95% of Group revenue, profit before taxation 
and total assets.
Component audits were performed to respective statutory materiality levels of the individual components. These local statutory materiality 
levels were set individually for each component and ranged up to £14.7m.
Where work was performed by component auditors, detailed instructions were issued by us and the Group audit team visited North America, 
UK, France and Brazil. Telephone discussions were also held with component auditors at these locations and with the majority of the 
components that the Group audit team did not visit in person. In addition, specific audit procedures over central functions and areas of 
significant judgement, including taxation, pensions, acquisitions and the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, were performed by 
the Group audit team centrally. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on 
the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the 
financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £15 million (2014: £15m)
How we determined it Approximately 5% of profit before taxation
Rationale for benchmark applied Given that the Group’s businesses are profit orientated and the directors use profit measures 
to assess the performance of the business, we believe that profit before taxation provides us 
with a consistent year-on-year basis for determining materiality
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £750,000 (2014: £750,000) 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 91 in relation to going concern. We have nothing 
to report having performed our review.
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Company have adequate resources to remain in operation, and 
that the directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have 
concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 138 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015

Other required reporting
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• Information in the Annual Report is:
 −  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 − apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group and Company acquired in the course of performing our  
audit; or
 − otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report.
• the statement given by the directors on page 53, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’), that they consider the Annual Report taken 
as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for members to assess the Group and Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group 
and Company acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
• the section of the Annual Report on page 57, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report.
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 36 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision 
C.2.1 of the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to.
• the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to.
• the directors’ explanation on pages 54 and 55 of the Annual Report, in accordance with 
provision C.2.2 of the Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, 
and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in 
scope than an audit and only consisted of making enquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking 
that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review. Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 139
Financial statements | Independent auditors’ report to the members of Bunzl plc
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
• the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Directors’ remuneration report – Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified  
by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate governance report relating to 10 further provisions of the Code. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 133, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or 
to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

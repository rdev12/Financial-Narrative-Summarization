chairman’s statement
Summary of 
Chairman’s statement
—  For the first time, our turnover 
for the year has topped the billion 
pound mark.
—  The total dividend payment for 
the year will be 23.1p, up 7 .4% 
on last year.
—  We acquired Cloverleaf Restaurants 
and Realpubs during the year as part 
of our retail expansion strategy.
Results
We have had a very successful year with 
record results and strong growth across 
the business. For the first time, our turnover 
for the year has topped the billion pound 
mark at £1,042.7m, up 6.0% on last year, 
with operating profit up 5.1% to £222.0m*. 
Profit before tax and exceptional items also 
reached a record level, up 13.8% on last year 
to £140.0m, with earnings per share up 
11.1% to 48.2p. 
Dividend
As a result of the company’s strong 
earnings growth and cash generation, 
the board is able to recommend a final 
dividend payment of 16.8p per share. 
This will take the total dividend payment 
for the year to 23.1p per share, up 7 .4% on 
last year. The final dividend is expected 
to be paid on 12 September 2011 to those 
shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 12 August 2011. 
Acquisitions 
The company’s strategy is focused on 
driving long-term growth and profitability 
by expanding and continuing to improve the 
quality of the Retail estate. In line with this 
strategy, in January we acquired Cloverleaf 
Restaurants for £55.7m. At the time, Cloverleaf 
had eleven food-led sites trading in the 
North of England and the Midlands. We have 
since opened a twelfth site and have a healthy 
pipeline of further sites.
*  As throughout this document, profit figures are 
shown before exceptional items.
Then, in April, we acquired Realpubs for 
£52.2m. This group comprised 14 premium 
local pubs in London. We also acquired a 
further 13 sites for £22.8m and exchanged 
on eight greenfield sites. 
Disposals
During the year, we disposed of 108 
non-core pubs and other properties for 
£27 .8m, ahead of book value. 
Board
In March, we bid farewell to Jane Scriven, who 
had served on our board as a non-executive 
director for six years. I express my thanks to 
her for the sound and reliable contribution she 
made at board and committee meetings over 
that time. We wish Jane well in the future.
I would also like to thank Ian Bull, our 
group finance director for the last five years, 
who is leaving us at the end of June. He has 
played a most important role in driving our 
performance and continued success and he 
leaves us in a strong position, both financially 
and operationally, with our best wishes for 
the future. 
We have appointed Matthew Fearn as group 
finance director to replace Ian and he will 
be joining us at the beginning of September.

review of the year
our strategy for growth
We have a clear and consistent 
strategy to drive long-term 
growth through expanding 
our Retail division, improving 
the quality of our tenanted 
and leased division and 
increasing investment in 
our iconic ale brand portfolio. 
Our operational strategy is 
to deliver outstanding value, 
exceptional service and 
unbeatable quality across 
all of our businesses.
Our medium-term 
priorities are:
1. Retail
expand branded 
retail 2. Pub Partners 
improve quality 
and reduce size of 
tenanted estate
3. Brewing and Brands
increase core beer 
brand investment 
Drive growth through expanding our 
branded, food-led, retail estate.
We are currently targeting a total 
of 1,100 sites and at the same time are 
improving the overall quality of the 
estate by increasing our exposure to 
the long-term growth of the eating out 
market and raising the premiumness 
of our unbranded more wet-led estate. 
Generate sustainable and improved 
rates of cash returns from a higher 
quality, more customer focused, 
tenanted estate.
We are looking to reduce the Pub 
Partners’ estate to around 1,200 pubs 
including over 300 non-core pub 
disposals. We are taking increasing 
control over our licensees’ customer 
offers and introducing new and 
innovative agreements into the estate. 
Deliver continued profitable growth 
in our branded beer business. 
Using synergies from the Belhaven 
integration, we are increasing the 
investment behind our iconic core 
ale brands including Greene King IPA, 
Old Speckled Hen, Abbot Ale and 
Belhaven Best. We aim to grow 
volume and take share in a declining 
UK ale market. www.greeneking.co.uk Greene King plc Annual Report 2011 7

of recession but failed to deliver anticipated 
growth levels. Real household income fell and 
is expected to do so again in 2011, impacting on 
consumer confidence. We also saw changeable 
trading in the second half of the year due to 
the weather, with snow across the country in 
December but much better Spring weather. 
We also benefited from a successful Royal 
Wedding weekend.
The pub and beer industry also continues to 
face political and social challenges. The duty 
escalator is penalising responsible drinkers 
and accelerating the closure of pubs and 
clubs in communities across the country, 
as alcohol is increasingly consumed in the 
home. We believe the government should be 
doing more to reverse current consumption 
trends, starting with setting a credible and 
meaningful minimum price for alcohol to 
target irresponsible retailers and drinkers 
without penalising the responsible majority. 
T o deliver a record performance in this context 
demonstrates the success of our strategy 
for growth and the strength of the people, 
the brands and the pubs at Greene King. 
We believe the best way to deliver long-term, 
profitable growth is to focus on expanding 
our Retail business and growing our share 
of the eating out market. This strategy is 
supported by improving the quality of our 
tenanted and leased estate via targeted 
disposals, agreement innovation and enhanced 
control of the offer, and investing in our 
leading ale brand portfolio. 
Across all businesses, our operational 
focus on delivering industry-leading Value, 
Service & Quality (VSQ) to our customers 
has driven our record performance. In this 
austere age, our customers are looking for 
‘affordable treats’, which we are delivering 
by continuously adding value to our offers, 
particularly in food, by exceeding customer 
expectations on service, and by maintaining 
industry leading product and offer quality. 
We are focused on increasing our share 
of the growing eating-out market. In Retail, 
food and food-related sales are approaching 
60% of total sales following another year of 
strong growth. We have upgraded kitchen 
facilities across the estate, further developed 
our menus and targeted cover growth and 
share gains through delivering exceptional 
value to our customers. Similarly in Pub 
Partners, our investment is focused on 
improving the food capability of our pubs. 
Our recruitment and training is increasingly 
geared to improving the overall food 
expertise amongst our licensees and we 
continue to utilise our Retail expertise to 
offer licensees a range of food solutions to 
grow their food sales.
We are investing in the development of the 
Greene King brand. We have launched our 
‘proper pubs’ and ‘proper pint’ campaigns, 
investing £2.5m, and since the year-end, we 
have launched the new Greene King brand 
identity. We have updated brand imagery, 
brand colours and the company website, to

Summary
Despite another challenging year, Greene King 
Retail average profit per outlet grew 9.6% and 
Pub Partners average profit per outlet grew 1.5%. 
This was achieved through strong revenue growth 
and tight cost control. 
Summary
Increased EBITDA and strong working capital 
performance has helped to generate positive free 
cash flow in the year of £51.2m, a 28% increase 
on last year. 
Summary
Fixed charged cover improved to 2.6x in the 
year due to increased EBITDA and reduced 
interest costs.

Free cash flow is the movement in net debt due to 
operating cash flows, after interest payments, tax 
payments, core capex and dividends, but excluding 
exceptional items, acquisitions, disposals and

Definition
Fixed charge cover is calculated using the 
formula EBITDAR (operating profit before 
depreciation, amortisation, rent and exceptionals)

reflect Greene King’s reputation for delivering 
authentic hospitality to its customers. 
We have completed the integration of 
Belhaven, maintaining business continuity 
and capturing anticipated synergies of £1m 
per annum. Belhaven has been a great success 
story for Greene King. Profits have increased 
by 77% since the 2005 acquisition, following 
another good year this year. Investment in 
Scotland continues: our new brewhouse 
opened for business in May 2011 and we 
acquired another four Retail pubs in the 
year. I am confident that the fully integrated 
Scottish operations will continue to be 
successful going forward. As a result of this 
integration, our Business Review is presented 
on the basis of the post integration model.
Strategy update
Our strategy for growth is three-fold: first, 
expanding the number of sites in Retail, 
our biggest and fastest growing division, to 
1,100, and improving the overall quality of 
the estate; second, reducing our tenanted 
and leased business to around 1,200 sites, 
and taking more control over the offer in the 
core estate; and third, increasing investment 
and driving growth of our core ale brands. 
Following good progress in the year, we 
remain on track to meet our targets. 
Retail expansion
We started the year with 888 sites and 
ended the year with 915 sites. We acquired, 
or transferred in from Pub Partners, 39 sites 
and disposed of a small number of sites, 
mainly from the value high street segment. 
In addition, we exchanged on eight 
greenfield sites. All acquisitions should 
improve the overall quality of the Retail 
estate by either driving greater exposure 
to the eating out market or driving the 
premiumisation of our overall offer. The net 
acquisition cost of the acquired sites was 
£130.7m and these acquired sites are expected 
to deliver an average site EBITDA of £436.4k, 
more than double the average for the 
existing estate. 
We acquired Cloverleaf Restaurants on 
28 January 2011 for £55.7m. Cloverleaf 
consists of 12 freehold, food-led sites, 
delivering, at the time of the acquisition, an 
average weekly turnover (AWT) of c.£40k 
and average EBITDA per site of c.£540k. 
Food is 69% of sales. Cloverleaf brings us 
carvery expertise and another concept to 
expand through our new-build programme. 
The Cloverleaf pipeline of new sites will 
deliver a minimum of ten additional sites 
trading by the end of April 2013 and we are 
looking to expand the concept further south 
and into Scotland. 
We acquired Realpubs on 27 April 2011 for 
£52.2m. Realpubs consists of 14 London pubs, 
all but one freehold, trading a well developed 
premium pub dining concept. AWT is c.£25k 
and EBITDA per site is c.£450k. Food is 
currently 33% of sales and growing strongly. 
We are looking to work closely with the 
team at Realpubs to spearhead our premium 
growth by converting a number of Greene 
King London pubs to the Realpubs concept, 
acquiring additional sites in London and 
expanding the Realpubs concept outside 
of the M25. 
Tenanted quality improvement
We reduced the number of tenanted 
and leased pubs by 4% and grew average 
EBITDA per pub in Pub Partners by 1.9%. 
We are increasingly operating Pub Partners 
as a more customer focused business, 
becoming more directive and influential 
over our licensees’ offers. This is reflected in 
the agreement innovation we have delivered 
in the year, including the launch of Blueprint, 
our new and innovative franchise-style 
agreement, which is delivering site profit 
increases of £65-£70k per annum. We are 
recruiting better quality licensees through 
a more demanding recruitment process, 
we are reducing direct licensee support 
and we have increased investment in our 
pubs by 33%. 
Core ale brand growth and investment
In the year we launched ‘Man Deserves 
a Proper Pint’, a £1m media campaign for 
Greene King IPA. The campaign is expected 
to reach around 14m men through the 
national press and male targeted magazines. 
We also increased our ‘above-the-line’ media 
investment in Belhaven Best with a new TV 
advertising campaign. Greene King IPA is 
the official beer of England Rugby and 
Old Speckled Hen sponsors prime time 
on the Dave TV Channel. Total investment 
in our brands in the year was £6.8m. business review

Greene King Retail has again demonstrated its 
ability to generate profitable, industry-leading 
sales growth, both through underlying organic 
growth and by growing the size and quality 
of its estate. Revenue was £710.7m, up 8.1% 
on last year on 1.5% more sites. LFL sales 
growth was 4.9%. Operating profit was 
£132.0m, up 11.2% on last year with operating 
margins growing 60bps in the year. In the 
year, all brands and segments performed 
well, as did all strategic growth categories, 
including food, wine, soft drinks, coffee 
and cask ale.
Our strong growth has been achieved 
through a focus on three strategic pillars: 
1.  delivering the best VSQ in the industry 
to drive volume and value growth;
2.  investing behind our food offer to drive 
industry-leading growth and a greater 
share of the sales mix; and
3.  focusing on operating branded and 
segmented offers.
Value, service and quality
We only operate pubs, restaurants or 
hotels if they can deliver the best VSQ in 
their markets to drive both organic volume 
and value growth. We have improved value 
across the estate through menu management, 
targeted promotional activity and known 
value item (KVI) drink pricing. We have 
enhanced our service standards as measured by  Business review

Food
The eating out market in the UK is

deliver long-term growth. Greene King is 
outperforming the market with food sales 
in the year of £263m, up 13% on last year,

over 36m meals, of which two million were 
fish & chips, and food is now almost 40% 
ofsales with food-related sales approaching 
60%. We are investing in kitchen 
improvements to drive higher maximum 
cover turns and improve service standards. 
Our growing scale, which has facilitated 
moving to a central distribution (CD) system 
in Local Pubs, taking the total food 
distributed through CD to 94%, and 
increasing buying and food development 
expertise, are allowing us to offset rising 
cost pressures. And, we are acquiring 
food-led businesses, such as Cloverleaf, 
and expanding existing food-led brands, 
such as Eating Inn and Hungry Horse.
Branding and segmentation
Greene King Retail operates a focused branded 
and segmented structure. In Destination 
Pubs, every pub or restaurant is branded, 
operating a strict, centralised commercial 
and operating structure. Each brand appeals 
to specific segments of the population and 
is targeted at specific occasions during the 
week. In Local Pubs, we operate under a 
segmented operating policy, but each pub 
appeals to a broad cross-section of the local 
community and each house manager has 
significant opportunity to stamp their own 
flair and imagination on each business, to 
cater for specific local needs. This brand 
and segmented approach gives us significant 
buying scale, facilitates a higher level of 
customer understanding and analysis, and 
simplifies our acquisition strategy and capital 
expenditure programme. All brands have 
their own market positions and are taking 
market share.
Destination Pubs
It was another strong year in Destination 
Pubs. Hungry Horse delivered good growth, 
with LFL sales up over 10% for the third 
year running and average weekly turnover 
(AWT) up 7 .0% to £19.0k. VSQ improvements 
delivered cover growth of 17%, with further 
dish innovation such as the ‘Leaning Tower 
of Pizza Burger’.  business review

covers up 32%. We made another step-change 
in product quality including introducing 
‘hand-battered’ Fish & Chips. 
In Mainstream, LFL sales growth accelerated 
in the second half of the year driven by strong 
growth in food sales with spend per head

Pub Partners has delivered profit per pub 
growth and made good progress in further 
improving the quality of its agreements, its 
licensees, their offers and its pubs. This was 
in the context of another challenging year 
for the tenanted and leased sector and the 
successful integration of the Belhaven 
tenanted estate. Our strategy to reduce the 
size and improve the quality of the estate is 
on track. We are also driving customer focus 
throughout Pub Partners, have launched, 
and embedded into the business, our new 
BII accredited Code of Practice, and we have 
recently won the HIM Tenant Tracker Pub 
Company of the Year, based on a survey 
of licensees across the industry. 
Revenue was £166.4m, up 1.7% on a per 
pub basis, while operating profit was £74.5m, 
up 1.5% on a per pub basis. In the original

Business Development Manager Training
Pub Partners has developed a training 
programme for their Business Development 
Managers to ensure that they provide 
first class business consultancy advice to 
their licensees. T welve Pub Partners BDMs 
are taking a post graduate diploma in 
multi site retailing with Birmingham City 
Business School, with the remainder 
commencing it in October 2011. 
Mike Mannion, BDM in the South says, 
“I’ve been in this business for 16 years 
so have plenty of experience. 
But the Post Graduate Diploma is 
helping me support my licensees much 
more strategically, planning long term 
for the future rather than just 
considering the next couple of years”.
Recruiting and retaining the best licensees 
to run our pubs remains the most important 
factor in a successful tenanted and leased 
business. W e have upweighted our recruitment 
team and campaigns, with particular focus 
on our online programme, and we have 
toughened the recruitment process, including 
holding final interviews for every prospective 
licensee with an operations director and 
delivering mandatory training for all new 
licensees. By the year-end, we were receiving 
seven enquiries for each vacancy in the 
English estate, compared to four at the end 
of the first half, while licensee churn fell 
six percentage points. Including Belhaven, 
there were just seven pubs closed for 
reopening and 76 TAWs at the year-end, 
while bad debt was 0.7% of sales.

competition with

its agreements, including:
1.  Blueprint – a franchise-style agreement 
within which Pub Partners directs and 
controls the product offer, driving a 
minimum forecast franchisee profit 
of £45k per year;
2.  Business Builder – lower wholesale 
prices are linked to VSQ contracts with 
licensees and Pub Partners invests up 
to £15k; and
3.  Local Hero – the pub is transformed into 
a ‘local’ pub, selling local ales and local 
food, supported by local licensees and

Customer satisfaction survey
Long term licensees, Dave and Trish 
McManus have run their upmarket 
destination food pub, The Hare Arms, 
for 35 years. They welcomed the 
initiative , using the results to reward 
great service and improve their offer.
Speaking about it, Trish said, “The 
mystery shops are a very good idea. 
When you get such great results back, 
it’s a big boost for our team. Our recent 
survey highlighted some areas in our 
garden which could be improved. 
We took that honest feedback on board 
and now keep an even closer eye on 
maintaining really high standards outside. 
It was helpful to bring that to our 
attention and make us see what our 
customers were seeing. 
Having a fresh pair of eyes look around 
the pub and giving you their honest, 
impartial advice is certainly helpful. 
It means we can make small changes to 
maintain the high standards for which 
we have become renowned and which 
our customers expect.”
Investment in our pub estate, to support 
our agreement innovation and our efforts to 
improve returns for both Pub Partners and 
its licensees, has increased 33% to £16.3m. 
Our investments are strategic and focused 
on improving the long-term profitability 
of an outlet, through improving both the 
external décor and the internal facilities, 
particularly by improving the provision of 
food. The average return on expansionary 
capital was 37%.
There are 60 of these agreements in place, 
with a further 150 planned for the new 
financial year. This would take the share 
of the core estate under an element of 
Greene King control to almost 20%. 
We are also unique amongst our main 
competitors in two innovative ways. 
First, we have introduced a mystery 
customer programme, called ‘Missing 
Something’, to improve service levels and 
encourage return visits and spend per head. 
Second, we have introduced a diploma for 
our Business Development Managers (BDM) 
in Multi-Unit Leadership in conjunction 
with Birmingham City University. The first 
group of our BDMs, across England and 
Scotland, have already started using their 
learnings from the course to improve their 
ways of working and effectiveness in the 
business, to the benefit of our licensees.

Current trading and outlook
Trading conditions in this calendar year 
have been variable and recently this has 
been even more pronounced. As we have 
previously reported, April was unusually

expenditure in May. June has seen more 
normalised trading, notwithstanding the 
tough comparatives with last year’s 
World Cup. 
In the first eight weeks of our new financial 
year, Retail LFL sales growth is 1% with 
underlying LFL growth, excluding the impact 
of the World Cup, of 3%; Pub Partners average 
EBITDA per pub growth is 1% with LFL 
EBITDA at -1%; and core brand own-brewed 
volume in Brewing and Brands is -2%. 
We anticipate another challenging year as 
continued high inflation and the impact 
of government cutbacks limit consumer 
spending power. Despite this, we remain 
confident of the prospects for Greene King 
as our Retail expansion strategy and strong 
group-wide operational performance, 
driven by value, service and quality, will 
underpin another year of growth and 
significant progress.

financial review
Summary of 
financial review
—  Revenue grew 6.0% to £1,042.7m.
—  EBITDA of £276.6m was up 4.6% 
on last year from 1.4% fewer pubs.
—  We agreed a new five-year £400m 
bank facility during the year. 
—  The total dividend for the year 
is up 7 .4% at 23.1p.
Revenue grew 6.0% to £1,042.7m from 
a 1.4% smaller estate. The main drivers 
were our Destination Pubs and Brewing 
and Brands divisions. Our continued focus 
on controlling costs and generating cash 
helped us to offset £3.4m more than the 
£9.0m increase in non-wage costs and 
inflation, particularly in liquor, food and 
utilities. Central costs include an additional 
£1.8m share-based payment charge for 
the year. 
Operating margin was down 20bps to 21.3%, 
delivering operating profit before exceptionals 
of £222.0m, up 5.0% on last year. Adverse 
divisional mix was 40bps, of which half was 
mitigated in the year through operational 
actions. Underlying core profit growth was 
2.5%. All pub businesses grew profits on a 
per pub basis, while Brewing and Brands 
achieved strong profit per barrel growth.
Interest costs of £82.0m were 7 .1% lower 
than the same period last year, as a result 
of strong cash flow management and a 
smaller IFRS pension interest charge of 
£0.2m. Profit before tax and exceptionals 
was £140.0m, an increase of 13.8% on last 
year. The tax charge before exceptional 
items of £36.4m equates to an effective 
tax rate of 26.0%. 
Earnings per share of 48.2p is up 11.1%, 
notwithstanding the slightly higher effective 
tax rate and a small increase in the average 
number of shares in issue. 
Cash flow 
Continuing to focus on generating strong 
cash flows is the key to providing options 
and flexibility for the group. We delivered 
EBITDA of £276.6m, up 4.6% on last year, 
from 1.4% fewer pubs. With another year 
of strong working capital management 
delivering a cash inflow of £15.9m, we have 
further improved our cash platform, allowing 
us to maintain investment levels in the core 
estate for both maintenance and expansionary 
purposes, to pay down debt (comfortably 
ahead of our normal amortisation) and to 
pay increasing dividends to shareholders. 
This remains a consistent part of our 
long-term financial strategy.
Continued investment, expansion 
and disposals 
Capital expenditure across the group, 
excluding investment in acquired sites, 
was £71.9m, slightly ahead of last year. 
This investment, across over 383 schemes 
in the year, benefited our business in both 
the short-term and the long-term by 
delivering a return on investment in excess 
of 20% in Retail and over 30% in Pub Partners. 
We completed the disposal of 108 trading 
and non-trading assets, realising £27 .8m net 
proceeds at a net profit of £3.6m over book 
value. The disposed and transferred pubs 
would have delivered an annualised EBITDA 
of £1.2m in Pub Partners. These actions 
helped to increase group ROCE by 40bps 
over last year. 
On 28 January 2011, we completed the 
purchase of Cloverleaf Restaurants for 
£55.7m. This bought us 12 high quality, 
food-led, freehold trading sites across the 
north of England and the Midlands and on 
an annualised outlet EBITDA multiple of 
8.7x. Cloverleaf will open a further ten sites 
from its pipeline by the end of FY13 at what 
is expected to be a higher level of EBITDA 
per site than the average for the existing 
twelve. This pipeline earmarks a further 
c.£25m of investment, which will comfortably 
deliver returns ahead of our cost of capital.
On 27 April 2011, we acquired Realpubs for 
£52.2m, which brought 14 premium London 
pubs, all but one freehold, into our Retail 
estate. Its well developed premium offer is 
expected to deliver average EBITDA per 
site of £450k, with returns ahead of our 
cost of capital in year one.

We also exchanged on four greenfield sites 
for development into food-led retail pubs, 
in addition to the Cloverleaf pipeline, 
which will begin trading in 2011/12.
Financing and treasury
Net debt at the year-end was £1,410.2m, 
an increase of £62.1m from the previous 
year-end, having invested £131.2m in 
expanding Retail with new and 
greenfield sites. 
Our high quality and primarily freehold 
assets support £1,355m of securitised 
bonds with a flat debt service profile 
and amortisation of £24.9m in the year.
On 4 April 2011, we announced a new five-year , 
£400m, revolving, credit facility with our 
banking partners, starting in April 2011. 
This replaced the existing £400m facility, 
which was due to expire in April 2012, and 
is fully available for five years. At the year-end, 
and following our recent acquisitions, this 
was £110m drawn.
The new facility, alongside our securitised 
debt, gives an expected blended average 
interest rate of 6.1%. This continued 
financial flexibility underpins the ongoing 
retail expansion and growth strategy.
During the period, there was a further 
improvement in our overall credit metrics, 
with interest rate hedges in place for 98% 
of the variable rate debt. Fixed charge cover 
improved to 2.6x, up from 2.4x at the last 
year-end, and interest cover likewise 
improved to 2.7x from 2.4x. Annualised net 
debt/EBITDA of 5.1x remains in our target 
area; it will continue to improve as cash 
outflows are invested ahead of the earnings 
stream they generate. Our securitised 
vehicle had a free cash flow debt service 
cover ratio of 1.5x at the year-end, giving 
27% headroom.
Dividend 
A recommended final dividend of 16.8p 
per share will be paid on 12 September to 
all shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 12 August. The total dividend 
for the year is up 7 .4% at 23.1p. The board 
continues to adopt a dividend policy 
targeting dividend cover of around two 
times underlying full year earnings.
Pensions
The group maintains a defined contribution 
scheme which is open to all new employees. 
The group’s three defined benefit schemes 
were all closed to new entrants by 2005. 
Under IAS19, the net pension liability was 
£45.7m, compared with £78.7m at the previous 
balance sheet date. As previously reported, 
the triennial valuations have been completed 
and, following constructive dialogue with 
the scheme trustees, the group has agreed 
to increase its cash contribution by £6.6m to 
£13.6m per annum, comfortably within the 
cash flow expectations for the group.
Exceptional items
We recorded £23.2m of exceptional charges 
during the year, as a result of their nature or 
size. We continue to review the pubs in the tail 
of our estate and recognised an impairment 
of £29.4m against the net book value of a small 
proportion of our estate, demonstrating the 
overall quality of our estate, while recognising 
some minor adjustments around specific sites. 
We achieved profit over book value on 
disposed pubs and other properties of 
£3.6m during the period. 
There is an additional £2.9m of charges for 
restructuring and acquisition, and a one-off 
exceptional gain of £5.5m for a pension credit. 
The pension credit has resulted following 
the curtailment of discretionary pension 
payments to members of the defined benefit 
pension scheme.

risks and uncertainties
This section highlights some of the 
key risks and uncertainties which affect 
Greene King, but it is not intended to be 
an exhaustive analysis of all risks facing 
the business. Formal risk management 
processes are in place to identify and 
evaluate risks, taking into account the 
likelihood of their occurrence, the scale 
of potential impact on the business and 
the impact of planned risk mitigation 
actions, so that risks can be ranked and 
actions suitably prioritised. Given that 
some risks are external and not fully within 
our control, the risk management processes 
are designed to manage risks which may 
have a material impact on our business, 
rather than to fully mitigate all risks.
Using a group-wide consistent approach, 
each business unit or functional area 
reviews its risks and mitigation plans 
on a regular basis, and draws up plans to 
manage new risks or gaps in mitigation 
plans. Progress of these risk implementation 
plans is monitored by senior management 
on a regular basis. In addition, a 
company-wide risk committee reviews in 
detail and monitors those risk mitigation 
plans, ensuring that plans work across the 
group as well as the sharing of best practice. 
Particular emphasis has been placed during 
the year on reviewing plans to deal with 
those risks which might arise from 
catastrophic events, and on emerging 
strategic risks. There has also been an 
increased focus on ensuring that risk 
mitigation plans are subject to 
independent review and audit.
At executive level, each of the risks has 
an identified owner to ensure senior 
management accountability for risk 
mitigation measures. Each business unit 
managing director or functional head 
presents a report to the audit committee 
once a year on the risk management 
processes for which they are responsible. 
The audit committee also reviews the 
company’s top risks, as set out on the 
group’s risk register, on an annual basis, 
prior to their submission to the board, 
which retains ultimate responsibility for 
the company’s risk management framework.
Alongside the production and distribution 
of our own beers, we work with a number of key 
suppliers (particularly in relation to food, lager 
and wines, spirits and minerals) and third party 
distributors to supply our pubs and restaurants. 
Supply chain risks
People risks
A failure to attract, retain, develop and motivate 
the best employees and tenants across all our 
managed and tenanted pubs, our brewing 
operations and our head office may impact 
our ability to deliver our operational and 
strategic objectives.
Economic risks
The group’s business operations are sensitive to 
economic conditions and in particular to levels 
of consumer spending. Any delay in economic 
recovery could affect consumer expenditure and 
therefore our revenue. There is an on-going risk 
to our business of increases in the cost of key 
products, including food, drink, Sky and utilities. 
Our licensees are also affected by the economic 
climate, leading to the risk of more tenant defaults 
and business failures. Property values are also 
impacted by the economic uncertainty, and with 
it our ability to continue to make disposals at 
appropriate values.
Operational risks
We are a consumer facing business with some 
well known national brands. Poor service standards 
and non-compliance with brand standards could 
lead to a loss of trade and a reduction in our 
perceived valuation by key stakeholders.
We are reliant on information systems and 
technology for many aspects of our business, 
which could be damaging if they were to fail 
for any length of time.
Financial risks
It is vital to the business that we continue to 
meet our financial covenants and to ensure that 
there is sufficient short term financing to meet 
our business needs. We are exposed to interest 
rate risk on the variable and floating rate 
components of our financing.
We are also reliant on maintaining sound systems 
of internal control to protect us from risk of financial 
fraud or material error in our financial statements. 
Risks
The last few years have seen an increased 
governmental focus on alcohol consumption, 
in regard to both its impact on the health of 
drinkers and law and order issues. There is a 
risk of further legislation in these areas, including 
additional taxation, which may adversely impact 
our business. 
A failure to comply with health and safety 
legislation, including in relation to food safety 
or fire safety, could lead to an incident which 
Regulatory risks
causes serious illness, injury or even loss of life 
to one of our customers, employees or tenants, 
in turn leading to a significant impact on 
our reputation.
The tied model in the UK has faced continuous 
scrutiny by various governmental bodies over the 
years and despite the EU block exemption and 
clean bills of health by the OFT, it could remain 
so in the future. Any changes to the model could 
impact our strategy and relations with our licensees.
Our business could be at risk of both interruption 
of supply and of failure of such key suppliers 
or distributors. Business review
25 Greene King plc Annual Report 2011 www.greeneking.co.uk
We have detailed risk mitigation and risk 
management plans in our internal production 
and distribution activities, including an on-going 
programme of testing the relevant disaster-recovery 
systems. We are always looking to improve and learn 
from other best-in-class operators in this area.
With regard to third-party suppliers, producers 
and supply chain partners, we review the disaster 
recovery plans of key suppliers regularly as well 
as our own back-up plans which are designed to 
ensure that we can cope in the event of the failure 
by or loss of a key supplier.
We also regularly review the financial position 
of our major suppliers to assess the risk of them 
ceasing to be able to trade and, with the help of 
external consultants, we monitor the financial 
stability of those we regard as of highest risk.
We aim to recruit the best people with the 
right skills and offer training and development 
programmes to ensure that we retain them. 
Remuneration packages are benchmarked to 
ensure that they remain competitive, including 
incentive arrangements where appropriate. 
There has been an increasing emphasis on 
succession planning across the group. 
We carry out an annual employee engagement 
survey to obtain direct feedback from our employees, 
and make sure that our businesses act on the results 
thereof to improve employee engagement.
Our licensee recruitment and training programmes, 
and the variety of rental agreements and support 
available, are designed to attract and retain the 
best quality licensees.
We have a diversified business encompassing 
brewing and drinks distribution, pubs and 
restaurants, with a wide range of offers targeted 
at different consumer groups, as well as a broad 
geographic spread. The board and the senior 
management team regularly review the impact 
of the economic conditions on the group’s budget 
and strategic plans. By emphasising excellent 
quality, service, value for money and up-to-date 
product offers, we aim to broaden our appeal 
to customers. 
All parts of our business are constantly reminded of 
the need to keep costs, including labour costs, down. 
Our purchasing team has successfully negotiated 
various contracts to protect us against significant 
increases in major cost items and a range of other 
techniques are also employed to keep costs down 
and protect us from price volatility.
The vital signs of our licensee health are constantly 
monitored and additional operational and financial 
support is provided to licensees where necessary 
and appropriate. The introduction and roll out 
of our new franchise agreement is designed to 
ensure that more of our tenants are able to run 
profitable businesses.
The long term value of each of our sites is 
regularly assessed. Decisions are made on a site 
by site basis around further improvements, 
operational focus for poorer performing sites, 
appropriate impairments where necessary and 
the active marketing of sites that no longer have 
long-term value for Greene King.
We endeavour to maintain tight controls to protect 
and enhance our reputation and brand values. We 
focus constantly on consistency and quality, with 
staff training, targeted investment programmes 
and mystery guest visits all designed to help maintain 
standards, and have systems in place to escalate 
and respond to relevant incidents. 
The introduction of PDAs for our Retail business 
development managers has helped improve the 
effective monitoring of brand standards.
A business continuity plan is in place to regularly 
review our critical business processes and ensure 
that we can continue to operate in the event of a 
major incident affecting our systems or technology. 
We have access to an off-site disaster recovery 
facility, which is regularly tested, in the event of 
a major issue with our head office or its systems.
Our performance against our financial covenants 
is regularly monitored. We also undertake detailed 
and regular stress-testing of our performance against 
those covenants. W orking capital is carefully forecast 
and closely managed. At the year end 98% of our 
floating rate debt was hedged through the use of 
derivative financial instruments, more details of 
which can be found in note 24 to the financial 
statements. During the year we successfully 
negotiated a new £400m 5 year bank facility.
We continue to move towards a single platform 
financial accounting system to unify the systems, 
processes and organisation of our finance teams. 
Our systems of internal control, which include 
segregation of duties and authority levels for 
expenditure and payments, are reviewed on a 
regular basis to ensure that they remain suitable.
Mitigation processes
We are committed to acting as a responsible 
retailer and engage actively with government to 
ensure that it recognises our belief that the safest 
and most responsible place to consume alcohol 
is in well-managed licensed on-trade premises. 
Internally we ensure that our training covers all 
aspects of licensing requirements and have due 
diligence in place to ensure that all our pubs 
comply with all relevant licensing legislation. 
We have a range of policies and procedures 
in place, including training and e-learning, the 
carrying out of risk assessments, reporting and 
regular monitoring, to ensure compliance with 
existing regulatory requirements in relation to 
health & safety, including food safety. Audits of all 
managed houses are carried out every year by an 
independent company to measure their performance 
against strict standards, and scores continue to 
improve year on year. All of our Retail sites have 
had an independent fire risk assessment completed 
during the year, whilst in Pub Partners we have 
continued to improve the systems in place to 
protect our assets, our brand and our tenants. 
We remain committed to the tied pub model and 
firmly believe that material changes to the tie, 
including its abolition, would lead to accelerated 
pub closures due to the higher costs of entry and 
ongoing overheads for licensees. Our new Code 
of Practice is designed to ensure that we continue 
to have a transparent and mutually beneficial 
relationship with our tenants. business review

We have made much progress over the past 
year with our CSR goals and, despite setting 
challenging targets, have achieved many 
of our aims. Last year we signed up to the 
Government’s Public Health Responsibility 
Deal (PHRD) which largely reflected our 
own aims and which now forms the basis 
of our target setting going forward.
This report covers our progress over the 
last financial year. Full details of our CSR 
policies and practices can be found in the 
Responsibility section of our website  
www.greeneking.co.uk.
Food safety and supply
In line with our commitment to the PHRD, 
and our own prior commitment to healthy 
choices, we have concentrated much of our 
effort on ensuring we are able to give our 
customers more choice, healthier options 
and lower fat alternatives, as well as on 
being able to deliver on our promises, 
namely around salt targets and trans 
fats in our dishes.
Salt targets
We have reviewed all of our core menu 
items across our Greene King pubs, hotels 
and restaurants and benchmarked them 
against the Government’s 2012 salt targets. 
Any products that do not comply with these 
guidelines are now being looked at with a 
view to either altering the recipe, where this 
is possible, or to removing them from our 
menus. In partnership with our suppliers 
we are putting a process in place to ensure 
all new products comply with the 2012 
targets before they enter our supply chain.
Trans fats
We have contacted all of our suppliers to 
gain positive confirmation that the food 
supplied to us is free of any artificial trans 
fats and are pleased to report that the 
majority of our suppliers have already 
removed these from their products. 
We are now in discussions with those 
suppliers that still use artificial trans fats 
in their products to ensure that they are 
removed from our food supply chain by 
the end of this year.
Allergen information
We now publish information on all the 
major allergens found in our core dishes, 
together with information on dishes that 
contain ingredients free from gluten. 
Working with Coeliac UK, we are currently 
finalising a training programme for house 
managers and chefs on allergens in food 
that will be delivered this summer/autumn 
and which will equip them with up-to-date 
knowledge and guidance on Government 
guidelines. Armed with this information, 
our teams will be able to help customers 
with their choices and address any concerns 
they may have. The training will also now 
form part of the manager induction process. 
In addition, we are designing a kitchen 
poster to highlight key actions to avoid 
cross-contamination during food preparation.
Healthy eating
Our Hungry Horse chain continues to 
innovate with new ‘female friendly and 
healthier choices’ dishes. This year saw the 
introduction of dishes such as bruschetta 
and a roasted chicken and sweet chilli wrap 
plus a new lower calorie section offering 
dishes of 600 calories or less. Over the next 
year we will be looking at further lower 
calorie options and the introduction of 
more salads.
Healthy children
Our popular pick ‘n’ mix menu for children has 
been extended to 7–10 year olds. The menu 
allows children and their parents to select 
healthier options such as mash instead of 
chips and also allows them an extra portion 
of vegetables without charge.
We now use free-range eggs across all of 
our managed pubs in England and Wales. 
Small steps 
High Park, Huddersfield (Hardy’s House) 
has been helping children understand the 
benefits of healthy eating by giving them 
the chance to help grow and harvest 
vegetables and herbs. Pak Choi, peppers, 
carrots, lettuce, leeks, onions, beetroot, 
chillies, tomatoes, cucumber, radishes 
and coriander were all grown in planters 
chosen and painted by the children. 
Once the crops were ready to harvest 
the children were able to use them at 
a ‘create a pizza’ session at the pub. www.greeneking.co.uk Greene King plc Annual Report 2011 27
Business review
Scores on the Doors
This year has seen both the extension of the 
Local Government environmental health 
departments’ grading system, ‘Scores on the 
Doors’ and with it a steep rise in the number 
of our pubs now graded good to excellent. 
Where schemes exist we now have 33 of our 
pubs with 5* Excellent scores and a further 
33 with 4* Good ratings.
The environmental impacts 
of our business
Our work on environmental matters has 
continued to focus on reducing our overall 
energy consumption, our water use, how 
we deal with our waste and reducing our 
emissions. Each year our data collection 
improves enabling us to be clearer about 
our progress and set more accurate targets. 
The year has seen us increase the number 
of our pubs, increase the amount of beer 
we have brewed and has seen some of the 
harshest winter weather for decades, all 
of which have had an impact in our overall 
energy consumption. Despite that, we have 
still made good progress.
Key achievements this year 
have included:
—  a reduction of 1.6% in the total amount 
of CO
2
 emissions, notwithstanding an 
increase in energy usage; 
—  a reduction of 7% in the amount of fuel 
used by company and leased vehicles; and
—  of the 25,000 tonnes of general waste 
we produced, we recycled over 63% 
(16,000 tonnes).
Our progress
We actively seek to reduce our energy use 
year on year. However, last year we were 
faced with one of the coldest winters for 
decades with heavy snow falls in November 
and December and that, combined with an

increase in the number and the size of our 
pubs and an increase in the amount of beer 
we brewed, led to an increase in our overall 
energy consumption of 0.4% to 412,443 
MWh. However, the mix between gas and 
electricity meant that overall our CO
2
 
emissions were actually down 1.6%. 
We used more water overall last year 
to brew more beer but still managed to 
reduce the amount of water used from 
4.4 barrels of water for every barrel of 
beer produced to 4.3 which represents a 
significant reduction from 2007/08, when 
we first began to report how efficiently 
we used water in the brewing process. 
Back then we were using 5.6 barrels of 
water for every barrel of beer brewed.
Last year we cut the amount of waste we 
produced and increased the amount we sent 
to recycling from 28% to 63%. The amount 
of cooking oil we collected and sent for 
recycling as biofuel also rose by 24% to 
1,106,000 litres.
Responsible retailing
Enjoy Responsibly
As part of our commitment to responsible 
retailing, we have launched an Enjoy 
Responsibly initiative to signpost our customers 
and consumers to our Enjoy Responsibly 
website (www.enjoyresponsibly.co.uk). 
The site contains useful advice and 
information in an easily accessible and 
non-judgmental way for anyone who 
is concerned about how much they are 
drinking. Our Enjoy Responsibly logo, 
incorporating the website address, is being 
rolled out on all our bottles, cans, packs, 
menus and drinks promotions.
Best Bar None
Our pub, the Frog and Parrot, Sheffield, 
was crowned overall Best Bar None (BBN) 
at a reception in the House of Lords earlier 
this year. The award recognised the pub as 
the most safe and responsible in the UK. 
The popular Frog and Parrot had already 
been named the best pub in Sheffield, and 
went on to compete against six other pubs 
and bars from across the country for the 
national title. The awards reward pubs for 
their safety and crime prevention measures. 
Judges were impressed by the pub’s choice 
of music, training, community atmosphere 
and its relationship with surrounding 
residents – the manager, Nick Simmonite, 
has fortnightly meetings with residents’ 
associations.
In addition, the Festing in Portsmouth was 
awarded Best Bar in category and Portsmouth 
Best Bar None 2010. Another of our pubs, 
the Turf Tavern, Carlisle, was a finalist in 
Carlisle’s BBN awards, missing out to the 
winners by one point. And in Scotland, the 
Gold winning Twa Tams, Perth was also a 
finalist in the national BBN Scotland awards.
This year we plan to continue to support 
BBN and have committed to ensure that 
all our pubs, where BBN schemes exist, 
have BBN accreditation. So far we have 
24 managed pubs signed up and a further 
125 of our managed pubs are also members 
of local Pubwatch schemes.
Don’t drink and drive
Hungry Horse and Pub Partners again 
supported the Government’s Christmas 
anti-drink drive campaign with their 
Designated Driver promotion. Four of our 
pubs were involved in regional launches 
by MPs. 
Safer by design
Whilst alcohol related violence has fallen by 
33% since 1997 , there remain 87 ,000 violent 
incidents involving glasses each year. Not only 
does this impact on the victims but also on 
families and communities and reportedly 
costs the NHS £2.7 billion a year. So, with an 
eye on both responsible retailing and customer 
safety we were delighted to be invited to take 
part in a trial to test, in a pub setting, a new  business review

toughened safety pint glass developed by Arc. 
The ‘Ultimate’ glass is designed to be both 
very hard to break and, if it should 
be broken, to disintegrate into tiny cubes 
of glass rendering it useless as a weapon. 
The glass, which has now been launched, 
could help provide both a safer drinking 
environment and a workable alternative 
to plastic glasses in outdoor settings.
The health and safety of our staff 
and customers
Earlier this year, our Bury St Edmunds 
brewery became the first brewery to open 
its doors to an unannounced audit by the 
British Retail Consortium. The audit looked 
at the quality of our ingredients and how 
we use by-products. As a result of the visit 
the brewery was awarded a Grade A*. Our 
Belhaven brewery has since undergone the 
same audit and here too we were awarded 
a Grade A*.
As part of our commitment to quality and 
to the improvement of our environmental 
impact, we subject ourselves to rigorous 
external auditing and are delighted that 
our brewing business has achieved the 
ISO 9001: 2008 and 14001: 2004 standards. 
These assurance standards reflect our 
obsession with quality and offer another 
layer of reassurance to pubs about the 
beer we deliver to them.

Focus 12 changing lives 
Focus 12 is an independent charity

facility with enabling clients to live in small 
independent living units that allow recovery 
to be as real an experience as possible. 
Greene King has forged closer links with 
the charity over the past few years and is 
described by the charity as being “hugely 
influential in assisting the charity to 
survive the enormous changes taking place 
in all areas of Social Care. Financial 
pressures affect all small charities and 
Focus 12 is indebted to the help provided 
by Greene King.” 
Greene King helps with management 
support, HR advice and fundraising events 
that have allowed the charity to thrive in 
difficult times. 
Commenting on Greene King’s involvement in 
the charity , Chip Sommers, said: “Everyone at 
Focus 12 recognises the brave and unusual 
step taken by Greene King in supporting a 
charity that deals with dependency. This 
socially responsible approach is both 
welcomed and applauded by all involved 
with our services.”

Safer drivers
Some of our success in retaining the RoSPA 
MORR award this year lies in our improved 
driver training and assessment system. All 
new entrants to the business who are either 
company car drivers, or are required to drive 
on company business, now go through driver 
training and assessment with Accufleet as 
part of their induction programme. The 
assessment helps drivers enhance their 
driving technique to improve road safety 
and fuel efficiency. We have also extended 
this approach to our LGV drivers.
Support for the communities 
in which we operate 
Last year our managed pubs, hotels 
and restaurants supported their local 
communities in a range of fundraising 
activities raising over £280,000 for various 
local and national charities and appeals. 
Our Loch Fyne Restaurants raised an 
additional £4,600 during 2010 for their 
national charity, the RNLI.
Our Brewing and Brands division held their 
first charity ball back in May 2010 as part 
of Greene King’s Real Food and Beer Festival 
in Bury St Edmunds. The event, which 
celebrated community heroes, raised over 
£12,000 for EACH (East Anglia Children’s 
Hospices) and Focus 12. 
Last year we donated £14,161 to The GREaT 
Foundation. Formerly known as the 
Responsibility in Gambling Trust, the GREaT 
Foundation was established as a charity 
in 2002 as Britain’s largest funding body 
responsible for tackling problem gambling 
through the funding of research, education 
and treatment from voluntary donations.
Providing a positive 
working environment
Our anonymous staff survey is an important 
tool which enables us to ‘test the temperature’ 
across the company and find out how our staff 
feel about being part of our team. This year 
around 50% of our 18,000 staff responded and 
shared their thoughts on roles, responsibilities, 
management, pay and benefits. 
We measure our progress in this area using 
an employee engagement score which we 
set at 3. However, this year we changed our 
survey provider to OCR International and 
with it the method of assessing employee 
engagement. With their help we set specific 
questions, with a proven link to engagement 
and benchmarked the overall rating with 
other retail businesses. For this year our 
overall score was 67%, which compared 
reasonably well to the retail benchmark 
and indeed our target, both 74%.
We have again this year offered all of our 
18,000 staff the opportunity to participate 
in our attractive share save scheme, which 
provides both an affordable savings scheme 
and, at the end of the three or five-year term, 
a stake in the company they work for. Business review

Franchise innovation gives licensees choice and certainty 
Pub Partners has launched a franchise-style 
agreement following a highly successful 
trial in nine pubs. The concept will be 
rolled out across 50 pubs within the leased 
and tenanted business over the next year 
and focuses on community town and 
suburban sites with growth potential. 
Developed around franchise principles 
the concept provides a proven pub package 
based on our extensive retail ‘know how’ 
and gives entrepreneurs a platform from 
which to grow a successful business with 
guaranteed returns.
David Knott and Robert Lamb, licensees 
at the Orange Tree in Braintree, were the 
first to trial the franchise agreement. 
Since conversion, the site has seen sales 
grow from £2.7k to over £10k net per week. 
David said: “This is fantastic as it allows 
you to walk straight into a pub and operate 
it successfully. You complete the training 
and follow the operating procedures and 
you have a busy pub. Everything has been 
developed to serve the community market. 
It’s operating your own business within a 
certain framework that’s not restrictive but 
gives you the support you need so the pub 
remains successful.”
Retaining, developing and attracting 
talent with fair and rewarding terms 
and conditions
Recruitment is a key area for our business 
to help ensure we have the right people to 
deliver our vision. This year we entered into 
a partnership with Job Centre UK to offer 
job trials to people considering a career in 
one of our businesses. Greene King is proud 
to be ‘BACKING YOUNG BRITAIN’ – the 
campaign to encourage businesses to provide 
more opportunities for young people through 
jobs, apprenticeships and work experience.
In our Local Pubs division, the work trial 
scheme which gives people who haven’t 
thought of working in a pub a chance to ‘try 
before they buy’, has seen 16 people who 
signed up through job centres offered jobs.
More recently the Government has 
launched a new apprenticeship scheme 
which Greene King has signed up to. Over 
300 of our employees have already applied 
for apprenticeships with us and of those 238 
have now started their training programmes. 
The remainder are going through the induction 
stage. At the end of the apprenticeships our 
team members will have a nationally 
recognised qualification, either Level 2 
Hospitality Services or Level 2 Kitchen 
Services. Our aim is that all of our full 
time team members hold this 
national qualification.
Building on the success of this scheme 
we plan over the next year to launch an 
advanced apprenticeship for supervisory 
and management teams that will lead to 
nationally recognised qualifications in 
team leading and management.
This year twelve of our business development 
managers began the first stage of the new 
Greene King BDM Post Graduate Diploma 
with Birmingham City Business School. 
The programme, which focuses on 
multi-site leadership, will take twelve 
months to complete. More of our business 
development managers will begin the 
programme in October.
Support for our tenants
Pub Partners, our tenanted and leased 
business, prides itself on working in 
partnership with our licensees and over 
the past year has developed a range of new 
ways of working and agreements designed 
to find the ‘best fit’ for each of our licensees. 
As part of our commitment to ensure 
new licensees have the best chance of 
success, we now insist that all new licensees 
attend three mandatory training courses 
prior to them taking a pub in our core 
estate. The courses are ‘Go for Growth 
Induction’, ‘Cellar Management’ and 
‘Finance’, all of which are designed to lay 
quality foundations on which new licensees 
can build their own business from day one.
In response to the parliamentary enquiry 
last year into tenanted and leased pub 
companies, all industry players were 
encouraged to introduce new Codes of 
Practice to ensure that their licensees 
clearly understood what to expect when 
they took on a pub. Pub Partners quickly 
rose to the challenge and produced a new 
code which swiftly gained British Institute 
of Innkeepers (BII) accreditation. The Code 
is now in force across most of our tenanted 
and leased estate. page heading

Priority Progress
A reduction in CO
2
 emissions in our 
existing estate of breweries, offices and 
managed houses on a like for like basis. 
We set a target of a 2.5% reduction on a like for like basis and achieved a reduction of 
2.4% despite one of the coldest winters for decades with heavy snow in November and 
December which increased our use of gas in order to heat our pubs, restaurants and hotels. 
Going forward we have set a target to further reduce our emissions next year by 4%.
A reduction in the amount of waste 
sent to landfill. 
We are working on our target that 80% of waste generated in our managed houses should 
not be sent to landfill by the end of calendar year 2011. Work is continuing on this challenging 
target and at the end of the first quarter of this year we were recycling 28% of our waste.
A reduction in water usage in our 
existing estate of breweries, offices and 
managed houses on a like for like basis.
Over the past year we have achieved a reduction of 1.5% in our breweries and offices 
on a like for like basis. We had set ourselves a target to install AMR meters across the 
managed estate and set reduction targets for 2011/12. Unfortunately, a technical issue 
led the manufacturer to withdraw the meters which meant we were unable to achieve 
this target. However, once the technical issues are resolved, we will install the meters 
as planned.
An improvement in employee 
engagement demonstrated by our 
annual attitude survey.
This year we changed our survey provider to OCR International and with it the 
method of assessing employee engagement. With their help we have set specific 
questions, with a proven link to engagement and benchmarked the overall rating with 
other retail businesses. For this year, our overall score was 67% compared to the retail 
benchmark of 74%. Whilst we are pleased with the comparison to retail and with the 
score for our second year on a like for like basis, this is below our target of 74%. 
The provision of more information and 
choice for our customers to support a 
healthy and balanced diet and support 
the FSA ’s principles on healthy eating.
We challenged ourselves to extend our nutritional database across our estate to include 
our local pub menus which we have done. In addition to this nutritional information, 
we now also provide allergen information on all core menu items.
The provision, on all our children’s 
menus, of a choice of healthier meals, 
which are lower in fat and contain 
a portion of vegetables.
We pledged to increase the range of healthier items on the children’s menu and change 
the 7-10 years section to a ‘pick and mix’ style to provide more choice for healthier options 
which we have done. 
Compliance with our Challenge 21 
policy in all our managed houses.
Our target last year was to look at developing software to help our staff spot anyone trying 
to buy alcohol underage. We have worked with suppliers to develop and implement new 
software which not only prompts the bar tender to confirm on every transaction that the 
customer is over 18 but also now displays a date of birth 18 years ago so staff can see at a 
glance if someone is old enough. This automatically updates daily.
Going forward we are looking at further training for bar staff, possibly as part of an 
e-learning package. 
As part of our integration of our Belhaven business we are currently reviewing our 
systems in Scotland.
The introduction of measures to reduce 
the risk of underage drinking taking 
place in Greene King managed houses.
Last year we commissioned 104 independent test purchases in 51 of our managed pubs, 
thus meeting the target we set. For any that failed we introduced further training and 
additional test purchases to ensure compliance.
Continually strive to identify and 
reduce health and safety risks and to 
improve the safety of our premises.
We set a target of carrying out specialist third-party fire risk assessments in all of our 
managed houses and that any works required should be scheduled for completion 
according to risk. The risk assessments have been carried out and the process of 
completing any necessary works begun.
We have also worked on driving compliance in hygiene standards and procedures with 
the result that our third party hygiene audit scores have improved and the average score 
of our businesses is up by over 4%.

rigorous application of Challenge 21 
and Challenge 25).
Health and safety
We will continually strive to identify 
and reduce health and safety risks and 
to improve the safety of our premises. business review

1 Accounting policies
Corporate information
The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011 were authorised for issue by the board of directors 
on 29 June 2011. Greene King plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The company’s shares 
are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance
The group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the EU as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011 (prior year 52 weeks ended 2 May 2010) 
and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, 
except where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related party, 
Greene King Finance plc. Greene King Finance plc is a special purpose entity set up to raise bond finance for the group, which is 
consolidated as a quasi‑subsidiary. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent 
company with adjustments made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated, from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue to be 
consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year with the exceptions noted below.
Amendment to IFRS 2 – Group Cash‑ settled Share‑based Payment Arrangements
The amended standard affects the accounting for cash‑settled share‑based payment transactions and supersedes IFRIC 8 and IFRIC 11. 
The adoption of the amendment had no impact on the financial performance or position of the group.
IFRS 3 (Revised) Business Combinations effective 1 July 2009
The amended standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, but with certain significant changes. All payments to 
purchase a business will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with some contingent payments subsequently remeasured at fair 
value through the income statement. Goodwill and non‑controlling interests may be calculated on a gross or net basis. Non‑controlling 
interests can be calculated at either fair value or at a share of net assets determined on an acquisition by acquisition basis. All transaction 
costs will be expensed. The revision to the standard has resulted in certain transaction costs which previously would have been capitalised 
and formed part of goodwill on acquisition being charged to the profit and loss account as exceptional acquisition costs, see note 5.
IAS 27 (Amended) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements effective 1 July 2009
The standard requires the effects of all transactions with non‑controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control. 
It will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses through the income statement. The revised standard also specifies the accounting 
when control is lost. Any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair value and a gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. 
The amendment to the standard has been applied prospectively and had no impact on the financial position or performance of the group. 
Significant accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight‑line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up 
to 50 years, and short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term 
of the lease or useful life of the asset. Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if 
residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value. Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives which range 
from three to 20 years.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, 
if appropriate, at each financial year end. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is de‑recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Profit or loss on de‑recognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, 
and is included in the income statement in the year of de‑recognition.

Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of 
the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date, fair value and the amount of any non‑controlling interest in the acquiree. 
The choice of measurement of non‑ controlling interest, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets, is determined on a transaction by transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are taken to the income statement.
When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation 
in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the 
separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred to the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes 
to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or a liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 
either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured 
until it is finally settled within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition‑date fair value of the consideration transferred 
and the amount recognised for the non‑controlling interest over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in exchange for the business combination. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, 
such as the settlement of pre‑existing relationships or post‑acquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for separately from the 
business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs. Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual‑legal 
or separability criterion, are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if 
the acquisition‑date fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisition‑date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non‑controlling 
interest is lower than the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre‑existing interest held in 
the business acquired, the difference is recognised in profit and loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the group’s cash generating units (or groups 
of cash generating units) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the 
acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the group 
at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and can not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with 
the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the 
operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion 
of the cash generating unit retained.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date 
has been carried forward as the carrying value. Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves. Such goodwill has not been reinstated 
and is not included in determining profit or loss on disposal.
Impairment
Property, plant and equipment
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows 
independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication of impairment. If an indication exists, the group makes 
an estimate of the recoverable amount of each asset group. An asset or cash generating unit’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair 
value less costs to sell and value‑in‑use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets, including goodwill. If there is an 
indication that any previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made 
only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised. 
The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of 
depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement. 
Details of the impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment are provided in note 14.
Goodwill 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of an operating segment. Where this is less than the carrying value of the operating 
segment an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.

Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables, held‑to‑maturity 
investments or available‑for‑sale financial assets. The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, 
where appropriate, re‑evaluates this designation at each financial year end. 
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the group’s beer. Trade loans are non‑derivative and are not quoted in an active 
market and have therefore been designated as ‘Loans and receivables’, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains 
and losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are de‑recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired. If there is evidence that an impairment loss 
has been incurred, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loan’s carrying amount and the expected future receipts 
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised 
in operating profit.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are de‑recognised 
when the group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash 
flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party. 
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full 
amount is no longer considered probable.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Raw materials are valued at average cost. Finished goods and work in 
progress comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short‑term deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less. For the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale
Property, plant and equipment is classified as held for sale only if it available for sale in its current condition, management are committed to 
the sale and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. Property, plant and 
equipment classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and is no longer 
depreciated or amortised.
Interest‑bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition, 
interest‑bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Finance costs and income
Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method. Finance income is recognised in the income 
statement using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds. 
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent 
measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge 
accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception. Documentation must include the 
group’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged. 
The group also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine 
whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective. 
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability), or cash flow (hedging the 
variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction). The group uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedge accounting
The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised directly in equity, whilst any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, 
unless the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non‑financial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the 
initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously 
recognised in equity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss. If the hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. Financial statements

Significant accounting policies continued
Trade payables
Trade payables are non‑interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect of the time value of money is material, using a pre‑tax discount rate that 
reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amortisation of the discount is 
recognised as a finance cost.
Pensions and other post‑employment benefits 
Defined benefit pension schemes 
The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered 
funds. The cost of providing benefits under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial 
method on an annual basis. The current service cost is charged to operating profit. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in 
the group statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight‑line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have 
vested. When a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are re‑measured and the resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in the income statement in the same period.
The interest cost on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are shown as a net amount on the face of the group 
income statement. 
The defined benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes’ obligations, less past 
service costs not yet recognised, and less the fair value of scheme assets. Defined benefit assets are restricted to the extent that they are 
considered recoverable.
Defined contribution pension schemes
The cost of the group’s defined contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made. Contributions are charged to the 
income statement as they become payable.
Post‑employment healthcare benefit 
The group also provided certain additional post‑employment healthcare benefits to employees which are unfunded. The cost of providing 
these benefits is determined on the same basis as the defined benefit pension schemes. 
Share‑based payments
Certain employees and directors receive equity‑settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over 
shares. The fair value of the shares and options granted are measured using a Black‑Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted. 
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions (service and performance), other than market conditions 
(performance linked to the price of the shares of the company). Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee 
to become fully entitled to an award are considered non‑vesting conditions. Like market performance conditions, non‑vesting conditions 
are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value. The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee 
expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant 
vesting date. The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the 
estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest. The periodic charge or credit is the movement in the 
cumulative position from beginning to end of that period. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest provided vesting is not conditional on market or non‑vesting conditions. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in calculating earnings per share figures.
In accordance with the exemption allowed under IFRS 1 for first time adopters, no expense is recorded in respect of grants made under the 
above schemes prior to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by the date of transition to IFRS. However later modifications of such 
equity instruments are measured using IFRS 2.
Own shares
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The group has an employee benefit trust for the 
granting of shares to applicable employees.  
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares 
is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. No gain 
or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Revenue 
Generally, revenue represents external sales (excluding taxes) of goods and services, net of discounts. Revenue is recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding 
discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty relating to brewing and packaging of certain products. Revenue principally consists of 
drink, food and accommodation sales, which are recognised at the point at which goods or services are provided, rental income, which is 
recognised on a straight‑line basis over the lease term and machine income, where net takings are recognised as earned.

Operating leases 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases. Lease payments are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight‑line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet as 
current (the portion relating to the next financial period) or non‑current prepayments. These are amortised on a straight‑line basis over the 
lease term.
Taxes 
Income tax
The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax. It is calculated 
using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided for using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of 
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss or, in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that it 
is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax 
losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are 
reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the 
deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are defined as items of income or expense which, because of their nature, size or expected frequency, merit separate 
presentation to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the period.
New standards and interpretations not applied 
As at 1 May 2011 there are a number of standards and interpretations that were issued by the IASB and IFRIC with an effective date after 
the date of these financial statements and which have not been early adopted by the group. These are expected to be applied as follows: 
IAS 12 Income Taxes (Amendment) – Deferred Taxes: Recovery of underlying assets
This amendment, effective on or after 1 January 2012 introduces the requirement that deferred tax on non‑ depreciable assets measured 
using the revaluation model in IAS16 should be measured on a sale basis.  
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures (Amendment) 
The amended standard, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, clarifies the definition of a related party 
to simplify the identification of related party relationships, particularly in relation to significant influence and joint control.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure (Amendment)
This amendment, effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011, requires additional quantitative disclosures relating to 
transfers of financial assets.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement 
The standard is the first phase in the IASB’s work to replace IAS 39 and applies to the classification and measurement of financial assets 
as defined in IAS 39. This will represent a change in reporting where an entity has designated liabilities using the fair value option.
IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement (Amendment)
The amendment provides guidance on assessing the recoverable amounts of a net pension asset. It permits the treatment of the prepayment 
of a minimum funding requirement as an asset.
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments 
The interpretation clarifies that equity instruments issued to a creditor to extinguish a financial liability qualify as consideration paid. 
The equity instruments issued are measured at the fair value, unless this cannot be measured reliably, in which case they are measured 
at the fair value of the liability extinguished. Any gain or loss being recognised immediately in the income statement.
These standards and interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on the group’s financial position or performance. Financial statements

1 Accounting policies continued
Significant accounting judgments and estimates 
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of 
accounting policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. The group bases its estimates and judgments 
on historical experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events. Actual 
results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions considered to be significant are detailed below: 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
The group determines whether property, plant and equipment is impaired where there are indicators of impairment. This requires an 
estimation of the value‑in‑use of the cash generating unit that the assets are grouped within. Value‑in‑use calculations require assumptions 
to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
Note 14 describes the assumptions used in the impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the 
sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Impairment of goodwill
The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis. Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are 
shown in note 13. This requires an estimation of the value‑in‑use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. 
Value‑in‑use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit and 
choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. If the actual cash flows are lower than 
estimated, future impairments may be necessary.
Business combinations
The group identifies separate assets and liabilities upon acquisition and recognises those assets at their fair value. The assessment of fair 
value, particularly for property, plant and equipment acquired, is undertaken with reference to current market trends. 
Note 17 describes the business combinations in the current year and provides details of the fair value adjustments made in arriving at the 
fair value of assets and liabilities acquired.
Residual values 
Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends. If residual values were lower than estimated, 
an impairment of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required. Useful lives are reassessed annually which 
may lead to an increase or reduction in depreciation accordingly.
Pension liabilities 
The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are 
disclosed in note 9. Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities. Note 9 describes the key 
assumptions used in the accounting for retirement benefit obligations.
Taxation 
Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined 
until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will 
be obtained. Tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise. The group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to 
assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
Share based payments
Judgment is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the group’s share based payment plans. Note 8 describes the 
key assumptions and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values. In addition estimates are made of the number of 
awards that will ultimately vest, judgment is required in relation to the probability of meeting non‑market based performance conditions 
and the continuing participation of employees in the plans.
Property provisions 
The group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where 
rental expenses is in excess of income. The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the experience of internal 
and external property experts. However changes to the expected method of exiting from the obligation could lead to changes in the level 
of provision recorded.
2 Segment information
On 3 December 2010 the group announced that the Belhaven business segment would be fully integrated into Greene King. Changes to the 
management structure took place in January 2011. The integration took place progressively from this date and, accordingly, we have disclosed 
below the segmental analysis based on the current structure. 
As a result of this change the group now has the following three reportable segments that are largely organised and managed separately 
according to the nature of products and services provided, brands, distribution channels and profile of customers:
Retail: Managed houses and restaurants
Pub Partners: Tenanted houses
Brewing and Brands: Brewing beer, marketing and selling
These are also considered to be the group’s operating segments and are based on the information presented to the chief executive who is 
considered to be the chief operating decision maker.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis.

Exceptional operating costs
Exceptional divisional restructuring and financial systems integration costs are items of one‑off expenditure incurred in connection with the 
restructuring of certain trading segments within the group and the review of group‑wide financial systems. 
Acquisition costs are items of one‑off expenditure incurred in connection with acquisition of businesses in the year. These costs include legal 
and professional fees incurred by the group and stamp duty which in accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised) can no longer be included within the 
consideration for the acquisition. In addition as, as detailed in note 17 , acquisition costs include a charge of £0.3m relating to amounts payable 
to the former owners of Cloverleaf Restaurants.        
The pension credit has resulted following curtailment to discretionary pension payments paid to members of the defined benefit pension scheme 
retiring early.
The net profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment of £3.6m (2010: £1.0m) comprises a total profit on disposal of £8.3m (2010: £5.0m) 
and a total loss on disposal of £4.7m (2010: £4.0m).       
During the prior year the group received a refund of £7m from HMRC in respect of VAT on gaming machines which was recognised as 
exceptional income. The decisions that resulted in this refund have been referred to the European Court of Justice and the case will be heard 
on 30 June 2011. Should HMRC be successful in their appeal the group would be required to repay the refund with interest, and as such this 
represents a contingent liability. An exceptional gain of £6.8m net of associated costs was recognised.
Exceptional finance costs
During the year ended 2 May 2010 the group repurchased securitised debt with a nominal value of £30.3m recognising a net gain of £13.5m.
Following the receipt of the proceeds of the rights issue and the subsequent repurchase of securitised debt certain interest swaps were no longer 
deemed to be effective hedges. All ineffective swaps were cancelled during the period to 2 May 2010 resulting in an exceptional charge of £3.3m.
Exceptional tax
The tax credit on indexation of properties represents the tax impact of movements in RPI during the period on the tax base cost of properties.
The Provisional Collector of Taxes Act 1968 reduced the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 26% from 1 April 2011. The effect of the new rate 
is to reduce the deferred tax provision by a net £9.1m, comprising a credit to the group income statement of £12.9m and a debit to group 
statement of comprehensive income of £3.8m.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods is in respect of deferred taxation on revaluation and rolled over gains on land and buildings.

8 Share based payment plans
The group operates two types of share‑based payment arrangements: a senior management long‑term incentive plan (LTIP) and a general 
employee share option plan (SAYE). In the prior periods executive share option plans (ESOS) have also been operated.
The general terms of each plan are detailed in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 84 to 86. All are equity settled. 
The total charge recognised for the period arising from share based payment transactions including National Insurance contributions is £3.5m 
(2010: £1.7m). A corresponding credit of £3.0m (2010: £1.7m) has been recognised in equity.
The fair value of equity‑settled options and LTIP contingently issued shares are estimated using a Black‑Scholes model. The fair value 
of the grants and model inputs used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period were as follows:

Expected life (years)         3.0 3.3
Weighted average fair value of grants in the year       358p 133p
Risk‑free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life. Expected volatility is 
based on historical volatility of the company’s share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of future 
trends. Expected life of options has been taken as the mid‑point of the relevant exercise period. This is not necessarily indicative of future 
exercise patterns.
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement.
Movement in outstanding options and rights during the period is as follows:

ESOS, SAYE and LTIP
Options were exercised on a range of dates. The weighted average share price through the period was 441p in 2011 and 431p in 2010.
The rights outstanding at 1 May 2011 under the LTIP had an exercise price of £nil (2010: £nil) and a weighted average remaining contractual 
life of 1.7 years (2010: 1.9 years).
The outstanding options for the ESOS scheme had an exercise price between 296p and 746p (2010: 370p – 1087p) and for the SAYE scheme 
between 274p and 694p (2010: 274p and 694p).
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 5.7 years for the ESOS (2010: 6.3 years) and 2.7 years for the SAYE scheme (2010: 3.1 years).
9 Pensions
The group maintains a defined contribution scheme, which is open to all new employees, and three defined benefit schemes. 
The group also has a past service liability in relation to post‑employment medical benefits offered to employees to cover any medical costs 
after employment. The benefit is no longer given to new employees.
Defined contribution pension scheme
Member funds for the defined contribution scheme are held and administered by the Prudential Assurance Company. The total cost 
recognised in operating profit for the period was £1.6m (2010: £1.6m).
Defined benefit pension schemes and post‑employment benefits
The group maintains the following defined benefit schemes which are all closed to new entrants and have had full actuarial valuations in the 
last three years: Greene King Pension Scheme (closed 2 May 1997 , last valued 5 April 2009), Belhaven Pension Scheme (closed 31 October 2005, 
last valued 4 May 2008), and the Hardys & Hansons Pension Scheme (closed 1 July 2003, last valued 30 April 2009). During 2010 the Morland 
Pension Scheme (closed 12 December 2000, last valued 5 April 2006) merged with the Greene King Pension Scheme.
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the group’s finances and are administered by 
pension trustees. Pension benefits are related to members’ final salary at retirement and their length of service.
The group has opted to recognise all actuarial gains and losses immediately via the statement of comprehensive income.
The total cost recognised in the income statement was:
         Pension schemes  P os t ‑ emplo yment benefits

During the year there was a curtailment to discretionary pension payments paid to members of the defined benefit pension scheme who retire 
early resulting in an exceptional credit to the income statement of £5.5m (see note 5).
The total charge recognised in the statement of comprehensive income was:

In July 2010 the government changed the statutory rate of inflation to which pension increases are linked from RPI to CPI. The effect of this 
change on the group’s pension schemes was to reduce the total liability by £3.7m. This adjustment has been reflected as part of the actuarial 
gain on scheme liabilities arising from changes in actuarial assumptions.
The total contributions to the defined benefit pension schemes in the following period are expected to be £13.3m (2010: £7 .6m) for the group. Financial statements

Defined benefit pension schemes and post‑employment benefits continued
The values of the schemes’ liabilities have been determined by a qualified actuary based on the results of the last actuarial valuation, updated 
to 1 May 2011 using the following principal actuarial assumptions:
           2011 2010
Discount rate          5.4% 5.5%
Expected rates of salary increases        4.3% 4.5%
Expected pension payment increases        3.2% 3.4%
Rate of inflation (RPI)         3.3% 3.4%
Rate of inflation (CPI)         2.8% —
Healthcare cost increase         9.0% 9.0%
The mortality assumptions imply the following expectations of years of life from age 65:
Man currently aged 40         23.0   23.4 
Woman currently aged 40          25.7   26.0 
Man currently aged 65          21.1   21.0 
Woman currently aged 65          23.9   23.8 
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables adjusted for scheme experience and with an allowance for future improvement in life expectancy . 
Overall expected rate of return on assets is established by applying brokers’ forecasts to each category of scheme asset.
The net liability of the schemes and other post‑employment benefit, as recognised in the balance sheet, is summarised below:

Factors that may affect future tax charges
In addition to the reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 26% during the period it is proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum 
to 23% by 1 April 2014. These further reductions had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and consequently are not included 
in these financial statements. The effect of these proposals would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by a further £13.2m.

12 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of £106.8m (2010: £79.9m) by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the period (excluding own shares held) of 214.8m (2010: 211.3m). 
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on a similar basis taking account of 0.6m (2010: 0.9m) dilutive potential shares under option, 
giving a weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect of dilution of 215.4m (2010: 212.2m). Share options granted over 
0.6m (2010: 2.4m) have not been included because they are anti‑dilutive at the year end. The performance conditions for share options 
granted over 1.9m (2010: 2.5m) shares have not been met in the current financial period and therefore the dilutive effect of the number of 
shares which would have been issued at the period end have not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. 
Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effect of exceptional items and is presented to show the underlying performance of the group 
on both a basic and dilutive basis.

Acquired through business combinations (note 17)        26.1 
At 1 May 2011           705.8 
All goodwill was purchased as part of business combinations. As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer 
amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments, the lowest group of cash generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored 
internally, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated £330.5m (2010: £259.5m) to Retail, £160.8m (2010: £152.3m) to Pub Partners, £214.5m 
(2010: £138.7m) to Brewing Company, and £nil (2010: £129.2m) to Belhaven. 
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined based on a value‑in‑use calculation, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount. 
The key assumptions used for all operating segments are: the pre‑tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 9.0% (2010: 9.0%), 
which is based on the group’s weighted average cost of capital and is used as an approximation for the risk‑adjusted cost of capital of the 
relevant operating segment; and the projected cash flows beyond the one year budgets are extrapolated using an average growth rate of 
2.0% (2010: 2.0%) which is below the long‑term average growth rate for the industry. Other commercial assumptions relating to market 
growth, market share and sales prices have been made based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects. 
The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for pre‑tax discount rate and growth rate. Neither a 1% decrease 
in assumed growth rate nor a 1% increase in the discount rate applied or a 10% reduction in budgeted cashflows would have led to an 
impairment of goodwill in the current period. Financial statements

The licensed estate relates to properties, and assets held within those properties, licensed to trade (i.e. managed, tenanted and leased houses).
Other assets relate to property, plant and equipment associated with unlicensed properties (i.e. brewing, distribution, and central assets).

           1,872.8  1,783.2 
Valuation       
The licensed estate properties were valued by the group’s own professionally qualified chartered surveyors, as at 20 December 2003, on the 
basis of existing use value, in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ Appraisal and Valuation Standards. A representative 
sample of properties was also valued by external valuers, Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, who confirmed that 
the values were consistent with their appraisal. Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition to IFRS, therefore no 
historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value. These valuations 
have been retained but they have not been updated. Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, at fair value.
Charges over assets 
Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of £1,429.6m (2010: £1,448.1m) over which there is a first charge 
in favour of the securitised debt holders as detailed in note 23.

Impairment of property plant and equipment
During the year £29.4m of impairment losses (2010: £37 .3m) were recognised in the income statement as exceptional costs. These are analysed 
between the group’s principal reporting segments as shown below: 
           2011 2010 
           £m £m
Retail            8.7   13.8 
Pub Partners           15.3   19.1 
Belhaven            5.4   1.9 
Corporate          —   2.5 
           29.4  37.3 
The group considers that each of its individual pubs is a cash generating unit (CGU). Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. 
When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount 
is the higher of the CGU’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
The group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model. The key assumptions used are the discount rate applied to cash flow 
projections of 9% (2010: 9%) and the projected cash flows extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2% (2010: 2%) which is below the 
long‑term average growth rate for the industry. Other commercial assumptions relating to individual CGUs have been made based on 
historic trends adjusted for management’s estimates of medium‑term trading prospects.
The impairment recognised in the Retail, Pub Partners and Belhaven estates are primarily the result of the reduced trading performance 
of a relatively small number of pubs due to a combination of site specific trading circumstances and the general weakening of the UK 
consumer environment seen in the year. The impairment losses recognised within the Corporate estate are primarily as a result of the 
reduction in the fair value less costs to sell of unlicensed properties acquired as part of business combinations in previous years. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions       
The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgments used in arriving at fair values, future growth rates and the discount 
rate applied to cash flow projections. The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to the growth rates used to 
calculate cash flow projections and in the pre‑tax discount rates would be as follows:
Increased impairment resulting from a 1% increase in discount:

Trade loans are net of provisions of £4.6m (2010: £4.6m), which represents the totality of impaired debt. During the year £0.3m (2010: 
£0.4m) of the provision was utilised and £0.3m (2010: £0.3m) of new provision created. All trade loans, net of any provision recognised, 
are considered to be neither past due nor impaired.
Trade loans are advanced to customers on terms linked to supply terms such that returns are greater than interest income. The fixed rate 
trade loans amounted to £26.8m (2010: £29.2m) and variable rate trade loans amounted to £16.6m (2010: £15.7m). Included in fixed rate 
loans are £6.6m of loans with settlement related to purchase levels (2010: £13.0m). The write‑down of these loans has been taken on a 
straight‑line basis over the remaining term of the loan as an approximation of the settlement. 
The fixed rate trade loans had a weighted average interest rate of 2.65% (2010: 2.44%) and a weighted average period of 6.77 years 
(2010: 6.45 years). Interest rates on variable rate trade loans are linked to base rate. Financial statements

The fair values attributed to the Cloverleaf and Realpubs acquisitions have been determined provisionally due to the proximity of the 
acquisition to the year end date.
Goodwill has arisen primarily due to expected operating synergies, the difference between property portfolio value and fair value‑in‑use 
and the proven ability of the management of Cloverleaf and Realpubs to develop businesses in their respective markets.
The fair value of properties acquired was established following a review that was carried out by qualified surveyors employed by the company. 
Properties have been revalued at their existing use value. 
From the date of acquisition the four sites acquired from Punch Taverns have contributed operating profit of £0.4m. Following the 
integration of the sites within the rest of group’s business it is no longer practical to identify the related cash flows separately.
From the date of acquisition Cloverleaf has contributed £1.0m operating profit to the group’s result. Following the integration of the 
business within the rest of the group’s business it is no longer practical to identify the related cash flows separately. 
From the date of acquisition Realpubs has contributed £0.1m operating profit to the group’s result with a net operating cash outflow of £0.2m. 
Prior to acquisition the results of the acquired businesses were prepared under UK GAAP using different accounting polices and bases and 
therefore a pro‑forma trading result has not been produced.
Under the terms of the acquisition agreements for the Cloverleaf and Realpubs acquisitions a total of £5.0m will be payable in cash to certain 
former owners who have remained as employees of the Greene King group two years from the date of completion based on the estimated 
future profitability of the business. The cost of these payments will be recognised in the income statement on a straight‑line basis over this 
period. The charge recognised in the current year is £0.3m.
During the prior period the group acquired three packages of pubs: 11 pubs were acquired from Punch Taverns on 1 July 2009 for £31.6m, 
seven from Mitchells & Butlers on 8 December 2009 for £13.4m and a further eight from Punch Taverns for £16.6m on 16 February 2010.

In the prior year from the date of acquisition the sites acquired have contributed £2.7m operating profit to the group’s result. Following the 
integration of the sites within the rest of the group’s business it is no longer practical to identify the related cash flows separately. 
Prior to acquisition the businesses acquired were part of larger incorporated businesses and therefore pre‑acquisition carrying values and 
trading results are not available.        Financial statements

Bank overdrafts
Overdrafts are utilised for the day‑to‑day management of cash. The group has facilities of £25.0m (2010: £25m) available with interest 
linked to base rate.
Bank loans – unsecured
During the period the group agreed a five‑year revolving credit facility, signed on 1 April 2011, of £400m, of which £110m was drawn down 
at the year end. Any amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payments on the undrawn portions. 
Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary in maturity. Although any individual draw‑downs are repayable within 12 months of the 
balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding. Immediate renewal is available under the £400m facility until April 2016. 
Final repayment of the total drawn‑down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
Securitised debt
The group has issued various tranches of bonds totalling £1,500.0m, in connection with the securitisation of 2,035 of the group’s pubs held 
in Greene King Retailing Limited at the date of the most recent tap. The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income 
streams and were issued by Greene King Finance plc.

Securitised debt continued
Repayment of nominal is made by quarterly instalments, in accordance with the repayment schedule, within the date ranges shown above. 
Payment of interest is made on quarterly dates for all classes of bond. All of the floating rate bonds are fully hedged using interest rate swaps.
The Class A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential 
interest payment and repayment rights over the Class AB1 and Class B bonds. The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, 
principal repayment and interest payment.
The Class AB1 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential interest payment 
and repayment rights over the Class B bonds. 
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing 
Limited, a group company. These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions 
on its ability to move cash to other group companies.
Loan notes – unsecured
The group issued loan notes during 2006 in connection with the Hardys & Hansons acquisition. These have a maturity date of September 2011 
and bear interest at a margin below LIBOR, payable semi‑annually. The effective interest rate of the loan notes is 0.55% (2010: 0.30%).
These loan notes are redeemable on demand of the holders on any of the interest payment dates and as such have been classified as current debt.
24 Financial instruments
The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business 
needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group. If appropriate, the group uses financial 
instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, 
loan notes, cash and short‑term deposits. Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade 
receivables, payables, and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the group’s operations 
and financing sources. No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the group’s financial instruments are cash flow risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The policy for 
managing each of these risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk
Exposure to changes in interest rates on the group’s borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the 
underlying debt. The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations 
primarily arising from the floating rate instruments. The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure 
should be hedged. The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges at the 
date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every six months.
In accordance with IFRS 7 , the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in 
interest rates. This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest 
rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 1 May 2011 and 2 May 2010. The analysis relates only to balances at these dates 
and is not representative of the year as a whole. The following assumptions were made:
—  Balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does 
not change as interest rates move.
—  Gains and losses are recognised within equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group.
—   Cash flow hedges were assumed to be effective or ineffective on the same basis as those as at the year‑end. An explanation for the split 
between those hedges that were effective at the year‑end and those that were ineffective is detailed within the cash flow hedging note.
Based on the group’s net position at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the group’s profit before tax by 
approximately £0.3m (2010: £0.2m) and the group’s equity by £87 .7m (2010: £91.6m). 
Liquidity risk
The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long‑term debt. 
The group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank 
loans. The group also monitors the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds. 
The standard payment terms that the company has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end (2010: 60 days following month end). 
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest‑bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than 1 month. Short‑term 
flexibility is achieved through the use of short‑term borrowing on the money markets.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the group’s financial liabilities at 1 May 2011 and 2 May 2010 based on contractual 
undiscounted payments including interest.

Credit risk
The policy for third party trading is that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to regular credit verification 
procedures. Receivable balances are also monitored on an on‑going basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the 
exposure to bad debts to a non‑significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans and cash. Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation, 
the maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Cash flow hedging
At 1 May 2011 the group held an interest rate swap contract (2010: nil), with a nominal value of £40m, designated as a hedge of the cash 
flow interest rate risk of the £110m draw down from the variable credit facility in the year. The interest rate swap is held on the balance 
sheet as a fair value liability of £0.3m. The cash flows occurred semi‑annually based a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR. 
At 1 May 2011 the group held 5 (2010: 5) interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of £759.6m (2010: £728.6m), entered into as part 
of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation taps. A fair value net liability of £116.3m (2010: £108.8m) has been recognised on the 
balance sheet in respect of these contracts which are designated cash flow hedges against £759.6m (2010: £728.6m) of variable rate bonds, 
receiving a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 4.834% (2010: 5.101%). The contract maturity 
dates are December 2034 and March 2036. The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective. 
The percentage of debt that was fixed as at the year‑end was 98.0% (2010: 98.7%) in line with the group’s policy of fixing at least 95% of all debt.

The interest on variable rate financial instruments is repriced at intervals less than one year. The interest on fixed rate financial 
instruments is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. Investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are not 
included in the above as they are non‑interest bearing and are not subject to interest rate risk.
Fair values
Set out in the table below is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the group’s financial instruments.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate 
the fair values:
Cash and cash equivalents – approximates to the carrying amount stated in the accounts.
Financial assets – these are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.
Short‑term loans and overdrafts – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long‑term loans – based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt; approximates to the carrying amount in the case of the 
floating rate bank loans and other variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps – fair values and effective interest rates of derivatives and other borrowings have been based on quotations from 
counterparties and represent estimates of the amount the group would expect to pay or receive on termination of the agreements.

Carrying values are stated net of any deferred finance fees which amounted to £12.4m (2010: £14.3m).
Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
IFRS 7 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs used to 
derive fair value. 
The classification uses the following three‑level hierarchy: 
Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly .
Level 3 – techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

Capital risk management       
The group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining a strong credit rating and a core level of debt which optimises the weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC) and shareholder value.       
A number of mechanisms are used to manage debt and equity levels (together referred to as capital), as appropriate in the light of economic 
and trading conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital 
to shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the period.
The group monitors capital using interest cover and several other measures including fixed charged cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA 
and free cash flow debt service coverage. Interest cover is calculated by dividing operating profit before exceptional items by net finance costs 
before exceptional items (note 7). For the period to 1 May 2011 interest cover was 2.7x (2010: 2.4x).

were issued for cash consideration of £207 .2m, net of issue costs of £10.9m. The rights issue price of 270p per ordinary share represented 
a bonus to existing shareholders of 0.246 ordinary shares per ordinary share held based on the closing share price of 566p on 29 May 2009,

Hedging reserve adjustments arise from the movement in fair value of the group’s derivative instruments used as an effective hedge, in line 
with the accounting policy disclosed in note 1. Amounts recycled to income are included within finance costs in the income statement.
Own shares
Own shares relates to shares held in treasury and by the employee benefit trust. At 1 May 2011 1.0m shares (2010: 1.0m) were held in 
treasury and 1.1m shares (2010: 0.5m) by the employee benefit trust. The market values at that date were £4.8m and £5.4m (2010: £4.6m 
and £2.3m) respectively.
During the period 0.6m shares were repurchased by the employee benefit trust (2010: nil). No (2010: 0.3m) shares held by the employee benefit 
trust were transferred to satisfy awards under the long‑term incentive plan and options exercised under the executive share option scheme.
The employee benefit trust is independently managed and has purchased shares in order to satisfy outstanding employee share options and 
potential awards under the long‑term incentive plan.
At the year end 0.8m treasury shares and 0.5m shares in the employee benefit trust were allocated to meet awards under the long‑term 
incentive plan.
A transfer of £0.1m (2010: £10.9m) from own shares to retained earnings has been made to reflect transfers to satisfy awards under the 
long‑term incentive plan and options exercised under the executive share option plan and reflects the weighted average cost of own shares.
Goodwill
The cumulative amount of goodwill written off to retained earnings in respect of acquisitions made prior to May 1998 amounts to £89.7m 
(2010: £89.7m).

30 Financial commitments
The group has entered into commercial leases on certain properties and items of plant and machinery. The terms of the leases vary but typically 
on inception a property lease will be for a period of up to 30 years and plant and machinery will be for less than 5 years. Most property 
leases have an upwards only rent review based on open market rents at the time of the review.
Future minimum rentals payable under non‑cancellable operating leases:

The group leases its licensed estate and other non‑licensed properties to tenants. The majority of lease agreements have terms of between 
6 months and 25 years and are classified for accounting purposes as operating leases. Most of the leases with terms of over 3 years include 
provision for rent reviews on either a 3 year or 5 year basis.

Final dividend
A final dividend of 16.8p per share (2010: 15.6p) amounting to a dividend of £36.1m (2010: £33.5m) was proposed by the directors at their 
meeting on 29 June 2011. These financial statements do not reflect the dividend payable.
33 Contingent liabilities
The group has provided guarantees totalling £4.4m at 1 May 2011 (2010: £4.8m) in respect of free trade customers’ bank borrowings.
During the prior year the group received a refund of £7m from HMRC in respect of VAT on gaming machines which was recognised 
as exceptional income. The decisions that resulted in this refund have been referred to the European Court of Justice and the case will be 
heard on 30 June 2011. Should HMRC be successful in their appeal the group would be required to repay the refund with interest, and as 
such this represents a contingent liability.  Financial statements
Greene King plc   Annual Report 2011 www.greeneking.co.uk 71
W e have audited the group financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011 which comprise the Group Income Statement, 
Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, Group Balance Sheet, Group Cash Flow statement, Group Statement of Changes in Equity and 
the related notes 1 to 33. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 81, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non‑ financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
— give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 1 May 2011 and of its profit for the 52 weeks then ended;
— have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
— have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinions on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
—  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
—  the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 87 to 90 with respect to internal control and 
risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent with 
the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
— certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
— we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
— a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
— the directors’ statement, set out on page 81, in relation to going concern; and
—  the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review; and
— certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011 and on the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

34 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting and presentation 
The accounts are prepared on a going‑concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting and financial 
reporting  standards in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). They are prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of 
derivatives, where the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings. 
Changes in accounting policy 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following:
Amendment to FRS 20 – Group Settled Share‑based Payment Arrangements
The amended standard affects the accounting for cash‑ settled share‑based payment transactions and supersedes UITF 44. The adoption 
of the amendment had no impact on the financial performance or position of the company.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less impairment and held as fixed assets on the balance sheet. The carrying value of 
investments is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions 
or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the 
following exceptions:
—  Provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, and gains on disposal 
of fixed assets that have rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement 
to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, 
it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement 
assets are sold.
—  Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing difference can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Financial instruments 
Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are de‑recognised 
when the company no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash 
flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party. 
The company is exempt, in accordance with FRS 29.2D, from producing disclosure required by the standard as the group accounts contain 
disclosure that complies with FRS 29 (IFRS 7). 
Interest‑bearing loans and borrowings 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition, 
interest‑bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings. 
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent measurement 
is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting the 
gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account. 
Hedge accounting 
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception. Documentation must include 
the company’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being 
hedged. The company also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to 
determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective. 
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability), or cash flow (hedging the variability 
in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability , or forecast transaction). The company uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. 
For these cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the 
ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the profit and loss account when 
the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.  
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. If the 
hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the profit and 
loss account as above. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit and loss. 
Own shares
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The company has an employee benefit trust for the 
granting of shares to applicable employees.  
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from equity shareholders’ funds. Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such 
shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. 
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.

34 Accounting policies continued
Share based payments
Certain employees and directors of subsidiary companies receive equity‑settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange 
for shares or rights over shares. The fair value of the shares and options granted is measured using a Black‑Scholes model, at the date at 
which they were granted.
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions (service and performance), other than market conditions 
(performance linked to the price of the shares of the company). Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee 
to become fully entitled to an award are considered non‑vesting conditions. Like market performance, non‑vesting conditions are taken 
into account in determining the grant date fair value. The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an increase in the 
company’s investments in its subsidiaries with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the performance 
conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date. The cumulative amount recognised as an investment reflects the extent to 
which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest. 
In accordance with the exemption within FRS 20 no amount is recorded in respect of grants made under the above schemes prior to 
7 November 2002 which had not vested by the date of implementation of FRS 20.
Related party transactions
In accordance with FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures the company is not required to disclose transactions with its wholly owned subsidiaries.
35 Profit for the period
No profit or loss account is presented for the company as permitted by s408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit after tax for the period 
is £20.3m (2010: £41.2m loss).
36 Auditors’ remuneration
Auditors’ remuneration in respect of the company audit was £15,375 (2010: £15,000).
37 Directors’ remuneration and employee costs
Details of directors’ remuneration is contained in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 84 to 86. The company has no employees 
other than directors and the directors are not remunerated through this company. Details of share options issued by the company are given 
in note 8 to the group accounts.

Share premium account
Share premium represents the excess of proceeds received over the nominal value of new shares issued.
Other reserve
The Other reserve consists of £3.3m (2010: £3.3m) capital redemption reserve arising from the purchase of own share capital and £90.6m 
(2010: £90.6m) arising from transfer of revalued assets to other group companies and will only be realised when the related assets are 
disposed of by the group.
Hedging reserve
Hedging reserve adjustments arise from the movement in fair value of the company’s derivative instruments used as an effective hedge, 
in line with the accounting policy disclosed in note 1.
Own shares 
Own shares relates to shares held in treasury and by the employee benefit trust. Movement in own shares is described in note 27 to the 
group accounts.
44 Contingent liabilities
During the prior year the company received a refund of £6.1m from HMRC in respect of VAT on gaming machines which was recognised 
as exceptional income. The decisions that resulted in this refund have been referred to the European Court of Justice and the case will be 
heard on 30 June 2011. Should HMRC be successful in their appeal the group would be required to repay the refund with interest, and as 
such this represents a contingent liability.

independent auditor’s report (company)
To the members of Greene King plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011 which comprise the parent 
company balance sheet and the related notes 34 to 44. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 81, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non‑ financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
— give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 1 May 2011;
— have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
— have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
—  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
—  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
—  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
—  the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
— certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
— we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Greene King plc for the 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011.

directors’ report Governance
Greene King plc   Annual Report 2011 www.greeneking.co.uk 79
Share capital continued
A total of 648,243 ordinary shares, with an aggregate nominal value of £81,030 were allotted, for cash, during the period in connection with 
the company’s sharesave and executive option schemes. In addition, a further 314,000 shares were transferred from treasury to satisfy the grant 
of awards to directors under the company’s LTIP scheme.
The trustees of the company’s employee benefit trust (EBT), Kleinwort Benson (Guernsey) Trustees Limited, transferred 276,434 ordinary shares 
to employees to satisfy the exercise of share options and the vesting of LTIP awards. During the period, 338,532 ordinary shares were purchased 
by the EBT at 427 .26p and 261,468 ordinary shares were purchased by the EBT at 421.42p. The company makes regular use of the EBT to 
satisfy the exercise of share options and will make market purchases of the company’s shares from time to time to ensure that it has 
sufficient shares to enable it to do so. 
Voting rights
In a general meeting of the company, on a show of hands, every member who is present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one 
vote. On a poll every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which they are the holder. The AGM 
notice gives full details of deadlines for exercising voting rights in respect of resolutions to be considered at the meeting.
Under the Free4All Employee Profit Share Scheme, participants are the beneficial owners of the shares but not the registered owners. 
The registered owner is the trustee, Killik & Co Trustees Ltd. The trustee will invite participants to direct it on the exercise of any voting 
rights attaching to the shares held under the scheme by the trustee on the participants’ behalf. The trustee will only be entitled to vote on 
a show of hands if all directions received from participants are identical. The trustee is under no obligation to call for a poll. In the case 
of a poll, the trustee will follow the directions of the participants.
No voting rights will be exercised in respect of any own shares.
Transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the company other than those which may from time to time be applicable under 
existing laws and regulations (for example under the Market Abuse Directive). 
In addition, pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, directors of the company and persons discharging managerial 
responsibility are required to obtain prior approval from the company to deal in the company’s securities, and are prohibited from dealing 
during closed periods.
Change of control
All of the company’s share incentive plans contain provisions relating to a change of control and full details of these plans are provided in 
the directors’ remuneration report. Outstanding options and awards would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, 
subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, if applicable, at that time.
The group’s banking facility agreements contain provisions entitling the counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the event 
of a change of control. Certain of the company’s trading contracts also contain similar provisions.
There are two employees who, on a change of control of the company resulting in the termination of their employment, would be entitled 
to compensation for loss of office. However, in the context of the company as a whole, these agreements are de minimis.
Articles of association
The company’s articles of association may only be amended by special resolution at general meetings of shareholders. 
Appointment and replacement of directors
The number of directors on the board shall be no less than five nor more than twelve. Directors may be appointed by the company by 
ordinary resolution or by the board of directors. A director appointed by the board of directors holds office until the next following AGM, 
and is then eligible for election by the shareholders.
Under the articles, at each AGM all those directors who were elected, or last re‑elected, at the AGM held in the third calendar year before 
the current year shall retire from office and may stand for re‑election.
The company may by ordinary resolution, of which special notice has been given, remove any director from office.
Any director automatically ceases to be a director if (i) they give the company a written notice of resignation, (ii) they give the company 
a written offer to resign and the directors decide to accept this offer, (iii) all of the other directors remove them from office by notice in writing 
served upon them, (iv) they are or have been suffering from mental ill health and have a court order for their detention or the appointment 
of a guardian made in respect of them, (v) a bankruptcy order is made against them or they make any arrangement or composition with their 
creditors generally, (vi) they are prohibited from being a director by law or (vii) they are absent from board meetings for six months without 
leave and the other directors resolve that their office should be vacated.

Charitable donations
Donations by the company for charitable purposes made during the period amounted to £25,777 (2010: £18,400). The group makes no 
political donations.
Payments to suppliers 
The group understands the benefits to be derived from maintaining good relationships with its suppliers and where possible enters into 
agreements over payment terms. Where such terms have not been agreed it is the group policy to settle invoices 60 days following the end 
of month of invoicing. This policy is dependent on suppliers providing accurate, timely and sufficiently detailed invoices. Payment in respect 
of 70 days’ average purchases from trade creditors of the group was outstanding at the end of the period (2010: 67 days).
Directors’ and officers’ indemnity insurance
The group has taken out insurance to indemnify, against third party proceedings, the directors of the company whilst serving on the 
board of the company and of any subsidiary. This cover indemnifies all employees of the group who serve on the boards of all subsidiaries. 
These indemnity policies subsisted throughout the year and remain in place at the date of this report.
Financial instruments
The group’s policy on the use of financial instruments is set out in note 24.
Post‑balance sheet events
Details of events occurring after the year‑end are set out in note 32.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
The directors who were members of the board at the time of approving the directors’ report are listed on page 32. Having made enquiries 
of fellow directors and of the company’s auditors, each of these directors confirms that:
—  to the best of each director’s knowledge and belief, there is no information relevant to the preparation of their report of which the 
company’s auditors are unaware; and
—  each director has taken all the steps a director might reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of relevant audit information and 
to establish that the company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in 
the Chief executive’s review. The financial position of the group, its cash‑flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the Financial review. In addition, note 24 to the financial statements includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure to credit 
and liquidity risk. 
The directors are of the opinion that the group’s forecast and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
show that the group should be able to operate within its current borrowing facilities and comply with its financing covenants. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report 
and financial statements.
Auditors
Ernst & Young LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office and a resolution to re‑appoint the firm as the company’s auditors will 
be proposed at the AGM.
Annual general meeting 
The AGM will be held at 12 noon on Tuesday 6 September 2011 at the Millennium Grandstand, Rowley Mile Racecourse Conference Centre, 
Newmarket, Suffolk. The notice of the AGM is set out in the separate circular to shareholders. 
The directors consider that all of the resolutions set out in the notice of AGM are in the best interests of the company and its shareholders 
as a whole. The directors will be voting in favour of them and unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each of them.

directors’ statements Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the group financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
Under company law the directors must not approve the group financial statements unless they are satisfied that they present fairly 
the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the group for that period. In preparing those group financial statements 
the directors are required to:
—  select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then 
apply them consistently;
—  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
—  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS’s is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the group’s financial position and financial performance; 
—  state that the group has complied with IFRS’s, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
— make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the group’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and enable them to ensure that the group financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the parent company financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the directors’ report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing 
those financial statements, the directors are required to:
— select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
— make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
—  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
— prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is appropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that the company financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The directors confirm, to the best of their knowledge:
—  that these financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company and undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
—  that the directors’ report and the business review includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the company and undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

Composition of the remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is appointed by the board. During the year the committee comprised Norman Murray (chairman of the committee), 
Ian Durant, Jane Scriven (until her retirement) and John Brady (appointed to replace her). All of the committee members during the year were 
regarded by the board as independent non‑ executive directors. 
Terms of reference and reporting
The committee determines, and annually reviews, all elements of executive directors’ remuneration and the remuneration of certain other senior 
executives who report to the chief executive, and whose details are set out on page 33. It recommends the fees that should be payable to the 
chairman to the board. It approves the contracts of the executive directors and those senior executives referred to above and any compensation 
arrangements arising from their termination. It also approves all LTIP allocations and oversees the operation of all of the company’s share 
based plans. The committee is made aware of the salary levels of the wider senior management team and of the incentive arrangements 
operating throughout the company.
Advisers to the remuneration committee
The committee has taken external advice on general remuneration matters and comparator information from Hewitt New Bridge Street, 
who do not provide any other services to the company. Advice and assistance is also obtained, where appropriate, from the company’s brokers, 
Deutsche Bank. During the course of the year legal advice has been obtained from the law firm Pinsent Masons. The committee also received 
internal advice from Rooney Anand, chief executive, in determining appropriate remuneration and incentive packages for the finance director 
and the other senior executives.
Remuneration policy
The company operates in a highly competitive market and must attract, motivate and retain high quality directors. The committee considers 
current market practice and makes comparisons with turnover, market capitalisation and operational details against a selection of other companies. 
The committee is made aware of and has regard to pay and conditions elsewhere within the group and endeavours to ensure that pay rises 
for executive and non‑ executive directors are generally comparable with those being applied elsewhere in the group. A range of bonus plans 
are operated for managers throughout the group, and all staff with the requisite qualifying service have access to the company’s share save scheme.
No director makes a decision relating to his own remuneration. Individual directors leave the meeting when their own remuneration is 
being discussed. A significant proportion of each executive director’s potential remuneration is performance‑related with appropriately 
stretching targets, thus aligning the directors’ interests with those of shareholders and encouraging performance at the highest levels. 
The committee has considered whether there are any aspects of the remuneration policy which could inadvertently encourage executives 
to take inappropriate risk and has concluded that the policy remains appropriate in this regard. 
Components of directors’ remuneration
The remuneration package of each executive director consists of the following elements:
Annual pay
Annual pay reflects the responsibilities, market value and sustained performance level of executive directors. Pay is reviewed annually or 
when a change in responsibility occurs. The pay rises granted in 2010/11 were considered appropriate taking account of pay rises for other 
employees in the group, the performance of the company, the individuals and the relative market positioning of the individuals’ packages.
Benefits in kind
The range of taxable benefits available to executive directors is listed on page 84.
Bonus 
Bonus payments are determined by the remuneration committee and awarded where justified by performance. For the financial year 
2011/12, the executive directors will be eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus, the maximum amount being 150% of annual pay, 
for the achievement of stretch targets. Two thirds of this amount, up to a maximum of 100% of annual pay, is based on pre‑ determined 
performance metrics, set at the start of the year, based on group profitability, return on capital employed, and a range of financial and 
non‑ financial specific targets relevant to each individual. 
The remaining one third of the bonus entitlement, equal to a maximum of 50% of annual pay, is subject to a separate performance condition 
based on challenging levels of annual economic profit performance in excess of the company’s strategic plan, with all of any additional bonus 
being invested in shares or granted in the form of nil cost options, which would be deferred or, as the case may be, not exercisable for a period 
of one year and which would be forfeited in the event that the relevant director or employee leaves the group, other than as a good leaver, 
during that time, to improve motivation, lock‑in and alignment of interest. In addition, the additional bonus will be reclaimable by the 
company in exceptional circumstances of misstatement or misconduct.
The enhanced element of the annual bonus provides improved strategic linkage through the use of an economic profit‑based performance 
condition. Economic profit (operating profit before exceptional items less the weighted average cost of capital multiplied by capital employed) 
is an important management tool and its use in the annual bonus complements this strategic focus. The use of economic profit also provides 
a balance to the rest of the bonus plan.
The additional focus on economic profit encourages the management team to target medium‑term decisions to ensure growth by: ensuring 
better deployment of capital expenditure; encouraging further improvements in relation to returns on invested capital; freeing up assets where 
higher economic profit can be gained by the group; and extracting higher returns from existing uninvested assets. 
The target set for 2011/12 is to achieve a stretching level of economic profit over and above the budget for the year, with a sliding scale for 
vesting which will ensure that management will not benefit from more than 20% of the uplift in economic profit. If this economic profit is 
achieved, it will benefit shareholders and the committee therefore considers that senior management should be incentivised to deliver this 
additional performance. There will be disclosure in the directors’ remuneration report at the end of the year of the basis on which the bonuses 
were payable.

Greene King plc   Annual Report 2011 www.greeneking.co.uk 83
Components of directors’ remuneration continued
Pension and life assurance
The pension arrangements for Rooney Anand and Ian Bull are on a defined contribution basis. They both have self‑invested personal pension 
schemes to which the company makes a contribution. The contribution rates are 25% for Rooney Anand and 20% for Ian Bull. Directors are 
given an option to have pension contributions above the £50,000 annual limit imposed by the government with effect from 6 April 2011 paid 
to them in cash. No element of remuneration other than annual pay is treated as pensionable. Both executive directors participate in a group 
death‑in‑ service insurance scheme, with death benefits in excess of the HMRC maximum being provided through additional insurance. 
The cost of this insurance is disclosed as a non‑ cash benefit in the emoluments table on the following page.
Long term incentives
Long term incentives form an important part of the company’s remuneration for its directors and senior employees, with historically a mix 
of options and LTIP awards being granted, subject to performance conditions based on earnings per share (EPS). Since 2009/10 the company 
policy has been to grant only LTIP awards. Directors are entitled each year to an LTIP award equivalent to a maximum of 133% of base salary. 
Awards are made in the form of restricted forfeitable shares, on which dividends are payable. Dividends in respect of future awards will be 
held in escrow pending vesting and will be released to the directors to the extent that the awards vest.
All LTIP awards are subject to two performance measures, namely an adjusted free cash flow condition and an earnings per share condition, 
both measured over a three year period. There is a 60:40 weighting in favour of the cash measure, given the importance of cash management 
as a medium term business priority. The use of two separate performance conditions is designed to provide a rounded assessment of the 
company’s financial performance.
For the three‑ year adjusted free cashflow measure, this will be determined by reference to net cash flow from operating activities less 
capital expenditure. Net cash flow from operating activities will include the impact of changes in working capital, and interest and tax 
payments, but will be adjusted to exclude exceptional items at the discretion of the remuneration committee in consultation with the 
audit committee. 
The capex related deduction in the free cashflow measure will be for capital expenditure on properties that were within the estate at the 
beginning of the performance measurement period, where that capital expenditure has not been funded from property disposal proceeds. 
Free cashflow has been chosen as a performance condition because converting EBITDA to positive cashflows to support debt repayment, 
continued investment in the business and the ongoing payment of dividends is a key measure for both management and shareholders.
The target range for the adjusted free cash flow performance target for the 2011/12 awards will be that the aggregate adjusted free cash 
flow of the company for the three financial years ending in April 2012, 2013 and 2014 must be more than £250m to vest at the minimum 
level and at least £290m to vest in full. Measuring on an aggregate three‑ year basis (rather than the more common approach of focusing 
on the end‑ year only of the three) will ensure that there will be a focus on delivering cash across all three years.
The adjusted earnings per share part of the performance condition for awards granted in 2011/12 will be based on a sliding scale range 
of ‘pence per share’ targets for the 2013/14 year end, with between 0% and 100% of that part of the award vesting depending on the extent 
to which the targets are met. The committee does not consider it appropriate to disclose the range, but does consider it to be appropriately 
challenging in the current economic climate. There will be disclosure of the conditions and the extent to which they have been achieved 
in the remuneration report at the time each award vests.
Employee share schemes
In common with all other employees, the executive directors are also entitled to participate in the company’s sharesave plan. Further details 
are given later in this report.
Remuneration from other company directorships
Since September 2007 Rooney Anand has served as a non‑ executive director of Drive Assist Holdings Limited, a company unconnected with 
the group. He is entitled to receive and retain for his personal benefit £40,000 per annum from that company by way of director’s fees.
Remuneration for non‑ executive directors
The fees paid to the chairman and the other non‑ executive directors are determined by the board as a whole. They are agreed after taking 
external advice and making market comparisons, and relate to the services of the directors in connection with the company’s business. 
The non‑ executive directors do not have service agreements and cannot participate in the pension scheme, the bonus scheme or the share 
option schemes. 
Service agreements
Newly appointed executive directors are offered a service agreement with a notice period of one year. In the event of the employment 
of an executive director being terminated, the committee would pay due regard to best practice and take account of the individual’s duty 
to mitigate their loss. 
Rooney Anand, whose contract with the company commenced on 6 August 2001 is subject to a one year notice period from the company. 
His contract does not contain any additional terms relating to compensation for termination of employment. The terms of his appointment 
as chief executive were agreed and set out in a letter dated 24 December 2004.
The employment of Ian Bull, finance director, who resigned from the company during the year, will terminate on 1 July 2011. His successor, 
Matthew Fearn, will join the company on 1 September 2011. His contract may be terminated by the company on giving one year’s notice, 
without any additional terms relating to compensation for termination of employment. Governance 84 Greene King plc   Annual Report 2011 www.greeneking.co.uk

 Retired from the board on 17 March 2011.
No payments were made to any third parties in respect of any directors’ services. Non‑ cash benefits principally include the provision 
of company cars, fuel for company cars, life assurance and private medical insurance. Other cash benefits include cash allowances paid 
in lieu of company cars. 
In relation to the annual bonus figures above, £253,000 of the bonus for Rooney Anand will be deferred under the terms of the economic 
profit bonus scheme introduced in 2010. This equates to 50% of his salary, as the performance condition relating to this part of his bonus 
was met in full. Against a target of achieving £10.1m of additional economic profit over that set out in the relevant strategic plan, actual 
additional economic profit in excess of that amount was £11.1m. The bonus will be deferred in the form of restricted shares, which will be 
acquired shortly after the preliminary announcement of the results. He will be entitled to any dividends paid on those shares, which will be 
released to him if he remains in employment for a period of one year from the date that the shares are acquired. Ian Bull forfeited any right 
to payment of a bonus under the economic profit bonus scheme as a result of his resignation.

Tim Bridge is a pensioner member of the group’s defined benefit scheme. His pension is equivalent to 1/45th of his final pensionable earnings 
for each year of service, with a pro rata payment for a part year, subject to HMRC limits. His final pensionable earnings were those received 
immediately prior to him ceasing to be chief executive.
Two former directors receive additional pension income from the company. John Bridge, who retired as a director on 31 December 1989, 
receives a pension of £27 ,000 pa in excess of his scheme entitlements and Bernard Tickner, who retired as a director on 27 August 1992, 
receives a pension of £22,000 pa in excess of his scheme entitlements. As required by law, both of these figures are stated net of their 
company‑ funded pension in payment at 31 March 1997 .
Share price during the period
The closing price of the company’s shares on 28 April 2011 (being the last business day before the financial period end) was 489.6p 
(2010: 453.9p). The closing price of the company’s shares during the period ranged between 376.2p and 491.4p.

No changes were made during the year to the terms and conditions of any options then outstanding (2010: adjustments were made in respect 
of all outstanding options, both to the option price and the number of options held by each director, to reflect the impact of the rights issue 
completed in May 2009, to ensure that the aggregate exercise price of each option remains unchanged). There have been no options exercised 
and no other changes since the year end to the date of this report. 
Unvested options can only be exercised if a performance condition has been met. This condition relates to the growth in audited adjusted 
earnings per share which must exceed RPI inflation by 4% per annum, measured over the period of three consecutive financial years of the 
company, starting with the year in which the award is granted. Since the year end, the options granted in 2008 have lapsed, as a result of the 
remuneration committee having determined that the performance conditions applicable to those options have not been met. Governance 86 Greene King plc   Annual Report 2011 www.greeneking.co.uk

* Under the rules of the scheme, all of the awards granted to Ian Bull lapsed on the date of his resignation.
The market price of the shares on 12 August 2010, when the last awards were made, was 412.6p, although the number of shares comprising 
the award was determined by reference to the closing market price on 11 August 2010, namely 417 .9p.
During the year the 2007 LTIP awards lapsed on the third anniversary of their grant as a result of the remuneration committee having 
determined that the performance conditions applicable to those awards had not been met. The 2008 LTIP awards will also lapse on the 
third anniversary of their grant for the same reasons. Total gains made by directors under the LTIP in the period ended 1 May 2011 
therefore amounted to £nil (2010: £nil).
The 2009 LTIP awards will only vest to the extent that two separate performance targets are met, over the three financial years ending in 
April 2012. A maximum of 60% of each award will vest if an adjusted free cash flow performance condition has been met. The remaining 
40% of the award will vest if an earnings per share performance condition has been met. The target range for the adjusted free cash flow 
performance condition is that the aggregate adjusted free cash flow of the company for the three financial years ending in April 2010, 2011 
and 2012 must be more than £190.0m to vest at the minimum level and at least £230.0m to vest in full. The 2010 LTIP awards will only vest 
to the extent that the relevant performance targets are met over the three financial years ending in April 2013. As with the 2009 award, a 
maximum of 60% of each award will vest if an adjusted free cash flow performance condition has been met and the remaining 40% of the 
award will vest if an earnings per share performance condition has been met. The target range for the adjusted free cash flow performance 
condition is that the aggregate adjusted free cash flow of the company for the three financial years ending in April 2011, 2012 and 2013 must 
be more than £230.4m to vest at the minimum level and at least £270.4m to vest in full. 
The earnings per share performance conditions set a range for the EPS for the financial year ending in April 2012 (for the 2009 LTIP) 
or April 2013 (for the 2010 LTIP) which the remuneration committee considered to be sufficiently challenging in the market conditions. 
The remuneration committee is advised on a regular basis as to how actual performance is tracking against the relevant targets. In relation 
to the 2009 LTIP , based on performance to date and assuming that the business units meet their stretching strategic plan targets, it is anticipated 
that the business will meet the upper quartile of the free cash flow target and the upper quartile of the earnings per share target. For the 
2010 LTIP, and on the same assumptions, it is anticipated that the business will meet the upper quartile of the earnings per share target, 
whilst performance against the free cash flow target is in the lower quartile. Details as to the extent to which the targets have actually 
been met and the awards have vested will be provided at the end of each three year performance period.
No changes were made during the period, or since the year end to the date of this report, to the terms and conditions of any awards 
then outstanding. Save as set out above, no awards vested or lapsed during the period. There have been no other changes to the date 
of this report. 
Sharesave scheme
The company has operated an HMRC approved sharesave scheme for a number of years. Options are granted over the company’s ordinary 
shares at an option price which, at board discretion, is at a discount of up to 20% of the closing price at the time of granting. The company 
has historically granted all such options at a 20% discount. 
None of the directors has any interest in any options granted under the sharesave scheme.
Share incentive plan
The directors’ beneficial interests in Greene King shares resulting from participation in the company’s HMRC approved share incentive 
plan are reflected in their shareholding data in the directors’ report. No further awards will be made under this scheme (2009/10: no award).
Shareholders will be asked to vote on this remuneration report, as an ordinary resolution, at the company’s AGM.
Approved by the board of directors on 29 June 2011.

directors’ remuneration report continued Governance
Greene King plc   Annual Report 2011 www.greeneking.co.uk 87
Greene King plc is committed to ensuring that high standards of corporate governance are maintained as we recognise that strong governance 
is crucial in helping the business to deliver its strategy, generating shareholder value and safeguarding our shareholders’ long‑term interests.
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Combined Code on corporate governance sets out guidance in the form of principles and provisions on how companies should be directed 
and controlled to follow good governance practice. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) requires companies listed in the UK to disclose, 
in relation to Section 1 of the Combined Code, how they have applied the principles and whether they have complied with its provisions 
throughout the financial year. Where the provisions have not been complied with companies must provide an explanation for this. 
The board considers that the company has complied with the 2008 Combined Code throughout the year, except in the following areas.
A.1.3 and A.6
A.1.3 requires the senior independent non‑ executive director to lead an appraisal of the performance of the chairman at least once a 
year and A.6 requires the board to undertake a formal and rigorous evaluation of its own performance and that of its individual directors. 
A formal evaluation of the board and its non‑ executive directors was completed in February 2010 and an externally facilitated review is 
currently taking place. The board is satisfied that, between such reviews, an open dialogue exists between all board members enabling 
issues to be raised and dealt with as they occur. A review of the chairman’s performance will be undertaken in conjunction with the 
evaluation process.
C.3.1
C.3.1 requires the audit committee to comprise at least three directors, all independent non‑ executive directors. This requirement was not 
met in the short period from the retirement of Jane Scriven in March 2011 until the end of the year, in that the audit committee had just two 
members. During that part of the year no committee meetings were held. The search for a new non‑ executive director, who will be appointed 
as a member of the audit committee, is well advanced. 
With effect from 2 May 2011 the company is now bound to comply with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The company 
is working towards compliance with the new code and will report on its compliance therewith in next year’s report and accounts.
The information required by DTR 7 .1 and DTR 7 .2 is set out in this report, except for information required under DTR 7 .2.6 which is set out 
in the directors’ report.
Governance structure
The board
The board considers that it is vital to ensure that there is an appropriate range of skills, knowledge and experience among its members, and 
that the objectivity and integrity of members should be exemplary. The board currently comprises a non‑ executive chairman, three other 
non‑ executive directors and two executive directors. The directors’ biographies are on page 32. The board believes that the structure and 
size of the board is appropriate and that no single individual or group dominates the decision making process. 
The division of responsibilities between the chairman and the chief executive has been clearly established, set out in writing and agreed 
by the board. The job descriptions are available on request. The chairman is responsible for the leadership and effectiveness of the board. 
The chief executive has responsibility for executing the company’s strategy, achieving operational and financial goals and leading senior 
management in dealing with the operational requirements of the business.
The board has a formal schedule of matters which are reserved for its decision, including approval of the long term objectives and strategy, 
approval of budgets and financial statements including the report and accounts, acquisitions and disposals, changes to the structure of the 
group and overall corporate governance issues. It reviews trading performance and considers major capital expenditure and acquisition 
opportunities. Management is delegated the task of the detailed planning and implementation of the company’s strategy. 
Information and training
Full and timely information is provided to the board to enable it to properly discharge its functions. Documentation includes detailed reports 
in current trading and full papers on matters where the board is required to give its approval. All directors have access to the advice and 
services of the company secretary and are provided with the opportunity to meet and question management as required and are encouraged 
to visit the company’s pubs. Each director is responsible for ensuring that they remain up to date in their skills and knowledge of the company 
and the training needs of the board are regularly reviewed. Explanations of issues and training provided during the year covered areas such 
as changes in legislation. 
There is an agreed procedure, set out in writing, for directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice at the 
company’s expense. The company has in place directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
Newly‑appointed directors receive a full and appropriate induction on joining the board to acquaint them with the company. This takes the 
form of meetings with other board members and senior management and the provision of an induction pack containing general information 
on the company, its policies and procedures, financial and operational information and a briefing on directors’ responsibilities.
Performance evaluation 
The board believes it is appropriate to undertake a regular performance evaluation of the board, its committees and individual directors. 
An evaluation exercise was completed in February 2010, with the results reported to the board in March 2010. The board’s intention is to 
conduct reviews approximately every eighteen months and, accordingly, no evaluation exercise was conducted in the 2010/11 financial year. 
An externally facilitated performance evaluation is already under way in 2011, with an external facilitator, Boardroom Review, having already 
been appointed and interviews being conducted. 
The board has confirmed that it is satisfied that it and its committees are operating effectively. Between evaluation exercises an open 
dialogue exists between all board members enabling issues to be raised and dealt with as they occur. 
The performance of the executive directors is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee in conjunction with their annual pay 
review and the payment of bonuses.

Governance structure continued
Independence of non‑executive directors
The non‑ executive directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by the executive directors are carefully 
examined and fully discussed and that the performance of the company is scrutinised and challenged. Their independence and objectivity 
are of paramount importance. The board believes that they all have a range of skills, knowledge and experience which will help the company 
and that their understanding of the company, its strategy and operations increases over the years. 
The board is satisfied that all of the non‑ executive directors were independent throughout the year, being free from any relationship with 
the executive management which could result in any conflict or affect their independent judgment, and that they all remained independent 
in character and judgment. None of the independent non‑ executive directors participates in the share option schemes or long‑term incentive 
plan operated by the company and none was dependent on the fees received from the company as their primary source of income. 
Norman Murray is the senior independent non‑ executive director. Norman was appointed to the board in January 2004, has never been 
employed by the company and has had diverse business interests. The board considers that he has remained independent from management 
in both character and judgment, that his performance has been effective and that he has demonstrated commitment to the role. As well as 
supporting the chairman, a key responsibility for him is to be available to shareholders in the event that they may feel it inappropriate to 
relay views through the chairman, chief executive or finance director. 
Tim Bridge was not independent on appointment, having previously served as chief executive. However, the board is satisfied that he shows 
independent judgment, that his performance as chairman is effective and that he demonstrates continued commitment to the role. 
Meetings and attendance
Board meetings are scheduled to be held eight times a year, linked to key events in the company’s corporate calendar. There is a two‑ day 
off‑ site meeting for the board each year focusing on strategy. Between meetings, as required, the board can be in frequent contact to progress 
the company’s business and if necessary, board meetings can be held at short notice. Where possible, however, ad hoc committees of the 
board are appointed to deal with matters which it is known will need to be dealt with between scheduled board meetings. It is expected 
that all directors attend board and relevant committee meetings, unless they are prevented from doing so by prior commitments. If directors 
are unable to attend meetings they are given the opportunity to be consulted and comment in advance of the meeting. The chairman holds 
regular informal meetings with the non‑ executive directors without the executive directors being present.
The table below sets out the attendance record of each director at scheduled board and board committee meetings during the year.

  John Brady was appointed to the remuneration committee on 28 April 2011. The number of remuneration committee meetings attended is stated with 
effect from that date.
(2)
 Jane Scriven resigned as a director on 17 March 2011. The number of board and committee meetings attended is stated up to and including that date.
Conflicts of interest
The board has the right, under the articles of association, to approve potential situational conflicts of interest. A small number of such 
potential conflicts have been approved by the board following disclosure by certain directors, in each case with the relevant director not 
taking part in any decision relating to their own position. Directors are also aware that the disclosure and authorisation of any potential 
conflict situation does not detract from their requirement to notify the board separately of an actual or potential conflict in relation to a 
proposed transaction by the company. The board keeps its authorisations under review on a regular basis.
Board committees
The board has established an audit committee, a remuneration committee and a nomination committee, each of which has formal terms 
of reference governing its method of operation. Each of the terms of reference, which are available on request and will be available for 
inspection at the annual general meeting, reflect the provisions of the combined code and have been approved by the board.
Set out below are reports from each of the nomination committee, audit committee and remuneration committee.
Nomination committee report
During the year the nomination committee was chaired by Tim Bridge, and the other members of the committee were Norman Murray 
and John Brady. Apart from the chairman, all members were considered by the board to be independent.
The committee’s role is to identify, evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment to the board, to review regularly the structure, 
size and composition (including skills, knowledge and experience) of the board and make recommendations to the board with regard 
to any adjustments that are deemed necessary.
The committee is also responsible for considering the company’s succession plans for board members and senior management, taking into 
account the challenges and opportunities facing the company, and what skills and expertise are therefore needed on the board in the future, 
and for reviewing membership of the board’s committees to ensure that undue reliance is not placed upon any individuals.

Board committees continued
Nomination committee report continued
The committee met three times during the year and the chief executive, at the request of the committee, attended two of those meetings. 
One of the meetings was held specifically to deal with the appointment of Matthew Fearn as the new finance director.
In accordance with the articles of association, all directors are subject to re‑ election by shareholders following their appointment and 
subsequently in every third year. The nomination committee undertakes a review of all directors who are due for re‑ election to determine 
whether or not to recommend their re‑appointment. Members of the committee do not participate in discussions regarding their own 
re‑appointment. The board is not proposing to introduce annual re ‑ election for all directors this year, for the reasons set out in the AGM 
notice of meeting.
Audit committee report
The audit committee was chaired during the year by Ian Durant. The other members of the committee were John Brady and, until her 
retirement, Jane Scriven. All members are considered by the board to be independent. The board is satisfied that Ian Durant has recent and 
relevant financial experience, as the former finance director of Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC, formerly Liberty International plc. 
The role of the audit committee is to review the results of the full year audit and the interim results in each case prior to their submission to 
the board. It is responsible for reviewing the company’s internal financial control systems, advising the board on the appointment of external 
auditors, overseeing the relationship with the external auditors, reviewing the company’s whistleblowing procedures and considering the 
need for a full internal audit function. It also reviews the group’s risk management policies and procedures prior to submission to the board 
and receives detailed reports on the risk management functions within the business units. Regular updates are provided to the committee 
on accounting and reporting developments under relevant financial standards and codes.
The committee had three meetings during the year and on each occasion the finance director and senior members of the finance function 
attended. The external auditors attended all of the meetings. There is an opportunity at each meeting for the committee to discuss matters 
privately with the auditors without management present. In addition, the chairman of the committee is in regular contact with the external 
audit partner to discuss matters relevant to the company.
The committee reviews the audit plan presented by the auditors before the start of each audit cycle and agrees the scope of the audit work. 
During the audit process the committee keeps under review the consistency of accounting policies on a year to year basis and across the 
group, and the methods used to account for significant or unusual transactions. The financial statements and interim results are reviewed 
in detail prior to their submission to the board. Following the audit the committee discusses issues arising from the audit, and any matters 
the auditor may wish to discuss. The committee also assesses the effectiveness of the audit process by reviewing whether the auditor has 
met the agreed audit plan, considering the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors in handling key accounting and audit judgements, 
obtaining feedback from key people involved and reviewing the management letter to ensure that the auditors have a good understanding 
of the business.
The audit committee continuously monitors the relationship with the auditors and assesses their performance, cost‑ effectiveness, 
objectivity and independence. The board is satisfied that the auditors are independent of the company and that best practice is being 
observed. Ernst & Young LLP report to the committee regularly to confirm compliance with their own policies, procedures and ethical 
standards in relation to auditor objectivity and independence. 
The committee chairman and the finance director worked together during the year to prepare for the planned retirement of the senior statutory 
auditor responsible for the group’s audit. A new Ernst & Young LLP audit partner has already been identified for the 2011/12 financial year.
The audit committee has established a policy in relation to the use of Ernst & Young LLP for non‑audit work. The company will award 
non‑audit work to the firm which provides the best commercial solution for the work in question, taking into account the skills and experience 
of the firm, the nature of the services involved, the fees payable for the work in question, with particular attention to the level of fees for 
non‑audit services (both for individual services and in aggregate) relative to the amount of the audit fee and whether there are safeguards 
in place to mitigate to an acceptable level any threat to objectivity and independence in the conduct of the audit resulting from such services. 
Pieces of work estimated to be in excess of £25,000 and for which the auditors are being considered are put out to tender unless agreed 
otherwise by the chairman of the audit committee. The finance director may approve specific engagements up to £50,000 and £100,000 
cumulatively, and the chairman of the audit committee may approve engagements up to £100,000 and £200,000 cumulatively, with fees 
in excess of those limits being subject to approval of the full committee. During the year the company made limited use of specialist teams 
within Ernst & Young LLP for non‑audit work such as taxation advice, primarily in relation to the resolution of legacy tax issues on which 
Ernst & Young LLP specialists had originally advised.
The company’s internal audit function focuses primarily on the group’s Retail division, where the greatest financial risks are perceived to exist. 
Elsewhere within the group a combination of the external audit procedures and the types of financial risks involved are felt to be such that 
a wider internal audit function is not required. 
Remuneration committee report
The remuneration committee was chaired during the year by Norman Murray, and the other members were Ian Durant, Jane Scriven 
(until her retirement) and John Brady (appointed to replace her). All the members are considered by the board to be independent. 
The role of the committee includes determining the remuneration policy for the executive directors, the chairman and those members of 
senior management whose details appear on page 33. It agrees the total individual remuneration package of each of the executive directors 
and those senior managers, considers the granting of share options and awards under the long‑term incentive plan and determines bonuses 
payable to the executive directors and senior managers.
The remuneration committee met three times during the year. The chairman and the chief executive, at the request of the committee, attend 
its meetings. The chairman does not participate in any discussions relating to his own remuneration. The chief executive is consulted by 
the committee on its proposals, but does not participate in any discussions relating to his own remuneration.
Details of the company’s policies on remuneration, service contracts and compensation payments are set out in the remuneration report 
on pages 82 to 86. Governance 90 Greene King plc   Annual Report 2011 www.greeneking.co.uk
Communication with shareholders
Shareholder communication is regarded as a key priority for the board, with the annual report and interim statements being the principal 
media used. Both are made available to all shareholders. In addition, the AGM is fully utilised as a means of communicating directly with 
private shareholders, who have the full opportunity to ask questions. The board aims to ensure that all members of the board, including 
in particular the chairmen of the board committees, are available to answer questions at the AGM. 
All substantive items of business at shareholders’ meetings are dealt with under separate resolutions, including a resolution to adopt the report 
and accounts. The chairman announces the results of the proxy voting on each resolution after it has been dealt with on a show of hands. 
The notice of meeting is issued in compliance with both the articles and the combined code and is sent to shareholders a minimum of twenty 
working days before the meeting. 
There is a regular dialogue with institutional shareholders, including meetings after the announcement of the year end and interim results. 
The board receives regular reports from the chief executive on the meetings he and the finance director have with principal shareholders. 
The senior independent non‑ executive director, Norman Murray, is available to shareholders if they have concerns about governance issues 
which the normal channels of contact fail to resolve. 
The company maintains a web site (www.greeneking.co.uk) to provide up‑to ‑ date, detailed information on the company’s operations and 
brands, which includes a dedicated investor relations section. All company announcements are available on this site, as are copies of slides 
used for presentations to investment analysts.
Internal control
The board acknowledges its responsibility for the group’s systems of internal control and for reviewing their effectiveness. Such systems 
can only be designed to manage, and not to eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. They can provide reasonable, but 
not absolute, assurance that the group’s assets are safeguarded and that the financial information used within the business and for external 
reporting is reliable. 
The company has assessed the key risks to which it is exposed and has formalised the control environment needed to address these 
and other issues. There are processes in place which are in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal control. 
The board has adopted a formal risk policy and regularly reviews risk management and internal controls, including key performance 
indicator data on the significant risks faced. 
The executive directors routinely consider the effective management of risk throughout the business at their regular meetings. This group 
oversees the development of risk management strategies, the implementation of suitable management actions and monitors progress made. 
The audit committee receives regular reports on risk issues within the business. 
The board is ultimately responsible for the company’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. A formal assessment 
of the risk and control environment in place during the period and to the date of this report has been undertaken, based on detailed reports 
from, and subsequent discussions with, senior management. No significant problems were disclosed in these reports.
The control environment comprises the elements set out below:
— Internal control and risk management process 
  The directors routinely monitor all aspects of risk management and internal control, and regularly assess the data on the significant 
risks faced. Major risks are identified, the financial implications of each risk assessed and the adequacy and effectiveness of the associated 
control environment analysed. Any issues arising from this process are discussed with operational management as needed. Appropriate 
steps are then taken to mitigate and monitor the effect of these risks. Data on the key exposures is reviewed regularly by the executive 
directors and the audit committee of the board.
— Internal audit
  The controls over the group’s managed houses are enhanced by an internal audit team and the availability of comprehensive 
information from the EPOS till system. On behalf of the board, the audit committee assesses the scope of the internal audit 
function within the group, including seeking the views of the external auditors.
— Information and financial reporting systems
  The group’s comprehensive planning and financial reporting procedures include annual detailed operational budgets and a three 
year strategic plan, both of which are reviewed and approved by the board. Performance against the budgets is monitored, and relevant 
action taken, throughout the year, through the periodic reporting of detailed management accounts and key performance indicators. 
Forecasts are updated during the course of the year.
  With a centralised financial reporting system, transactions and balances are recognised and measured in accordance with prescribed 
accounting policies, and all relevant information is appropriately reviewed and reconciled as part of the reporting process. The use of a 
reporting pack by all business units in the group ensures that information is gathered and presented in a consistent way that facilitates 
the production of the consolidated accounts. 
— Capital and project control
  There are clearly defined evaluation and approval processes for acquisitions and disposals, capital expenditure and project control. 
These include escalating levels of authority, detailed appraisal and review procedures and post‑ completion reviews of all major projects 
to compare the actual outcome with the original plan. Certain transactions are reserved for approval by the board. Limits of delegated 
responsibility and areas of authority have been identified for employees.
— External audit
  The audit committee reports to the board on matters discussed with the auditors during the course of the statutory audit 
and interim review.

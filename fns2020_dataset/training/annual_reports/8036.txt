INDITHERM at a glance
Based near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, Inditherm designs and manufactures heating solutions
using the Company’s innovative low voltage polymer. The technology provides a flexible heating
surface that can produce uniform working heat output to +120°C, powered by a low voltage
(typically 24v) power supply . Applications for the technology are wide spread, though the business
is initially focused on key markets which will enable the establishment of a premium brand 
for heated products. To achieve this goal the Company is organised into the following 
operating groups. 
Specialises in heating solutions for critical temperature management and frost protection for
pipelines and storage containers. Principal markets include confectionery, utilities, food and
chemical processing. Inditherm provides a complete solution of design, build and installation.
Specialises in heating solutions for maintaining core body temperature and improving infection
and wound treatment, plus the recently launched Speedheat range of physiotherapy products.
In partnership with Pegasus Ltd, the Inditherm range of Operating Theatre products combine
effective patient warming performance with reduced operating costs to hospitals throughout 
the UK. 
Specialises in heating solutions for third party partners to incorporate into existing or new end user
products. Examples of products developed to date include heated inserts for steering wheels,
pizza delivery bags and pharmaceutical transportation.
Specialises in heating solutions for personal protection against cold. Products include a range of
own brand clothing and a number of potential partnerships in the leisure wear and cold water
survival suit market.
Formed in November 2002, to handle the development and market exploitation of using the
Inditherm technology for various concrete curing applications, working in conjunction with
Sheffield Hallam University, School of Construction. 2

Chairman’s Statement
Introduction
In my first report to you a year ago I stated that following the Company’s flotation on
AIM in December 2001 the Board’s short term goals were to progress the commercial
growth of the business, expand our product range and develop and strengthen our
relationships with key customers. Though our initial rate of expansion was slowed
during 2002 by the general climate for capital equipment investment in the UK, I am
very pleased to be able to report to you now that we have made good progress in each
of the above areas. 
Results for the year 
Turnover for the year increased overall by 43% to £683,000 (2001: £477,000). After
adjusting for one-off exclusivity payments included within both years, product sales
increased by 61%. The level of administrative expenses necessarily committed to
develop the business resulted in an operating loss of £781,000 for the year (2001: loss
£235,000) and after net interest income of £42,000 (2001: net cost £21,000) the loss before
tax was £739,000 (2001: loss £256,000). Loss per share was 6.8 pence (2001: loss
3.0 pence).
As a result of the loss for the year, together with capital investment in our new
premises, the year end net cash balance reduced to £0.90 million (2001: £2.12 million).
Dividends
Last year I reported the Board’s intention to devote the Company’s financial resources
to business development and product range expansion. This intention, which the
Board believes to be in the shareholders’ best interests, has been pursued during 2002
and will continue for the foreseeable future. Therefore the Board still does not expect
to declare a dividend during the Company’s continuing formative period.
Management
As announced in September 2002, as part of our succession planning Colin Tarry,
formerly Managing Director, took the role of Chief Executive as from 1 October 2002.
Pat O’Grady, the founder of the Company, remains as an executive director in a part-
time capacity, providing guidance, support and technical advice to the Board during
the medium term.
At managerial level, some restructuring and reorganisation of responsibilities within
sales, engineering and production has been implemented to facilitate growth. 
Employees
Given the very substantial increase in enquiry and quotation levels, we have taken on
additional resource to meet our medium term requirement. Though still small, our
workforce has doubled in numbers during the year. In our formative period much work
has been put into setting up systems and procedures to establish ourselves for the future.
On behalf of the Board I thank all our staff most sincerely for their sustained support. 4
Outlook
Though trading patterns are still likely to be somewhat erratic until the second half of
this year, we are now seeing an encouraging growth in enquiries in each of our target
markets, both in the UK and overseas. We have also been improving our
manufacturing efficiency and exercising stringent controls on our cost base to
maximise our opportunity to move into profitable operation.
In the Industrial market the Inditherm product is now receiving considerably more
customer enquiries, albeit that the nature of the business means that it is often several
months before these can be converted into orders. Our sales and marketing activity for
Industrial products now has the additional support of a team of UK agents and two
European distributors, with further distributors still being sought.
Following the launch of our new control unit in September 2002, our Medical business
has seen the return of heated mattress sales via Pegasus, who are now also actively
promoting the Inditherm medical product range in Europe.
Custom products has received the first full production orders for steering wheel
inserts, while our customers for pizza bag and pharmaceutical transportation inserts
are currently negotiating new supply contracts for their products.
The potential for the year ahead appears encouraging, with requests for quotations on
a substantial volume of work. The result in the short term will be dependent upon the
rate at which these quotes can be converted into production orders.

Chairman’s Statement (continued)
INDITHERM plc Chief Executive’s Review
Over the last year we have invested in the infrastructure required to generate and
support business in our various market sectors. We have continued the process of
establishing our technology in our key markets and commenced the process of creating
wider market access.
Industrial solutions
Our technology continues to become accepted for many critical temperature
applications in the process control sector. However, the rate of sales increase has been
affected by the general capital investment climate in the UK, resulting in a slower than
projected take up. We are building on the successful trials work completed during the
year and our products have become a preferred solution for a growing number of
companies operating in food processing and maritime cargo vessels. 
We commenced a programme of identifying and appointing distributors and
representatives that will expand our access to a broader industrial market. In the
second half of the year we appointed a UK group to represent Inditherm in the general
industrial market and European distributors in Finland and Italy. This programme will
continue as a priority to provide a platform of increased market access to support
continued growth.
Medical products
During the year we redesigned the control unit for the original range of operating
theatre products to provide greater capability and to enable access to the international
market. Pegasus launched the new unit in the UK in October 2002 with plans to
establish an international presence in 2003. Following increased demand for our
products in the first quarter of 2002, sales slowed in the remainder of the year in
anticipation of the new unit launch. 
Product development for Pegasus has been focused on the existing range of products, with
future developments of wound dressing and other applications under review for 2003.
In December 2002, a new range of physiotherapy products was launched under the
brand name Speedheat. Early indications are that this range is proving to be of benefit
to the professional sporting community in the treatment of muscle injuries and
improving the recovery time of injured players. 
Custom products
Our Custom Products group has developed new innovative solutions that have been
brought to market during the year. The development programme for steering wheels has
been completed, with initial production orders being received in the first quarter of 2003,
in line with the time scale reported last year. Whilst at a low volume, this initial production
platform provides the baseline design that can be used in future vehicle production.
A distribution and exclusivity agreement with Laminar Medica commenced in October
2002. Initial production quantities have been completed enabling Laminar Medica to
launch the ActivHeat range of heated pharmaceutical containers. Although the
products have only recently been launched, the indications are that production
requirements will become more evenly spread from mid 2003.
5 6
The range of heated inserts used for pizza delivery bags has been extended to cover
various units for a wide range of take-away food delivery systems. Market access has
been limited to trials by a number of major companies in the home delivery market.
Production requirements are now being received for both pizza and curry bag inserts,
with a new range of home use products planned for launch  in  the second quarter of 2003.
In November 2002, we established Inditherm Construction Ltd which will be
responsible for completing the development and market exploitation of Inditherm for
various concrete curing applications. Working in conjunction with Sheffield Hallam
University, School of Construction, a programme has already commenced to research
and develop enhanced methods of controlling the concrete curing process. Initial
results have been very encouraging, although it is not expected that we will have
products to market until 2004. 
Future development
After a demanding year, where the manufacturing facility has been relocated, staff
levels increased and our operating systems brought up to the level required to support
future growth, we are looking forward to a period of expansion and realisation of
potential business. 
In the industrial sector we look forward to further expanding our access to both
national and international markets. We will remain focused on establishing our
technology as the preferred alternative to traditional solutions, building on the
growing acceptance of our capability within major industrial groups. During 2003, we
will undertake product developments that open up new markets that require
hazardous area approval and higher operating temperatures.
We will continue to work closely with Pegasus to accelerate growth within the
international medical market for existing products and to develop new products.
Expansion into Europe and the USA will be the priority for the relaunched operating
theatre range. We expect Pegasus to develop the Speedheat range for use in hospitals
and residential care homes. 
Custom Products will concentrate on the three principal product ranges brought to
market over the last twelve months, working with our partners to increase throughput
and establish the Inditherm technology within these fields. We will continue to explore
new opportunities as they arise, with a view to developing new products that have the
potential for high returns in future years.  
Since taking the position of Chief Executive in October 2002, my focus has been to
build on the work started by Pat O’Grady, to establish Inditherm as the preferred
supplier in our core markets. We have many opportunities and challenges ahead of us
as we look forward with confidence that Inditherm will start to realise its full potential.

Chief Executive’s Review (continued)

Financial Review
Trading results
Having derived the majority of sales from Medical products in the first half of the year,
which included the second exclusivity payment of £200,000 from Pegasus, Industrial
sales activity proved strongest in the second half, mainly through increased take-up
within the food manufacturing sector. Overall, full year turnover was £683,000
(2001: £477,000), an increase of 43%, though the increase in product sales, after
adjusting for one-off exclusivity payments, was 61%.
To support the development of the business, necessary investment was made during
the year in several key personnel and in increased sales and marketing activity.  A level
of ongoing legal and professional costs associated with being a plc has also added to
the cost base. Consequently total administration expenses increased to £1.13 million
(2001: £519,000), resulting in an operating loss of £781,000 (2001: £235,000). In the
absence of the one-off costs and by maintaining tight controls, our ongoing rate of
administration expenses is currently being held below the 2002 level. Costs will only
be increased  with increased trading activity. Cash resources generated net interest
income for the year of £42,000 (2001: net cost £21,000), giving a pre tax loss of £739,000
(2001: loss £256,000). 
With only a minimal increase in issued share capital during the year via exercises of
share options, loss per share increased to 6.8 pence (2001: loss 3.0 pence).
Cash resources and net assets
Cash outflow from operations for the year was £855,000 (2001: £89,000), reflecting the
operating loss incurred plus a £140,000 working capital increase, most of which  related
to payment of costs of flotation  outstanding at the end of 2001. The move to our new
premises in mid year included fit-out and equipment costs of £260,000 out of total
capital expenditure for the year of £428,000 (2001: £4,000). Against these outflows
£125,000 (2001: nil) was received from exercises of share options.
Net funds at the year end after deduction of hire purchase and factoring liabilities were
£738,000 (2001: £2.10 million), while cash balances totalled £0.90 million (2001:
£2.12 million). The £250,000 current asset investment represents a deposit, the majority
of which is to secure our current premises. 
Shareholders’ funds amounted to £1.48 million (2001: £2.08 million), the sustained
deficit for the year being partly offset by the share options exercised.
Taxation 
As the Company has continued to incur trading losses no corporation tax liability has
yet arisen. Accumulated tax losses to the end of 2002 of £1.108 million (2001: £556,000)
are available which should be recoverable against future trading profits. The
Company’s continuing investment in research and development has given rise to a tax
credit provision of £22,000 in the year on qualifying expenditure.

Statement of Corporate Governance
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance in relation to the
Company’s size and sets out below details of how it has applied those provisions
considered appropriate to the group’s circumstances:
Board composition
The Board has three executive directors and two independent non-executive directors.
Details of the Board members appear on page 8. The Board meets regularly throughout
the year and has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for its decision.
The non-executive directors are considered by the Board to be independent of
management and free from any relationship which could materially interfere with the
exercise of their independent judgement. They receive a fixed fee for their services.
The additional recommendations included in the recent Higgs Report on corporate
governance are currently being considered by the Board.
If required, the directors are entitled to take independent legal advice and if the Board
is informed in advance, the cost of the advice will be reimbursed by the Company. The
Company Secretary’s services are available to all members of the Board.
Due to the current size of the Company the roles of Finance Director and Company
Secretary are carried out by one person.
Board committees
The Board has three standing committees, the membership of which is set out on
page 8.
The Audit Committee meets as required, but at least twice a year.  In addition to
reviewing the annual report and financial statements and the interim statement prior
to their submission to the Board for approval, it keeps the scope, cost effectiveness,
independence and objectivity of the external auditors under review. This includes
monitoring the level of non-audit fees. The committee routinely meets for private
discussion with the external auditors, who attend its meetings as required.
The Board is considering the recommendations included in the Smith Report on the
composition and role of the Audit Committee, due to be implemented by July 2003.
The report of the Remuneration Committee is set out on page 11.
The Nomination Committee has recently been created to consider succession planning,
review the structure, size and composition of the Board and nominate candidates to fill
Board vacancies. Detailed terms of reference for this Committee are currently being
established.
Board appointments
Any decision to appoint a replacement or additional director is taken by the entire
Board in formal meeting. Future appointments will include full consideration of the
recommendations of the Nomination Committee. Where necessary new members of
the Board will be provided with appropriate training in respect of their role and duties
as a public company director.  Statement of Corporate Governance (continued)
Relations with shareholders
The Company places a great deal of importance on communication with its
shareholders.
John Markham has been identified as the Company’s Senior Independent Director. He
is available to shareholders who wish to raise any concerns that they have been unable
to resolve through other channels and to attend meetings between management and
major investors.
The notice of the AGM will be sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the
meeting. Resolutions are proposed on each substantially separate issue. At the AGM,
the Company will indicate the level of proxy voting and the directors will be available
to answer questions.
Internal control
The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the group’s systems of internal
control.
Continuous action has been taken over the last twelve months to further the process
which commenced immediately following flotation of strengthening and extending the
level of controls in operation. The directors can now report that the requirements of the
Combined Code have been implemented as they believe appropriate for the
Company’s size and requirements. 
The group maintains systems of internal control to provide reasonable but not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The system of internal control is
structured around an assessment of prioritisation of the various risks to the business.
The control environment is designed to address particularly those risks that the Board
consider to be material to the business, in safeguarding the assets against unauthorised
use or disposition and maintaining proper accounting records which produce reliable
financial information.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control for the
accounting period and the period to the date of approval of the financial statements.
The key features of the group’s systems of internal control are as follows:
  An ongoing process of risk assessment to identify, evaluate and manage
business risks.
  Management structure with clearly defined responsibilities and authority limits.
  A comprehensive system of reporting financial results to the Board. 
  Quality control systems certified under ISO 9001. 
  Appraisal and authorisation of capital expenditure.
The Company does not currently operate an internal audit function. The Board keeps
this requirement under review in relation to the size and complexity of the business.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For
this reason, the going concern basis has been adopted in preparing the financial
statements.

Remuneration Report
Composition
The members of the Remuneration Committee are set out on page 8. This Committee
is responsible for the determination of the remuneration policy of the group’s executive
directors and senior executives.
Details of each individual director’s remuneration and share options are included in
note 4 to the financial statements and those of directors’ shareholdings are set out in
the Report of the Directors.
Policy on remuneration of executive directors and senior executives
Remuneration policy
The Committee endeavours to offer competitive remuneration packages which are
designed to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and senior executives of the
highest calibre. Packages are reviewed each year to ensure that they are in line with the
group’s business objectives. No director participates in decisions about their own
remuneration package. As a result of slower trading conditions the directors
volunteered during the year to accept pay reductions of between 10% and 15%. This
will be reviewed as trading levels improve.
The main components in determining pay are:
  Basic salary/fees and benefits
Salary ranges are reviewed annually and when an individual changes position or
responsibility. Benefits comprise the provision of a vehicle allowance and private
health insurance.
  Annual bonus
Annual performance targets for executive directors are set for both the short and
long term. The bonus scheme includes individual objectives and targets linked to
the group’s performance for its key performance indicators.
  Executive share options schemes
C R Tarry , P J O’Grady and K A Lees have service contracts requiring 12 months written
notice given by either party.
Directors’ pension policy
Executive directors receive pension contributions of 5% of salary.
Non executive directors
The remuneration for the non-executive directors consists of fees for their services in
connection with Board and Board committee meetings and, where relevant, for
additional services such as chairing a Board committee. They are not eligible for
pension scheme membership and do not participate in any of the group’s bonus or
incentive schemes. The non-executive directors have service contracts for a fixed
period of 2 years.

Charitable and political donations
During the year the group made no charitable or political donations.
Creditor payment policy and practice
It is the group’s policy to settle all trade creditors within the normal commercial terms
of trade agreed with each supplier. The number of days purchases represented by trade
creditors at the year end was 56 (2001: 53).
Re-appointment of Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Blueprint Audit Limited as the Company’s auditors will be
proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Special Business
Resolution 4 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting on page 32 renews the authority
of the directors to allot relevant securities. The nominal amount of securities to which
the authority relates is £15,000, which represents approximately 14.2% of the
Company’s current issued share capital. This authority will expire at the earlier of
either the 2004 Annual General Meeting or fifteen months from the date the resolution
is passed. The directors have no present intention of exercising this authority.
Resolution 5 waives the statutory pre-emption rights under section 89 of the
Companies Act 1985 in respect of the allotment of equity securities for cash. The
nominal amount of equity securities which may be issued without being offered to
existing shareholders is £15,000, as noted above for Resolution 4. There is no present
intention to make any such allotment of equity securities, but the directors consider it
desirable to maintain the flexibility afforded by this power.
The directors believe that both of the above resolutions are in the best interests of the
Company and the shareholders and they therefore recommend shareholders to vote in
favour of the resolutions.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial
year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and Company
and of the profit or loss of the group for that year. In preparing those financial
statements, the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed subject to any
material departure disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and to enable
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
INDITHERM plc Independent Auditors’ Report to the shareholders of
Inditherm plc
We have audited the financial statements of Inditherm plc for the year ended
31 December 2002 which comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account,
Consolidated Balance Sheet, Company Balance Sheet, Consolidated Cash Flow
Statement and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under
the historical cost convention and the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with
Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that
we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to
them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the
opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal
and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair
view and are properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also
report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial
statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with
the Company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited financial statements. This other information comprises
only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review,
the Financial Review, the Statement of Corporate Governance and the Remuneration
Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also
includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and
explanations which we consider necessary in order to provide us with sufficient
evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In
forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of
information in the financial statements.
15 Opinion

Notes forming part of the financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2002
1 Accounting Policies
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and
are in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The following principal
accounting policies have been applied:
New accounting standards
FRS18 “Accounting Policies” and FRS19 “Deferred Tax” have been adopted for the first
time in these financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements of the group consolidate the financial statements of Inditherm
plc and its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December 2002 using acquisition
accounting. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during a financial period
are included from the effective date of acquisition.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under Section 230 of the
Companies Act 1985 and has not presented its own profit and loss account. 
The group loss for the year includes an amount of £717,000 loss (2001: £688,000 profit)
in respect of the parent Company.
Turnover
Turnover represents sales to outside customers at invoiced amounts less value added
tax and trade discounts. Where appropriate, the recognition of income is deferred
according to the specific circumstances of material transactions, see note 16.
Intangible fixed assets
Purchased intellectual property rights are capitalised and amortised over the directors’
estimate of their useful economic life of 10 years. In addition, provision is made for any
impairment in value.
Research and development costs
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Investments
Investments held as fixed and current assets are stated at cost less provision for any
impairment in value.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all fixed
assets evenly over their expected useful lives. It is calculated at the following straight
line rates:
Plant, machinery and office equipment – 20% per annum
Fixtures and fittings – 10%-15% per annum
Motor vehicles – 25% per annum
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the cost
of purchase on a first in, first out basis. Net realisable value is based on estimated
selling price less additional costs to completion and disposal. 22
Notes forming part of the financial statements (continued)
For the year ended 31 December 2002
1 Accounting Policies (continued)
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets acquired under hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and
depreciated over their expected useful lives. The interest element is charged to the
profit and loss account over the term of the contract. Rentals in respect of operating
leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term
of the agreement.
Deferred taxation
The payment of taxation is deferred or accelerated because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for accounting and taxation purposes. Full
provision for deferred taxation is made under the liability method, without
discounting, on all timing differences that have arisen, but not reversed by the balance
sheet date, unless such provision is not permitted by FRS 19.
Financial instruments
In adopting Financial Reporting Standard 13: Derivatives and other financial
instruments, the group has not treated short term debtors and creditors as financial
assets and liabilities.
Employee share schemes
Provision is made for National Insurance contributions on options granted on or after
6 April 1999 under unapproved share option schemes. Provision is made at the
prevailing rate on the difference between the period end share value and the grant
price, being the best estimate of the ultimate liability at each period end.
Pension costs
Contributions to the group’s stakeholder pension scheme and to employees’ personal
pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they
become payable.
2 T urnover
All turnover, losses and net assets are wholly attributable to the principal activity of the
group being the manufacture, sale, installation and licensing of specialised heating
products and arose solely within the United Kingdom.

Financial instruments
The group’s financial instruments comprise cash and various items such as trade
debtors, trade creditors etc., that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose
of these financial instruments is to finance the group’s operations. As permitted by FRS
13 short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from interest rate and liquidity
disclosures. The amount of foreign currency held is not considered to be material.
The main risk arising from the group’s financial instruments is liquidity risk. The
group ensures that it has sufficient cash resources available to meet all short term cash
requirements and to meet its capital expenditure programme for the foreseeable future. 
At present the directors do not believe that the group has significant interest rate or
foreign currency risk and consequently does not hedge against such risk. The Board
keeps these risks under regular review.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from
their book values.

 Annual Report 2009
With the rapid development of 
increasingly complex aerospace 
technology, our customers are 
demanding more from the materials 
they use. In Morgan Crucible they 
have a partner who can help them 
respond to the pace of change.
Enhancing aerospace production processes
Innovative materials for the  
aerospace industry
Long life and high-altitude 
performance
Morgan Crucible is helping to make aerospace production 
processes more efficient and safer. For example Thermal Ceramics  
is working with a leading UK investment casting company to 
develop single use bio-soluble mould wrap insulation for casting  
the turbine blades for many civilian and military aircraft. This is 
based on our Superwool 607HT
TM
 and is critical to ensure that the 
nickel-based super-alloy blades develop the right crystal structures 
as they are gradually cooled from 1,600ºC to room temperature.
Advanced materials technology from Morgan 
Crucible is used throughout many modern 
aircraft, including in guidance and satellite 
positioning systems, ignition systems, fire 
protection and suppression, instrument 
displays and engine monitoring. For example, 
the Technical Ceramics Division’s seals, 
thermocouples and feedthroughs are ideal  
for aerospace applications due to their ability 
to withstand the high temperatures, vibration 
and mechanical shock experienced in aircraft 
engines and other high-stress locations.
Through the Carbon Division’s advanced 
engineering, an innovative carbon material 
has been developed to transfer electrical 
current between stationary wires and 
moving parts in low-humidity environments 
at high altitude and in space. Used to 
transfer the high current loads required by 
starter generators on fixed and rotary wing 
aircraft, the material offers longer life with 
no compromise on performance, thereby 
helping to reduce maintenance requirements 
and associated operating costs. Overview

Science, Engineering & Technology  
Student of the Year
Many of Morgan Crucible’s products and services help to improve 
the sustainability of our customers’ operations. For example, 
Thermal Ceramics’ advanced high-temperature insulation solutions 
dramatically reduce energy consumption and associated emissions  
in the metals, petrochemical, power generation and other sectors  
of the economy. Whilst the energy saved by the use of our products 
may exceed the amount consumed in their production by a wide 
margin, we cannot be complacent. Internally we continue to work 
to conserve energy and reduce our carbon footprint in absolute  
and relative terms. As a result our CO
2
 emissions intensity was down 
by 18% over the past two years and we are targeting further 
reductions in the coming years.
 
A new training centre has been opened  
at the Carbon Division’s site in South  
Africa, providing greater flexibility to 
support a range of training initiatives  
from adult basic education through to 
production technology qualifications.
To help foster the best engineering talent, Morgan Crucible 
sponsors the annual Science, Engineering & Technology Student  
of the Year Awards. Morgan Crucible is proud to sponsor this  
event as we believe it allows high-calibre students to showcase  
their remarkable research work and demonstrates the capability

Chairman’s statement
Overview
In my Chairman’s statement last year 
I commented that I believed that the  
Group’s strategy of reducing its exposure  
to economically cyclical, more commoditised 
markets would stand us in good stead  
to weather the very difficult economic 
circumstances that we expected to lie ahead 
in 2009. The past year has confirmed this 
view and Morgan Crucible has shown real 
resilience in its performance during the  
most severe downturn in global industrial 
production that we have seen in most of  
our lifetimes. 
The changes to the Group’s portfolio  
in recent years, with the disposal of 
under-performing and cyclical businesses 
combined with the acquisition of higher 
margin, more differentiated businesses,  
have delivered significant improvements  
in Morgan Crucible’s through-cycle margins. 
Specifically, at the beginning of 2009  
we acquired a further 11% stake in NP 
Aerospace, taking the Group’s equity 
holding to 60% and enabling us to 
consolidate NP Aerospace in Morgan 
Crucible’s financial results. The remaining 
40% stake will be acquired in annual 
tranches of 10% from 2010 to 2013.  
NP Aerospace’s strong business in ballistic 
armour protection delivered an excellent 
performance at a time when general 
industrial markets were significantly 
depressed. As we look to the future, the 
goal for your Board is to leverage Morgan 
Crucible’s extensive global footprint to 
develop opportunities for NP Aerospace 
beyond its traditional position as a 
predominantly UK-focused business.
Both NP Aerospace and the technical 
ceramics businesses acquired in 2008  
from the Carpenter Technology Corporation 
have delivered operating profit margins well 
Morgan Crucible has  
shown real resilience in its 
performance during the 
most severe downturn in 
global industrial production 
that we have seen in most 
of our lifetimes.

into double digits in a particularly  
difficult macroeconomic environment.  
This, combined with a robust performance 
from the existing businesses, has helped  
the Group deliver overall operating profit 
margins before restructuring and one-off 
costs of 9.4%.
I am pleased with the results delivered  
by Morgan Crucible in such a challenging 
market environment. Group revenues  
for the year were £942.6 million compared 
to £835.0 million in 2008. Operating profit 
before restructuring and one-off items was 
£89.0 million compared to £108.8 million in 
2008, and underlying diluted earnings per 
share was 12.6 pence (2008: 22.8 pence). 
From a balance sheet perspective, a strong 
and consistent focus on cash generation 
during the year resulted in net debt being 
reduced from a £290.4 million opening year 
position to £252.7 million by the year end. 
Dividend
The Group’s resilient profit performance  
and solid cash generation mean that  
the Board is confident to recommend 
maintaining a final dividend of 4.5 pence 
per Ordinary share. This brings the total 
dividend for the year to 7.0 pence.
Board
Given the extreme volatility of the market 
environment, your Board remained very 
close to the operational performance of the 
business during 2009. A significant amount 
of our time was focused on ensuring that 
the right mitigating actions were taken 
quickly and decisively in the face of the 
global industrial downturn to ensure that 
the cost base remained as closely aligned  
to revenue demand as possible. This close 
operational cost base focus was a key factor 
in delivering the robust profits and margins 
that were achieved in 2009.
Outlook
As we look forward, we remain cautious  
on the outlook for the world economy 
which we believe still faces a number of 
challenges and uncertainties as various 
national stimulus packages are withdrawn. 
However, encouragingly, in the latter  
parts of 2009 we did begin to see  
signs of modest demand recovery in  
our business, particularly in the Chinese  
and Indian markets. 
Regardless of whether the economic 
outlook remains depressed or does  
indeed begin to show recovery in 2010,  
I am confident that Morgan Crucible is a 
more resilient, higher quality business that  
is well equipped to thrive and prosper in  
the future.
It has been, undeniably, a difficult market 
environment in 2009. That the Group has 
prospered during this period and that it is 
so well positioned for the future is due, of 
course, to the hard work and commitment 
of all our employees around the world.  
The Board is grateful as always for all that 
they have achieved.

Chief Executive Officer’s review
Group results
The Group’s well-established strategy  
of reducing our exposure to economically 
cyclical, more commoditised markets has 
served us well. Operating profit margin 
before restructuring and one-off items  
in 2009 was a highly creditable 9.4%.  
The performance of the NP Aerospace 
business in particular merits highlighting, 
having achieved stellar results in 2009  
with revenues of £186.2 million (compared 
to £72.0 million in 2008) and operating 
profit of £28.8 million (compared to  
£10.7 million in 2008). This is primarily 
attributable to significant business with  
the UK Ministry of Defence in providing 
high-specification vehicle and personal 
ballistic protection solutions. 
Given the challenging market environment, 
we have kept a tight and rigorous focus on 
cash generation and on the health of our 
balance sheet throughout the year. Our 
five-year banking facilities, which were 
coming to the end of their term in 2009, 
were successfully renewed in the first quarter 
during a period of significant uncertainty for 
the world’s banking system. The fact that  
we were able to bring two new banks into 
our syndicate of lenders at a time of such 
turbulence in financial markets was a very 
pleasing endorsement of the strength and 
resilience of your Group. Furthermore, I am 
pleased to report that we ended 2009 having 
successfully maintained our position on the 
key net debt to EBITDA financial covenant at 
2.1 times, which is exactly where we were at 
the end of last year. This is having purchased 
a further 11% stake in NP Aerospace to 
move us to a majority equity holding of 
60%. We are also in a position of being able  
to recommend a full-year dividend in line 
with the prior year.
I am extremely proud of 
what Morgan Crucible has 
achieved in 2009 against  
a backdrop of the most 
difficult market environment 
for industrial companies  
for many decades.

 Annual Report 2009
Divisional highlights
All of the Group’s Divisions have shown 
pleasing resilience during this period of 
pronounced global recession, with each 
delivering sound profit levels in 2009.  
I have already commented on the excellent 
performance of NP Aerospace in its maiden 
set of figures as a majority-owned Morgan 
Crucible business. 
The Technical Ceramics Division also 
deserves special mention for delivering 
£25.1 million of Divisional EBITA before 
restructuring and one-off costs, 
representing an operating profit margin 
of 12.2%. Revenues were £206.0 million 
(compared to £212.2 million in 2008), 
driven by the Division’s increasing exposure 
to more secular growth markets, with our 
medical business performing especially  
well. The integration of the businesses we 
acquired from the Carpenter Technology 
Corporation in 2008 was delivered 
successfully to plan. 
The Insulating Ceramics Division has also 
demonstrated a much improved resilience  
of operating profit margins compared to 
previous downturns, achieving 8.0% in 
2009. The Division’s strong and increasing 
business presence in emerging-market 
economies including China, India and Latin 
America helped offset the weakness of 
western-world economies. Good progress 
was also made in the Division’s operating 
efficiencies driven by the Thermal Ceramics 
‘World Class Manufacturing’ programme.
The Carbon Division, excluding NP 
Aerospace, arguably had the most difficult 
environment of our Divisions in 2009 with 
market downturns in core industrial markets 
combined with demand slowdowns in 
newer end-markets such as solar and US 
body armour. Nevertheless, the business 
made a respectable profit contribution in 
2009, with an encouraging pick-up in orders 
seen in the latter part of the year.
One area where all of our businesses did an 
excellent job during the course of the year 
was in aligning their cost bases with prevailing 
demand levels. Their decisive actions during  
a period of pronounced economic downturn 
were a key factor in your Group weathering 
this difficult environment so robustly. I would 
like to extend a personal thank-you to all  
our employees for their commitment and 
individual contributions towards making  
this happen.
Looking forward
Even though we have seen some degree  
of recovery in many end-markets in the 
latter part of 2009, our expectation is that 
the demand environment is likely to remain 
challenging and will certainly be unpredictable. 
The deep global recession of 2009 was a 
thorough test of our strategy and business 
model, which have stood up to this stern 
examination in a pleasing manner. 
Looking to the future, I am therefore 
confident that Morgan Crucible is emerging 
from the downturn as a stronger, more 
resilient business which is well placed to 
capitalise on opportunities as 2010 develops.  Overview

The Group’s five strategic priorities are: 
To focus on higher growth, higher > >
margin, non-economically cyclical 
markets.
To be high value-added to our > >
customers.
To be number one or number two  > >

Revenue and profits 
Group revenues increased by 12.9% to 
£942.6 million (2008: £835.0 million). 
Group EBITA before restructuring charges 
and one-off items was £89.0 million (2008: 
£108.8 million), representing a margin of 
9.4% (2008: 13.0%). The main factors for 
these movements are as follows:
Carbon: > > Revenues were up by 63% 
compared to 2008 at £391.4 million 
(2008: £239.9 million). This increase 
reflects the inclusion of NP Aerospace  
in the Division’s consolidated results for 
the first time following the increase in 
Morgan Crucible’s shareholding from 
49% to 60% in January 2009. Revenues 
for the underlying Carbon business, 
excluding NP Aerospace, were down 
approximately 25% on a like-for-like 
constant currency basis, reflecting the 
impact the economic downturn had  
on almost all of the markets we serve, 
combined with a significant reduction in 
North America body armour revenues. 
Divisional EBITA including NP Aerospace 
was £40.5 million, a margin of 10.3%, 
compared to £36.3 million, and a 
margin of 15.1%, for 2008. 
Technical Ceramics: > > Revenues for 2009 
were £206.0 million (2008: £212.2 
million), a decrease of 3%. This included 
£45.9 million (2008: £41.4 million, for 
nine months of ownership) of revenue 
contributed by the businesses acquired 
from the Carpenter Technology 
Corporation at the end of March 2008. 
Revenues for the underlying Technical 
Ceramics business, including the 
businesses acquired from the Carpenter 
Technology Corporation as if they had 
been owned for 12 months in 2008, 
were down by 19.4% on a like-for-like 
constant currency basis. Despite the 
unprecedented economic conditions, 
Technical Ceramics was, in the main, 
able to protect Divisional EBITA profit 
margins, which were 12.2% for the year 
(2008: 14.9%).
Insulating Ceramics: > > Revenues for the 
Insulating Ceramics Division decreased 
by 9.8% to £345.2 million in 2009. 
Divisional EBITA and margins dropped  
to £27.6 million and 8% from £45.6 
million and 11.9% in 2008, reflecting 
challenging end-market demand, 
particularly in the second half of  
the year.
Cash generation
The net cash inflow from operating activities 
was £134.5 million (2008: £111.2 million), 
an increase of 21% over the previous year. 
Free cash flow before one-off items and 
dividends was £85.9 million, a substantial 
increase in cash generation on the previous 
year (2008: £34.7 million). This was driven 
by strong working capital management 
which resulted in a net inflow of £25.8 
million compared to last year’s outflow  
of £21.8 million. As a result our net debt  
at the year end was £252.7 million; an 
improvement of £37.7 million compared  
to the 2008 year-end position. Overview

forward the market will offer solid 
opportunities due to the continued 
escalation of ballistic threats and increasing 
demand for lighter, more mobile solutions 
for both vehicles and personnel. 
Electrical current transfer 
The Carbon Division has a strong position  
in the global market for electrical current 
transfer systems which are critical enablers 
for many industries. The Division utilises  
its core technology portfolio and global 
support network to supply carbon brushes, 
collectors and rotary current transfer 
products to railways, the mass transit 
industry, open pit and deep shaft mining, 
and a variety of other key industrial markets. 
During the year, demand in European 
markets and the Americas was down 
significantly due to the global economic 
crisis. However, Asian markets were more 
resilient, particularly China. The medium- 
and long-term prospects are positive, with 
demand in western markets expected to 
improve during 2010.
Fluid handling
Seals and bearings are critical to the  
pumps and compressors used in many fluid 
handling applications in the petrochemical, 
food processing, residential and oil and  
gas industries. The Carbon Division has a 
wide and expanding range of carbon and 
silicon carbide materials and is the globally 
recognised leading provider of seal faces, 
bearings, rotors, vanes and other technical 
solutions required for a large variety of  
fluid handling applications. Market demand 
declined significantly in 2009, but is 
expected to recover slightly ahead of  
global GDP growth in the medium term.

The Carbon Division’s channels to  
market are primarily direct with sales  
and applications engineers serving  
both the original equipment market and  
the aftermarket. The Division is structured 
regionally and is able to leverage its global 
footprint and infrastructure to ensure  
that the best possible resource is deployed 
to provide advanced materials and 
technologies in the form of engineered 
solutions to the following key global 
markets: 
Defence and protection
The Carbon Division is a major supplier  
of advanced ceramic technology to the  
US body armour market and is the major 
supplier of protective body armour systems 
to the UK’s defence forces. The addition  
of NP Aerospace to the Division at the 
beginning of the year broadened our 
materials portfolio and competency in 
ballistics, positioning Morgan Crucible  
as a leader in lightweight armour systems. 
Morgan is now a critical resource to  
the UK’s Ministry of Defence for major 
integration contracts for the fielding of 
next-generation tactical wheeled vehicles 
and our highly advanced systems have  
seen service in both Iraq and Afghanistan. 
The Division continues to invest heavily  
in the development of ballistic solutions  
to counter ever-increasing threats. The 
protection market was robust during the 
year and, although expectations are for 
Power generation and renewables
Over the past two years the global  
energy sector has become an increasingly 
important target market for the Carbon 
Division. The Division’s technology and 
product portfolio includes components 
which are critical to traditional power 
generation companies, the nuclear industry 
and the renewables sector, including solar 
and wind power. In solar power, the Carbon 
Division is a world leader in advanced 
high-temperature solutions providing major 
producers of polysilicon and silicon ingots 
with the means to enhance solar cell 
performance. In wind power generation, 
the Division supplies carbon brushes and 
rotary transfer systems which perform in the 
harshest environments around the globe. 
Investment in wind power slowed during 
2009, but installed capacity represents a 
large and more stable aftermarket for 
carbon brushes. Looking forward, demand 
for both solar and wind power capacity  
is expected to grow significantly and the 
Division is well placed to capitalise on  
this growth.
Semiconductor processing
The Carbon Division’s products are at the 
heart of many electronic innovations, and 
are used in semiconductor manufacturing 
processes such as ion implantation,  
epitaxy and compound crystal growth.  
With the drive to faster, smaller and lower 
cost devices, semiconductor processing 
equipment companies are dependent on 
advanced materials being able to work at 
higher temperatures and having higher 
purity levels to achieve the required 
performance. The Carbon Division also  Overview

continued
supplies products used in the manufacture 
of components such as optical fibres, laser 
diodes, and transistors for mobile and 
satellite communications. The sector started 
to decline in mid 2008 and by early 2009 
demand was down very significantly. The 
market began to improve in the summer  
of 2009 and is expected to grow in 2010. 
Although this sector is a relatively small 
portion of the Division’s turnover, our 
engineered solutions are highly valued  
and prospects for future growth through 
innovation are promising.
Research and development
The Division is a leader in carbon-based 
materials, oxide and non-oxide ceramics  
and lightweight composites, having 
expanded its materials technology portfolio 
through in-house research and development 
and through the strategic acquisitions of NP 
Aerospace in 2009 and Aceram in 2006.  
The Division’s research activities cover both 
material and process capabilities and are 
located within our major material processing 
facilities in the USA, the UK and China. 
Carbon’s application development engineers 
in 25 countries worldwide work with our 
customers to apply the Division’s advanced 
materials and process technologies to 
develop leading-edge solutions according  
to customer need and to position the 
Division as a leader in high-growth and 
emerging markets.
Divisional performance
Total revenues for the Carbon Division were 
up by 63% on a reported basis at £391.4 
million (2008: £239.9 million). This increase 
reflects the inclusion of NP Aerospace in the 
Division’s consolidated results for the first 
time following the increase in Morgan 
Crucible’s shareholding from 49% to 60% 
in January 2009. The like-for-like revenue 
increase (ie including NP Aerospace revenues 
for all of 2008 when they were accounted 
for as an associate) on a constant currency 
basis was 13%. This was driven by an 
exceptionally strong performance from the 
NP Aerospace business with revenues of 
£186.2 million, up 159% on the previous 
year (2008: £72.0 million).
Revenues for the underlying Carbon Division 
business, excluding NP Aerospace, were 
down approximately 25% on a like-for-like 
constant currency basis, reflecting the 
impact of the economic downturn 
combined with a significant reduction  
in North America body armour revenues. 
Second half revenues were broadly flat  
on the first half, reflecting a seasonally  
quiet third quarter, especially in Europe,  
and some improvement in quarter four. 
The traditional electrical brush and the  
seals and bearings businesses were affected 
by a significant contraction in mature 
western markets, although growth was 
achieved in China with the introduction  
of new products. 
The rotary business was impacted by a 
continued slowdown in the industrial and 
construction markets however, significant 
progress was made in the global wind 
energy sector and in China.
The high-temperature insulation  
business delivered some growth in  
2009, despite deeply contracted markets. 
Demand for these products is driven by 
the processing of advanced materials  
for markets such as solar energy and 
semiconductors. The Division continued  
to improve its operational capability and 
product offering and is well positioned  
to take advantage of the expected market 
improvements. 
Full-year EBITA on a reported basis was 
£40.5 million, a margin of 10.3%, 
compared to £36.3 million and a margin  
of 15.1% for 2008. EBITA margins were 
15.5% in NP Aerospace and 5.7% in the 
underlying Carbon business and, whilst the 
margin in the underlying Carbon business 
was below that achieved in 2008, second 
half margins improved over the first half  
of 2009.
The NP Aerospace business had a very 
strong year, with revenues in each half in 
excess of £90 million. Demand for Mastiffs, 
Ridgbacks and Wolfhounds from the  
UK Ministry of Defence (UK MoD) remained 
strong throughout 2009 and progress was

Reductions in the working week were also 
implemented at a large number of sites and 
the relocation of manufacturing to lower 
cost regions such as Mexico, China and 
Hungary was accelerated wherever possible. 
As a result of these actions, full-year total 
employment costs were reduced by more 
than £12 million compared with 2008. 
However, the Division maintained its 
commitment to devote resources to new 
growth opportunities, advancing its position 
in the renewable energy sector, in the global 
armour market and in China.
Looking forward, the actions taken to  
meet the challenges of the global economic 
downturn provide a more efficient and 
flexible structure to respond effectively  
as market demand recovers, and the 
increased focus on global growth markets 
has improved the prospects for growth 
entering 2010.
Outlook
End-market demand in the Carbon 
Division’s underlying business stabilised 
during the third quarter of 2009 and has 
shown some signs of recovery entering 
2010. Improvements to the cost base and  
to global operational capability, along with 
the focus of effort and resource on higher 
growth markets, means that the Division  
is well positioned to take advantage of 
improvements in the global economy.
made in the development of new product 
offerings. NP Aerospace has successfully 
established itself as a critical supplier to the 
UK MoD and is, through the deployment of  
its technology into combat theatre, gaining 
global recognition for its highly advanced 
lightweight armour systems.
Business developments
The key developments in 2009 were the 
excellent performance of the NP Aerospace 
business and the response to the global 
economic crisis. 
At the beginning of 2009 the Group 
increased its equity stake in NP Aerospace 
from 49% to 60% as part of the strategy  
to further develop the Group’s presence  
in the market for personal and vehicle 
protection. During the year NP Aerospace 
more than doubled its sales and profits  
and has strengthened its position as a 
critical supplier to the UK MoD for the 
armouring and integration of tactical 
wheeled vehicles and for personal 
protection in terms of body armour and 
helmets. Good progress was also made in 
developing future strategies for accessing 
the Division’s wider global footprint across  
a number of key geographic regions.
In the underlying Carbon business, a series 
of significant cost reduction actions were 
initiated in the second half of 2008 in 
anticipation of weakening demand. Total 
headcount has been reduced by nearly 700 
(18%) since the summer of 2008. 
NP Aerospace is expected to continue  
to perform well above pre-acquisition  
levels; however, revenues in 2010 are 
expected to be below the record levels  
of 2009. Opportunities beyond the UK 
market are being pursued and could allow  
a further ’reinvention’ of the business.
Through the course of 2010 the Division’s 
operational footprint will continue to  
be refined, while appropriate resource 
is committed to markets that offer the 
greatest long-term profitable growth.  
After a year of consolidation and 
considerable reinvention, the Division  
is much better positioned for future 
challenges and opportunities.  Overview

to customer-specific requirements. Our main 
channel to market is direct with sales and 
applications engineers working closely with 
our customers to establish their needs and 
support them through the design and 
production process. The Division has strong 
niche positions within its target markets. 
The performance and prospects of the  
five main markets are described below.
Aerospace 
As engines run hotter in order to increase 
efficiency and reduce CO
2
 emissions, 
demands on the materials used in their 
construction become greater, as does the 
need to monitor and control operating 
conditions. Technical Ceramics produces 
braze alloys for engine build and repair and 
ceramic components and sub-assemblies for 
engine monitoring and control equipment. 
Our Certech business manufactures cores 
used in the casting of turbine blades.  
We also supply piezoelectric components 
and sensors, including fuel level sensors  
and gyroscopes, and our Diamonex™ 
engineered coatings are used on critical 
components of aircraft fuel systems.  
As passenger numbers fell during 2009,  
our sales to the aerospace market declined 
significantly. Forecasts for 2010 are 
expected to show growth year on year, 
but the market will remain difficult in the 
medium term.

Technical Ceramics leverages its advanced 
ceramic materials capabilities to serve its 
major markets – aerospace, automotive, 
electronics, household goods, industrial 
equipment, medical, power generation, 
process control and monitoring and  
security and defence. Ninety percent of 
sales are designed and manufactured  
expertise includes ceramic orthopaedic  
joint replacements and highly specialised 
ceramic-to-metal assemblies for implantable 
devices such as pacemakers, cochlear 
implants and defibrillators. In addition we 
supply key components for instrumentation 
and diagnostic equipment such as ultrasonic 
imaging, CAT and MRI scanners. Our superior 
piezoelectric ceramic components are 
enabling increased resolution of ultrasonic 
imaging and are used extensively in medical 
ultrasound. Piezoelectric components are also 
the key technology in applications such as 
blood flow measurement and foetal heart 
monitors, providing increased reliability and 
accurate detection. Additionally, they can 
be found in ultrasonic air-in-line sensors  
in medical devices and infusion pumps.  
The high-performance piezoelectric material 
is used in high-power transmission of 
high-frequency waves to assist with surgical 
cutting. We supply efficient materials for 
small medical tools such as ultrasonic dental 
descalers and ultrasonic scalpels, which are 
used in applications such as cataract removal. 
Multilayer chip capacitors are used extensively 
in MRI systems to tune the magnetic field 
accurately and our ceramic capacitors can  
also be found in lasers for eye surgery. 
The medical market again showed itself  
to be resilient in times of recession. Sales 
growth was strong during the year and  
the market is expected to continue to grow 
strongly in the medium term.  Overview

Industrial equipment
The mechanical, electrical, chemical and 
thermal characteristics of our materials 
make them ideally suited for use in harsh 
processing environments such as those  
found in valves, pumps and a variety of 
manufacturing processes. Our ceramic 
rollers are used in kilns used for the 
manufacture of metals, glass, ceramic-ware 
and fuel cell production. Our kiln furniture 
and high-temperature components are  
used in a wide range of specialist thermal 
processing applications from industrial 
annealing to medical device manufacture 
and scientific equipment.
Our range of high-efficiency piezoelectric 
materials are used in many high-power 
ultrasonic systems such as those for cleaning 
and welding. We also design and manufacture 
complete sensors and transducers for these 
industrial applications. The global downturn 
in manufacturing and equipment sales 
impacted our revenues in this market and 
we saw a decline compared to 2008. A 
steady recovery is expected in the coming 
year and medium-term prospects are 
generally positive. 
Power generation and distribution
Energy generation, management and 
distribution is arguably one of the fastest 
evolving industries of modern times.  
Our precision-engineering capabilities  
are increasingly being called on to develop 
components and sub-assemblies for new 
products across the power sector. Increasing 
global demand for power and dramatic 
increases in energy costs have led to an 
increased emphasis on environmental issues 
and the need for renewable energy.  
We supply a range of products that are used 
in the manufacture of thin-film photovoltaic  
cells for the solar industry and our Certech 
business manufactures cores used in the 
manufacture of turbine blades used for 
industrial gas turbines. A slowdown in 
equipment sales and cutbacks in funding  
of new projects caused sales to the power 
sector to decline significantly during the 
year. However, the outlook for the coming 
year is more encouraging. 
Electronics
Technical Ceramics’ components and 
sub-assemblies are used extensively in the 
electron tubes used in communications, 
healthcare, security and research 
applications. Our components are used  
in hand-held, land-based and satellite 
communications equipment and networks 
for the telecommunications sector; as well 
as PCs, servers, data storage and a range  
of peripheral equipment for IT hardware 
producers. Demand for mobile devices  
that offer increasing functionality, together 
with increased requirements for data 
storage, drives the consumer products 
segment of this market to develop and 
introduce a constant flow of new products. 
In addition, the laser market continues  
to find new applications that drive growth 
in healthcare, product marking and  
process control. During 2009 demand for 
consumer-related products weakened but 
this was offset by sales of electron tube 
products, driven by security and related 
applications. Sales of products for data 
storage devices were also strong, driven  
by new product launches. Overall the 
electronics market declined slightly, but 
prospects for 2010 are more positive with 
growth expected in the medium term. 
Research and development
Technical Ceramics’ research and 
development capabilities are led by the 
Divisional Technical Director with a network 
of materials scientists and process engineers 
across our operations. They work with our 
customers to engineer solutions that address 
their needs. The Division also undertakes 
research in collaboration with leading 
universities in Europe and North America. 
Our internal research and development 
focus has been on product development  
for the medical and solar markets. In the 
medical sector, we have developed and 
released a new implantable grade of 
ceramic (Vitox™ AMC) which will have 
applications for orthopaedic implants.  
In solar energy, we have developed products 
that are used in the growth and subsequent 
processing of silicon substrates for solar 
panels as well as a variety of uniquely stable 
ceramic products that are used by panel 
producers using thin-film manufacturing 
techniques. 
In 2009, Technical Ceramics registered  
a number of new patents. These include  
a controlled textured ceramic surface called 
Sharkskin™ which will have a variety of  
end application uses in the semiconductor, 
medical and other markets. Another is  
for a new silicon carbide diamond pad 
conditioner named Phoenix™ which is  
used for chemical-mechanical polishing  
in semiconductor manufacturing.

 Annual Report 2009
Business developments
During the year, Technical Ceramics 
maintained its focus on positive mix shift, 
moving towards higher margin, higher 
value-added end-markets such as medical 
and aerospace, whilst concurrently reducing 
exposure to more commoditised and 
economically cyclical product areas. Our 
continuous operational improvement 
programme, cost reduction initiatives and 
our emphasis on positive price pass-through 
are all contributing to supporting operating 
margins in very difficult market conditions. 
In 2009 major investments were controlled 
due to the uncertain market outlook. Work 
on consolidating our footprint continued 
throughout the year. In July we announced 
and initiated the move of business from  
our Auburn site into the Hayward location 
in California, USA and expect to realise  
the benefits of this in 2010. In October  
we announced the sale of the small  
Metal Injection Moulding (MIM) business 
for £1.1 million. The MIM business was 
based at our New Bedford, MA, USA site 
and the sale will make room to expand 
the medical business there. The Shanghai, 
China site, which produced mostly 
commodity products for domestic 
applications, was successfully closed  
on time and to plan during the first half  
of the year. 
Divisional performance
Revenues for 2009 were £206.0 million 
(2008: £212.2 million), a decrease of 3.0%. 
This included £45.9 million (2008: £41.4 
million, for nine months of ownership)  
of revenue contributed by the businesses 
acquired from the Carpenter Technology 
Corporation in 2008. The proforma 
underlying revenue decrease at constant 
currency was 19.4% compared to the  
full year 2008 (the proforma calculation 
assumes that Carpenter was included for a 
whole year in 2008 to enable a like-for-like 
comparison).
Despite the unprecedented and difficult 
economic conditions, the Division was,  
in the main, able to protect margins, which 
were 12.2% for the year (2008: 14.9%). 
EBITA for the year was £25.1 million  
(2008: £31.6 million). The Division made 
progress during the year and finished 2009 
well, with an EBITA margin of 13.4% in  
the second half. (first half 2009: 11.1%).
In response to the weaker global market 
conditions, we took early and decisive 
action to protect our margins. These cost 
control measures included headcount 
reductions of 670 employees compared  
to June 2008, with the majority taking  
place in the first half of 2009. These 
measures continued to deliver benefits  
in the second half of the year, driving the 
improved margins seen over the first half.
Outlook
Although overall market demand declined  
in 2009 there are some areas that showed 
positive signs of improvement as we  
enter 2010. 
The US market appears to have stabilised, 
although we continue to watch carefully  
for any signs of a further downturn. Some 
weakness in the aerospace and industrial 
gas turbine sector is being offset by 
improvements in demand from sectors 
within the electronics market. An example 
of this is our initiation of a production 
ramp-up to meet demand for the next 
generation of hard disk drive products. 
Our European business had a difficult year, 
being consistently challenged by weak 
market conditions in general industrial 
markets and construction. This principally 
affects our business in Germany, which 
supplies products for manufacturing 
applications involving thermal processing. 
Since the half year we have seen a reduction 
in industrial gas turbine demand, which is 
continuing into 2010. In both Europe and 
North America a highlight of 2009 has been 
the continuing strength of our medical 
customers. Developing our presence in  
this sector remains an important focus  
for the Division during 2010. We continue  
to look carefully at potential bolt-on 
acquisition opportunities that would 
enhance our offering in our core markets, 
which together with our strong new 
business pipeline leaves the Division  
well placed for the future. Overview

projects lasting many years in planning  
and implementation. Thermal Ceramics is 
well positioned in the market and with its 
leading capability offers bespoke packaged 
solutions of insulation bricks, fibre and fibre 
products. During the year the sector was 
relatively strong and is seen as likely to 
remain so in the short and medium term. 
Fire protection 
Thermal Ceramics’ FireMaster™ fire 
protection systems are comprehensively 
certified and extensively tested to meet 
national and international standards, 
offering customers proven fire protection 
performance in various sectors including 
commercial buildings, hotels, airports, 
industrial plants, offshore platforms,  
cruise ships, military vessels and tunnels  
and other underground construction. 
Thermal Ceramics works with fire protection 
specialists in the sector and channels to 
market include direct sales and distribution. 
Fire protection-related legislation is a key 
factor in driving demand in the sector, 
which is also linked to construction output. 
During the year, demand was down but 
increased penetration enabled Thermal 
Ceramics to outperform the underlying 
market. It is expected that the new lighter 
weight solutions of the FireMaster™ 
product range, combined with the 
increasing regulatory requirements for  
fire protection, will create opportunities  
for growth in 2010. 
Ceramics 
Thermal Ceramics’ fibre products offer 
multiple benefits to the ceramics industry, 
including saving energy by reducing kiln  
car mass. Each year over one million square 
metres of Thermal Ceramics insulating 
products is installed in kilns firing ceramic 
products from tiles to tableware and from 
sanitaryware to fine bone chinaware. 
Thermal Ceramics’ routes to market include 
both direct sales and distribution. The 
Division’s application engineering and 
design capabilities are a key competitive 
advantage and its customer base is  
broadly diversified.
The business targets growth opportunities 
in the following key markets:
Metals/Iron and steel
Thermal Ceramics has a strong position in 
the supply of monolithic linings for blast 
furnaces, fibre modules in reheating and 
heat treatment furnaces and insulating fire 
bricks for hearth and reheating furnaces 
where product quality is a key differentiator. 
Channels to market include distribution with 
direct sales to major accounts and where 
engineering input is required. Demand from 
the iron and steel sector declined in the year 
although demand for higher technology 
heat management solutions from Asia  
was strong. In the medium term, as the 
global economy recovers, the demand  
for steel will begin to rise again fuelled  
by industrialisation, population growth and 
construction. In addition, steel producers 
are seeking new heat management 
solutions to tackle environmental concerns 
and rising energy costs and to increase 
operational efficiency. 
Petrochemical processing 
Thermal Ceramics targets both new  
and retro-fit projects in the global 
petrochemical sector, supplying heat 
management solutions for fired heaters, 
sulphur recovery units, fluid catalytic 
cracking units and boilers. As petrochemical 
and refining process technology develops, 
high-temperature heat management and 
energy efficiency become increasingly 
critical. Long-term growth in the sector  
is geared to population expansion with 
Insulating fire bricks are sold under the 
JM™, K™ and TJM™ brands, for use in 
roller kilns, shuttle kilns, tunnel kilns and 
hobby kilns. Thermal Ceramics is well 
positioned in the market based on its 
high-quality products and engineering 
support. Demand in the ceramics industry is 
broadly linked to building and construction 
and has suffered from a severely reduced 
market in the last year. The outlook remains 
good longer term but with the market 
moving faster from Europe to Asia following 
the downturn. 
Power generation 
Increasing demand for electricity across 
the world, and particularly in the emerging 
economies, is driving expansion in the 
power generation sector. Environmental 
and energy/cost efficiency issues make heat 
and thermal management a key issue for all 
operators. For example, Thermal Ceramics’ 
low bio-persistent fibre Superwool™ is used 
for duct insulation in heat recovery steam 
generators (HRSGs), offering high-
temperature resistance with the important 
reassurance that the materials utilised are  
an environmentally friendly solution. The 
new-generation fibre Superwool Plus™ 
improves HRSG design further by reducing 
heat losses or reducing panel thickness. 
Power generation is a global industry with 
the specification, fabrication, financing and 
installation of projects potentially taking 
place on different continents. Such 
long-term projects are proving resilient to 
market downturns. Thermal Ceramics has  
a strong position in higher end applications 
in the power generation and renewables 
sector, serving the market through both 
direct sales with engineering support and 
via distributors.  Overview

Research and development
The Thermal Ceramics business carries out 
the majority of its research and development 
at its Bromborough, UK site, in a purpose- 
built world-class facility. With 25 dedicated 
scientists, the team has led the market  
in the development of low bio-persistent 
fibres, low-energy furnace operation  
and product development. The work of  
this team has been at the heart of all of 
Thermal Ceramics’ major product launches 
of the last five years and in the past year 
investment has been increased as the 
business positions itself for future growth. 
Molten Metal Systems (MMS) 
MMS has a leading position in the supply of 
crucibles to the non-ferrous metals industry 
and manufactures equipment and foundry 
products used in the melting, holding and 
processing of metals and alloys.
MMS employs some 500 people** at  
its 10 locations worldwide, including five 
manufacturing facilities with localised 
technical support and five distribution 
centres. MMS is managed as an integrated 
global business with three product lines: 
crucibles, foundry consumables and 
furnaces. In 2009 Germany and India 
accounted for 90% of production output. 
MMS’s strategy is to deliver targeted 
solutions for metal casters, focused on 
improving their metal quality, increasing 
efficiency and reducing energy consumption 
and related CO
2
 emissions.
This strategy is implemented by:
Focusing on high-value/high-challenge > >
opportunities. 
Striving for operational excellence > >
worldwide. 
Developing a growth culture throughout > >
the business.
MMS serves its customers through a 
combination of direct sales and distribution 
with targeted technical support. MMS’s key 
growth opportunities are driven by multiple 
end-use markets. These include: 
Non-ferrous castings for the automotive, > >
marine and rail markets. 
The recycling and refining of precious > >
metals from mining projects. 
The production of metal powder for  > >
the cosmetics, aerospace and defence 
markets. 
Copper and brass castings for the > >
construction, chemical processing  
and oil and gas sectors. 
The production of pure aluminium  > >
for electronics applications. 
MMS has a leading market position in 
crucibles, which make up 80% of its 
revenue; key markets are North America, 
India, Brazil and Germany. Sales to the 
Indian market were up by over 15% in  
the year. Future growth will continue  
to come from the ‘BRIC’ countries and 
smaller developing markets. 
MMS’s technology capability is focused  
in its global research and product 
development facilities which form  
part of the Indian operations.
Divisional performance
The Insulating Ceramics Division comprises 
two reportable operating segments, 
Thermal Ceramics and Molten Metal 
Systems (MMS).
In 2009 the Insulating Ceramics  
Division’s revenue decreased by 9.8% to 
£345.2 million (2008: £382.9 million). On  
a constant currency basis, the year-on-year 
decline was 19.7%. Divisional EBITA and 
margins dropped to £27.6 million and 8.0% 
respectively from £45.6 million and 11.9% 
in 2008.
Thermal Ceramics
Thermal Ceramics’ revenues decreased  
by 9.3% to £315.1 million in 2009  
(2008: £347.4 million). On a constant 
currency basis, the year-on-year decline  
was 19.4%. End-market demand was more 
challenging in the second half of the year 
with a revenue decline of 6.6% at constant 
currency compared to the first half of 2009.
Due to early management action, Thermal 
Ceramics’ profitability showed encouraging 
resilience to this sales decline compared with 
the performance in previous downturns,  
with EBITA margins holding up well at 8.5% 
(2008: 11.9%) and with EBITA for the year  
of £26.7 million (2008: £41.4 million). 
Our businesses in the developed economies 
of Europe and North America were most 
affected by the global downturn. In contrast, 
markets in Asia and Latin America held  
up somewhat better and in the latter part  
of the year started to show some order  
book recovery.

Thermal Ceramics’ new product 
development remains concentrated in  
the field of low bio-persistent fibre with  
the continued roll-out of Superwool 607
TM
,  
the improved insulation performance 
product of Superwool Plus
TM
, as well as  
the higher temperature Superwool HT
TM.
 
The Division is positioned as the global 
technology leader in the production of 
its bio-soluble product range.
The objective of Thermal Ceramics  
‘World Class Manufacturing’ programme  
is to increase productivity overall by 
improving health, safety and environmental 
performance, quality, cost, logistics and 
customer satisfaction. The roll-out of the 
programme covered three plants in 2009 
with a further three plants planned for 
2010. At the same time, engineering and 
research time is being utilised to optimise 
manufacturing processes to improve gross 
margins through improved raw material  
and energy yield enhancements. 
The relocation of MMS’s manufacturing 
footprint to India and China was completed 
in 2009. Both facilities are fully functional. 
The focus in 2010 is to leverage our 
low-cost advantage and move the business 
into a period of profitable growth.
Outlook
Towards the end of 2009 Thermal Ceramics’ 
order intake rate started to improve in all 
regions except Europe. This has continued 
into the early part of 2010 with the 
expectation that the year will show a  
trend of continued improvement, although 
Europe is likely to remain slow until 2011. 
Margin improvements were made with a 
number of operational excellence initiatives 
underway, including our ‘World Class 
Manufacturing’ programme. 
Molten Metal Systems
MMS revenues decreased by 22.5% in  
2009 on a constant currency basis. The  
decline in customer demand was most 
severe in Europe and North America. The 
foundry products and crucibles product 
lines fared significantly better than the 
furnace equipment product line.
While the business traded at just above 
breakeven in the first half of 2009,  
it improved in the second half of 2009  
as benefits of the cost reduction and 
manufacturing footprint moves began  
to take effect. 
Business developments
Whereas 2008 represented a growth  
period for Thermal Ceramics, 2009 has 
been one of cost control and consolidation 
in the face of the challenging global 
economic conditions. Commencing in late 
2008, the business implemented a cost 
reduction programme that led to a 12% 
headcount reduction at the end of 2009. 
The cost reduction programme included  
the closure of two fibre plants: Erwin, USA 
and Skawina, Poland.
The long-term outlook for Thermal 
Ceramics remains encouraging, driven by 
the growth in global population and the 
continuing industrialisation of emerging 
economies. In 2009 some 39% of revenues 
were generated in the Asian and Latin 
American regions and this percentage is  
set to increase. These factors, combined 
with the need to reduce energy expenditure 
and the increasingly stringent environmental 
legislation that favours low bio-persistent 
fibres such as Superwool
TM
, will continue  
to drive demand for Thermal Ceramics’ heat 
management solutions.
The outlook for MMS is positive with  
the order book having improved markedly 
due to modest recovery in Europe and 
strong growth in India and China. Having 
successfully completed the relocation of its 
manufacturing facilities, approximately 70% 
of MMS’s 2010 output will come from India, 
Brazil and China. MMS is well placed to take 
advantage of the continuing industrialisation 
of emerging economies and to retain its 
market-leading position. Overview

Environment, health and safety
Our Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) 
Policy and implementation programmes 
support our five strategic priorities and  
our Core Values Statement. The regular 
collection and reporting of EHS key 
performance indicators (KPIs) and the 
setting of EHS-related targets assist us  
in the development and monitoring of 
programmes to reduce the impact of  
our operations on the environment. 
The Company is committed to conducting 
all its activities in a manner which achieves 
the highest practicable standards of health 
and safety for our employees and others 
affected by our operations. 
This Report includes a summary of our EHS 
Policy and its effectiveness as demonstrated 
through our EHS KPIs and programmes. 
Further detail will be included in our 2009 
EHS Report to be published on our website 
in April 2010. The EHS Report will also 
include case studies to help demonstrate 
our approach to enhancing the sustainability 
of our business.
EHS Policy
The Group’s EHS Policy applies Group-wide. 
It is made available to all employees and is 
published on our website and in our annual 
EHS Report.
During 2009, we reviewed and externally 
benchmarked our Group EHS Policy. The 
revised policy has been agreed by the 
Executive Committee and approved by  
the Board. In addition to statements of  
EHS policy, the new EHS Policy clearly sets 
out the responsibilities for EHS matters 
throughout the Group.
Our EHS Policy requires high standards  
of EHS management at all sites. This is 
achieved through risk assessment and  
the management and mitigation of 
identified risks to help provide continuous 
improvement in environmental, health  
and safety performance in support of  
our strategic priorities.
EHS Policy implementation
Our EHS Policy forms the basis of our 
environment, health and safety management 
systems and processes. The management of 
our environmental and health and safety 
performance is aligned with the operation of 
our day-to-day business. The Chief Financial 
Officer has specific responsibility for EHS 
Policy and performance, supported by the 
Director of Environment, Health and Safety. 
Operational responsibility is delegated to  
the Chief Executive of each Division and  
the manager of each operation. In practice,  
all employees are responsible for ensuring 
that our EHS Policy is implemented and  
for identifying additional areas and 
opportunities for further development.
Morgan Crucible’s environmental and  
health and safety management processes 
include the EHS Compliance Audit 
Programme carried out by external auditors 
in Europe and Asia and in-house resources 
in the Americas. This programme provides 
assurance of the EHS management at each 
site and helps ensure compliance with local 
regulations and good management practice. 
All of the Group’s manufacturing facilities 
are audited on a three-year rolling cycle.  
Thirty-three sites were audited during 2009, 
including all seven of the Group’s Chinese 
facilities. This enabled the effectiveness of 
the first stage of the Group’s Chinese EHS 
training and improvement programme to  
be independently assessed. Our target  
for 2010 is to audit a further 26 sites. 
Training is an integral part of our EHS  
Policy implementation. During 2008 we 
implemented an in-depth EHS training 
programme at all of the Group’s facilities  
in China. The programme was carried out 
with the assistance of external consultants 
and included comprehensive training of 
senior management and the development 
and implementation of EHS management 
systems at all sites. The EHS Compliance 
Audits carried out at all of these facilities  
in 2009 showed a substantial improvement 
in EHS performance. A small number of 
areas requiring further improvement were 
identified and these are being addressed  
in the next stage of the programme, which 
is currently underway. 
The success of the Chinese programme 
demonstrated the benefits of focused  
EHS training and a similar programme  
is being developed for the Group’s six 
manufacturing facilities in India. This 
programme will be implemented in 2010. 
Environmental management systems are  
in place at 89 sites worldwide, representing 
over 90% of output, including 34 major 
sites or 38% of output certified to ISO 
14001 (2008: 27 sites and 43% of output). 
Seven sites achieved certification in 2009, 
however, the proportion of our output 
covered by ISO 14001 certification declined 
due to the consolidation of NP Aerospace. 
We plan for the main NP Aerospace sites  
to be certified over the period of 2010-11.
These new certifications are in addition to 
the ongoing programme of recertifications. 
All of our major sites worldwide have health 
and safety management systems in place, 
with nine sites certified to or working 
towards OHSAS 18001. Overview

Environmental performance
Wherever possible we work to minimise the 
impact of our business on the environment 
and to maximise the positive environmental 
benefit of our products. 
Our environmental target for the two years 
2009-10 is to reduce the intensity of our 
CO 2 emissions due to all sources of energy 
use by 5% in real terms. CO 2 intensity was 
down by 14% in 2009. In absolute terms 
total CO 2 emissions due to energy use were 
some 393,000 tonnes against 464,000 
tonnes in 2008, 444,000 tonnes in 2007 
and 419,000 tonnes in 2006. Our waste 
intensity was down by 11% in the year, 
ahead of our 5% reduction target for the 
two years 2009-10. The proportion of total 
waste which was recycled was 28% in 
2009, down one percentage point on  
the prior year and thus we are not on track 
to achieve our target to increase the level  
of recycling to 35% of total waste over  
the period 2009-10. Water intensity was  
down 9% in 2009 and we are ahead of  
the targeted 5% reduction over the two 
years 2009-10.
We will again be targeting reductions in our 
energy, emissions, waste and water intensity 
in 2010 to ensure we achieve our targets  
for the two-year period 2009-10. Further 
details will be included in our EHS Report to 
be published on our website in April 2010.
EHS Policy effectiveness
In addition to the EHS Compliance  
Audit Programme, the Group monitors  
the effectiveness of its EHS Policy through  
a series of EHS KPIs. These are reported 
Group-wide on a monthly basis and  
the Executive Committee and the Board 
receive reports every six months.
During 2009 we extended our EHS 
reporting to cover NP Aerospace. The data 
in this Report includes the environmental 
and health and safety impacts of this 
business following the Group’s acquisition 
of a majority stake in January 2009. 
Where necessary, historic data has been 
restated to reflect changes to the business 
with environmental intensity KPIs reported 
at constant currency. The summary charts 
on pages 52 and 53 represent the Group’s 
EHS performance in real terms, covering 
100% of production sites during the year.
The verification of our environmental, social 
and governance disclosures is discussed on 
page 49.

53 The Morgan Crucible Company plc  
 Annual Report 2009
The number of days lost due to accidents was 
down 13% in the year but, as a result of the 
reductions in working time at many facilities 
worldwide, relative lost time performance 
was flat at 0.14% of working time although 
many businesses improved performance in 
this area. However, with the reduced number 
of lost time accidents, the average time lost 
per lost time accident increased to 32 days, 
although this figure includes a small number 
of more long-term cases.
Health and safety performance
Our long-term health and safety objective  
is to have no accidents. In 2010 we will 
continue to extend our accident prevention 
and training programmes throughout the 
Group with the objective of reducing the 
time lost per lost time accident and placing 
particular focus on those sites with below 
average performance. 
Our health and safety KPIs include accident 
frequencies and causes and related lost 
working time. These are used to monitor the 
effectiveness of our health and safety policies 
and related systems on a monthly basis. 
The Group’s accident reporting and analysis 
systems continue to be refined to enable us 
to produce KPIs that more accurately reflect 
the health and safety situation throughout 
the Group.
Our EHS Policy implementation 
programmes, including the training 
programme mentioned on page 51, helped  
to drive down the frequency of lost time 
accidents across the Group to 0.56 per 
100,000 hours worked. The number of  
lost time accidents was down by over 25%. 
Manual handling cuts and abrasions are  
the most common cause of accidents  
and we will be working to address this, 
specifically targeting businesses with 
below-average performance.

Our people
During a period of global economic 
recession, the capabilities, flexibility  
and tenacity of our people have enabled 
Morgan Crucible to achieve a resilient 
performance in 2009. In almost every  
area of the business our people have  
been affected in some way and while the 
business has been constrained to directly 
reward them their commitment and effort 
have not waned. We will continue to leverage 
that commitment and the significant talents 
of our people around the world to create a 
network that reaches our customers and 
supports their individual needs globally. 
People policies
We support the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and our Human Rights Policy 
commits us to protect the rights of everyone 
who works for the Company and all those 
who have dealings with it. The principles of 
the policy cover child labour, forced labour, 
health and safety, freedom of association, 
discrimination, discipline, working hours  
and compensation and the policy is published 
on our website. The Director of Human 
Resources reports to the Chief Executive 
Officer and is responsible for the 
development of human rights policy and 
related matters, with the Chief Executive  
of each Division having responsibility  
for policy implementation within their 
respective Divisions. The Morgan Crucible 
Whistleblowing line enables employees  
who are aware of or suspect issues under 
our Human Rights Policy to report these 
confidentially.
Our global Human Resources Policy provides 
an infrastructure of human resource 
activities that enables the business to 
attract, retain and engage people with the 
skills and capabilities to deliver its business 
plans and outperform the competition. 
Key to building and maintaining the trust 
and respect of our people is open, timely 
and factual communication. Our systems 
provide two-way communication forums 
through online working areas encouraging 
greater collaboration. The Divisions 
We recognise and celebrate the 
accomplishments achieved by our people 
individually or as teams. In acknowledging 
and celebrating achievement, loyalty, 
innovation and creativity, we strive to 
motivate and inspire employees towards the 
pursuit of performance excellence, creating  
a sense of pride in their work and in Morgan 
Crucible. Our compensation systems reward 
people who apply their knowledge, skills  
and talents to support the achievement  
of business goals. We pay for performance  
in all our compensation practices. The total 
reward package includes a mix of base pay, 
variable pay and benefits. We establish 
compensation levels that are both competitive 
and affordable to Morgan Crucible. We have 
the flexibility to respond to changing market 
conditions and competition for high-demand 
skills, while maintaining equity in salary 
ranges and pay levels. 
Implementation of our people-related 
policies
The implementation of our Human Rights 
Policy is supported by an online learning 
programme that is translated into Brazilian 
Portuguese, Latin American Spanish and 
Mandarin Chinese. The assessment of 
compliance with this policy is part of  
our annual certification process.
During the year we launched the Morgan 
Crucible intranet, renamed by our people  
as ‘MorgaNet’. MorgaNet provides fast  
and efficient access to information from 
diverse sources across the globe. We also 
introduced our global ‘360’ e-magazine  
in an online version in addition to having 
hard copies available in 13 languages.  
The Divisions continue to issue regular 
Divisional newsletters in both soft and hard 
formats. In Europe we have an established 
consultative arrangement that provides  
an arena for the exchange of relevant  
and appropriate information across the 
European region. We also held our 13th 
annual European Employee Forum in April 
2009 where site representatives attended 
from France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the 
Netherlands and the UK.
communicate regularly through  
employee forums, team briefs and  
Divisional magazines. We are committed to 
providing our people with the opportunity  
to give feedback through regular global 
employee surveys. Listening to our people 
and harnessing their knowledge and 
experience of Morgan Crucible is essential 
to continuously improve and grow the  
business over the long term.
Demands on the business are constantly 
growing and changing, requiring the 
placement of current and new talent into 
jobs that fit those business requirements,  
at the time they are needed. We review 
short- and long-term business needs on  
a regular basis and carry out succession 
planning and talent reviews to identify  
any skill gaps. When recruiting for a  
vacant position we will draw from internal 
talent and where necessary seek external 
candidates. Selection is based on many 
factors including a candidate’s relevant 
education, work experience, competencies 
and performance record. We provide  
equal opportunities in recruitment  
and employment ensuring we do not 
discriminate against any person based on 
sex, race, caste, origin, religion, disability, 
gender, sexual orientation, age or any  
other status protected by law. Should 
existing employees become disabled, our 
policy is to provide continuing employment 
and training wherever practicable.
For the business to achieve superior 
performance there is an expectation that 
our people need to operate at superior 
levels. We aim to support them through  
a formalised performance management 
system cascaded through the businesses 
that focuses on setting clear results-based 
objectives directly linked to the strategic 
goals and annual objectives of the business. 
Providing people with the skills to perform  
at a superior level is also critical, and we see 
continuous learning and their professional 
development as a major investment in  
our future.  Overview

55 The Morgan Crucible Company plc  
 Annual Report 2009
We have introduced a Learning Management 
System that enables managers and employees 
to track and record their learning and 
development and link specific development  
to the achievement of business goals and 
objectives. In our online Development Centre, 
we added a number of new e-learning 
programmes throughout the year: Microsoft 
IT, e-appraisal and compliance training, while 
continuing with a Business English language 
module. A number of new employee 
development initiatives have been introduced 
in our businesses. Insulating Ceramics  
has developed and introduced e-learning 
programmes to support the implementation 
of its ‘World Class Manufacturing’ 
programme, while Carbon China has set  
up a Virtual Learning Resource Centre with 
Time Guanghua School to support a breadth 
of technical and business management 
training. A new training centre has been 
opened at Morgan Carbon South Africa 
providing greater flexibility to support a  
range of training initiatives from adult basic 
education through to production technology 
qualifications. 
In pursuit of growing capability in the  
labour market, Morgan Crucible continues 
to sponsor annually the Science, Engineering  
& Technology Student of the Year Awards. 
We are proud to sponsor this event as we 
believe it allows high-calibre students to 
showcase their remarkable research work 
and demonstrate the depth of ability of 
graduates in the UK. In 2009 the winner  
of the Best Materials Student award was 
Michael Robinson from Sheffield University. 
People policy effectiveness
At the end of the year, Morgan Crucible 
employed some 9,400 people, a reduction 
of 11.9% on the previous year. Our 
geographic coverage has 35% of employees 
in Europe, Middle East and Africa, 37% in 
the Americas, and 28% in Asia Pacific. Of 
these employees 97% are ‘permanent’ and 
73% are male. Lost time as a proportion of 
total working time was 2.7% with lost time 
due to accidents in the workplace of 0.14%. 
The training hours per employee were 12.4.
This reflects a reduction in expenditure on 
direct training during this period. However, 
we are looking forward to this increasing  
in 2010 with the ability to collate data from  
our new Learning Management System.  
Our employee turnover increased to 16.7%  
in 2009. This regrettably reflects an increase 
in the number of people made redundant 
during the year and the challenges of 
retaining talent in China where the labour 
market is exceptionally fluid. 
During this period 19 employees around the 
world celebrated 40 years of loyal service 
with Morgan Crucible, with 117 employees 
celebrating anniversaries of 20, 25 and 30 
years service. This year we regretfully said 
goodbye to Bill Byrd who retired at the age 
of 83. The transportation specialist based  
in our Insulating Ceramics plant in Augusta, 
GA, USA, decided to retire after 62 years’  
of loyal service with Morgan Crucible. To 
reflect our long-serving employee base we 
have improved our method of calculating 
employee tenure for 2009 and our average 
length of service is 11.3 years.
Morgan Crucible carried out an employee 
survey in October 2008 and an overview of 
the results was reported in the 2008 Annual 
Report. Throughout 2009 we have focused 
on completing actions related to improving 
communications and growing the skills  
of our employees through effective 
performance management and focused 
development programmes.

Introduction
These results are produced under 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU (adopted IFRSs). All 
the figures referred to below are extracted 
from the financial statements on pages 88 
to 148 and comply with adopted IFRSs. 
Reference is made to ’Underlying operating 
profit’* and ’Underlying earnings per share 
(EPS)’. EPS is defined in note 9 on pages 109 
and 110. These measures of earnings are 
shown because the Directors consider that 
they give a better indication of underlying 
performance.
Group revenue and operating profit
Group revenue was £942.6 million (2008: 
£835.0 million), an increase of 12.9% 
compared to 2008. On a proforma constant 
currency basis Group revenue declined by 
8.7% from the previous year. The proforma 
calculation assumes that NP Aerospace had 
been consolidated in 2008 to enable a 
like-for-like comparison.
Group EBITA before restructuring costs  
and one-off items was £89.0 million  
(2008: £108.8 million) representing  
a margin of 9.4% (2008: 13.0%).
Group underlying operating profit  
was £77.0 million (2008: £98.2 million). 
Underlying operating profit margins were 
8.2%, compared to 11.8% for 2008.
Group operating profit was £60.7 million 
(2008: £95.0 million). Operating profit 
margins were 6.4%, compared to 11.4% 
for 2008.
Our strategy of focusing  
on higher growth, higher 
margin, less economically 
cyclical markets has 
generated a good 
performance with greatly 
improved resilience of 
earnings.

57 The Morgan Crucible Company plc  
 Annual Report 2009
The Group has undertaken extensive cost 
reduction programmes across its business  
in 2009, the majority of which were 
completed in the first half of the year.  
Our focus, particularly in the first half of  
the year, was to rapidly resize and adjust  
our cost base to reflect weakening market 
demand. Net restructuring costs and gain 
on disposal of property were £12.9 million 
in 2009 (2008: £9.7 million) and costs 
recovered associated with the settlement  
of prior period anti-trust litigation were  
£0.9 million (2008: cost incurred  
£0.9 million).
Foreign currency impact
The principal exchange rates used in the 
translation of the results of overseas 
subsidiaries were as follows:
  Average rate Year-end rate

The potential impact of changes in foreign 
exchange rates is given in note 19 on  
pages 125 and 126. 
Amortisation of intangible assets
The Group amortisation charge was  
£16.3 million (2008: £3.2 million).  
The increase in amortisation is mainly 
attributable to a fair value assessment  
of the assets of NP Aerospace at the date  
of the 11% acquisition. The amortisation

calculation is driven by the NP Aerospace 
order book which has been ‘fair valued’ as 
part of the intangible assets and amortised 
over the 12-month period over which the 
orders were delivered. Hence in 2009 the 
Group had a one-off increase in its 
amortisation charge for the year. In 2010 
the Group amortisation charge will be 
reduced to circa £7.5 million per annum, 
which includes the amortisation on the 
other ongoing intangible assets the Group 
has booked on the acquisition of NP 
Aerospace, the Carpenter businesses and 
other historical acquisitions.
Finance costs
The net finance charge was £29.3 million 
(2008: £12.7 million). Net bank interest  
and similar charges were £22.8 million 
(2008: £14.3 million), an increase of  
£8.5 million, due mainly to the increase 
in average net debt in 2009 following  
the NP Aerospace and Carpenter business 
acquisitions. A significant part of the  
finance charge under IFRSs is the net  
interest charge on pension scheme liabilities 
which was £4.3 million (2008: £0.1 million 
gain). Also included in the finance charge 
is an interest expense on unwinding of 
discount on deferred consideration of  
£2.2 million (2008: £nil) which relates  
to the NP Aerospace acquisition.
The impact of potential changes in interest 
rates on profit or loss is stated in note 19  
on pages 124 and 125.
Taxation
Group taxation for the year was £8.7 million 
(2008: £20.1 million). The effective tax rate 
was 27.7% (2008: 24%).
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share was 13.2 
pence (2008: 23.4 pence), Basic earnings 
per share, was 7.1 pence (2008: 22.2 
pence). Details of these calculations can  
be found in note 9 on pages 109 and 110.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final  
dividend of 4.5 pence per share, bringing  
the total dividend for the year to 7.0 pence 
per share, in line with the previous year’s 
dividend. The dividend will be paid on  
9 July 2010 to Ordinary shareholders on the 
register of members at the close of business 
on 21 May 2010. Subject to shareholder 
approval at this year’s Annual General 
Meeting a scrip alternative to the cash 
dividend will be offered and will replace  
the existing DRIP scheme.

Free cash flow before one-off costs and 
dividends was £85.9 million, a substantial 
increase in cash generation on the previous

Non-current assets were £619.6 million 
(2008: £583.8 million) and total assets were 
£1,041.2 million (2008: £1,078.7 million). 
The most significant elements of these 
movements were the translation effect  
of the US dollar and the purchase of a 
further 11% stake in NP Aerospace in 
January 2009, taking Morgan Crucible’s 
stake to a controlling 60% holding. As a 
result this business has been consolidated 
into the Group results for the first time in 
2009. Please refer to note 3 on pages 104

Capital structure is further discussed in note 
19 on page 126 under the heading Capital 
management. 
Pensions
The Group operates a number of pension 
schemes throughout the world, the majority 
of which are of a funded defined benefit 
type. The largest of these are located in the 
UK and the US with others in Continental 
Europe. Net employee benefit liabilities 
totalling £105.9 million are included in the 
financial statements at the end of the year, 
an increase of £4.1 million compared with 
the previous year. The main movements have 
been in the US and UK pension schemes. The 
US scheme deficit improved by £15.2 million 
to £46.2 million (2008: £61.4 million) while 
the UK scheme deficit deteriorated to  
£34.5 million (2008: £13.1 million), mainly 
due to an increase in the inflation rate and  
a lower discount rate. Refer to note 20 on 
pages 129 to 132 for further details.
Treasury policies
The following policies were implemented 
and in place across the Group throughout 
the year. The manager of each business  
unit is required to confirm this as part of  
the year-end process.
Financial risk management  
and treasury policy
Group Treasury works within a framework 
of policies and procedures approved by  
the Audit Committee. It acts as a service  
to Morgan Crucible’s business, not as a 
profit centre, and manages and controls  
risk in the treasury environment through  
the establishment of such procedures. 
Group treasury seeks to align treasury  
goals, objective and philosophy to those  
of the Group. It is responsible for all of  
the Group’s funding, liquidity, cash 
management, interest rate risk, foreign 
exchange risk and other treasury business. 
As part of the policies and procedures,  
there is strict control over the use of 
financial instruments to hedge foreign 
currencies and interest rates. Speculative 
trading in derivatives and other financial 
instruments is not permitted.
Foreign exchange risks
Due to the international reach of the  
Group, currency transaction exposures  
exist. The Group has a policy in place to 
hedge all material firm commitments and 
highly probable forecast foreign currency 
exposures, and achieves this through  
the use of the forward foreign exchange 
markets. The Group continues its practice  
of not hedging income statement 
translation exposure.
There are exchange control restrictions 
which affect the ability of a small number  
of the Group’s subsidiaries to transfer funds 
to the Group. The Group does not believe 
such restrictions have had or will have any 
material adverse impact on the Group as  
a whole or the ability of the Group to meet  
its cash flow requirements. Overview

 Annual Report 2009
Credit risk
Credit risk arises when a counterparty  
fails to perform its obligations. The Group  
is exposed to credit risk on financial 
instruments such as liquid assets, derivative 
assets and trade receivables. Credit risk  
is managed by investing liquid assets  
and acquiring derivatives in a diversified  
way from high-credit-quality financial 
institutions. Counterparties are reviewed 
through the use of rating agencies, systemic 
risk considerations, and through regular 
review of the financial press. The Group has 
a credit policy in place in relation to trade 
receivables and exposure to credit risk is 
monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit 
evaluations are performed on all customers 
requiring credit over a certain amount.  
The nature of the Group’s operations  
are such that the Group has a significant 
number of low-value trade receivables.  
The risk is therefore considered minimal. 
Credit risk is further discussed in note 19  
on pages 121 and 122.
Capital investment
The Group has well-established formal 
procedures for the approval of investment in 
new businesses and of capital expenditure 
to ensure appropriate senior management 
review and sign-off.
Tax planning risk
The Group’s reported after-tax income  
is calculated based on the relevant tax 
legislation in each of the jurisdictions that  
it operates in. Changes in tax legislation 
(including tax rates) could materially affect 
the Group’s after-tax income. The Group 
undertakes tax planning initiatives where 
appropriate. The outcome of such planning 
cannot be assured and could materially 
influence the effective tax rate.
Accounting policies
We adopted International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU 
(‘adopted IFRSs’) in 2005. All accounting 
policies shown on pages 93 to 101 are 
compliant with adopted IFRSs.
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out in the Business review on pages 
32 to 63. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described earlier in 
this Financial review. In addition, note 19 
includes the Group’s policies and processes 
for managing financial risk; details of 
its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk  
and liquidity risk.
The Group announced in May 2009 the 
signing of a new £280 million three-year 
multi-currency revolving facility agreement 
with a syndicate of eight banks. This 
replaced a US$420 million facility with the 
same financial covenants which was due  
to mature in March 2010. The Group meets 
its day-to-day working capital requirements 
through local banking arrangements that 
are supported through the flexibility 
provided by the new facility. The Group’s 
forecasts and projections, taking account  
of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance and exchange rates, show the 
Group operating comfortably within the 
Group’s debt financial covenants for the 
next 12 months.
The current economic climate continues to 
have an impact on the Group, its customers 
and suppliers. The Board fully recognises the 
challenges that lie ahead but, after making 
enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual Report and Accounts.
Currency translation risks are controlled 
centrally. To defend against the impact  
of a permanent reduction in the value  
of its overseas net assets through currency 
depreciation, the Group seeks to match  
the currency of financial liabilities with  
the currency in which the net assets are 
denominated. This is achieved by raising 
funds in different currencies and through 
the use of hedging instruments such as 
swaps, and is implemented only to the 
extent that the Group’s gearing covenant 
under the terms of its loan documents,  
as well as its facility headroom, are likely  
to remain comfortably within limits. In  
this way, the structure of the Group’s 
borrowings becomes more aligned to  
the trading cash flows that service them.
Interest rate risk
The Group seeks to reduce the volatility  
in its interest charge caused by rate 
fluctuations. The Group adopts a policy of 
ensuring that between 30% and 80% of  
its exposure to changes in interest rates on 
borrowings is on a fixed rate basis. This is 
achieved through a combination of fixed 
rate debt and interest rate swaps.
Borrowing facilities and liquidity
All of the Group’s borrowing facilities are 
arranged by Group Treasury and the funds 
raised are then lent to operating subsidiaries 
on an arm’s-length basis. In a few cases 
operating subsidiaries have external 
borrowings but these are supervised and 
controlled centrally. Group Treasury seeks  
to obtain certainty of access to funding in 
the amounts, diversity of maturities and 
diversity of counterparty as required to 
support the Group’s medium-term financing 
requirements and to minimise the impact of 
poor credit market conditions.
In May 2009 the Group announced the 
signing of a new three-year multi-currency 
facility for £280 million from a syndicate of 
eight banks. This has replaced the US$420 
million facility which was due to mature  
in March 2010. Further information on the 
Group’s debt and maturity profile is provided 
in note 18 on page 119. Overview

 Annual Report 2009
Risk management
Introduction
Our risk management processes are 
designed to be forward-looking in the 
identification, management and mitigation 
of business risks that could impact the 
Group’s short- and long-term performance 
and value. The processes will not eliminate 
risks but rather mitigate them to an 
acceptable level within the context of  
the business environment in which we 
operate. The process covers both risks  
and opportunities.
Management of business risk is an integral 
part of delivering performance and is  
the responsibility of all managers. Our  
risk management decision-making and 
reporting procedures are integrated in our 
formal business reporting up to the Board. 
The Group appointed a new Director of Risk 
Assurance at the end of 2008. During the 
year the Group reviewed and benchmarked 
its risk management methodologies and 
processes against external good practice. 
Following this review, the Board approved  
a plan to evolve the existing processes to  
a more coherent approach by using a 
formalised and standardised risk management 
methodology throughout the Group. 
Implementation commenced in 2009 and  
will continue through 2010 with regular 
reports covering risk management processes 
and key risks to the Audit Committee  
and the Executive Committee through the 
Risk Management Committee. The Risk 
Management Committee is chaired by  
the Chief Financial Officer and includes 
representation from each Division. The 
effectiveness of risk management and 
internal control processes is monitored by  
the Audit Committee, which also ensures 
that the Board has sufficient information  
in this regard.
During the year the Group and its 
subsidiaries complied with its policies and 
procedures for managing material risks.
The risks described below include the main 
areas of risk that could impact Morgan 
Crucible. These cover most areas of known 
and emerging business risk. They include 
internal risks where we have a greater 
degree of control and influence as well  
as external risks where our ability to 
completely control them may be more 
limited. They are nevertheless assessed and 
managed down to an acceptable level. The 
relative importance of some of these risks 
has changed during 2008-09 as a result  
of the world recession. As a consequence 
the controls to manage risk have been 
adjusted to ensure that the risks continue  
to be managed within acceptable limits.
Strategic planning risks
These risks relate to the appropriateness  
of strategy, business model or product 
portfolio, acquisitions and disposals.  
The risks to planning and delivery of  
the strategy are also included.
External risks
Political, economical and social
We are exposed to these risks in a number 
of countries in which we operate as part of 
realising business opportunities. We operate 
within the local conditions while monitoring 
the political, economic and social changes in 
these countries and adjusting our business 
plan, operations and controls accordingly.
Financial
Operating in a number of countries, we  
are exposed to events in the financial 
environment including commodity and 
energy prices, currency exchange, the  
current credit crisis and other financial market 
incidents, market volatility, interest rates, 
liquidity, pension funding, tax planning etc. 
These risks are managed through proactive 
assessment, contingency planning and the 
use of appropriate mitigation.
Examples of mitigation include:
Optimising exchange rate exposure > >
through the supply chain by raw 
material sourcing, manufacturing  
and selling locally to minimise exchange  
rate impact. 
Minimising the impact on the Group  > >
of a major currency devaluation.
Fixing long-term pricing for the  > >
purchase of energy and other materials.
Entering into certain hedging > >
arrangements to help manage the 
impact of currency fluctuations (the 
Group’s relevant treasury policies are 
summarised in the Financial review on 
pages 58 and 59).
Managing pension funds using > >
independent, competent Trustee Boards 
and external advisers.
Further details of the Group’s pension plans 
and employee benefits are included in note 
20 on pages 129 to 136.
Market dynamics and competition
Our products tend to be technologically 
advanced and use complex and 
high-added-value manufacturing 
techniques. We operate in a business 
environment where we need to be proactive 
with respect to market dynamics including 
customer preference, new technology and 
new competition.
We monitor our current areas of business, 
working with our customers to ensure that 
we continue to satisfy their evolving needs. 
We adjust our strategies and business plans 
to reflect changing conditions, thereby 
helping to ensure that risks are managed 
within acceptable limits. Overview

 Annual Report 2009
Business conduct risks
Risks such as a potential breach in the area 
of ethical behaviour could impact the 
Group’s reputation or image.
Our reputation with our stakeholders is 
fundamental to the continued success of  
the Group and we mitigate reputational 
risks through various means, including:
Our corporate responsibility programme, > >
and our Core Values Statement. 
Our Ethics Policy, Whistleblowing line > >
and related procedures. 
Our systems of internal control and  > >
risk management.
The Group’s Ethics Policy and Anti-Trust 
Compliance Programme are further 
described in the Corporate responsibility 
section. These programmes address the risk  
of unethical business behaviour and are 
supported by mandatory training and the 
Group’s Whistleblowing line and related 
procedures.
Operational risks
Financial, physical property, intellectual 
property and information
The Group’s financial, physical and 
intellectual property assets are exposed to 
risks such as theft, loss, natural catastrophe, 
accidental disclosure etc. Such incidents can 
also impact the continuity of the business.
These risks are managed through internal 
controls, proactive design and protection of 
facilities and business continuity measures  
to minimise the impact of an incident. 
Audits by experts in their fields (including 
financial auditors) review and assess the 
effectiveness of such measures.
In some cases, risks are partially transferred 
through insurance programmes.
Human resources risks
The Group maintains human resource 
policies and processes to manage the  
risks relating to our people, eg reward  
and recognition, health and safety, talent 
management including succession planning, 
skills assessment and development, 
performance management and employee 
consultation.
Product development, performance  
and safety risks
Our products are used in many industrial 
sectors including medical, aerospace and 
defence. These sectors require high quality 
and conformance to specification as well  
as consideration of the health and safety  
of the end users.
Robust research and development 
processes, both in-house and where 
undertaken in co-operation with our 
customers, minimise product development 
risks. Our design, testing and quality 
assurance processes, including ISO 9001 
accreditations, help to control 
manufacturing risks.
Compliance and ethics risks
Legal, regulatory and litigation
We are subject to varying laws and 
regulations around the world. Changes  
in these could affect the long- and 
short-term value of the Group. As a listed 
company we are also exposed to the  
risks of ensuring compliance with listing 
requirements. We cannot always predict 
whether future developments in laws and 
regulations concerning our businesses will 
have an adverse or a positive effect.
For example, a failure to comply with  
export control regulations could have a 
negative impact, whilst new environmental 
performance legislation which affects  
our customers could increase the demand 
for our energy-conserving products and 
services which can help our customers to 
address the requirements of such legislation.
To manage these risks, we monitor potential 
changes in regulation as well as having 
appropriate training and compliance 
processes in place.
From time to time, and in the normal  
course of business, we are subject to certain 
litigation, in particular in the USA. Provisions 
for the expected costs and liabilities are  
set out in note 21 to the accounts. If the 
liabilities arising were significantly to exceed 
the amounts provided for, there could be 
a material financial effect on the value of 
the Group.
Health, safety and environmental
Our operations involve the normal 
environmental, health and safety risks 
associated with manufacturing operations  
in the countries in which we operate. 
Although we believe that our operations  
are in compliance with current regulations, 
we cannot eliminate the risk of all accidents 
or non-compliance. 
Further detail of the programmes in place  
to manage these risks are included on  
pages 51 to 53. Overview

 Annual Report 2009
Key resources and  
contractual relationships
Morgan Crucible has built up significant 
resources and benefits from contractual  
and other relationships with multiple 
stakeholders, including customers and 
suppliers, employees and joint venture 
partners. These have been built up  
over many years to support the Group’s 
competitive positioning in the key markets 
which the Group serves. 
As is described below, no one contractual  
or other relationship is considered essential 
to the business of the Group as a whole.
Further information on the Group’s 
stakeholder relationships is included 
elsewhere in this Business review, including 
in the Corporate responsibility section on 
pages 48 to 55. As referred to in the 
Directors’ report on page 68, a number  
of commercial and contractual agreements 
include change of control provisions which 
come into effect in the event of a change  
in ownership of the Company following a 
takeover.
In accordance with its vision, aim and 
strategic priorities, the Group continues  
to invest in the areas discussed below to 
maintain its leading market positions.
Commercial relationships, market 
position and reputation
Morgan Crucible is generally ranked number 
one or two in its chosen market segments. 
The Group is a world leader in advanced 
ceramic and composite materials. The 
Company was founded in 1856 and has  
a worldwide reputation.
The Group’s businesses provide products 
and services to other companies and we 
have developed close working relationships 
with many of our customers and suppliers 
and work in collaboration with them to 
develop new products. 
None of the Group’s customers or suppliers 
are individually essential to the business of 
the Group as a whole. Notwithstanding  
this, the Group devotes significant resources 
to ensure these relationships continue to 
operate satisfactorily.
Employees
Morgan Crucible’s most important  
resource is its people and we employ a 
highly skilled and qualified workforce. One 
of our strategic priorities is ‘finding, keeping 
and developing the right people’. Many 
employees stay with the Company for their 
whole careers as is highlighted on page 55. 
We place great emphasis on recruitment 
and training and our policies and 
performance in these areas are set out  
on pages 54 and 55.
Succession plans are in place covering key 
management and technical roles and as 
such no individual employee is considered 
essential to the business of the Group as  
a whole.
The Directors’ contracts are referred to on 
page 82 and are available for inspection 
prior to the Annual General Meeting and  
at the Company’s registered office.
Research and development, patents 
and intellectual property
The Group’s vision is to be one of the 
world’s very best advanced materials 
companies, supported by the strategic 
priority of ‘offering high added value to 
our customers’. The Group’s Divisions use 
their extensive knowledge base, particularly 
in the areas of advanced ceramic and 
composite materials, to develop new 
products and services to meet customer 
needs and to differentiate themselves in  
the markets they serve.
The Group benefits from technological 
know-how and other forms of intellectual 
property, some of which is covered by 
patents. Collectively this intellectual 
property supports the development and 
manufacture of new products and services 
to meet customer needs, but no one single 
patent is considered essential to the  
business of the Group as a whole.
Each of the Group’s Divisions has a 
Technical Director, with research and 
development capabilities variously located  
at Divisional centres of excellence and 
diffused through the business in the form  
of applications engineering. Further details 
are included in the review of operations for 
each Division on pages 36 to 47.
Manufacturing capabilities
Over many years Morgan Crucible has 
invested heavily in manufacturing capacity 
and technology to develop its capability  
to serve its chosen markets worldwide. In 
recent years the Group has developed and 
extended its manufacturing presence and 
capabilities in China, India and Latin America 
to meet customer needs in both local and 
global markets. This investment supports  
our strategic priority of ‘having a culture of 
operational excellence and cost efficiency’. 
Joint venture partners
In a number of territories around the world, 
the Group has established joint ventures with 
local partners. Many of these joint ventures 
have been in operation for many years; 
however, no individual joint venture 
agreement is considered to be essential  
to the business of the Group as a whole.
Banking and other financial 
relationships
Details of significant banking and other 
relationships are referred to on page 68  
in the Directors’ report. However, no one 
banking relationship is considered to be 
essential to the performance and value  
of the Company. Overview

The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend at the rate of 4.5 pence per share on the Ordinary share capital of the Company, 
payable on 9 July 2010 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 21 May 2010. Together with the interim dividend of  
2.5 pence per share paid on 12 January 2010, this final dividend, if approved by shareholders, brings the total distribution for the year to 
7.0 pence per share (2008: 7.0 pence).
Acquisitions and disposals
On 5 January 2009 the Company increased its equity stake in NP Aerospace from 49% to 60% by acquiring an additional 11% of the 
equity for £12.2 million, with a deferred consideration based on 2009 performance payable in 2010.
On 6 April 2009 the Company acquired, via its subsidiary NP Aerospace Limited, a 50% stake in Integrated Survivability Technologies 
Limited for £1.5 million.
On 25 September 2010 Morgan Advanced Ceramics Inc disposed of its Metal Injection Moulding business for £1.1 million cash.
On 9 October 2009 the Company acquired a further 9.0% of the issued share capital of Carbo San Luis SA for £1.1 million, bringing  
its interest in Carbo San Luis to 84.6%.
Post-balance sheet events
There have been no material events since the year end. The Company proposes to pay a final ordinary dividend of 4.5 pence per share  
in respect of the 2009 financial year.
Share capital
As at 3 January 2010, pursuant to an authority granted at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 17 April 2009, the Company was 
authorised pursuant to the Companies Act 1985 to purchase up to 9.99% of its issued share capital. This authority expires on the date  
of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 23 April 2010.
This authority was not used by the Company during the year under review.
The Company’s share capital is set out in note 17 on pages 117 to 119. The Company’s Ordinary shares represent 99.36% of the total 
issued share capital, with the 5.5% Cumulative First Preference shares representing 0.18% and the 5.0% Cumulative Second Preference 
shares representing 0.46%. The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s Ordinary shares, and restrictions on the transfer of 
shares in the Company, are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, copies of which can be obtained from Companies House  
in the UK or the Company Secretary. The holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends, when declared; to receive the 
Company’s reports and accounts; to attend and speak at general meetings of the Company; to appoint proxies; and to exercise voting 
rights. Details of the structure of the Company’s Preference share capital and the rights attached to the Company’s Preference shares  
are set out on page 119. No person holds securities in the Company carrying special rights with regard to control of the Company. The 
Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or  
on voting rights. Unless expressly specified to the contrary in the Articles of Association of the Company, the Company’s Articles of 
Association may be amended by a special resolution of the Company’s shareholders.

 Annual Report 2009
Policy on the payment of creditors
The Company’s policy in relation to its suppliers is, where possible, to settle terms of payment when agreeing the terms of the transaction 
and to abide by those terms, provided that it is satisfied that the supplier provided the goods and services in accordance with the agreed 
terms and conditions. The Company and its subsidiaries do not follow any one code or standard on payment practice due to the diverse 
nature of the global markets in which the Group operates.
The number of days’ purchases outstanding for payment by the Company at the end of the year was 18 days (2008: 33 days) and for  
the Group was 54 days (2008: 68 days).
Research and development
Innovative use of existing and emerging technologies will continue to be crucial to the successful development of new products and 
solutions to customer demands. The Company has research and development facilities at its key manufacturing sites. The spend on 
research and development, which excludes the amounts spent working with customers and others by way of product enhancement and 
application engineering, was £14.6 million during the year (2008: £11.4 million), including £0.7 million of capitalised development costs 
(2008: £1.6 million).

awards under the NP Aerospace share option scheme. The NP Aerospace employee benefit trust holds 33,335 shares in Clearpower Limited 
in respect of the scheme.
All of the Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding options and awards would normally 
vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time.
The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust (‘the Trust’) held 1,984,022 shares on 3 January 2010 in connection with awards granted 
under the Company’s employee share schemes. In the period 3 January 2010 to 18 February 2010 no shares were transferred out of the 
Trust. The trustees of the Trust (‘Trustees’) have agreed to waive their entitlement to the payment of dividends on the shares held by the 
Trust. The Directors are not aware that any other shareholders waived or agreed to waive any dividends or future dividends during the 
period under review.
The Trustees have absolute and unfettered discretion in relation to voting any shares held in the Trust at any general meeting. Their policy 
is not to vote the shares. If any offer is made to shareholders to acquire their shares, the Trustees will have absolute and unfettered 
discretion on whether to accept or reject the offer in respect of any shares held by them.

Directors’ report
continued
Details of the background and experience of all the Directors can be found on page 64 and details of the Board Committees on which  
they serve can be found on pages 74 and 75.
The Company’s Articles of Association (‘the Articles’) give the Directors power to appoint and replace Directors. Under the terms of 
reference of the Nomination Committee, any appointment must be recommended by the Nomination Committee for approval by the 
Board of Directors. The Articles also require Directors to retire and submit themselves for election at the first Annual General Meeting 
following appointment and all Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at the third Annual General Meeting following 
their appointment or re-election.
Subject to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association, UK legislation and any directions given by special resolution,  
the business of the Company is managed by the Board, which may exercise all the powers of the Company.
The Directors may also seek authority from shareholders at each Annual General Meeting to allot shares, to disapply pre-emption rights 
and to make market purchases of the Company’s Ordinary shares. These powers may be exercised under authority of resolutions of the 
Company passed at its Annual General Meeting.
As at the date of this Report, indemnities are in force under which the Company has agreed to indemnify all of the Directors, to the extent 
permitted by law and the Company’s Articles of Association, in respect of all losses arising out of, or in connection with, the execution of 
their powers, duties and responsibilities, as Directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Donations
During the year, Morgan Crucible companies made charitable donations of £302,232 (2008: £114,736).
Further details of charitable donations and activities of the Group are given on page 50. No political donations have been made.
Significant agreements
As referred to in the Key resources and contractual relationships section on page 62, the Group has a number of borrowing facilities 
provided by various financial institutions. These facility agreements generally include change of control provisions which, in the event  
of a change in ownership of the Company, could result in renegotiation or withdrawal of these facilities.
The most significant such agreements are the UK £280 million Multicurrency Revolving Facility Agreement which was signed on  
1 May 2009 and the privately placed Note Purchase and Guarantee Agreements signed on 6 March 2003 and 15 December 2007,  
for which the outstanding loan amounts are US$45 million and US$350 million respectively.
There are a number of other agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a 
takeover bid, such as commercial contracts and joint-venture agreements. No such individual contract is considered to be significant  
in terms of its potential impact on the business of the Group as a whole.

 Annual Report 2009
Statement of compliance with the Combined Code
Throughout the year ended 3 January 2010 the Company has been in compliance with Section 1 of the June 2008 edition of the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (‘the Code’).
This statement describes how the Company has applied the main and supporting principles of the Code. It should be read in conjunction 
with the Business review and Remuneration report on pages 32 to 63 and pages 77 to 85 respectively.
Directors
The Board
The Board is collectively responsible to the Company’s shareholders for the success of the Company. The Board is satisfied it has met the 
Code’s requirements for its effective operation. It has set the Company’s strategic aims, which were reviewed by the Board at its strategy 
meeting during the year, and has ensured that there is a framework of prudent and effective controls which enable risk to be assessed and 
managed. The Board sets the Company’s values and standards, which are contained in the Core Values Statement and Ethics Policy, both 
of which are referred to on pages 48 and 49 in the Business review.
The Board met formally 11 times during the year to review current performance against agreed objectives and to make and review  
major business decisions. There is a schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board including significant contractual commitments 
(including the acquisition or disposal of companies/businesses, treasury and intellectual property transactions), the review of the 
effectiveness of risk management processes, major capital expenditure and corporate responsibility. One meeting each year is specifically 
focused on strategy and the longer term development of the Company. Various matters are delegated to duly authorised sub-committees 
of the Board, as is further described below.
There were no changes to the membership of the Board during the year and there were no changes of role.
As at 3 January 2010 the Board comprises Tim Stevenson, Chairman; Mark Robertshaw, Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Dangerfield,  
Chief Financial Officer, and three independent non-executive Directors. Martin Flower is the Senior Independent Director. Biographies  
of the Directors, including details of their other main commitments, are set out on page 64.
All Directors submit themselves for election by the shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment and for 
re-election at least once every three years. Should a non-executive Director serve for more than six years, his re-election would be subject 
to particularly rigorous review. Should any Director serve for longer than nine years he would then be subject to annual re-election.
The attendance of each Director at Board and Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committee meetings is set out in the table below.

The Chairman and the non-executive Directors met without the executive Directors present on multiple occasions during the year.  
In addition, the Senior Independent Director and the other non-executive Directors met without the Chairman present.
Should a Director have concerns about the running of the Company or a proposed action which are not resolved, their concerns  
would be recorded in the Board minutes. 
An appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance policy is in place.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate, clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by the Board.  
The Chairman is responsible for running the Board and the Chief Executive Officer is responsible for running the Company’s business.  
The management of the Group’s operating Divisions report to the Chief Executive Officer.

 Annual Report 2009
Board balance and independence
Throughout the year the Company complied with the requirement of the Code that at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, 
should comprise non-executive Directors determined by the Board to be independent. At the year end, in addition to the Chairman,  
whom the Company deemed to be independent on appointment, the Board comprised two executive Directors and three further 
non-executive Directors deemed by the Board to be independent. In addition to the factors set out in the Code, the Board’s assessment  
of a non-executive Director’s independence and effectiveness covers their total number of commitments and any relationships with major 
suppliers or with charities receiving material support from the Company.
The structure and shape of the Board were reviewed during the year. The Board has frequent interaction with senior management and  
the Divisional Chief Executives normally attend Board meetings. Thus, it was considered that the current level of executive representation 
on the Board remains appropriate.
Appointments to the Board
As is further detailed in the report of the Nomination Committee, set out on page 75, there is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for appointments to the Board.
The Board is satisfied that there are succession plans in place for appointments to the Board and for senior management.
There were no new appointments to the Board during the year and none of the Directors changed role.
Information and professional development
The Board receives, in a timely manner, information in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties, with  
Board papers generally sent out five working days before each meeting.
All Directors received a full, formal and tailored induction on joining the Board. Each Director’s experience and background is taken into 
account in developing a tailored programme.
Non-executive Directors are encouraged to visit operating sites and to meet with management. In addition to visits by individual Directors 
and the Chairman, each year at least one Board meeting is held at an operating facility. During 2009 formal Board meetings took place at 
the Technical Ceramics site in Rugby, UK and at the Carbon Division’s site at Swansea, UK. In addition, the Board visited the NP Aerospace 
site in Coventry, UK.
Training and development needs are assessed as part of the Board performance review process and the Directors regularly update and 
refresh their skills and knowledge, taking into account environmental, social and governance matters. The Company Secretary keeps the 
suitability of external courses under review.
The Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary who, with the Chairman, is responsible for ensuring that 
Board procedures are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are observed. A procedure is in place to enable the Directors to 
seek independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in connection with their duties as Directors.
Performance evaluation
The Board undertook a formal evaluation of its performance, its committees and of the individual Directors during the year. The review 
consisted of a structured interview between the Chairman and each Director, the Divisional Chief Executives and the Company Secretary. 
These one-to-one discussions were complemented by a questionnaire and each Director had the opportunity to raise broader issues 
relating to the Company’s strategy and governance. The results of the review were communicated to the Board with one-to-one feedback 
where appropriate.
The evaluation concluded that the Board performs effectively, that the Board calendar and agendas are appropriate with open discussions 
and effective follow-through by the executive team. The Chairman and the non-executive Directors also confirmed that they have 
sufficient time to fulfil their commitments to the Company. As noted above, training needs are assessed.
The recommendations to be implemented following the 2009 Board performance evaluation include: increasing the amount of  
interaction outside the formal Board environment, reviews of the Board procedures in relation to capital expenditure proposals and the 
Board evaluation process for 2010, increasing the focus on succession planning throughout the business and further presentations of  
the Group’s technology to the Board.
The non-executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, met without the Chairman present to evaluate the Chairman’s 
performance during the year, taking into account the views of the executive Directors.
The recommendations made following the 2008 Board performance review were implemented during the year, including with regard to 
increased reporting between meetings, enhancing the exposure of the Board to senior management, with the Divisional Chief Executives 
normally attending Board meetings and with Board meetings held at two manufacturing locations and a Board visit to a third 
manufacturing site during 2009. Overview

Remuneration policy and practice is discussed in the Remuneration report on pages 77 to 85.
Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
In its reporting to shareholders, the Board aims to present the balanced and understandable assessment of the Company’s position  
and prospects required by the Code and in accordance with the Accounting Standards Board’s Reporting Standard 1, The Operating  
and Financial Review. This is included in the Business review on pages 32 to 63. The Board also presents updated information in its  
Interim and other public reports.
A summary of the statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and the financial statements is set out on  
page 76 and the ‘going concern’ statement is set out in the Business review on page 59.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ 
investment and the Company’s assets. Through the Audit Committee, the Board reviews the effectiveness of the internal control system 
annually and did so during the year. This review covered all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls,  
and risk management systems. The Audit Committee receives regular risk management reports covering the full range of risks faced by 
Morgan Crucible as a Group and ensures there are adequate systems in place and evaluates their effectiveness. 
The Directors believe that the Group’s system of internal financial controls provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that: the  
assets of the Group are safeguarded; transactions are authorised and recorded in a correct and timely manner; and that such controls 
would prevent and detect, within a timely period, material errors or irregularities. The system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate,  
risk and to address key business and financial risks, including social, environmental and ethical risks. The internal control framework 
complements the Group’s management structure. The main features of the Group’s systems for internal control and for assessing the 
potential risks to which the Group is exposed are summarised as follows:
Control environment > > The Group’s management processes include delegated authorities and the segregation of duties with 
documented policies and manuals. These cover financial procedures, environmental, health and safety practice and other areas. In 
addition, there is a schedule of matters reserved for the Board. The Group’s Core Values Statement, Ethics Policy and other supporting 
policies and procedures set out the Group’s commitment to the highest standards of corporate and individual behaviour and provide 
guidance for employees. The Group’s Whistleblowing line is available to employees and others in this regard. The Chief Executive of 
each Division makes an annual statement of compliance to the Board confirming that for each of the businesses for which he is 
responsible, the financial statements are fairly presented in all material respects, appropriate systems of internal controls have been 
developed and maintained and the businesses comply with Group policies and procedures.
Financial reporting > > A detailed budgeting system for each Division exists with an annual consolidated budget reviewed and approved 
by the Board. Businesses present their revenue and capital expenditure budgets for approval. Monthly results for the Group are 
presented to the Executive Committee and the Board, including comparisons against budget and the prior year. The Group’s annual 
and half-yearly results are reported externally, in addition to interim management statements. The annual results are audited.
Performance monitoring > > There are regular meetings of the Board and of the Executive Committee. A comparison of forecast  
and actual results is considered, including cash flows and comparisons against budget and the prior year. Divisional management 
teams also meet regularly to review performance. Presentations of actual and forecast performance are made to the Executive 
Committee and the Board by the Group’s Divisional Chief Executives. In addition, regular site visits are made by members of the 
Executive Committee.
Risk management > > The identification of major business risks is an ongoing process carried out in conjunction with operating 
management. Steps are taken to mitigate or manage any material risks identified. The Board, either directly or through the  
Audit Committee, receives reports on financial, taxation, insurance, pension, legal and social, environmental and ethical risks from 
management. The Divisional Chief Executives cover risk issues at their management meetings and the Director of Risk Assurance  
helps to ensure that internal control and risk management is embedded into the Group’s operations through the Risk Management 
Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and is attended by the Chief Financial Officer of each Division.
Risk factors > > Morgan Crucible’s businesses are affected by a number of factors, many of which are influenced by macroeconomic 
trends and are therefore outside the Company’s immediate control, although, as described above and in the Business review, the 
identification and management of such risks is carried out systematically. These are further discussed in the Risk management section 
on page 60.
Internal audit > > The Group’s internal audit function reviews internal control and risk management processes. The Audit Committee 
approves the plans for internal audit reviews and receives reports accordingly. Actions resulting from internal audit reviews are  
agreed with management. A new internal auditor was appointed during the year and has direct access to the Chairman of the  
Audit Committee. Overview

 Annual Report 2009
Audit Committee and auditors
The Board has formal and transparent arrangements for considering how the Directors apply the Company’s financial reporting and 
internal control principles, and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with the Company’s auditors. This requirement is met by the 
work of the Audit Committee, as described below, and by the audit work carried out by the Company’s external auditors, KPMG Audit plc. 
The Audit Committee has received confirmation from KPMG Audit plc that its general procedures support the auditors’ independence and 
objectivity in relation to non-audit services. After considering such procedures the opinion of the Audit Committee was that the auditors’ 
objectivity and independence was safeguarded despite the provision of non-audit services by KPMG Audit plc.
Conflicts of interest
The Board has procedures in place to address the requirements of Section 175 of the Companies Act 2006 concerning the duty of the 
Directors to avoid conflicts of interest. These procedures are in accordance with the GC100 guidance. 
Accordingly the Directors are required to continue to (1) disclose proposed outside interests before they are taken in order to enable a  
prior assessment of any actual or potential conflict; and (2) disclose without delay any situation which arises which gives rise to an actual  
or potential conflict. 
During the year the Board undertook a review of Directors’ outside interests to identify actual or potential conflicts of interest, including 
the interests of connected persons where such interests could give rise to an indirect conflict. This confirmed that there were no actual 
conflicts of interest and the only potential conflicts of interest identified were outside directorships. The Board considered each Director’s 
situation and authorised any potential conflicts for a period of 15 months from December 2009. Such authorisation is revocable at any 
time at the Board’s discretion. 
Should an actual or potential conflict be identified, the Board shall consider whether to authorise the situation and, if so, the terms of any 
authorisation. In the event of an actual conflict arising, the Director concerned is to notify the Chairman (the Chairman would notify the 
Senior Independent Director) and the Director would be excluded from the relevant information, debate and decision.
The Board is responsible for undertaking a regular review of any authorisations given and will itself, or through one of its committees, 
ensure that the procedures for reporting and, if appropriate, authorising conflicts and potential conflicts of interest are operated correctly. 
In addition, the Nomination Committee will review the outside interests of a proposed Director to identify actual or potential conflicts of 
interest and will make recommendations to the Board as to whether the situation should be authorised.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with shareholders
The importance of dialogue with major shareholders is recognised and meetings are held in order to help achieve a mutual understanding 
of objectives. In this respect, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer make themselves available to major shareholders as 
appropriate throughout the year, in particular at the time of the Preliminary and Interim announcements. The Chairman also discusses 
governance and other matters directly with shareholders. The Chairman and the non-executive Directors are invited to investor briefings 
and attend meetings with major shareholders when requested. The Senior Independent Director is available to attend separate meetings 
with major shareholders on request.
Following the announcement of the Group’s Preliminary and Interim results and after other significant statements and presentations, 
investor opinion is canvassed and any feedback is made available to the Board. In addition, the Board is provided with brokers’ reports  
and feedback from shareholder meetings on a regular basis. 
To help facilitate dialogue with shareholders, the Investors section of the Company’s website includes details of Stock Exchange 
announcements, press releases, presentations, webcasts and other relevant information.
Constructive use of the AGM
The Annual General Meeting is normally attended by all members of the Board and by a representative of the auditors. At the AGM held 
in April 2009, the Chief Executive Officer made a short business presentation. Shareholders are also invited to ask questions during the 
meeting and have the opportunity to meet the Directors and other members of senior management before and after the formal meeting. 
The results of the proxy voting on all resolutions are provided for all attendees and are released to the London Stock Exchange and 
published on the Company’s website as soon as practicable after the meeting. Overview

Flower, Andrew Given and Simon Heale were members of the Committee throughout the year. All members of the Committee are 
independent Directors and Andrew Given, the Chairman of the Committee, has the requisite financial experience.
The Audit Committee met five times during the year and has the power to, and does, request the attendance at meetings of any Director, 
auditor or member of management as may be considered appropriate by the Chairman of the Committee. At the end of each meeting the 
non-executive Directors who are members of the Committee also meet the auditors without the executive Directors or other members of 
management present.
The Committee identifies and confirms that it receives the information it needs to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities. This is complemented 
by an annual presentation made by the Divisional Chief Executives and Chief Financial Officers on the internal control environment within 
their respective Divisions.
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference include:
Monitoring and making appropriate recommendations to the Board with regard to the financial reporting process, the integrity of  > >
the financial statements of the Company, any formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial performance and reviewing 
significant financial reporting judgments contained in them.
Reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control, internal audit and risk management systems. > >
Making recommendations to the Board, for it to put to the shareholders for their approval in general meeting, in relation to the > >
appointment, reappointment and removal of the external auditors and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement of  
the external auditors.
Reviewing and monitoring the external auditors’ independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into > >
consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements.
Developing and implementing policy on the engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit services, taking into account > >
relevant ethical guidance regarding the provision of non-audit services by the external auditors.
Reporting to the Board, identifying any matters in respect of which it considers that action or improvement is needed and making > >
recommendations as to the steps to be taken.
The Committee has the authority to investigate any matters according to its terms of reference and may obtain external advice at the cost 
of the Company. The Director of Risk Assurance and the internal auditor both have access to the Chairman of the Committee and meet, 
when appropriate, with the Committee without other executives present.
The work of the Committee in discharging those responsibilities in respect of 2009 included:
Reviewing the Group’s 2008 financial statements and 2009 Interim statements prior to Board approval. > >
The review of the process by which the Group’s main business risks are assessed and managed, with the principal risks being > >
considered by the Board as a whole.
Reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit and risk management systems. > >
Consideration of the work and plans for the internal audit function. > >
Appraisal of the Company’s Whistleblowing line and related procedures and policies. > >
Confirmation of the external auditors’ terms of engagement and fee structures. > >
Monitoring the level of non-audit work of the auditors, which in 2009 included services amounting to £0.1 million, mainly in > >
connection with tax advice.
To ensure the objectivity and independence of the external auditors, the policy implemented by the Committee for the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditors is in summary as follows:
Certain non-audit services may not be provided by the external auditors, including the review of their own work; they may not  > >
make management decisions; their work must not create a mutuality of interest; and they may not put themselves in the position  
of advocate.
Any non-audit work proposed to be placed with the external auditors with a fee in excess of £200,000 should be referred to the  > >
Audit Committee.
The prior approval of the Audit Committee is required for any non-audit work which, when added to the fees paid for other  > >
non-audit work, would total more than 80% of the audit fee. Overview

 Annual Report 2009
During the year the proportion of the auditors’ fees for non-audit work relative to the audit fee was 5% (2008: 11%).
The external auditors have processes in place to safeguard their independence and have written to the Committee confirming that, in their 
opinion, they are independent. The Company last changed its auditors in late 2001 and undertook a formal review of the external auditors 
which included a re-tender presentation during 2007. During 2008 the external auditors rotated the partner responsible for the Group’s 
audit work. As a result the Committee recommended to the Board that the Group’s audit work should not be put out to third-party tender 
during 2009.
Remuneration
As is further described in the Remuneration report on pages 77 to 85, the Remuneration Committee has responsibility for setting 
remuneration for all executive Directors and the Chairman, including benefits such as share options and awards under the Company’s 
incentive plans, pension rights and any compensation payments. The Committee also monitors the level and structure of remuneration  
for senior management.
Tim Stevenson, Martin Flower, Andrew Given and Simon Heale, who is the Committee Chairman, were members of the Committee 
throughout the year. The Committee is assisted in its duties by the Chief Executive Officer, the Company Secretary and the Director of 
Human Resources. No member of the Committee or attendee is present when their own remuneration is under consideration, nor do  
they participate in any relevant voting. The Committee also has the power to request, for all or part of any meeting, the attendance of  
any Director or member of management as may be considered appropriate by the Chairman of the Committee. The Committee met  
seven times during the year.
It is the Company’s policy to disclose the fees of any executive Director who serves as a non-executive Director of another company.  
During the year Mark Robertshaw served as a non-executive Director of Rathbone Brothers plc. The fees received by Mark Robertshaw  
in this regard are shown on page 82.
The report of the Remuneration Committee, which includes details of the Committee’s responsibilities and terms of reference and of  
the Directors’ remuneration and Directors’ interests in options and shares, is set out on pages 77 to 85.
Nomination
The Nomination Committee leads the process for Board appointments and makes recommendations to the Board on the appointment  
of new Directors. A majority of members of the Nomination Committee are independent non-executive Directors. Tim Stevenson as 
Chairman of the Committee, Martin Flower, Andrew Given, Simon Heale, and Mark Robertshaw were members of the Committee 
throughout the year. 
The Committee has the power to request the attendance of any other Director or member of management, for all or part of any  
meeting, as may be considered appropriate by the Chairman of the Committee. The Committee formally met once during 2009 and  
also held further informal discussions regarding the shape and size of the Board. No nominations to the Board or changes in role were 
made during the year.
The Nomination Committee reviews the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board, succession planning and the leadership 
needs of the Group. In the light of this review, the Committee prepares a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular 
appointment.
Candidates for appointment as Director are considered by the Committee, taking advice from external consultants where appropriate.
The terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive Directors are available for inspection. Non-executive Directors, including the 
Chairman, are asked to undertake that they will have sufficient time to meet their commitments to the Company. Their other significant 
commitments are disclosed to the Board before appointment, with an indication of the time involved, and the Board is informed of any 
subsequent changes. The terms of appointment for non-executive Directors do not include a notice period.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view  
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently. > >
Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent. > >
For the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU. > >
For the parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject  > >
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent Company financial statements.
Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent > >
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ report, Directors’ Remuneration report 
and Corporate governance statement that comply with that law and those regulations.

 Annual Report 2009
The Directors’ Remuneration report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’) and has been approved by  
the Board. Shareholders will be given the opportunity to approve the report at the Annual General Meeting on 23 April 2010.
The report has been drawn up in accordance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules.
The Remuneration report is divided into two parts. The first part contains commentary on remuneration policy, which is not required to be 
audited. The second part contains the remuneration tables that have been audited in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing Group policy on executive remuneration and for determining, on behalf of  
the Board, specific remuneration packages for the executive Directors and the Chairman. The Committee’s terms of reference are available 
on our website.
During the year the members of the Committee were: Simon Heale, who is the Chairman of the Committee, Martin Flower, Tim Stevenson 
and Andrew Given. Each of the non-executive Directors is regarded by the Board as independent. Tim Stevenson was independent at the 
time of his appointment as Chairman of the Board.
The Committee met on seven occasions during the year.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. The Chief Executive Officer and the Director of Human Resources attend 
meetings of the Committee by invitation. The Committee also had access to advice from the Chief Financial Officer. No executive Director 
or other attendee is present when his or her own remuneration is under consideration.
Deloitte LLP was appointed by the Committee as its retained advisers in February 2007 and has provided advice on market practice and 
remuneration policy as well as Total Shareholder Return (TSR) analysis.
During the financial year, Deloitte LLP has also provided unrelated tax advice to the Company.
During the year, Imbucon provided TSR analysis relating to the Company’s share plans. Imbucon did not provide any other services  
to the Company.
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain  
and motivate executive Directors and senior executives of the right calibre in order to run the Company successfully and to create  
value for shareholders.
The policy of the Committee is to ensure that a significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity is performance-related  
and based on the achievement of measurable targets which are relevant to and support the business strategy. This is in order to create  
a strong link between performance and reward which should be beneficial to shareholders, employees and the Company.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Committee takes into account the packages offered by similar companies to ensure  
the remuneration packages for executive Directors are competitive against the market in which the Company competes for talent.  
For the purposes of such analysis, comparator companies are chosen having regard to: the size of the company (eg market capitalisation, 
turnover and number of people employed); the diversity and complexity of its businesses; and the geographical spread of its businesses. 
The Committee also considers the level of pay throughout the Company when determining executive Directors’ remuneration.
The Committee believes that the current remuneration structures are appropriate and support the business strategy.

 Annual Report 2009
Base salary
The base salary for each executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the performance of the 
individual and having regard to practice in companies of comparable size and complexity in the FTSE 350. Salaries are normally reviewed 
on an annual basis.
No increase to base salaries was made in 2009. In line with the approach being taken across the organisation, executive Directors’  
salaries will be increased in 2010. In considering the level of increase, the Committee has been mindful of the general level of increase 
across the Company as well as the positioning of roles against the market. The table below shows the salaries in 2009 and with effect 
from 1 January 2010.
         Salary
        2009 2010
Mark Robertshaw       £440,000 £450,000
Kevin Dangerfield       £255,000 £265,000
 
Base salary is the only element of the remuneration package that is pensionable.
Annual bonus
The targets for the annual bonus are set by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the short- and long-term requirements  
of the Company. Challenging goals are set, which must be met before any bonus is paid. This approach is intended to align executive 
reward with shareholder return by rewarding the achievement of ‘stretch’ targets.
The bonus scheme provides the opportunity for executive Directors to earn a bonus of up to 100% of basic salary if stretching 
performance targets are achieved.
For 2009, the bonus was based wholly on financial performance. The targets for the awards were set to address the new demands  
placed on the business in the current economic climate and were based on underlying operating profit performance (up to 60% of salary) 
and cash conversion (up to 40% of salary). 
For 2010, the bonus will be based on profit before tax. This incentivises the executive Directors to manage much more of the ‘income 
statement’ to improve the earnings per share of the Group.
In addition to the achievement of the targets set, in considering any awards to be made the Committee also takes into account the  
quality of the overall performance of the Company. 
The bonuses awarded to executive Directors in respect of 2009 were as follows:
Mark Robertshaw – 20% of salary (2008: 60%). > >
Kevin Dangerfield – 20% of salary (2008: 30%). > >
This award was made on the basis that in 2009 the underlying operating profit target was not achieved, but the cash conversion measure 
was partially satisfied, resulting in a bonus payment of 20% of salary.
Long-term incentive arrangements
The Committee believes that share ownership by the executive Directors and senior executives helps align their interests with those of  
the shareholders. Accordingly the Company operates a number of share schemes for the executive Directors and other senior employees, 
details of which are set out below.
Deferred Bonus Share Matching Plan
In 2008 shareholder approval was gained for the introduction of a new long-term incentive plan, the Deferred Bonus Share Matching Plan. 
This Plan now operates alongside the other long-term incentive arrangements. To date, participants have been offered the opportunity  
to defer up to 50% of their annual bonus on a pre- or post-tax basis into Company shares. Participants must hold the deferred shares for 
three years to be eligible for a matching award based on the pre-tax value of their deferred shares. Matching shares may be earned at the 
end of three years in the event that stretching EPS targets have been met.
For the 2009 performance year, participants will be given the opportunity to defer up to 75% of their bonus under the Plan. This is in 
order to provide participants with a meaningful opportunity to invest in Morgan Crucible shares. This change is within the limits in the  
Plan rules approved by shareholders in 2008. This approach will be reviewed for future award cycles. Overview

As is set out in the table below, the targets for the 2010 matching awards will revert to referencing a growth above RPI as used in 2008. 
EPS performance       Matching shares
RPI+ 15% pa        3x match
RPI+ 10% pa        1.75x match
RPI+ 7.5% pa        1x match

RPI+ 4% pa        0.25x match
< RPI+ 4% pa        0x match
There is straight-line vesting in between each point above.
The performance targets for awards made in 2009 did not reference growth above RPI. Given the difficult economic climate at that time, 
the Committee considered the targets to be stretching.
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP was approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and offers executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity  
to receive shares as a reward for outstanding performance. The scheme allows awards of up to 150% of basic salary, although in 
exceptional circumstances the Committee is able to make awards of up to 200% of basic salary. The vesting of the awards is subject  
to the achievement of performance targets measured over the three-year period from the start of the year in which the award is made.
During the year, an award over 489,705 shares was made to Mark Robertshaw and an award over 283,806 shares was made to  
Kevin Dangerfield.
Due to the real economic uncertainty at the time the 2009 awards were made, the Remuneration Committee decided to recalibrate the 
focus of awards between internal financial targets and relative share price targets. Consequently, awards made under the LTIP in 2009 
were based wholly on the Company’s TSR performance against the comparator group below. If the Company’s TSR places it at the median 
of the comparator group, 30% of the award will vest, with 100% of the awards vesting for performance at the upper quartile or above. 
For performance between median and upper quartile, awards vest on a straight-line basis. The Committee must also be satisfied that the 
Company’s underlying financial performance justifies the level of vesting. 
For 2010 awards, the Remuneration Committee believes it is appropriate to return to the previous split between TSR and EPS targets on 
the basis that the Company is now able to set robust three-year EPS targets which have a meaningful line of sight for participants. The  
split between TSR and EPS targets provides the right balance between incentivising strong financial growth while taking into account the 
share price performance relative to peers. Therefore, for awards to be made under the LTIP in 2010, 50% will be based on TSR against the 
comparator group ones leaf and 50% will be based on EPS growth above RPI. Following a review during the year, the comparator group 
for the 2010 awards has been extended to include six new comparator companies. This is to ensure that the comparator group is of a 
robust size and reflects the different markets in which Morgan Crucible operates. The Committee must be satisfied that the Company’s 
underlying financial performance justifies the level of vesting. The awards made under the LTIP in 2007 and 2008 were based on the  
same measures and targets as will apply for the 2010 awards.
The vesting schedule for the 2010 awards is as follows:
      % of the award which vests % of the award  
      TSR performance against which vests 
      the sector comparator group EPS growth
Upper-quartile-ranked performance     50% RPI+ 10% pa 50%
Median-ranked performance     15% RPI+ 4% pa 15%
Below-median-ranked performance     0% < RPI+ 4% pa 0%
Straight-line vesting applies between each point (for both vesting schedules). Overview

Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)
The ESOS was approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and offers executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity 
to receive options granted at the market price of the Company’s shares at the time of the grant. The scheme allows awards of up to  
150% of basic salary, although in exceptional circumstances the Committee is able to make awards of up to 200% of basic salary.
There are two remaining awards to the executive Directors. Mark Robertshaw has a vested option grant from 2004 that he has not 
exercised. Kevin Dangerfield has an unvested option from 2001 that is subject to annual re-test for up to 10 years from the date of  
the grant (see Directors’ share options table on page 83). There is currently no intention to make awards under the ESOS in 2010.
Savings-related Share Option Scheme (SAYE)
As UK employees, the executive Directors may also participate in the Savings-related Share Option Scheme on the same basis as other 
eligible employees and subject to UK legislation. Scheme members save a fixed amount per month over three years and options have  
been granted with an exercise price at 80% of the market price at the date of grant. Those Directors who received options under this 
scheme are shown in the table on page 85. No performance conditions apply to these options as they are a tax-efficient mechanism for 
all employees to acquire shares in the Company at their own cost.
Other benefits
Executive Directors are eligible to receive certain benefits including a car allowance, health insurance and, where appropriate, relocation 
and other expenses.
Shareholding guidelines
In order to encourage alignment with shareholders, individual shareholding guidelines are operated for executive Directors and senior 
executives. Under such guidelines, executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain over time a shareholding in the Company 
equivalent to at least 100% of basic salary. This policy is supported by the Deferred Bonus Share Matching Plan under which participants 
are encouraged to invest their bonus in Company shares.
Chairman and non-executive Directors
Tim Stevenson was appointed as Chairman on 1 December 2006. Since the date of his appointment his annual fee has been set at £125,000.
Non-executive Directors receive a basic annual fee of £40,000. Additional payments of £4,500 per annum are made to the Senior Independent 
Director, £7,500 to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and £5,000 to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. The Chairman and 
non-executive Directors are also entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred in attending Board, strategy and other meetings. No changes 
were made to non-executive fees during the year.
Annual fees paid to the Chairman and non-executive Directors are reviewed on a biennial basis. A review was held in 2008 and, while  
no increases were recommended for the non-executive Directors, an increase for the Chairman was recommended. At the request of  
the Chairman, the 2009 increase was deferred for 12 months. Therefore, with effect from 1 January 2010 his annual fee will be increased  
to £140,000.
None of the non-executive Directors has a service contract with the Company although they do have letters of appointment which  
contain no obligations relating to any notice period. There are no obligations on the Company to make any payments in lieu of notice  
to any non-executive Director. The non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the incentive, share or share option plans. Each  
of the non-executive Directors is subject to re-election by shareholders every third year after their initial confirmation by shareholders  
as a Director.
Should any non-executive Director serve for nine or more years they would be subject to annual re-election. Overview

Service contracts
Executive Directors are employed on contracts subject to 12 months’ notice at any time. Contracts may be terminated on 12 months’ 
notice given by the Company or on six months’ notice given by the Director concerned. Contracts end on each Director’s anticipated 
normal retirement date. The following table shows the date of the contract for each executive Director who served during the year.
       Date of Date of
Executive Director      appointment service agreement
Kevin Dangerfield     3 August 2006 15 August 2008
Mark Robertshaw     4 August 2006 15 August 2008
 
The service agreements for Mark Robertshaw and Kevin Dangerfield do not contain specific termination provisions. In the event of  
early termination, the Company may be liable to pay an amount in damages having regard to salary, bonus and other benefits that would 
have been received had they served out their notice period. The value of any termination payment made will be at the judgment of the 
Committee having regard to all relevant factors including ensuring that the full benefit of mitigation is obtained. There is no automatic 
entitlement to bonus as part of the termination arrangements. 
Company pensions policy
The executive Directors participate in The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which is a contributory, 
HMRC-registered, defined benefit, funded occupational pension scheme. With effect from 6 April 2006 the basis of the scheme  
changed from final salary to career average and the normal pension age increased by five years. The main features of the plan are:
A normal pension age of 65. > >
Pension at normal pension age of two-thirds career average pensionable salary, subject to completion of 20 years’ employment > >
(26 years and eight months for new members).
Life assurance of four times basic salary. > >
Dependants’ pension on death. > >
Pensionable salary is the member’s basic salary restricted to a scheme earnings cap of £123,600 for the 2009-10 tax year.
In addition, executive Directors received a pension allowance derived from employer contributions based notionally on the registered 
scheme pensionable salary in excess of the earnings cap. The value of the pension allowance for each executive Director is set out in  
the Directors’ emoluments table on page 83.
External directorships
With the approval of the Board in each case, and subject to the overriding requirements of the Company, executive Directors may accept 
external appointments as non-executive Directors of other companies and retain any fees received.
The total amount of fees received by Mark Robertshaw in respect of a non-executive Directorship was £35,000.

*  This relates to an award made to Mark Robertshaw on his appointment as Chief Executive Officer in February 2006. The award is structured as a market value 
option over 1,000,000 shares subject to the performance conditions that apply to awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme.
The performance measure for the Executive Share Option Scheme awards above was based on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return 
performance against the FTSE 350. Thirty per cent of the awards vest for achieved median-ranked performance with full vesting for 
upper-quartile-ranked performance. For performance between median and upper quartile, awards vest on a straight-line pro-rata basis. 
The performance condition for the awards granted in 2006 was not met and these awards have therefore lapsed in full.
The share price at the year end was 157.7 pence and the high and low during the year were 192.3 pence and 70.3 pence respectively. Overview

1.  Investment shares represent those shares acquired with a portion of the bonus set out in the emoluments table on page 83 voluntarily deferred into the  
Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan. 
2.  This is the maximum number of shares based on the pre-tax value of the deferred shares that could be earned at the end of the performance period if the 
performance condition set out on page 79 is met in full.
3.  In 2008 the executive Directors deferred their bonus payment on a gross basis and in 2009 deferral was on a net basis. The flexibility to defer on either basis  
is within the Plan rules.
Note:  Prior to 6 April 2010, the Committee is intending to amend the terms of the Investment shares in order to allow individuals to crystallise the tax due on 
their earned deferred bonus awards. The net value of these awards will continue to be held until the normal vesting date. No amendment will be made  
to the terms of the matching shares. Overview

Notes re. pension benefits:
1.  The accrued benefit entitlement for Mark Robertshaw and Kevin Dangerfield is the pension which would be paid annually on retirement based on service at 
the end of the year.
2.  The transfer values for the pension benefits have been calculated on the basis set by the Trustee of the pension scheme. The Trustee of the pension scheme  
is an independent body that is separate from the Company and they must calculate transfer values in accordance with legislation having taken actuarial advice 
from an independent adviser. The assumptions used in the calculation of the transfer values depend on market conditions. Over the year corporate bond yields 
fell and inflation expectations, as implied by government bond yields, rose. Both movements increase the assessed transfer values. The method for setting the 
assumptions used was also updated by the Trustee during the year on the advice of the actuary, following the introduction of new legislation. This too increased 
transfer values. These two factors were much more significant than the increase in accrued benefits over the year. 
3.  Members of the pension scheme had the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions. Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included  
in the above table.
Mark Robertshaw and Kevin Dangerfield also received a pension allowance, details of which are set out in the Directors’ emoluments table 
on page 83.

 Annual report 2009
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
1. Accounting policies, estimates and judgments
Accounting policies
The Morgan Crucible Company plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated in the UK.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’), and include 
the Group’s interest in associates. The parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity 
and not about its Group. Historically the Group has drawn up its consolidated financial statements to 4 January. These consolidated 
financial statements have been drawn up to Sunday 3 January 2010. As from this year, the Group will maintain a 52 or 53 week fiscal  
year ending on the Sunday nearest to the Accounting Reference Date of the Company, 1 January.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (adopted IFRSs). The Company has elected to prepare its parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; these are presented on pages 139 to 147.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group 
financial statements.
During the period, the Group has applied IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (revised 2007) which has introduced a number of 
terminology changes and has resulted in a number of changes in presentation and disclosure. The revised standard has had no impact  
on the reported results or financial position of the Group. In addition, the Group has adopted IFRS 2 Amendment Regarding Vesting 
Conditions and Cancellations, IFRS 8 Operating Segments, IAS 23 Borrowing Costs (revised 2007), IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a  
Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes and Amendments 
to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, none of which have had a significant effect 
on the reported results or financial position of the Group.
(a) Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: 
derivative financial instruments and financial instruments available-for-sale.  
(b) Functional and presentation currency
The Group financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency.
(c) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
(ii) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. 
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity. Associates 
are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on 
acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the income and 
expenses and equity movements of associates, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date 
that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest 
in an associate, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the 
extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the associate. 
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation 
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the 
investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains,  
but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 
(d) Foreign currency 
(i) Foreign currency transactions 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets  
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to pounds sterling at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets  
and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to pounds 
sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.  Overview

1. Accounting policies, estimates and judgments continued
(ii) Financial statements of foreign operations 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated  
to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated to pounds sterling at an average rate for the period where this approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates  
of the transactions. Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation since the adoption of IFRS are recognised directly in a separate 
component of equity.  
(iii) Net investment in foreign operations
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations and of related hedges are taken to the 
translation reserve. They are released into the income statement upon disposal.
(e) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, 
financing and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
for trading purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends  
on the nature of the item being hedged (see accounting policy ‘f’). 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted 
forward price.
(f) Hedging
(i) Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecasted transaction, 
the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. The associated gain or loss is 
removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the period in which the transaction to which it relates occurs. 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but  
the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in the hedging reserve and  
is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take 
place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in the hedging reserve is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
(ii) Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities
Where a derivative financial instrument is used to hedge economically the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset  
or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement. 
(iii) Hedge of net investment in foreign operations
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an 
effective hedge is recognised directly in the translation reserve. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
(g) Property, plant and equipment 
(i) Owned assets 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, or at deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment 
losses (see accounting policy ‘l’). The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and an appropriate 
proportion of production overheads.  
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 5 January 2004, the date of transition  
to adopted IFRSs, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation. Where parts of an 
item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the 
carrying amount of the asset. Gains and losses on the disposal of property are recognised in ‘Other one-off items’ in the income 
statement. Gains and losses on the disposal of plant and equipment are recognised in ‘Operating costs’ in the income statement. 
(ii) Leased assets 
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Leased assets acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of  
the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.   Overview

(iii) Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, 
plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Buildings 50 years
Plant and equipment - presses, kilns and furnaces 10-20 years
Other plant and equipment 10 years
Fixtures and fittings 10 years
Motor vehicles and IT equipment 3 years
(h) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred  
since 5 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired. 
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded 
under UK GAAP. The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 5 January 2004 has not  
been reconsidered. Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.  
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment (see accounting policy ‘l’). 
(ii) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding,  
is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially 
improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has 
sufficient resources to complete development, use and sale of products or processes. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost  
of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation (see below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy ‘l’). Other development expenditure is recognised  
in the income statement as an expense as incurred. 
(iii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and impairment losses 
(see accounting policy ‘l’).
(iv) Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such 
lives are indefinite. Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance 
sheet date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Capitalised development costs 3 years
Computer software 3-6 years
Customer relationships 15-20 years
Technology 15-20 years
Order book Amortised over the period in which the associated orders are fulfilled
(i) Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated at their fair value less impairment losses (see accounting policy ‘l’).
(j) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course 
of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. 
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing 
them to their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate 
share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Overview

(k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits. 
(l) Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than inventories (see accounting policy ‘j’) and deferred tax assets (see accounting  
policy ‘s’), are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication  
exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated (see (i) below).
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to cash-generating units (group of units) and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) 
on a pro-rata basis. 
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective evidence 
that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss even though the 
financial asset has not been derecognised. The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the difference between 
the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
(i) Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of the Group’s investments in receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated 
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate (ie the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of these 
financial assets). Receivables with a short duration are not discounted. The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their  
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For  
an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs.
(ii) Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can  
be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. 
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed through profit or  
loss. If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event 
occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal 
recognised in profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been  
a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount and when there is an indication that the impairment loss may  
no longer exist.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
(m) Share capital
(i) Ordinary share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
(ii) Preference share capital
Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable and any dividends are discretionary, or is redeemable but only at  
the Company’s option. Dividends on Preference share capital classified as equity are recognised as distributions within equity.
(iii) Repurchase of share capital and own shares held by ESOP trust (treasury shares)
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable  
costs, is net of any tax effects and is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares and the purchase of own shares by the 
Group-sponsored ESOP trust are presented as a deduction from total equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares until  
their subsequent cancellation. Overview

(n) Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
(ii) Defined benefit plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount  
of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to 
determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on  
AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a 
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is 
limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future 
refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable 
during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities. Actuarial gains and losses, differences between the expected and actual 
returns, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in equity in the year in which they arise.
(iii) Long-term service benefits
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that 
employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is calculated using the projected  
unit credit method, or similar approximation, and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.  
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of  
the Group’s obligations. 
(iv) Share-based payment transactions
The Group operates various share option programmes that allow Group employees to acquire shares in the Company. Under the  
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and The Morgan Crucible Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan awards of shares are made to various  
key executives and under the Directors’ Share Option Plan 2006 (2006 ESOP), the Executive Share Option Scheme 2004 (2004 ESOS)  
and the Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 (1995 ESOS) share options are granted by the Company. The Company also maintains  
an all-employee sharesave scheme available to employees in the UK and Germany. The grant date fair value of options granted to 
employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options  
for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are met.
The fair value of the options and awards under each scheme have been measured using the following models:
Directors’ Share Option Plan 2006 Monte Carlo model
Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 Monte Carlo model
The Morgan Crucible Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan Monte Carlo model
Executive Share Option Scheme 2004 Monte Carlo model
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 (grants made since 2004) Binominal Lattice option pricing model
Employee Sharesave Scheme 1995 (grants made since 2004) Black-Scholes Merton model
Employee Sharesave Scheme 2004 Black-Scholes Merton model
Employee Sharesave Scheme 2004 (Germany) Black-Scholes Merton model
The choice of model takes into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made and the options were granted.  
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only 
due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. Overview

(o) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event,  
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value  
of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
(i) Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring 
has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided for.
(ii) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
(iii) Environmental
In accordance with the Group’s environmental policy a provision is recognised for known environmental issues which the Group will rectify 
over the next few years. In a number of jurisdictions companies have a constructive obligation to remedy any known environmental 
problems.
(p) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at their fair value.
(q) Revenue
(i) Goods sold
Revenue from the sale of products is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts 
and volume rebates. Revenue is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred to the buyer.
(ii) Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income, as grants for capital expenditure, when there is 
reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them. Grants that 
compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised as revenue in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same periods 
in which the expenses are incurred. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in the income statement as 
other operating income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.
(r) Expenses
(i) Operating lease payments 
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense. 
(ii) Finance lease payments
Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if the asset  
had been purchased outright. Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the capital elements of the 
leasing commitments are shown as obligations in creditors. Depreciation is charged on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or over 
the lease term if shorter. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding 
liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability.
(iii) Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on 
funds invested, gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement (see accounting policy ‘f’), expected 
return on IAS 19 pension assets and interest on IAS 19 obligations. Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, 
using the effective interest method.  Overview

Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are 
not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable 
profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
(t) Segment reporting
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 4 January 2009. The Group has identified four reportable operating 
segments. These have been identified on the basis of internal management reporting information that is regularly reviewed by the Group’s 
Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to allocate resources and assess performance. 
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable 
basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly investments and related income, loans and borrowings and related expenses, corporate assets 
(primarily the Company’s headquarters) and head office expenses, and income tax assets and liabilities. 
(u) Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group 
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity (ie forming part of shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that they meet 
the following two conditions: 
(i)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or 
financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and 
(ii)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified 
takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and 
share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated with financial 
instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
(v) Investments in debt and equity securities 
Investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with  
any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity (in the fair value reserve), except for impairment losses and, in the case of 
monetary items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative  
gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss. Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest 
calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss. 
(w) Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised  
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
(x) Capitalisation of borrowing costs
Borrowing costs (interest and other costs) are capitalised when they are incurred on raising specific funds to finance a major capital  
project which will be a significant productive asset, or to the extent that funds borrowed generally are used for the purposes of obtaining  
a qualifying asset.  Overview

1. Accounting policies, estimates and judgments continued
(y) Dividends
Dividends payable are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared and approved. 
(z) Step acquisitions
Step acquisitions arise when the Group acquires control of an entity through successive share purchases. The identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at fair value on the date that control is acquired. The amount recognised as goodwill  
or negative goodwill is determined separately for each tranche acquired, calculated as the difference between the fair value of the 
consideration paid and the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, in accordance with IFRS 3 
Business Combinations. Any changes in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired between the acquisition date and  
the date that control is obtained are recorded in other reserves in equity to the extent that they have not previously been recognised in  
the income statement. 
(aa) New Standards and Interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new Standards and amendments to Standards and Interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 3 January 2010, 
and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements: 
The following adopted IFRSs were available for early application but have not been applied:
(i) IFRS 3 (Revised 2008) Business Combinations
(ii) IAS 27 (Revised 2008) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
  The revised standards introduce changes to acquisition accounting, notably in respect of treatment of acquisition costs, step and 
partial acquisitions, minority interests and contingent consideration. 
  The Group does not expect the above standards to have any significant impact on the financial statements for the period commencing 
4 January 2010. 
Amendments to the following adopted IFRSs were available for early application but have not been applied:
(i) IAS 17 Leases 
(ii)  IAS 18 Revenue 
(iii) IAS 27 (Amended 2008) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 
(iv)  IAS 36 Impairment of Assets 
(v)  IAS 38 Intangible Assets 
(vi)  IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations 
(vii)  IFRS 8 Operating Segments 
(viii)  IAS 39 Financial Instruments 
(ix)  IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation
  The Group does not expect the above amendments to have any significant impact on the financial statements for the period 
commencing 4 January 2010.
Accounting estimates and judgments
Judgments made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements 
and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below.  
Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting policies and 
estimates and the application of these policies and estimates. The following accounting estimates are subject to significant uncertainty:
Provisions
Note 21 contains information about provisions. Provisions for closure and restructuring costs, environmental issues and settlement  
of litigation are judgmental by their nature. Amounts provided are the Group’s best estimate of exposure based on currently  
available information. Overview

Recognition of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill
Note 3 contains information about intangible assets recognised on acquisition. These primarily relate to existing contracts, order books 
and customer relationships, which are supported by long-term relationships with key customers. The Group has estimated that the 
customer relationships have an economic life of 15-20 years.
Impairment of goodwill
Note 11 contains information about the assumptions relating to goodwill impairment tests.
Credit risk
Note 19 contains information about the Group’s exposure to credit risk. The Group establishes both specific and general allowances  
for impairment losses against receivables. The general loss allowance is estimated based on historical data of payment statistics for  
similar financial assets.
Foreign currency exposure 
Note 19 contains information about the foreign currency exposure of the Group and risks in relation to foreign exchange movements.
Pension assumptions 
The principal actuarial assumptions applied to pensions are shown in note 20. The actuarial evaluation of pension assets and liabilities  
is based on assumptions in respect of inflation, future salary increases, discount rates, returns on investments and mortality rates.  
Relatively small changes in the assumptions underlying the actuarial valuations of pension schemes can have a significant impact  
on the net pension liability included in the balance sheet.
Taxation
The level of current tax and deferred tax recognised is dependent on the tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and on subjective 
judgments as to the outcome of decisions to be made by the tax authorities in the various tax jurisdictions around the world in which  
the Group operates. Deferred tax assets are recognised based on management’s assessment of the extent to which they are recoverable.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in 
the Business review on pages 32 to 63. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Business review. In addition, note 19 includes the Group’s policies and processes for managing financial risk; details of  
its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group announced in May 2009 the signing of a new £280 million three-year multicurrency revolving facility agreement with a 
syndicate of eight banks. This replaced a $420 million facility with the same financial covenants which was due to mature in March 2010. 
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through local banking arrangements that are supported through the flexibility 
provided by the new facility. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance 
and exchange rates, show the Group operating comfortably within the Group’s debt financial covenants for the next 12 months.
The current economic climate continues to have an impact on the Group, its customers and suppliers. The Board fully recognises the 
challenges that lie ahead but, after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts. Overview

2. Segment reporting
This year the Group adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments which replaces IAS 14 Segment Reporting. The accounting policy for identifying 
segments is now based on internal management reporting information that is regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision 
Maker. In contrast, IAS 14 Segment Reporting required the Group to identify two sets of segments (business and geographical) based on 
the risks and rewards of the operating segments. 
As a result of the adoption of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the Directors are of the opinion that the primary business segments, as 
previously reported under IAS 14 Segment Reporting, should remain unchanged. 
Hence the Group continues to comprise the following four reportable segments:
Carbon – the Carbon Division produces a wide variety of technological solutions from carbon, graphite and silicon carbide. > >
Technical Ceramics – the Technical Ceramics Division makes an extensive range of industrial ceramics products for a wide variety  > >
of applications.
Thermal Ceramics – the Thermal Ceramics Division designs and manufactures a wide variety of heat insulation products. > >
Molten Metal Systems – the Molten Metal Systems Division occupies a leading position in the supply of crucibles and manufactures > >
equipment used in the melting, holding and processing of metals and alloys.

3. Acquisitions
Acquisitions in 2009
Clearpower
In 2007 the Group acquired 49% of the Ordinary share capital of Clearpower Limited, a company that, via two intermediary holding 
companies, owns 100% of NP Aerospace Limited. On 5 January 2009 the Group acquired the remaining 51% of the Ordinary share capital  
of Clearpower Limited for a total of £56.8 million, an amount contingent on the future performance of Clearpower Limited. This comprised 
£12.2 million in cash for 11% of the Ordinary share capital and £44.6 million in discounted deferred contingent consideration for 40% of the 
Ordinary share capital.
The discounted deferred contingent consideration takes the form of four synthetic forwards each to acquire 10% of the Ordinary share 
capital of Clearpower Limited at future dates from 2010 onwards, the amount of which are based on a fixed EBITDA multiple of 
Clearpower Limited. In accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, the Group has recognised a liability representing the 
estimated present value of the redemption amount in respect of its obligation to acquire these shares and has treated them as if they were 
acquired by the Group on 5 January 2009. Since this consideration is contingent on the future performance of Clearpower the liability is 
remeasured at each reporting date with any adjustments recorded through goodwill, in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.  
It is possible that the carrying amount of this liability will increase or decrease if the future performance of Clearpower varies from current 
expectations. At 3 January 2010 this liability to purchase the remaining 40% of the Ordinary share capital of Clearpower Limited was 
remeasured and increased to £46.0 million. In addition amounts payable in respect of the acquisition of 11% of the Ordinary share capital 
were increased by £8.1 million based on the actual performance of Clearpower Limited in 2009. The £8.1 million deferred contingent 
consideration in respect of the acquisition of 11% of the Ordinary share capital will be paid after the balance sheet date.
At 3 January 2010 the Group carries a total liability of £54.1 million in respect of deferred consideration. This is included within current 
and non-current non-trade payables (see note 22). The unwinding of the discount on this liability of £2.2 million is recorded as a finance 
expense (see note 6). The adjustment through goodwill since the date of acquisition as a result of the remeasurement is £7.3 million. 
The principal activity of NP Aerospace Limited is the development, manufacture and marketing of ballistic and non-ballistic products in  
the defence and civil sectors. In the 12 months to 3 January 2010 Clearpower Limited and its subsidiaries contributed an operating profit 
before amortisation of intangible assets of £28.8 million to the consolidated net profit.

3. Acquisitions continued
Provisional fair value adjustments were made to reflect the fair value of the assets/liabilities acquired and principally represent the 
recognition of the fair value of non-contractual customer relationships, order book and technology and the associated deferred tax  
on the temporary timing difference created by the fair value adjustments. No adjustments to fair value were made.
Recognised goodwill comprises £22.5 million arising on the initial purchase of the 49% interest in 2007 and £74.2 million arising on the 
effective acquisition of the remaining 51% interest on 5 January 2009.
Excluding goodwill a total of £51.5 million of intangible assets has been recognised comprising £23.9 million of customer relationships, 
£18.3 million of technology and an order book of £9.3 million. These have been recognised within operating intangibles arising on 
acquisition (see note 11).
Goodwill represents future economic benefits arising from assets that are not capable of being identified individually or recognised as 
separate assets. This includes acquirer-specific synergies such as cross-selling opportunities and the enhancement of technologies and 
processes between existing and acquired sites.
The fair value of the purchase consideration, which is dependent on future results, represents management’s best estimate of the likely 
final purchase consideration.
The revaluation surplus, recorded in the statement of other comprehensive income, reflects the increase in the fair value of the Group’s 
original 49% interest in Clearpower Limited from the date of its original acquisition to 5 January 2009 excluding goodwill and to the 
extent not previously recognised as the Group’s share of the results of Clearpower Limited.
Other acquisitions
On 6 April 2009, the Group acquired a 50% stake in Integrated Survivability Technologies Limited. The principal activity of Integrated 
Survivability Technologies Limited is acting as prime contractor for delivery of military vehicles and provision of related support services. 
This company did not trade prior to the date of acquisition. 
During the year the Company acquired a further 9% of the Ordinary share capital and voting rights of Carbo San Luis SA for £1.1 million, 
resulting in a total shareholding of 84.6% at 3 January 2010.
Acquisitions in 2008
On 31 March 2008 the Group acquired 100% of the shares in the Technical Ceramics business of Carpenter Technology Corporation, 
known as Certech and Carpenter Advanced Ceramics, for £74.6 million. The principal activity of Certech is the manufacture of complex 
injection-moulded ceramic components. The principal activity of Carpenter Advanced Ceramics is the manufacture of engineered ceramic 
products. In the nine months to 4 January 2009 these subsidiaries contributed an operating profit before amortisation of intangible assets 
of £6.6 million to the consolidated net profit for the period. The Group revenue and profit from operations before amortisation of intangible 
assets for 2008, had the acquisition taken place at the beginning of the period, are £849.2 million and £100.4 million respectively.

Impairment test for cash-generating units containing goodwill
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units that  
are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill. The most significant elements  
of the Group’s total consolidated goodwill of £206.8 million at 3 January 2010 are allocated to the Carbon cash-generating unit.
Goodwill is attributed to each cash-generating unit as follows:
        2009 2008
        £m £m
Carbon       117.0  21.5 
Technical Ceramics       67.2  72.1 
Thermal Ceramics       20.5  22.5 
Molten Metal Systems       2.1  2.3 
        206.8  118.4 
 
Each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment. 
As part of the annual impairment test review the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to its value in use reflecting 
the projected cash flows of each cash-generating unit. 
The key assumptions on which the cash flow projections are based relate to growth rates and discount rates.
The cash flow projections in year one are based on budgeted operating results for the forthcoming year. The budget for 2010 was 
approved in December 2009.
Growth rates for the period not covered by budgets are specific to each operating Division, ranging from 4.4% to 6.9% (2008: 4.4%  
to 6.9%). These growth rates reflect the products, industries and countries in which the Divisions operate. These medium- to long-term 
growth rates have been reviewed by management during 2009 and are considered to remain appropriate.
Given the similar risk profiles of each of the operating Divisions, together with common funding from the central Group Treasury function, 
a standard pre-tax discount rate of 12.9% (2008: 13%), based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, has been used in 
discounting the projected cash flows and calculating the terminal value at the end of year five. This discount rate has been used as  
the Group believes it suitably approximates the rate used by end-market participants.
The Directors have considered the following individual sensitivities and are confident that no impairment would arise in any of the 
following three circumstances:
if the pre-tax discount rate was increased by 300bps to 15.9%; > >
if no growth was assumed for years two to five; and > >
if the cash flow projections of all businesses were reduced by 25%. > > Overview

result its results are fully consolidated in the results for the year ended 3 January 2010. In 2008 the Group had accounted for its investment 
in Clearpower Limited as an associate. In 2008, the Group’s share of profit after tax in its associate for the year was £1.2 million.

The majority of this balance is for precious metals which are held on consignment by a subsidiary and for which it is invoiced only when  
the material is required.
During the year provisions of £4.4 million were made against inventories and recognised in operating expenses (2008: £4.6 million).  
The Group did not reverse any provisions against inventory during 2009 and 2008. Overview

17. Capital and reserves
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign 
operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in a foreign subsidiary and forward 
contracts used for net investment hedging.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments 
related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Fair value reserve
The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the investment is 
derecognised.
Special reserve
A Special Resolution to cancel the Share Premium Account was passed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 11 June 
1993. This cancellation was confirmed by an Order of the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, on 14 July 1993. The amount of  
£88.9 million standing to the credit of the Share Premium Account on 14 July 1993 was transferred to the special reserve against which 
goodwill on consolidation can be written off. This reserve, together with the amounts standing to the credit of the Share Premium Account 
on 12 October 1990 of £71.5 million, on 19 June 1987 of £38.9 million and on 27 July 1989 of £12.3 million which were transferred  
following previous Orders of the High Court, becomes distributable to the extent of subsequent increases in issued share capital and  
share premium account.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve arose when the Company redeemed Preference shares wholly out of distributable profits. The movement  
in 2008 relates to the cancellation of Ordinary shares as a result of the share buy-back programme.
Other reserves
The other reserves includes the £10.8 million increase in the fair value of the Group’s original 49% interest in Clearpower Limited from  
the date of its original acquisition to 5 January 2009 excluding goodwill and to the extent not previously recognised as the Group’s share 
of the results of Clearpower Limited. See note 3 for further details.
Retained earnings
The Company has acquired own shares under a share buy-back programme. The Company has also acquired own shares to satisfy the 
requirements of the various share option incentive schemes. The number of treasury shares held by the Company at the year end was 
1,984,022 (2008: 2,593,799); 1,984,022 shares were held by The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust (2008: 2,593,799) and nil

Overview
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
credit risk > >
liquidity risk > >
market risk. > >
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, and the Group’s management of capital. Further 
quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board delegates the establishment and implementation of the systems for internal control and risk management to the operating 
Divisions which are responsible for the identification and evaluation of significant risks applicable to their area of business together with  
the design and operation of suitable internal controls. The Board delegates the monitoring and review of the internal control and risk 
management systems to the Audit Committee assisted by the Risk Management Committee. The Risk Management Committee, which  
is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, reviews the full range of risks faced by Morgan Crucible as a Group, ensures there are adequate 
systems in place and evaluates their effectiveness. Where necessary, the Risk Management Committee will initiate action to improve  
the systems and ensure compliance. Overview

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities. 
The Group has set up notional cash pooling agreements with a number of banks. Under the notional cash pooling agreement the Group 
has the legal right to offset liabilities on undrawn bank accounts against surplus balances. 
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the Group’s 
customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are 
performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The Group serves thousands of customers. Many of these have purchased the same product for several years and in some cases decades. 
Others have modified and enhanced designs or adopted the same components into new products, extending the lifecycle of the 
components that the Group supplies. The Group’s level of customer retention is very high, particularly with its major accounts, and, 
although the top 20 ranking will alter from year to year, many of the names remain consistent over time.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables 
and investments. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, 
and a general loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. 
The general loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Investments
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a sound credit rating. 
Given these high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting 
date was:

        £m £m
Balance at beginning of period       10.5  4.4 
(Decrease)/increase in allowance for impairment       (0.3) 6.1 
Balance at end of period       10.2  10.5 
 
Based on past experience, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due.  
A specific impairment allowance may be created in respect of an individual trade receivable for which full recovery is doubtful. As at  
3 January 2010 and 4 January 2009 there were no specific impairment allowances that were significant to the Group. In addition, local 
management may create a general impairment allowance to reflect their experience of the historical recoverability of trade receivables  
past due in the respective markets in which their businesses operate.       
The allowances in the accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no 
recovery of the amount owing is possible; at the point the amount is considered irrecoverable it is written off against the financial asset directly. Overview

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are 
settled by cash. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to 
meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions.
The Group seeks a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost-effective borrowing structure. The policy is to ensure that  
the Group has sufficient liquidity available to meet all foreseeable needs.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk 
exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks. 
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Risk Management Committee. Generally the Group seeks to apply 
hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss.

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
A change of 100 basis points in interest rates on the outstanding bank syndication debt at the reporting date would have increased/
(decreased) profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, 
remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2008.

Foreign currency risk
The table below shows the Group’s currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and 
losses recognised in the income statement. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not 
denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges 
of net investments in overseas entities.

The Group aims to hedge all material trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency. At any point in time the 
Group also hedges up to 75% of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecasted sales and purchases over the following 
12 months. The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk. Most of the forward exchange contracts have 
maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than the currency of the reporting unit, the Group ensures that 
the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term 
imbalances.
Forecasted transactions
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.  
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted transactions at 3 January 2010 was a loss of £0.4 million 
(2008: loss £4.6 million), comprising assets of £0.1 million (2008: £0.2 million) and liabilities of £0.5 million (2008: £4.8 million) that were 
recognised in fair value derivatives.
Cash flow hedges
The contractual cash flows associated with the forward exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges are shown in the 
section on liquidity risk. The impact on profit or loss is expected to occur at the same time as the associated cash flows. Overview

Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries       
The Group manages the translation exposure of overseas net assets by seeking to match the currency of borrowings with the currency in 
which the net assets are denominated. The objectives are to maintain a low cost of borrowing, whilst maintaining a balanced portfolio of 
net assets by currency.
The Group enters into forward contracts to hedge net investments in overseas subsidiaries. The Group also designates the Euro 
drawdowns under the US$280 million multicurrency revolving credit facility as a hedge of the Group’s investment in subsidiaries  
in Europe. Euro drawdowns during the year amounted to w43.5 million (2008: €100.0 million).
Sensitivity analysis
The Group’s sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 3 January 2010 is set out in the table 
below. The impact of a weakening in sterling on the Group’s financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income 
by its impact on the Group’s overseas net assets and earnings respectively. Sensitivity on Group assets other than financial assets and 
liabilities is not included in this analysis.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market 
conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments in the global financial 
markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, 
which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
The estimated changes for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all 
other currencies from the levels applicable at 3 January 2010, with all other variables remaining constant. Such analysis is for illustrative 
purposes only - in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.

The impact of a one cent movement in the US$ exchange rate on results that are reported in US$ (including those currencies that track  
the US$) would be circa £1.9 million of revenue and £0.2 million of underlying operating profit.
Other market price risk
Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held for meeting partially the unfunded portion of the Group’s defined 
benefit pension obligations. The primary goal of the Group’s investment strategy is to maximise returns in order to meet partially the 
Group’s unfunded defined benefit obligations.
Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base (total equity) so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
future development of the business. The Board uses a number of measures, identified as key performance indicators (KPI), to ensure the 
continued success of the Group. The main KPI for the Group is the underlying profit margin. The aim is to achieve mid-teen margins in  
good times and double-digit margins when the environment is more challenging. Another measure, the economic value-added ratio (EVA), 
compares the returns made by our Divisions with the notional cost of investing in them. The Group uses this ratio to ascertain where to 
make capital investments within the Group. The basic calculation deducts the cost of capital from the net operating profit after allowing  
for a notional medium-term tax charge.
The Board encourages employees of the Group to hold the Company’s Ordinary shares. The Group operates a number of employee  
share and share option schemes. From time to time the Company purchases its own shares on the market; the timing of these purchases 
depends on market prices. Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Group’s various share option incentive 
schemes. The Company may also acquire its own shares under a share buy-back programme. Overview

Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the 
preceding table.
Equity securities
Fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives
Forward exchange contracts are marked to market either using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and 
deducting the current spot rate. 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities
The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease 
agreements. The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables/payables
For receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value. All other 
receivables/payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest rates used for determining fair value
The interest rates used to determine the fair value of loans and borrowings and finance leases are as follows:
        2009 2008
        % %
Loans and borrowings       2.7-6.3 2.0-4.0
Finance leases       6.0 6.0
 
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices)  
or indirectly (ie derived from prices)
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The 2009 expense recognised in the consolidated income statement includes a £1.3 million gain on curtailment of US employee benefit 
schemes. The curtailment gain of £0.7 million in Europe arose as a result of two European employee benefit schemes being withdrawn. 
The unrecognised past service cost in France was as a result of a change in future benefit accrual. This will be amortised over 13 years.

The actual liability in respect of global employee benefits will not be known until the last payments have been made. In placing a current estimate 
on the Company’s past service benefit obligations, a number of assumptions about the future are required. For defined benefit schemes, the 
Directors make annual estimates and assumptions in respect of discount rates, future changes in salaries, employee turnover, inflation rates  
and life expectancy. In making these estimates and assumptions, the Directors consider advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries.
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans. The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was  
£3.9 million (2008: £2.6 million).
Share-based payments
During 2004, the Group established a new Long Term Incentive Plan and a new Executive Share Option Scheme. During 2004, the 
Company also renewed its all-Employee Sharesave Scheme and took the opportunity to extend a similar scheme to employees in Germany.
During 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 the Group made awards under the 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan. During 2005 and 2006 the 
Group made awards under the 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme. Also in 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2009 the Company granted options 
under the UK all-Employee Sharesave Scheme and in 2008 the Company granted options under the German all-Employee Sharesave Scheme.
During 2008, the Group established The Morgan Crucible Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan and awards were made under this plan  
in 2008 and 2009.
Additionally, equity-settled share option grants and awards made under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 are outstanding. In accordance 
with the transitional provisions under IFRS 1, the recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to these grants. Overview

Performance criteria for Long Term Incentive Plan 2004, Directors’ Share Option Plan 2006 and  
Executive Share Option Scheme 2004
For awards granted from 2004 to 2006 inclusive, the extent to which awards vested depended on the Company’s Total Shareholder  
Return (‘TSR’) ranking against the TSR of the other companies in the FTSE 350 measured over the performance period.
If the Company’s TSR placed it at the median, then 30% of the awards would vest on the third anniversary of the date of the grant.
If the Company’s TSR placed it at the upper quartile, then 100% of the option would vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
Between the median and upper quartile, the option would vest on a straight-line basis. Below the median, none of the shares would vest.
In 2007 additional performance criteria were attached to the Long Term Incentive Plan 2004. The TSR performance criteria referred to 
above now only relate to 50% of awards made. The extent to which the other 50% of these awards vest will depend on the Company’s 
earnings per share (‘EPS’) compared with the Retail Price Index (‘RPI’). The full 50% will vest if, over the three-year performance period, the 
Company’s EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 10% per annum. If the Company’s EPS increases by more 
than the sum of the annual RPI increase and between 4% and 10% per annum then the proportion of awards vesting will be interpolated 
between 15% and 50%. If the Company’s EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 4% per annum then 15% 
of the awards will vest. If the Company’s EPS increases by less than the sum of the RPI increase and 4% per annum then 0% of the awards 
will vest.
In 2008 further changes were made to the performance criteria attached to the Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 for awards made in 2008 
and onwards. For all participants excluding executive Directors the TSR performance criteria referred to above now only relate to 33.3%  
of awards made. The extent to which the other 66.7% of these awards vest will depend on the Company’s EPS compared with the RPI. 
The full 66.7% will vest if, over the three-year performance period, the Company’s EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI 
increase and 10% per annum. If the Company’s EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and between 4% and 10% 
per annum then the proportion of awards vesting will be interpolated between 15% and 50%. If the Company’s EPS increases by more 
than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 4% per annum then 15% of the awards will vest. If the Company’s EPS increases by less than 
the sum of the RPI increase and 4% per annum then 0% of the awards will vest. For executive Director participants the conditions remain 
unchanged from 2007.
In 2009 further changes were made to the performance criteria attached to the Long Term Incentive Plan 2004. For all participants the  
TSR performance criteria referred to above now relate to 100.0% of awards made. 
In addition, an improvement must be shown in the Company’s underlying financial performance.
Performance criteria for The Morgan Crucible Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan
The extent to which awards will vest will depend on the Company’s EPS compared with the RPI. Participants are able to defer up to 75% 
of their annual bonus into Company shares, subject to approval by the Remuneration Committee. Under the 2008 grant, the Remuneration 
Committee allowed participants to defer up to 50% of their annual bonus into Company shares. Participants must hold the deferred 
shares for three years to be eligible for a matching award. Matching shares may be earned at the end of three years in the event that a 
stretching EPS target has been met. If the Company’s EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 15% per annum 
then matching shares equal to three times the deferred shares will be earned. If the Company’s EPS increases by more than the sum of  
the annual RPI increase and between 4% and 10% per annum then the proportion of awards will be interpolated between 0.25x deferred 
shares and 1.75x deferred shares. If the Company’s EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 4% per annum 
then matching shares equal to 0.25x deferred shares will be earned. If the Company’s EPS increases by less than the sum of the RPI 
increase and 4% per annum then 0% of the awards will vest.
In 2009 additional criteria were attached to the Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan. Under the 2009 grant, the Remuneration Committee 
allowed participants to defer up to 50% of their annual bonus into Company shares. Participants must hold the deferred shares for  
three years to be eligible for a matching award. Matching shares may be earned at the end of three years in the event that a stretching  
EPS target has been met. If the Company’s EPS increases by more than 15% per annum then matching shares equal to three times the 
deferred shares will be earned. If the Company’s EPS increases by between 4% and 10% per annum then the proportion of awards will  
be interpolated between 0.25x deferred shares and 1.75x deferred shares. If the Company’s EPS increases by more than 4% per annum 
then matching shares equal to 0.25x deferred shares will be earned. If the Company’s EPS increases by less than 4% per annum then 0% 
of the awards will vest. Overview

Performance criteria for the Executive Share Option Scheme 1995
The diluted earnings per share for the Company must grow by at least 2% per annum in excess of RPI over the period of date of grant  
to date of vesting.
The fair values of services received are in return for awards made and share options granted. The estimate of the fair value of the services 
received is measured based on an appropriate model as shown in accounting policy note ‘n’. In the case of the Binomial Lattice model and 
Monte Carlo model the contractual life of the options and awards are used as an input. Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into 
both of these models.

The options outstanding at the year end have an exercise price in the range nil to 256.00 pence and a weighted average contractual life  
of 0.7 years.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted. 
The estimates of the fair value of the services received is measured based on either a Monte Carlo model, a Binomial Lattice option  
pricing model or a Black-Scholes Merton model. The choice of model takes into account the terms and conditions upon which the options 
were granted. 
The IFRS 2 fair value charge expensed to the income statement was £2.0 million (2008: £2.2 million).

Closure and restructuring provisions are based on the Group’s restructuring programmes and represent committed expenditure at  
the balance sheet date. The amounts provided are based on the costs of terminating relevant contracts, under the contract terms, and 
management’s best estimate of other associated restructuring costs including professional fees, most of which are expected to be incurred 
over the next year. The amounts provided also include the obligation for discounted future payments under a non-cancellable lease for  
the offices of the Company’s former headquarters, net of expected rental income under sub-leases. The lease expires in 2016.
Other provisions include the settlement of European class actions, together with the associated legal costs. The estimated costs are based on 
the Group’s assessment of the probable future costs of these activities. The Group expects to incur most of the liability in more than one year.
Environmental provisions are for known environmental issues which the Group will rectify over the next few years. In a number of jurisdictions 
companies have a constructive obligation to remedy any known environmental problems. The estimated costs are based on management’s 
best estimate of the costs required to remedy these problems. The Group expects to incur most of the liability over the next five years. Overview

24. Capital commitments
Commitments for property, plant and equipment and computer software expenditure for which no provision has been made in these 
accounts amount to £2.7 million (2008: £3.8 million) for the Group.
25. Contingencies
There are contingent liabilities on bills discounted by the Group amounting to £0.8 million (2008: £0.8 million).
The Group has been subject to legal claims in the USA, Canada and Europe. Settlements for the majority of these have been agreed.  
There remain provisions in respect of these claims of £0.7 million (2008: £2.3 million). The Board, having taken legal advice, is of the opinion 
that the remainder of these actions will not have a material impact on the Group’s financial position.
In an international group of companies a variety of claims arise from time to time. Provision has been made in these accounts against those 
claims which the Directors consider meet the requirements of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and are likely 
to result in significant liabilities. Overview

Limited, as an associate, in the comparative year.
In 2009 the Group acquired a significant interest in Integrated Survivability Technologies Limited and started to account for it as an 
associate. The transactions with associates reported in 2009 refer to Integrated Survivability Technologies Limited.

Notes to the Company balance sheet
 
28. Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation  
to the financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and under the historical cost  
accounting rules.
Under Section 408(4) of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and  
loss account.
Under FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds  
that the cash flows of the Company are included within the published consolidated financial statement.
Fixed assets and depreciation 
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets by equal instalments over  
their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Buildings – 50 years 
Motor vehicles – 3 years 
Fixtures – 10-20 years 
Computer software – 3-6 years
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward,  
at the rate of exchange under the related forward currency contract. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  
are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation  
are included in the profit and loss account.
Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Post-retirement benefits
The Company participates in a Group-wide pension scheme providing benefits based on career average pensionable pay. The assets of the 
scheme are held separately from those of the Company. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities 
of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, accounts for the scheme as if 
it were a defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable 
to the scheme in respect of the accounting period. Refer to note 40 for the additional disclosures required by FRS 17.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and 
accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company
Following the adoption of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, financial instruments issued by the Company are 
treated as equity (ie forming part of shareholders’ funds) only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets  
or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company; and
b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified 
takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and 
share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of interest payable and similar charges. Finance payments 
associated with financial instruments that are classified as part of shareholders’ funds (see dividend policy) are dealt with as appropriations 
in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds. Overview

 Annual report 2009
28. Accounting policies continued
Hedging instruments and hedged items are accounted for separately in the balance sheet. Gains and losses on both are included in profit 
for the year when they arise (fair value hedges) or when the hedged transaction occurs, having first recorded those on the hedging 
instrument in equity (cash flow hedges, to the extent effective).
Certain financial assets and liabilities have been designated as fair value through profit or loss and are recognised in the balance sheet  
at fair value. Changes in the fair value of such instruments during the year were recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Own shares held by ESOP trust
Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected in the Company’s 
financial statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited and credited to equity.
Share-based payments
The share option programme allows employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of options granted after 7 November 
2002 and those not yet vested as at 4 January 2005 is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair 
value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the options. 
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except 
where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting. For details of share-based payments made and the 
assumptions used in measuring the fair value see note 20.
Share-based payments recharged to subsidiary undertakings are recorded via the inter-company loan account.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately 
authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes 
to the financial statements.
Financial guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company 
considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a 
contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
29. Staff numbers and costs
The average number of persons employed by the Company (including Directors) during the year, analysed by category, was as follows: 
        Number of employees
        2009 2008
Directors and head office staff       23 21
Global business units’ staff       13 14
        36 35
 
The majority of the Directors and head office staff devote a proportion of their time to global business duties. Of the 23 Directors and  
head office staff, the average number who spent all or a proportion of their time on corporate duties was eight (2008: eight) as shown  
in note 5.
The aggregate payroll costs of these persons were as follows:
        2009 2008
        £m £m
Wages and salaries       4.9  6.0 
Share-based payments (see note 20)       2.0  2.2

The Morgan Pension Scheme and The Morgan Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme
The Company participates in two defined benefit schemes in the UK. The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee-administered 
funds, The Morgan Pension Scheme (‘MPS’) and The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (‘SSS’). Given that 
the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, as permitted by FRS 17 
Retirement Benefits, the schemes have been accounted for in these financial statements as if they were defined contribution schemes. Overview

The contribution for the year was £4.7 million (2008: £6.4 million).
41. Contingent liabilities
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group,  
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the 
guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment 
under the guarantee.
There are no other contingent liabilities in the Company as at 3 January 2010.
The Group has been subject to legal claims in the USA, Canada and Europe. Settlements for the majority of these have been agreed.  
There remain provisions in respect of these claims of £0.7 million (2008: £2.3 million). The Board, having taken legal advice, is of the opinion 
that the remainder of these actions will not have a material impact on the Group’s financial position.

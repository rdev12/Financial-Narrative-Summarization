Chairman’s statement
Overview
Against the backdrop of a soft economic environment, particularly 
in Europe, I am pleased to report that Bodycote made further 
progress in 2013. The ongoing execution of the Group’s strategy to 
direct the mix of sales towards higher added-value work linked to 
careful management of costs has enabled us once again to improve 
our profitability and return on investment. Going forward we will 
continue to seek out opportunities to expand the Group through 
a combination of organic growth initiatives in new markets and 
technologies, investment in capability in emerging markets and 
acquisition of high quality businesses at reasonable prices.
Headline earnings per share at 41 .2p grew by 10%, headline 
operating margins exceeded 17% and operating profit was fully 
backed by positive cash generation. As a result I am very pleased  
to report a strong net cash position of £15m at 31 December 2013. 
The return on capital employed increased to 19.9%.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final ordinary dividend of 9.1p, an increase 
of 10%, which will be paid on 2 May 2014 subject to shareholder 
approval at the AGM. This brings the total ordinary dividend for 
2013 to 13.5p (2012: 12.3p) costing £25.7m, which is a year-on-year 
increase of 10%. The Board is also recommending a supplemental 
distribution, by way of a special dividend, amounting to 10.0p per 
share costing £19.1m. 
Governance
As Chairman, one of my primary responsibilities is to ensure 
that the Group operates to the highest standards in all aspects 
of governance and risk management. Our aim within Bodycote 
is to manage a growing business effectively, while ensuring 
that proper operating procedures and internal controls are 
maintained at all times in each of the 26 countries where we 
operate. Transparency is central to this objective and you will find 
more detail about our approach and progress over the last year 
in the Corporate Governance section starting on page 32. The 
Remuneration Committee report is in accordance with the new 
reporting requirements of the large and medium sized companies 
regulations. These came into force in October 2013.
“Bodycote has once again delivered 
value in terms of total shareholder 
return and remains in a strong 
financial position. ”
A.M. Thomson l Chairman
02 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2013 23065.02     11 March 2014 1:46 PM     Design Shell
During the year I met a number of Bodycote’s major shareholders 
and received positive feedback from them on their views of the 
Group. Going forward I will maintain this valuable dialogue with 
our shareholders and look forward to meeting increasing numbers 
of you at this year’s AGM, when there will be an opportunity to 
discuss the Group’s business and prospects.
People
The people who work for the Company are undoubtedly our key 
asset and I am certain that the existing opportunities for long-
term growth will ensure that our employees find Bodycote a place 
where they will continue to enjoy rewarding careers. On behalf 
of the Board I congratulate them all for delivering another year of 
successful trading and excellent financial performance.
Summary
Bodycote has once again delivered value in terms of total 
shareholder return and remains in a strong financial position.
I believe that the Group will continue to deliver positive returns in 
the years ahead. Underpinned by the ongoing focus upon excellent 
customer service, strong cash management and the quality of our 
global workforce, I look forward to the future with confidence.

Chief Executive’s review
“In 2013 improvements in business 
mix, plus the full year effect of 
the 2012 acquisitions, enabled 
Bodycote to achieve good growth 
and strong returns, despite weak 
markets in the early part of the 
year. ”
S.C. Harris l Group Chief Executive
Overview
Bodycote moved strongly ahead in 2013 despite mixed market 
conditions. Reported revenue grew by £31 .8m (5.4%) to £619.6m, 
albeit helped by a positive contribution of £14.2m (2.4%) from 
foreign exchange translation effects. This corresponds to a 3% 
growth at constant exchange rates. The acquisitions made in 2012 
contributed £32.4m, or 5.5%, with organic revenues declining by 
£14.8m (2.5%). Nearly all of Bodycote’s markets were weak in the 
first part of the year but, encouragingly, many strengthened as the 
year progressed.
Margins increased once again with progress in both the Aerospace, 
Defence & Energy (ADE) and Automotive & General Industrial (AGI) 
businesses. Group margins rose to 17 .3% from 16.6% in the prior 
year. ADE now has a margin of 27 .0% (2012: 26.8%) and AGI has 
improved to 14.7% (2012: 13.4%). These margin improvements 
are largely down to the continuing drive towards a better mix of 
business, notably from increased revenues generated in S
3
P and 
HIP Product Fabrication, and strong cost management. This can 
be seen very clearly when looking at the organic performance of 
the Group on a constant currency basis. Overall organic profit fell 
only £0.4m on £14.8m of organic sales decline. Both ADE and AGI 
saw organic sales declines, the former primarily driven by falling 
oil & gas demand and the latter driven by weak general industrial 
demand. The mix improvement and cost management efforts 
held organic headline operating profit decline in ADE to £0.9m on 
organic sales down £4.5m, while in AGI headline operating profit 
increased by £0.8m notwithstanding a £10.3m drop in organic 
revenues. Acquisitions added £6.7m of headline operating profit.
A key element of the Group’s success in these weak economic 
conditions was its ability to maintain price increases at or above 
cost inflation. In 2013, the business demonstrated its pricing power 
once again with price increases some £1 .6m greater than cost 
increases.
In 2013 headline EPS grew by 10% to 41 .2p while return on capital 
employed grew to 19.9% (2012: 17 .9%). The high quality of the 
Group’s earnings was underscored by the cash performance 
with a headline operating cash flow of £108.9m (2012: £110.8m), 
corresponding to a headline operating cash conversation rate 
of 101%. This was despite a 20% increase in capital spending. 
One of the consequences of Bodycote’s focus on high returns on 
investment and a constant focus on cash generation resulted in the 
Group finishing the year with net cash of £15.0m. This compares to 
£34.2m of net debt at the end of 2012.
04 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2013 23065.02     11 March 2014 1:46 PM     Design Shell
The Group’s priority for the use of cash is firstly to fund organic 
expansion followed by enhancement of the core dividend. 
Acquisitions form the third priority after these first two items. 
Supplemental distributions will only be made if cash generation 
exceeds the immediate needs of the business and such a 
distribution can be undertaken without compromising the Group’s 
acquisition strategy or sacrificing its strong financial position. 
Strategic progress
The Group’s expansion in China continued with one new plant 
coming on stream in 2013. There is strong demand for Bodycote’s 
service offering in China, which is geared towards non-Chinese 
companies targeting the domestic Chinese market. Further facilities 
are currently in the planning stage for the emerging markets.
The market in Brazil remained challenging in 2013 and even though 
20 basis points of the Group’s margin improvement was derived 
from a better operating performance in Brazil, the business has 
yet to reach breakeven. Further progress is expected in 2014 with 
the focus now firmly shifted to sales expansion following the 
restructuring activities of previous years. Any improvement in the 
Brazilian economy in this region should have a significant positive 
impact, as operational gearing is likely to be very high on extra sales 
generated.
The new technologies of S
3
P and HIP Product Fabrication are 
starting to be meaningful contributors to the Group performance. 
Investment in these exciting technologies has been a focus for 
some five years now and they have moved from a virtual standing 
start to adding 40 basis points to the Group’s margins in 2013 
compared to 2012. Significant capacity expansion took place in S
3
P 
during 2012 and 2013 and more expansion will occur in the coming 
year. Meanwhile, extra Giga HIP capacity was brought online at the 
end of 2013 which will further assist the growth in the HIP business 
in 2014.
A significant focus in 2013 was the post-acquisition integration of 
the three businesses acquired in 2012. The integration has been 
virtually seamless and the new businesses together generated 
a 13% return on investment in their first full year of Bodycote 
ownership. No new acquisitions were made during the year. 
The Group continues to be on the lookout for value enhancing 
acquisitions.
Summary and outlook
In 2013 improvements in business mix, plus the full year effect of 
the 2012 acquisitions, enabled Bodycote to achieve good growth 
and strong returns, despite weak markets in the early part of the 
year.
At this early stage in the year and on a constant currency basis, 
the Board expects Bodycote’s growth initiatives to deliver further 
progress in 2014.

Core technologies
Thermal processing
Bodycote provides thermal processing services which improve 
material properties such as strength, durability and corrosion 
resistance, enabling manufacturers’ components to work more 
efficiently with significantly extended operational lifetimes. 
Bodycote’s services consist of a number of core technologies: 
heat treatment and metal joining, hot isostatic pressing (HIP) 
and surface technology.
Heat treatment and metal joining
Heat treatments are controlled processes used to alter the 
microstructure of materials, such as metals and alloys, to impart 
properties which benefit the working life of a component, for 
example: increased surface hardness, temperature resistance, 
ductility and strength. Metal joining includes specialised processes 
such as electron beam welding, vacuum and honeycomb brazing - 
complex operations requiring a fusion of expertise and technology.
Bodycote offers an extensive range of heat treatment services and 
specialist metal joining techniques from facilities around the world. 
With unmatched capacity and computerised systems, Bodycote 
facilities can process a wide range of component sizes to exacting 
standards with reliable, repeatable results.
Hot isostatic pressing (HIP)
HIP combines very high temperature (up to 2,000°C) with inert 
gas under very high pressure (up to 30,000 psi - equivalent to that 
found at an ocean depth of 11,000m such as at the bottom of the 
Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean). HIP can be used to eliminate 
porosity in castings and consolidate encapsulated powders to 
dense materials. Dissimilar materials can be bonded together to 
manufacture unique cost-effective components. Every week a 
typical Bodycote HIP plant will process many tons of titanium, 
aluminium, steel and super-alloy castings, removing porosity and

Markets
Aerospace, Defence & Energy markets
Civil aerospace revenues increased in 2013 by 10% (8% at 
constant exchange rates, of which 5% was organic and 3% from 
acquisitions), due to a combination of new contract gains and 
market demand. Original equipment sales improved as both Boeing 
and Airbus continued to increase production rates. Available seat 
kilometres grew by 5% indicating an increase in aircraft flying 
hours, which in turn drove an increase in demand for aftermarket 
parts.
Sales into the defence sector, which accounted for around 5% of 
Group sales, were weak as the effect of the widespread reduction 
in military budgets took effect. Revenues were 6% lower than in 
2012 (7% at constant exchange rates).
Demand for the Group’s services in the power generation 
sector grew well with sales ahead by 11% in 2013 (9% at 
constant exchange rates, of which 5% was organic and 4% from 
acquisitions) compared to 2012. Additional capability came on 
stream at the end of 2013. The organic growth was driven mainly by 
our European operations. 
Market conditions were markedly different in onshore and subsea 
oil & gas during 2013. The majority of the Group’s revenues in the 
onshore sector are in the USA covering both conventional and 
fracking requirements. Customers for components for fracking 
undertook significant destocking during the year, which resulted 
in sales in North America being down 19% (21% at constant 
exchange rates). Conversely, sales into subsea continued to 
improve so that, in total, revenues to the oil & gas sector were 
lower by 7% (8% at constant exchange rates).
Automotive & General Industrial markets
Car and light truck production showed improvement in most 
territories in 2013. Backed by the Group’s value-added technologies, 
revenues increased year-on-year by 18% (15% at constant 
exchange rates, of which 4% was organic and 11% coming from 
acquisitions completed in 2012). Particularly pleasing was an 
8% increase in sales in Europe (4% at constant exchange rates) 
notwithstanding weak consumer demand.
As anticipated 2013 was a difficult year in heavy truck with very 
weak demand in both North America and Europe for much of the 
year. North American revenues were helped from a low base by the 
acquisitions undertaken in 2012 but overall sales to the sector were 
down 1% (4% at constant exchange rates).
Bodycote provides thermal processing services for a wide range 
of heavy equipment. Cutbacks in capital expenditure in the mining 
sector were a notable drag on demand and requirements for 
agricultural equipment have been subdued. Together these areas 
more than offset some increase in demand for construction 
machinery and rail. With the benefit of currency movements overall 
revenues increased by 2% but fell by 1% at constant exchange rates.

Landing gear
Critical landing gear must perform without fault every time the aircraft flies. The 
nature and position of this critical component requires strength as well as wear 
and corrosion protection to fulfil design requirements. A combination of thermal 
processing techniques is used to ensure the materials’ desired characteristics are 
achieved. Heat treatment is performed to change the properties of the materials 
allowing the parts to endure their harsh punishment. Environmentally friendly 
thermal spray processes such as HVOF have superseded traditional coating 
methods to aid corrosion and wear resistance properties.

Within the Aerospace, Defence & Energy (ADE) business, our 
customers think and operate globally and increasingly expect 
Bodycote to service them in the same way. Consequently, the 
ADE business is organised globally. This gives Bodycote a notable 
advantage as the only thermal processing company with a global 
footprint and knowledge of operating in all of the world’s key 
manufacturing areas. A number of Bodycote’s most important 
customers fall within the compass of ADE and Bodycote intends 
to continue to leverage its unique market position to increase 
revenues in these market sectors. The business incorporates the 
Group’s activities in hot isostatic pressing and surface technology 
as well as the relevant heat treatment services, encompassing  
64 facilities in total.
Results
Revenues for the ADE business were £261 .8m in 2013 compared to 
£258.0m in 2012, an increase of 1 .5% (a 0.5% decline at constant 
exchange rates made up of 1 .8% organic decline and 1 .3% increase 
from acquisitions). Organic revenue reduction in the year reflects, 
on the one hand, a further increase in demand from aerospace 
and industrial gas turbine customers in all geographies and market 
share gains, particularly for subsea oil & gas requirements, but on 
the other very weak demand in North American onshore oil & gas.
Headline operating profit
1
 for ADE was £70.7m (2012: £69.1m). The 
headline operating profit margin improved from 26.8% to 27 .0% as 
a result of a continuing improvement in mix of business.
In 2013, the Group added capacity in a number of aerospace-
focused facilities, including the establishment of a new Surface 
Technology location in Houston, Texas. In the coming year it is 
expected that capital expenditure will again be slightly above 
depreciation as further capacity and capability are added to support 
continuing growth in aerospace demand. 
Net capital expenditure in 2013 was £20.4m (2012: £21 .0m) which 
represents 1 .1 times depreciation (2012: 1 .1 times).
Average capital employed in ADE in 2013 was £235.4m (2012: 
£227 .9m). The small increase is primarily due to investment in new 
capacity to meet continued sales growth in the aerospace markets. 
Return on capital employed in 2013 was 26.1% (2012: 26.1%).
Achievements in 2013
The ADE divisions made further progress during the year in gaining 
new agreements with a range of customers and for a variety of end 
uses. In HIP , new customers, who are key suppliers to the oil majors 
in the subsea oil & gas market, have continued to be added as they 
adopt the Group’s proprietary Product Fabrication (PF) offering.
Organisation and people
Total full-time equivalent headcount at 31 December 2013 was 
1,945 (2012: 2,099), a decrease of 7 .3% compared to revenue 
growth in ADE of 1 .5%. 
Looking ahead
Order books for commercial aerospace OEMs remain strong, 
although aircraft build rates in the higher volume platforms have 
now reached manufacturers’ target levels. There is softness in 
North American onshore oil & gas demand but offtake appears 
to be improving slowly. Defence markets are expected to remain 
weak. Bodycote expects to be able to continue to capitalise on its 
world leading position and once again outperform the market.

Harvester heads
There is nothing more important than keeping harvesters up and running during 
harvest times. Unexpected breakdowns and repairs cost time and money, 
so each component must be reliable and long lasting. Some components in 
contact with abrasive crops require an extremely hard wearing surface and may 
need more than one surface treatment. 
Bodycote’s services help to ensure components do not wear out prematurely. 
Processes such as carburising, carbonitriding, ferritic nitrocarburising, 
marquenching and tempering may all be used to extend the life of harvesting 
components.

Whilst the Automotive & General Industrial (AGI) marketplace 
has many multinational customers which tend to operate on a 
regionally-focused basis, it also has very many medium-sized 
and smaller businesses. Generally, there are more competitors 
to Bodycote in AGI and much of the business is locally oriented, 
meaning that proximity to the customer is very important. 
Bodycote’s uniquely large network of 127 AGI facilities enables 
the business to offer the widest range of technical capability 
and security of supply, continuing to increase the proportion of 
technically differentiated services that it offers. Bodycote has a long 
and successful history of serving this wide-ranging customer base.
Results
AGI business revenues were £357 .8m in 2013, compared to 
£329.8m in 2012, an increase of 8.5% (5.7% at constant exchange 
rates, made up of an organic decline of 3.1% and an increase from 
acquisitions of 8.8%). 
In 2013 sales into car & light truck have been good in all 
geographies with revenues increasing by 3.7% (excluding 
acquisitions and at constant exchange rates). Revenues to heavy 
truck and general industrial markets have been soft in all territories. 
Sales into heavy truck and general industrial sectors decreased 
by 14.6% and 5.5% respectively, excluding acquisitions and at 
constant exchange rates.
North American revenues declined by 10.2% excluding acquisitions 
and at constant exchange rates, driven by the softening in general 
industrial markets. In Europe, revenues declined by 1 .7% (at constant 
exchange rates). In the emerging markets, revenues declined by 
0.8% (at constant exchange rates), with Brazil lower by 8.4% driven 
by weaker demand from general industrial markets, but with Asia 
ahead by 18.7% helped by the Group’s greenfield expansion.
Acquisitions made in 2012 increased revenue and headline operating 
profit in the AGI division by £29.1m and £5.5m respectively.
Headline operating profit
1
 in AGI was £52.7m compared to £44.1m 
in 2012. Headline margin increased to 14.7% (2012: 13.4%) 
reflecting strong cost control, particularly in areas of demand 
weakness and improved mix. Sales of the Group’s high added-value 
services, and especially its S
3
P technology, grew strongly at high 
margins.
Net capital expenditure in 2013 was £34.2m (2012: £23.1m), which 
represents 1 .0 times depreciation (2012: 0.7 times). In 2014 we 
expect that capital expenditure will be just above depreciation 
as we add further capacity in China, Mexico and for selected 
technologies such as S
3
P , Corr-I-Dur
®
 and low pressure carburising. 
Return on capital employed in 2013 was 15.1% (2012: 12.0%). The 
increase reflects continuing focus on improving capital returns by 
increasingly targeting higher added-value activities. On average, 
capital employed in 2013 was £304.2m (2012: £315.5m).
Achievements in 2013
The Group has continued to win business across all geographies. 
In both North America and Europe our ability to support automotive 
manufacturers as they move to newer technologies in pursuit of 
better fuel efficiency has provided Bodycote with market share 
growth. New outsourcing contracts and contributions from 
differentiated technologies such as S
3
P meant that the revenue 
declines stemming from the weak economic environment were 
mitigated and margins improved. 
AGI continued to see the benefits of restructuring and market 
focus. The emphasis on improved efficiency has been a key  
factor in the achievement of margin enhancements in the face of 
declining revenues.
Organisation and people
At 31 December 2013, the number of full-time equivalent 
employees in AGI was 3,614 compared to 3,619 at the end of 2012 
and 1,630 less than its peak in July 2008. AGI revenues of £357 .8m 
compare to £363.3m in 2008 (at 2013 exchange rates), a decrease 
of 1 .5%.
Looking ahead
The AGI businesses will continue to build on their success of 
enhancing their margins through capturing high value work. The 
focus on improving customer service helps drive this effort while 
the prioritisation of existing capacity in favour of higher value work 
and investing in selected technologies such as S
3
P , Corr-I-Dur
®
 and 
low pressure carburising provides additional momentum. In addition 
the Group will continue with its strategy of adding to its existing 
footprint in emerging markets, with an emphasis on China and 
Mexico in the near term.

Group revenue was £619.6m, an increase of 5.4%, of which acquisitions 
accounted for 5.5%, with organic revenues down 2.5% and foreign 
exchange rate movements having a positive impact of 2.4%. 
Headline operating profit for the year increased by 10.2% from 
£97 .5m to £107 .4m and headline operating margin was 17 .3% (2012: 
16.6%). Acquisitions in the prior year increased headline operating 
profit by £6.7m. The impact of foreign currency movements in the 
year was to increase headline operating profit by £3.6m. Despite a 
£14.8m decline in organic revenue, organic headline operating profit 
decreased by only £0.4m.
The amortisation of acquired intangible assets arises from 
acquisitions in prior years and the level of the charge has increased 
to £4.5m (2012: £2.0m) due to the full year impact of the 
acquisitions completed during 2012. 
Operating profit was £102.1m (2012: £93.0m) after charging £4.5m 
(2012: £2.0m) in respect of the amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets and £0.8m (2012: £2.4m) of reorganisation costs. During 
2012 a profit on disposal of the Group’s investment in Ionbond of 
£2.4m and acquisition costs of £2.5m were also recognised.
Headline operating cash flow
1
 for the Group was £108.9m (2012: 
£110.8m). This was 101 .4% of headline operating profit (2012: 
113.6%). Net capital expenditure was 1 .0 times depreciation (2012: 
0.9 times) as the Group continued to focus on increasing the 
utilisation of existing equipment. There was a working capital 
outflow in the year mainly due to a decrease in the level of 
payables and an increase in the level of inventories offset by a small 
decrease in the level of receivables. 
After deducting interest and tax, the Group recorded positive free 
cash flow
2
 of £78.8m (2012: £81 .2m).
Exceptional costs
Total exceptional costs charged to the income statement amounted 
to £0.8m (2012: £2.5m). Redundancy and reorganisation costs of 
£0.8m (2012: £2.4m) have been incurred in relation to the transfer 
of accounting services for our Sweden, Finland and Denmark 
operations to our Shared Service Centre in Prague. There was no 
profit on disposal of investments (2012: £2.4m) and no acquisition 
costs were expensed in the year (2012: £2.5m). 
Restructuring provisions outstanding at 31 December 2013 totalled 
£8.6m. Of the remaining costs, £4.1m is expected to be spent in 2014 
and £4.5m in 2015 and later. All expenditure after the end of 2014 
relates to ongoing environmental remediation, primarily in the USA.
Profit before tax

Finance charge
The net finance charge was £3.7m compared to £3.0m in 2012
3
. 
The increase results primarily from higher average net debt during 
the year due to the cost of acquisitions completed during 2012 and 
a refinancing of the €125m revolving credit facility in 2013 (£0.2m 
due to higher commitment fees and £0.2m from the amortisation 
of upfront fees).

T axation
The tax charge was £25.3m for the year (2012: £22.8m).
The effective tax rate of 25.7% (2012: 25.3%) resulted from the 
blending of differing tax rates in each of the countries in which the 
Group operates.
The headline tax rate for 2013 was 24.7% (2012: 25.6%), 
being stated before accounting for exceptional items, including 
amortisation of goodwill and acquired intangibles, which are 
generally not allowable for tax purposes.
Subject to any future tax legislation changes, and with the Group 
making most of its profits in countries other than the UK, the 
headline tax rate is expected to remain around current levels, being 
higher than the current UK statutory tax rate of 23%, which is due 
to fall to 20% from 2015.
Earnings per share
Basic headline earnings per share (as defined in note 9) increased 
to 41 .2p from 37 .5p. Basic earnings per share for the year increased 
to 38.5p from 35.9p.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 9.1p 
(2012: 8.3p) bringing the total ordinary dividend to 13.5p per share 
(2012: 12.3p). The Board has also recommended a supplemental 
distribution, by way of a special dividend, amounting to 10.0p per 
share. If approved by shareholders, the final ordinary dividend of 
9.1p per share for 2013 and the supplemental distribution of 10.0p 
per share for 2013 will be paid on 2 May 2014 to all shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 11 April 2014.
Capital structure
The Group’s balance sheet at 31 December 2013 is summarised 
below:
Assets 
£m
Liabilities 
£m
Net Assets 
£m
Property, plant and 
equipment 444.6 – 444.6

assets 167 .9 – 167 .9

and liabilities 3.4 (13.1) (9.7)
Retirement benefit 
obligations – (18.5) (18.5)
Deferred tax 29.4 (61 .6) (32.2)
Total before net cash 791 .7 (259.3) 532.4
Net cash 16.9 (1 .9) 15.0
Net assets as at  
31 December 2013 808.6 (261.2) 547 .4
Net assets as at  
31 December 2012 
(restated) 792.8 (288.7) 504.1
Net assets increased by £43.3m (8.6%) to £547 .4m (2012
3
: 
£504.1m). At constant exchange rates, net assets increased by 
£42.5m (8.4%). The major movements compared to 31 December 
2012 were a reduction in net debt of £49.2m, together with an 
increase in net deferred tax liabilities
3
 of £9.3m and a decrease in 
property, plant and equipment of £4.1m. 
The decrease in property, plant and equipment was due to additions 
of £57 .3m offset by depreciation of £51 .9m, asset impairments of 
£5.1m and foreign exchange variances.
Net deferred tax liabilities
3
 increased by £9.3m due to the inclusion 
of deferred tax liabilities attributed to the 2012 acquisitions, 
timing differences on depreciation and local provisions and a 
reduction in deferred tax assets following the utilisation of tax 
losses. Restructuring provisions were reduced by £2.9m, as Group 
restructuring activities proceeded as planned.
Retirement benefit obligations
3
 decreased by £0.5m during the 
year, largely as a result of benefit payments made from the scheme 
offsetting the increase in liabilities generated from accrued interest, 
in addition to the effect of the change in RPI to 3.4% (2012: 3.1%).
Net cash/(debt)
Group net cash at 31 December 2013 was £15.0m (2012: net debt 
£34.2m). During the year, loans of £33.9m drawn under committed 
facilities were repaid. The Group continues to have access to 
committed facilities at competitive rates and therefore currently 
deems this to be the most effective means of funding.

Finance Director’s report continued
Cash flow
The net increase in cash and cash equivalents was £13.7m (2012: 
decrease of £7 .6m), made up of net cash from operating activities 
of £139.4m (2012: £131 .2m), less investing activities of £58.2m 
(2012: £130.6m) and less cash used in financing activities of £67 .5m 
(2012: £8.2m).
The increase in net cash flow from operating activities from 
£131 .2m to £139.4m was driven primarily by the increase in 
headline EBITDA
4
 from £152.7m to £168.9m. Working capital 
increased in line with levels of activity. Net current tax liabilities 
decreased by £2.5m, mainly due to the timing of tax payments 
made compared to the previous year. The continuing utilisation 
of environmental and restructuring provisions resulted in a cash 
outflow of £2.4m. 
Net cash outflows from investing activities decreased from 
£130.6m to £58.2m, primarily as a result of no acquisitions being 
completed in 2013 compared to the prior year. The level of net 
capital expenditure in 2013 was £57 .3m (2012: £47 .7m), consistent 
with plans to maintain and improve the capacity and capability of 
the Group, whilst keeping expenditure levels close to depreciation. 
Net cash outflows used in financing activities increased from £8.2m 
to £67 .5m. 2013 saw the repayment of loans of £36.6m (2012: 
£2.3m) and new bank loans raised of £nil (2012: £28.8m), together 
with payment of dividends totalling £24.0m (2012: £21 .3m).
There has been a continued focus on cash collection, although 
receivable days at 31 December 2013 increased by one to 59 days 
(2012: 58 days).
Net interest payments for the year were £3.3m (2012: £2.5m). Tax 
payments were £22.5m (2012: £19.3m) reflecting the increase in 
Group profits.
Capital expenditure
Net capital expenditure (capital expenditure less proceeds from 
asset disposals) for the year was £57 .3m (2012: £47 .7m). The 
multiple of net capital expenditure to depreciation was 1 .0 times 
(2012: 0.9 times), which reflects the Group’s continued careful 
management of its capital expenditure programme. Major capital 
projects that were in progress during 2013 included installation of 
new Giga HIP capacity in Camas, Washington, expansion of our 
production facilities in Silao, Mexico, completion of the Jinan facility 
in China, and expansion of our vacuum furnace capacity in Holland, 
Michigan and Derby, UK. The Group also continued to invest in the 
implementation of a new ERP system.
Borrowing facilities
Total funding available to the Group under its committed facilities 
at 31 December 2013 was £229.0m (2012: £226.4m), expiring 
between August 2016 and March 2018, as well as access to a 
US$10m committed letter of credit facility maturing in August 2016.
The €125m revolving credit facility was refinanced for a further five 
years in February 2013 at a higher margin than the 2006 arranged 
facility it replaced.
At 31 December 2013, the Group had the following committed

Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group 
will be able to continue as going concerns, while maximising the 
return to shareholders. The capital structure of the Group consists 
of debt, which includes borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, 
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising 
capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The capital structure is reviewed regularly by the Board. The Group’s 
policy is to maintain gearing, determined as the proportion of net 
debt to total capital, within defined parameters, allowing movement 
in the capital structure appropriate to the business cycle and 
corporate activity. Due to the net cash position at 31 December 
2013 the gearing ratio has fallen to 0% (2012: 7%).
Defined benefit pension arrangements
The Group has defined benefit pension obligations in the UK, 
Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and USA and cash lump sum 
obligations in France, Italy and Turkey, the liabilities for which are 
reflected in the Group balance sheet.
The net deficits in these arrangements are as follows:

22 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2013 23065.02     11 March 2014 1:46 PM     Design Shell
The UK plan is closed to new entrants but the 87 active members 
continue to accrue benefits. The arrangements in France, Italy and 
Turkey are open to new members. All other arrangements are 
closed to new entrants.
UK Scheme liabilities remained broadly unchanged over the year 
(2012: £85.6m, 2013: £85.7m). The actuarial assumptions used 
to assess the present value of the liabilities are unchanged from 
2012, with the exception of the RPI inflation assumption which has 
increased from 3.1% in 2012 to 3.4% in 2013. Although this and 
the interest accrued over the year marginally increased the value of 
the liabilities, this increase was largely offset by benefit payments 
made from the scheme.
Assets have decreased over the period from £81 .4m to £80.9m, 
leading to a deficit of £4.8m as at 31 December 2013. 
The liability for unfunded Western European schemes reduced 
by £1 .0m, primarily in Germany. The key reason for the decrease 
in the deficit in the Western European schemes is an increase in 
corporate bonds yields and the impact of the settlement of certain 
liabilities.
For the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group is required to 
adopt IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee Benefits’. 
IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee Benefits’ and the related consequential 
amendments have impacted the accounting for the Group’s defined 
benefit scheme by:
  reclassifying pension scheme administration costs from finance 
costs to operating costs in the income statement;
  replacing the interest cost and expected return on plan assets 
with a net interest charge on the net defined benefit liability; and
  charging past service costs immediately to the income statement 
as incurred. 
As a result of this change in accounting policy the comparative 
amounts have been restated as follows:

Going concern
In determining the basis of preparation for the Annual Report, the 
directors have considered the Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance 
and position. This includes an overview of the Group’s financial 
position, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities.
The Group meets its working capital requirements through a 
combination of cash resources, committed and uncommitted 
facilities and overdrafts. The overdrafts and uncommitted facilities 
are repayable on demand but the committed facilities are due 
for renewal as set out below. There is sufficient headroom in the 
committed facility covenants to assume that these facilities can be 
operated as contracted for the foreseeable future.
Committed facilities as at 31 December 2013 were as follows:
  £125m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 31 August 2016
  €125m Revolving Credit Facility maturing 1 March 2018
  $10m Letter of Credit Facility maturing 31 August 2016
On 18 February 2013, the €125m Revolving Credit Facility was 
refinanced for the same amount, extending the maturity to 1 March 
2018. The December 2013 weighted average life of the committed 
facilities was 3.3 years.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable 
potential changes in trading performance, show that the Group 
should be able to operate within the level of its current committed 
facilities.
The directors have reviewed forecasts and projections for the 
Group’s markets and services, assessing the committed facility and 
financial covenant headroom, central liquidity and the Group’s ability 
to access further funding. The directors also reviewed downside 
sensitivity analysis over the forecast period, thereby taking into 
account the uncertainties arising from the current economic 
environment. Following this review, the directors have formed a 
judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason the directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Effective management of risks is essential to the delivery of the Group’s objective of creating superior shareholder returns. The Board 
is responsible for the Group’s risk management and the review of financial risk has been delegated to the Audit Committee. Under the 
leadership of the Group Head of Risk, Bodycote has developed the risk management framework to identify, report and manage its business 
critical risks. The Risk Committee, established in 2012, continued to meet during the year attended by senior managers from each of the 
operating divisions. The role of the Risk Committee is to embed risk management and facilitate the implementation of risk management 
measures throughout the Group. 
A variety of approaches are used to identify and report risks, which are aggregated first at a sub-divisional level and then at Group level. For 
each business critical risk, assurance activities have been documented in risk assurance maps and this is used to direct assurance activity. 
The Group Head of Risk provides an update to the Audit Committee on the Group’s risk activities at every meeting and a comprehensive 
review of the Group’s business critical risks is presented in December. In addition, the Board examines a specific risk topic at each Board 
meeting.
The table below highlights the major risks that may affect Bodycote’s ability to deliver the strategy, as laid out on page 7 . Details of the 
Group’s financial risks (funding, foreign exchange, interest rate and counterparty risks), which are managed by the Group’s treasury function 
are provided in note 18 to the financial statements. The mitigating activities described below will help to reduce the impact or likelihood of 
the major risk occurring, although the Board recognises that it will not be possible to eliminate these risks entirely. Furthermore, there could 
be risks that may be unknown or that may be judged to be insignificant at present, but may later prove to be significant. For this reason 
business continuity plans have been prepared for all plants to provide for situations where specific risks have the potential to severely 
impact the business.
Risk Description and Impact Mitigation
Market and Customer Risks 
Markets
Bodycote’s exposure to macroeconomic performance means that it suffers 
from a certain level of sales volatility. A substantial proportion of Bodycote’s 
sales are closely linked to the economic cycle. Sales in the markets served 
by the AGI businesses (64% of the total Group) tend mainly to develop in line 
with or ahead of the economic cycle, whereas ADE sales (36%) tend to track 
behind the economic cycle. Sales can also be impacted by energy prices which 
in turn can be affected by general economic activity. The high proportion of 
fixed costs in the business means that a drop in sales may have a significant 
impact on profitability. However Bodycote’s presence in 26 countries in a wide 
variety of end-markets acts as a natural hedge to neutralise localised economic 
volatility. Nevertheless, the Board is mindful of the potential impact on demand 
for the Group’s services.
  Implement strategic plan with medium-term objective of “above-
market” sales growth, a focus on targeted premium growth 
business segments and a more balanced geographic spread.
  Maintain flexibility of cost base for example, by ensuring that a 
proportion of the workforce is employed on temporary contracts.
  Respond quickly to changes in customer demand on a local or a 
Group-wide level.
  Wide geographical and market sector spread of Group sales.
Loss of key customers
Bodycote benefits from many long-term relationships with key customers. 
Damage to, or loss of, any of these relationships would be detrimental to 
Group results and could affect the viability of one or more of Bodycote’s 
facilities. However, the Board believes this is unlikely as Bodycote strives 
to provide a high level of customer service and the Group’s network of 
strategically located facilities ensures that it is the supplier of choice to 
these major manufacturers. Furthermore there is no significant customer 
dependency, with the Group’s top ten customers accounting for less than  
13% of sales and the balance made up by many thousands of customers.
  Continued focus on customer service and quality processes to 
maintain excellent relationships with major customers. Use key 
account management to monitor customer satisfaction with the 
Group’s service levels.
  Ensure there is no significant customer dependency.
Corporate and Community Risks
Human resources
Bodycote is reliant on its ability to attract, develop and retain staff of the right 
calibre to support its growth strategy. Competition for capable resources 
is high and there is a risk that Bodycote may not be able to attract or retain 
skilled individuals. As a market leader Bodycote is seen as a source of talent by 
competitors, while the Group competes with employers from a wide range of 
sectors to attract staff into the business. 
  Continue the implementation of the HR strategy to address the 
long-term development and retention of staff.
  Develop succession plans.
  Ensure performance management processes are properly 
implemented and used effectively.

Risk Description and Impact Mitigation
Corporate and Community Risks (continued)
Safety and health
Bodycote is committed to providing a safe work environment for its 
employees. The nature of Bodycote’s activities presents safety and health risks 
which can have a significant impact on individual employees. Furthermore 
poor safety and health practices could lead to disruption of business, financial 
penalties and loss of reputation.
  Group-wide health and safety policies set by the Chief Executive. 
  Bodycote SHE management system standard, being implemented 
based on OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 .
  Programme in place to focus on reduction of incidents which could 
have a high impact. 
  Safety compliance audits at all plants at least every two years. 
  Oversight of safety and health framework provided by the Group SHE 
Committee.
Environment
Bodycote is committed to providing the highest level of protection to the 
environment. Environmental contamination could lead to health risks, 
disruption of business, financial costs and loss of reputation. 
Historical use of chlorinated solvents and other hazardous chemicals by plants 
operated by Bodycote or by plants acquired by Bodycote could have led to 
ground contamination. The environmental regulations in many of the jurisdictions 
in which Bodycote operates impose actual or potential obligations on Bodycote 
to remediate contaminated sites. Bodycote incurs costs annually (2013: £1 .6m) 
in meeting its obligations and has a provision of £13.2m at 31 December 2013 
in respect of required environmental remediation costs. If the provision is 
insufficient to meet the cost of remediation, then this could have an impact on 
the Group’s results. Some of the Group’s heat treatment plants continue to use 
chlorinated solvents and hazardous chemicals in small quantities.
  Remediation of contaminated sites as required by local legislation.
  Reduction in the use of hazardous substances, such as chlorinated 
solvents.
  Environmental procedures and measures in place conforming to  
ISO 14001 (2013: 85% of plants).
  Environmental due diligence of businesses for acquisition.
Operational Risks
Service quality
The Bodycote brand is reliant on the repeatable delivery of parts to agreed 
specification to an agreed time. Deterioration in quality or service levels could 
cause serious long-term damage to Bodycote’s reputation with financial 
consequences such as the loss of a customer and the cost of damages or 
litigation. Work that is released into use which is not in compliance with 
specification could arise as a result of system or human failure. Bodycote has 
stringent quality systems in place managed by qualified staff. Where necessary, 
plants have relevant accreditations such as ISO 9001, Nadcap and TS 16949. 
  Maintain industry relevant accreditations.
  Quality systems and processes operated at plant level, supervised 
by divisional quality teams. 
  All plants subjected to internal and external quality audits and 
inspections at least once a year.
Major disruption at a facility
Bodycote’s business processes have inherent risks and there is a possibility 
that a major fire or utility outage could lead to closure of a facility’s operation. 
In addition a number of sites are exposed to natural hazards, such as 
earthquakes, flooding and storms. As a result there is a possibility that service 
to Bodycote’s customers from the affected site could be disrupted. However 
Bodycote’s global network of over 190 plants creates a framework to provide 
backup capability for any affected facility.
  OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 compliant SHE management systems  
being used by Group Head of Safety, Health and Environment with 
support of divisional safety and health teams.
  Programmed equipment maintenance and inspections. 
  Independent insurer inspections to assess hazard and business 
interruption risks. 
  Business continuity plans developed for all plants.  
Information technology systems
The efficient operation of the Group will rely increasingly on the proper 
development and operation of its IT systems. Bodycote is currently undergoing 
a Group-wide implementation of a new ERP system. The impact of the 
re-engineered business process will have significant long-term benefits 
on Bodycote’s operational effectiveness. However, failure to manage the 
implementation programme successfully could result in cost overruns and 
potentially, disruption to the business.
  Defined disaster recovery planning and data backup procedures.
  Project approval and progress subject to Board review.
  Project teams made up of skilled subject matter experts 
supplemented with third party advisers. 
  Best practice project management processes in place with 
assurance provided by third parties.
Regulatory Risks
Regulatory and legislative compliance
The global nature of Bodycote’s operations means that the Group has to comply 
with a wide range of local and international legislative requirements, including 
anti-bribery and anti-competition legislation, taxation legislation, employment law 
and import and export controls. Failure to comply with legislation could lead to 
substantial financial penalties, disruption to business, diversion of management 
time, personal and corporate liability and loss of reputation.
  Establish business processes supported by HR policies and the 
Group Code of Conduct. 
  The “Open Door Line” whistleblower facility which is managed by a 
third party.
  Training and awareness programmes.
  Engagement of local specialists to support Bodycote at local, 
divisional and Group level.
  Regular audit of the effectiveness of implemented procedures.

Our approach
Bodycote’s objective is to create superior shareholder returns 
through the provision of selected thermal processing services that 
are highly valued by our customers and to achieve this in a safe 
working environment, while continually seeking to minimise the 
impact on the environment.
Bodycote is dedicated to improving the management of corporate 
responsibility issues and is implementing policies and initiatives to 
achieve this goal. The future success and growth of the Group is 
intrinsically linked to our ability to ensure the Group’s operations are 
sustainable and that we can nurture and develop our talent.
Our people
The strength of the Group primarily rests in its people and one 
of the key challenges for management is to ensure availability of 
appropriately qualified people to support its continued growth. 
Bodycote is fortunate to have a competent and committed 
international team that is well-respected in technical and  
business circles. 
Bodycote invests in the training and development of its people both 
at local and Group level. At a local level the Company is committed 
to providing the appropriate skills and technical training which will 
allow its employees to operate effectively and safely in their roles 
and deliver excellent customer service. At Group level a number  
of initiatives are currently being rolled out to drive excellence  
in management.
A tool to develop further understanding and skill in the area of 
performance management is in place and is being used globally 
through the management population. Through communication of 
clear messages coupled with skills development, the organisation 
aims to raise the capability of its management population in 
driving performance. This initiative is backed by a performance 
management IS system which supports the process.
Bodycote’s employment policies are non-discriminatory, complying 
with all current legislation to engender equal opportunity 
irrespective of race, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation or 
nationality. Harassment is not tolerated.
Female representation on our Board is currently 17% (2012: 14%) 
and at manager level it is 23% (2012: 23%). We will increase female 
representation on the Board if appropriate candidates are available 
when Board vacancies arise. Females represent 17% (2012: 16%) 
of our total workforce.
Core values
It is not just important what we do but how we do it and how 
we behave in our company. How we operate as a Group and the 
behaviours that we expect from all our employees are expressed in 
our core values. Our values represent Bodycote and its people and 
our commitment to the company and the business.
Our core values are straightforward and are summarised as follows: 
Honesty and T ransparency
We are honest and act with integrity. This is not something we take 
for granted. Bodycote lives by a culture of honest and transparent 
behaviour, which is at the core of all our business relationships.
Respect and Responsibility
We manage our business with respect, applying an ethical approach 
to our dealings with those we interact with. We believe in taking 
ownership and being mindful of the impact of our actions.
Creating V alue
Creating value is the very essence of our business and needs to be 
the focus of our endeavours. We create value for our customers, 
our employees and our shareholders.

Human rights
Bodycote’s human rights policy is consistent with the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Global Compact’s ten 
principles.
We prohibit forced, compulsory and underage labour and any form 
of discrimination based on race, gender, religion, age, disability or 
political affiliation. Appropriate mechanisms are in place to support 
any contraventions of these rules.
Customers and suppliers
Bodycote has no significant suppliers who are wholly dependent 
upon the Group’s business. Suppliers are paid in line with 
contractual and legal obligations.
We endeavour to respond quickly to changing customer demand, 
to identify emerging needs and to improve service availability and 
quality. We stay close to our current and potential customers, 
building long-term relationships.
Bodycote seeks to play a positive role in the local communities in 
which it operates by providing employment opportunities, building 
goodwill and a reputation as a good neighbour and employer.
Responsible business ethics
All Bodycote personnel are expected to apply a high ethical 
standard, consistent with an international UK-listed company. 
Directors and employees are expected to ensure that their personal 
interests do not at any time conflict with those of Bodycote. 
Shareholder employees are advised of and comply with share 
dealing codes.
Bodycote has systems in place designed to ensure compliance with 
all applicable laws and regulations and conformity with all relevant 
codes of business practice. Further, Bodycote does not make 
political donations.
With regard to competition, Bodycote aims to win business in a 
differentiated high-value manner. The Group does not employ unfair 
trading methods and it competes vigorously but fairly within the 
requirements of the applicable laws. Employees are prohibited from 
either giving or receiving any inducements.
Our Open Door Policy has been translated into all languages used 
throughout the Group. The policy allows employees to report their 
concern verbally or in writing and in confidence to an independent 
third party provider to ensure anonymity. Reports are transcribed 
and sent to the Group Head of Risk, who then passes the matter to 
the appropriate individual in the business to be addressed.
Bribery and Competition Law online training courses have been 
put in place, translated into the major languages used throughout 
the Group, and relevant employees have completed the interactive 
courses. 
Operational SHE performance
Bodycote is committed to building and maintaining a high reliability 
organisation; one that delivers consistently high performance 
across all aspects of safety, health and environmental (SHE) 
management. Its objective is to be known for the excellence of 
its SHE performance in all of its business activities and at all of its 
sites.
Safety and health
The nature of the Group’s operations is such that employees are 
regularly exposed to hazards in the workplace. Bodycote aims to 
manage these hazards and thereby minimise risks to employees 
through the deployment of a robust safety management system 
which includes appropriate policies and procedures.
Although Bodycote has reported a reduction in accident rate over 
recent years, a review of operational activities and processes 
towards the end of 2011 suggested a high likelihood of under-
reporting due to a number of factors. A three-year global 
improvement strategy began in 2012, and one aspect of this was 
to address the incident reporting and investigation processes. 
Although regrettable and not acceptable, accidents represent 
learning opportunities, and so accurate reporting is an essential part 
of building a robust safety management system.
A number of specific actions were taken to encourage the 
reporting of incidents, including the introduction in 2013 of a new 
global incident reporting system and a common near-miss/unsafe 
condition reporting system at every operational site. As a result, the 
number of near-misses and unsafe conditions reported at the end 
of 2013 was over three thousand, compared with just 58 at the end 
of 2011 .
The reported number of accidents leading to lost time has also 
shown an increase, from 1 .5 (per 200,000 hours worked) in 2012 
to 1 .9 (per 200,000 hours worked) in 2013. Whilst it cannot be 
proven that this increase is due to better reporting, it is highly 
likely that this is the principal reason, given the emphasis that has 
been placed on incident reporting and the simultaneous safety 
improvement activities.
Environment
A proactive approach to improving energy efficiency means that 
Bodycote has implemented a variety of systems to reduce water 
and gas consumption and re-use energy. The continuing focus on 
lessening its impact on the environment has resulted in Bodycote 
seeking accreditation to ISO 14001 at all of its facilities.
At every stage where Bodycote is involved in the manufacturing 
cycle, our operational aim is to reduce the overall impact on the 
environment, not just in our own operations, but also those of our 
customers. Bodycote operates modern, efficient equipment, which 
is operated around the clock so as to optimise thermal processing 
cycles. Without Bodycote, many companies would be using older 
in-house technology and running their equipment at reduced 
capacity, both of which are a drain on energy resources. Working 
with Bodycote enables our customers to commit more easily to 
carbon reduction initiatives.
Bodycote also reduces the carbon footprint of its customers’ 
activities by increasing the lifespan of their products, by improving 
metallurgical properties and by enhancing corrosion resistance. 
For example, surface treatment technology is widely used in the 
reclamation of damaged and worn components, offering a cost-
effective and energy-efficient alternative to the need to manufacture 
new replacement parts, and treated parts often last up to twenty 
times longer than the original.
So, whilst thermal processing is an energy-intensive business, it is 
a vital part of the manufacturing chain and its use saves the energy 
it consumes many times over.

Greenhouse gas emissions
Scope 1 emissions in the year amounted to 154,069 tCO
2
e (2012: 
143,576 tCO
2
e). The intensity ratio
1
 amounted to 248.7 (2012: 
244.3). Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions resulting from fuel 
usage and the operation of facilities. 
Scope 2 emissions in the year amounted to 219,912 tCO
2
e (2012: 
211,123 tCO
2
e). The intensity ratio
1
 amounted to 354.9 (2012: 
359.1). Scope 2 emissions are indirect energy emissions resulting 
from purchased electricity, heat, steam or cooling for own use.
The sum of both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in the year 
amounted to 373,981 tCO
2
e (2012: 354,699 tCO
2
e). The combined 
intensity ratio
1
 amounted to 603.6 (2012: 603.4).
The financial control consolidation approach has been used to 
report the above data. This method aligns with the reporting scope 
in the financial statements. 
The Group collects electricity and natural gas usage information 
from each facility on a monthly basis. The Group then applies 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 
published national carbon conversion factors to calculate the total 
tonnage of CO
2
e produced.
Group operational management actively monitors their monthly 
CO
2
e emissions reported and the Group’s Executive Committee 
reviews the level of CO
2
e emissions on a monthly basis.
All entities and facilities under financial control are included within 
the disclosure. Emissions <1% of the Group’s total CO
2
e relating 
to fugitive emissions and owned vehicles are not material and 
are excluded. As such there are no material omissions from this 
disclosure.
KPI – ISO 14001 accredited facilities
Reducing the environmental impact of the Group’s activities is 
taken very seriously. Compliance with the requirements of ISO 
14001 helps to minimise the risk of adverse environmental effects 
at Bodycote’s locations. At the end of 2013, 85% of our operating 
facilities had achieved ISO 14001 accreditation. Operational plants 
which have not yet received accreditation to the standard are 
working towards it, including several of the facilities acquired 
in 2012 and 2013. The fall in percentage in 2012 was due to the 
facilities acquired in 2012 which had not obtained accreditation. 
A number of the acquired plants have obtained the ISO 14001 
accreditation during the year.
Carbon footprint and water consumption
The absolute energy usage increased by 5%, in line with the 
increase in sales.
When normalised, the total CO
2
e emissions per £m sales in 2013 
were 603.6 Te, unchanged from 2012. However, factors affecting 
this normalised value are the effect of foreign exchange rates and 
acquisitions. If these are ignored, then the normalised value for 
carbon emissions shows a reduction of 6%.
The Group’s total CO
2
 emission data is based on Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions, as defined by the UK Government’s DEFRA, 
and data relating to this has been calculated to include country-
specific electricity conversion factors.
Water usage per £m sales decreased by 7%. 
Chlorinated solvent use
The use of chlorinated solvents in Bodycote’s thermal processing 
activities has been reduced in recent years as aqueous degreasing 
facilities have been introduced. In 2013 the overall solvent use 
decreased by 13% compared with the previous year.
A greener, cleaner environment
Reducing any detrimental impact on the environment has become 
a growing focus of industry worldwide and Bodycote can assist 
with the drive towards carbon reduction and environmentally 
friendly approaches in a number of ways. For example, certain heat 
treatment and thermally sprayed surface treatments are leading 
the way in the replacement of older, less environmentally friendly 
processes such as chrome plating.
Future restrictions that will be placed on chrome plating due to 
health and environmental issues have led many businesses, 
including the major aerospace companies, to embark on initiatives 
to replace it. These companies have highlighted thermal spray 
coatings as the preferred replacement for chrome plating.
Bodycote has been involved in a number of initiatives to replace 
chrome plate and results have shown that, in addition to the 
environmental benefits, thermally sprayed tungsten carbide 
outperforms hard chrome plate for both wear and corrosion 
protection.
Modern thermal processing techniques have allowed designers and 
manufacturers to use much lighter materials, such as aluminium 
and titanium, and have significantly prolonged component lifetimes. 
Through the effective use of thermal processing, parts can now be 
lighter and overall component weight reduced, leading to improved 
efficiency and reduced fuel consumption of products in service.
Cautionary statement

Corporate governance statement
Chairman’s message
As Chairman I have taken a leading role in supporting the governance agenda and upholding good principles of corporate behaviour at 
Bodycote recognising that good governance serves to ensure that the business is run to achieve growth on a controlled and ongoing basis. 
There have been various changes during the year to the narrative and remuneration reporting regulations. The Board has reviewed and 
discussed the impact of these new regulations and has implemented them where appropriate. The important governance developments at 
Bodycote over the last year are detailed in Governance reporting below.
We have made a number of improvements in Board processes and will continue to do so in the coming year. During Q3 of 2014 we will 
update our review of the Group’s strategy, capitalising on the work performed in September 2013.
The policy of the Board is to manage the affairs of the Company in accordance with the principles of corporate governance contained in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code by promoting wide discussions on topics to which Board members contribute and demonstrate mutual 
engagement. We strive to maintain best practice and continually seek to improve our practices for the benefit of our shareholders.
I also wish to invite all shareholders to attend the AGM, which will be held at our Macclesfield head office on the 29 April 2014. This event 
provides an excellent opportunity to meet the Executive and independent Non-Executive Directors.

Board diversity
Bodycote is a global business with operations in 26 countries and diversity is an integral part of how we do business. The Nomination 
Committee considers diversity when making appointments to the Board, taking into account relevant skills, experience, knowledge, 
personality, ethnicity and gender. Our prime responsibility, however, is the strength of the Board and our overriding aim in any new 
appointment must always be to select the best candidate. We have made progress in addressing the issue of Board gender and diversity 
by appointing Eva Lindqvist to the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 1 June 2012. We will further address this issue when we discuss 
Board Succession Planning in the coming year. The Board is kept deliberately small and currently comprises two Executive Directors and 
three Non-Executive Directors and a Non-Executive Chairman. We believe it is difficult to set targets or timescales for the percentage of 
women, or any other group, on our Board and do not propose to set a target for the percentage of women on our Board. 
Female representation on our Board is currently 17% and at manager level it is 23%. We will increase female representation on the Board if 
appropriate candidates are available when Board vacancies arise. Females represent 17% of our total workforce.
The Corporate responsibility and sustainability section on page 28 contains further details of the male and female representation within the 
Group, including Board representation. 
Board evaluation
Following 2012’s external Board Evaluation, the Board agreed to undertake an internal evaluation in 2013.
To ensure that all aspects of good governance would be covered by the review the Company Secretary distributed to each member a 
tailored questionnaire. Questions were framed under the following seven headings:
  Remit and objectives;
  Composition, training and resources;
  Corporate governance / risk management;
  Stakeholder engagement;
  Board meetings and visits;
  Board procedures and administration; and
  Evaluation and effectiveness.

At a meeting of the Nominations Committee in October 2013, the directors assessed the conclusions reached and a number of 
recommendations are now in the process of being implemented. Additional emphasis will be placed on risk management and certain 
operational matters. The Board evaluation covered the activities of the main Board and each of its Committees.
As in previous years, the Chairman has assessed the performance of each Board member by conducting individual interviews and we can 
confirm that all directors continue to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment to their roles.
The overall conclusion is that the Board is performing well and high governance standards have been adopted. It was apparent that the 
Executive is strongly challenged when appropriate. The Board is satisfied with the Chairman’s commitment and performance.
Arising from the exercise, the Board has concluded that its focus should remain on divisional growth strategies, technology development, 
risk and sustainability as well as continued training.
The Executive Directors Messrs S.C. Harris and D.F . Landless were also appraised in February 2014. 
Led by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, the Directors have carried out an evaluation of the Chairman’s performance in 
October 2013. 
T raining
All new directors are subject to a tailored induction programme covering a diverse range of topics including trading assessment methods, 
investor relations, organisational and legal matters. The Board receives training via ad hoc presentations and papers from advisers and 
the Company Secretary. External periodic training on important topics takes place through the Deloitte Academy and during the year the 
directors received training on trends in financial reporting, corporate governance, remuneration reporting and cyber crime.
Succession planning
Succession planning ensures that appropriate senior leadership resources are in place to achieve Bodycote’s strategic objectives. The plans 
are reviewed annually by the Nomination Committee.
The Board further develops its knowledge and gains greater visibility of executive talent and management succession by visiting the 
Group’s sites and meeting with key talent and senior executives.
The road map for Non-Executive refreshment was reviewed by the Nomination Committee at the December 2013 meeting.

 Tenure in years
Non-Executive T enure
As a number of our Non-Executive Directors have a tenure of 6 years or more, it is planned to refresh the Board gradually over the next  
three years.
Compliance reporting
In respect of the financial year 2013 Bodycote’s obligation under the Disclosure and Transparency Rules is to prepare a corporate 
governance statement with reference to The UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the FRC in September 2012 (the ‘Code’).
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2013 Bodycote has complied with the provisions of the Code with the exception of provision 
E1 .1 . As in previous years, the Board has taken the view that generally it is the responsibility of the Chief Executive and the Finance Director 
to manage relationships with institutional investors. The Chairman also meets institutional investors to discuss overall strategy, governance 
and any concerns that shareholders may have. Only where these more usual channels of communication have failed would the Board 
expect the Senior Independent or other Non-Executive Directors to become involved, notwithstanding that the Code specifies attendance 
of the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SID) at meetings with major shareholders. During the year the SID contacted major 
shareholders and offered to facilitate meetings with them should they have any concerns they wished to discuss. To date, no meetings have 
been requested. Regular feedback by the Company’s advisers on investor meetings and results presentations is circulated to all directors.
Apart from this distinct area, Bodycote was in compliance with the provisions of the Code throughout 2013.

The Board is responsible to shareholders for good corporate governance, setting the Company’s strategic objectives, values and standards 
and ensuring the necessary resources are in place to achieve the objectives.
The Board met on nine occasions during 2013, including a specific meeting to review and update the Company’s long-term strategy. 
The Board of Directors comprises six members, of whom four are Non-Executive Directors and two are Executive Directors, led by the 
Company’s part-time Non-Executive Chairman, Mr. A.M. Thomson, who also chairs the Nomination Committee. The Chief Executive is  
Mr. S.C. Harris and the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director (SID) is Mr. J.A. Biles, who also chairs the Audit Committee. 
Ms E. Lindqvist is Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. Brief biographical details of all Directors are given on pages 32 and 33. During 
the year the Board made regular visits to UK and overseas facilities. In particular sites in Austria and Liechtenstein were visited. Such events 
involved meetings with local management and the unit work force to better understand technical and operational performance in countries 
where Bodycote has a significant presence.
Matters reserved for the Board were reviewed during the year and updated broadly based on the guidance of the Institute of Chartered 
Secretaries and Administrators issued in July 2013. Certain defined powers and issues reserved for the Board to decide, are inter alia:
  Strategy;
  Approval of financial statements and circulars;
  Capital projects, acquisitions and disposals;
  Annual budgets;
  Directors’ appointments, service agreements, remuneration and succession planning;
  Policies for financial statements, treasury, safety, health and environment, donations;
  Committees’ terms of reference;
  Board and committee chairmen and membership;
  Investments;
  Equity and bank financing;
  Internal control and risk management;
  Corporate governance;
  Key external and internal appointments; and
  Employee share incentives and pension arrangements.
In advance of Board meetings, directors are supplied with up-to-date information regarding the trading performance of each operating 
division and sub-division, the Group’s overall financial position and its achievement against prior year, budgets and forecasts. They are also 
supplied with the latest available information on safety, health and environmental and risk management issues and details of the safety and 
health performance of the Group, and each division, in terms of severity and frequency rates for accidents at work. Senior management 
from across the Group and advisers attend some of the meetings to provide updates. The exposure to members of senior management 
from across the businesses helps enhance the Board’s understanding of the business, the implementation of strategy and the changing 
dynamics of the markets in which we operate.
Where required, a director may seek independent professional advice, the cost of which is reimbursed by the Company. All directors have 
access to the Company Secretary and they may also address specific issues to the SID. In accordance with the Articles of Association, all 
newly appointed directors and any who have not stood for re-election at the two previous Annual General Meetings, if eligible, must submit 
themselves for re-election. However, this has been superseded by the directors’ decision to stand for yearly re-election. Non-Executive 
Directors, including the Chairman, are appointed for fixed terms not exceeding three years from the date of first election by shareholders, 
after which the appointment may be extended by mutual agreement. A statement of the directors’ responsibilities is set out on page 62. 
The Board also operates three committees. These are the Nomination Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee.
In accordance with the recommendations of the Code, Board members serve for a period of six years which will only be extended in certain 
circumstances. If letters of appointment are extended beyond six years, the fixed term is reduced to one year.

In order that necessary actions can be taken promptly, a Finance Sub-Committee, comprising the Chairman (or failing him any other 
Non-Executive Director), the Chief Executive and the Finance Director operates between the dates of scheduled Board meetings and is 
authorised to make decisions, within limits defined by the Board, in respect of certain finance, treasury, tax or investment matters.

All directors attended the maximum number of Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committee meetings that they were scheduled to 
attend. In addition, where not a member, Messrs Thomson, Harris and Landless attended by invitation the whole or part of some of the 
meetings of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees.
Proposals for re-election
The Board decided, in line with the Code, that all directors will retire annually and, other than in the case of any director who has decided to 
stand down from the Board, will offer themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting. Accordingly Messrs A.M. Thomson,  
S.C. Harris, D.F . Landless, J.A. Biles, Dr K. Rajagopal and Ms E. Lindqvist will stand for re-election at the 2014 AGM. The Board recommends 
to shareholders that they re-elect or elect all the directors. In accordance with the recommendations of the Code, Board members will 
serve for a period of six years which may be extended in certain circumstances.
The performance of each director was evaluated as indicated above and the Board confirms in respect of each that their performance 
continues to be effective and that each continues to demonstrate commitment to his or her respective role.
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The Board has applied Principle C.2 of the Code by establishing a continuous process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks, including risks arising out of Bodycote’s corporate and social engagement. The 
Board continuously and regularly reviews the process, which has been in place from the start of 2000 to the date of approval of this report 
and which is in accordance with Internal Control: Guidance for directors on the Combined Code published in September 1999 and with 
revised guidance on internal control published October 2005. The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk management systems. It is based principally on reviewing reports from management and from internal 
audit to consider whether any significant weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The Audit 
Committee assists the Board in discharging these review responsibilities.

Governance Strategic Report 23065.02     11 March 2014 1:46 PM     Design Shell
The Group prepares a comprehensive annual budget which is closely monitored and updated quarterly. The Group’s authority matrix clearly 
sets out authority limits for those with delegated responsibility and specifies what can only be decided with central approval.
Internal Audit monitors the Group’s internal financial control system and its reviews are conducted on the basis of plans approved by the 
Audit Committee, to which Internal Audit reports are submitted on a regular basis.
Every Bodycote site provides assurance on specified financial and non-financial controls through a control self assessment process. The 
results are validated by Internal Audit through spot checks and are reported to the Audit Committee. In addition the President and the Vice 
President of Finance of each Division sign a Letter of Representation annually. 
During 2013, in compliance with provision C.2.1, management performed a specific assessment for the purpose of this Annual Report. 
Management’s assessment, which has been reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Board, included a review of the Group’s key 
strategic and operational risks, which is summarised from work performed by the Head of Risk and the Group’s Risk Committee to identify 
risks (by means of workshops, interviews, investigations and by reviewing departmental or divisional risk registers). The risks identified 
were assessed using conventional impact and likelihood scoring (both before and after mitigating actions), and further assessment, 
monitoring and review work was carried out in 2013. The Group’s risk management framework is progressively being embedded throughout 
the Group. The principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Group are shown on pages 24 and 25. No significant previously unidentified 
risks were uncovered as part of this process, and the necessary actions have been or are being taken to remedy any significant failings or 
weaknesses identified as part of the reviews.
Investor relations
The Chief Executive and Finance Director regularly talk with and meet institutional investors, both individually and collectively, and this 
has enabled institutional investors to increase their understanding of the Group’s strategy. The business of the Annual General Meeting 
comprises a review of the Group’s operations for the benefit of shareholders attending. In addition, internet users are able to view up-to-
date news on the Group and its share price via the Bodycote website at www.bodycote.com. Users of the website can access recent 
announcements and copies of results presentations and can enrol to hear live presentations. On a regular basis, Bodycote’s financial 
advisers, corporate brokers and financial public relations consultants provide the directors with opinion surveys from analysts and investing 
institutions following visits and meetings with the Chief Executive and Finance Director. The Chairman and SID are available to discuss 
any issues not resolved by the Chief Executive and Finance Director. On specific issues, such as the introduction of long-term incentive 
and share matching schemes in 2006 and changes thereto in 2009, 2010 and 2013, the Company has sought and will continue to seek the 
views of leading investors.

Directors’ report
The directors are pleased to submit their report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the Strategic report, and all the information contained on pages 31 to 61 together 
comprise the Directors’ report for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Strategic report
The Strategic report is provided on pages 6 to 30 of this Annual Report. This is a review of the development of the businesses of the Group, 
the financial performance during the year ended 31 December 2013, key performance indicators, a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group and information about the use of financial instruments. The Strategic review has been prepared solely to 
assist the shareholders in assessing the Group’s strategies and the potential of those strategies. It should not be relied on by any other 
party for any other purpose. Forward-looking statements have been made by the directors in good faith using information available up to 
the date of this report and such statements should be regarded with caution because of the inherent uncertainties in economic trends and 
business risks. Since the end of the financial year no important events affecting the business of the Group have occurred.
Dividends
The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 9.1p (2012: 8.3p) bringing the total ordinary dividend to 13.5p per share  
(2012: 12.3p). The Board has also recommended a supplemental distribution, by way of a special dividend, amounting to 10.0p per share.  
If approved by shareholders, the final ordinary dividend of 9.1p per share for 2013 and the supplemental distribution of 10.0p per share for 
2013 will be paid on 2 May 2014 to all shareholders on the register at the close of business on 11 April 2014.
Share capital
The Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 31 December 2013 was £33.1m and during the year was increased by the issue of 
32,084 ordinary shares between 21 March and 9 September 2013 for a total consideration of £47 ,250.11, in connection with the Company’s 
executive share incentive schemes. At the Annual General Meeting on 24 April 2013 the shareholders authorised the Company to purchase 
up to 19,142,409 of its own shares. This authority expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to be held on  
29 April 2014, at which time a further authority will be sought from shareholders.
Capital structure
Details of the issued share capital are shown in note 23. The Company has one class of ordinary shares, which carries no right to fixed 
income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company. There are no specific restrictions on the size of a 
holding nor on the transfer of shares, both of which are governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing 
legislation. The directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting rights. Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 26 and shares held by the Bodycote 
Employee Benefit Trust abstain from voting and waive dividend rights. No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. The appointment and replacement of Directors is governed by the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act and related legislation. The Articles of Association may be amended by 
a special resolution of shareholders. The powers of the directors are described in the Corporate governance statement on page 34. Under 
the Articles of Association the Company has authority to issue ordinary shares with a nominal value of £11,023,234.
There are also a number of other agreements that take effect, alter, crystallise or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid such as commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, property lease agreements, employment contracts and 
employee share plans. None of these are considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as 
a whole, and the directors are not aware of any agreements between the Company and themselves or employees that provide for 
compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid except where specifically mentioned in this report.

Directors’ report continued
Directors
The current directors and their biographical details are listed on pages 32 and 33 and all served throughout the year. Under the Articles of 
Association of the Company each director must retire from office and stand for re-election by shareholders as a minimum at every third 
Annual General Meeting in order to continue to serve as a director. However in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and to further 
increase accountability, all directors retired at the Annual General Meeting in 2013 and stood for re-election by the shareholders. Going 
forward all directors will retire at the Annual General Meeting and will stand for re-election by the shareholders, if they wish to continue to 
serve as directors of the Company. Accordingly, those directors retiring and offering themselves for re-election at the 2014 Annual General 
Meeting are Messrs A.M. Thomson, S.C. Harris, D.F . Landless, J.A. Biles, Dr K. Rajagopal and E.Lindqvist. The service agreements for 
Messrs Harris and Landless are terminable by twelve months’ notice. The remaining directors do not have a service agreement with the 
Company and their appointments are terminable by six months’ notice.
Directors’ interests in contracts and shares
Details of the Executive Directors’ service contracts and details of the directors’ interests in the Company’s shares and share incentive 
plans are shown in the Board report on remuneration on pages 47 to 61 . No director has had any dealings in any shares or options in the 
Company since 31 December 2013. Qualifying third party indemnity provision (as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) has 
remained in force for the directors for the year ended 31 December 2013 and, as at the date of this report, remains in force for the benefit 
of the current directors in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur (or have incurred) to third parties in the course of 
their duties. Apart from these exceptions, none of the directors had a material interest in any contract of significance in relation to the 
Company and its subsidiaries at any time during the financial year.
Potential conflicts of interest
During 2008 the duties owed by directors to a Company were codified and extended by the Companies Act 2006 so that directors not only 
had to declare actual conflicts of interests in transactions as they arose, but also had a duty to avoid such conflicts whether real or potential. 
Potential conflicts of interest could arise where a single director owes a fiduciary duty to more than one organisation (a ‘Situational Conflict’) 
which typically will be the case where a director holds directorships in more than one Company. In order to ensure that each director was 
complying with the new duties, each director provided the Company with a formal declaration to disclose what Situational Conflicts affected 
him or her. The Board reviewed the declarations and approved the existence of each declared Situational Conflict until September 2014 and 
permitted each affected director to attend and vote at Bodycote directors’ meetings, on the basis that each such director continued to keep 
Bodycote’s information confidential, and provided overall that such authorisation remained appropriate and in the interests of shareholders. 
Where such authorisation becomes inappropriate or not in the interests of Bodycote shareholders, the Chairman or the Nomination 
Committee can revoke an authorisation. No such revocations have been made.
Employment
The Group recognises the value that can be added to its future profitability and strength by the efforts of employees. The commitment of 
employees to excel is key to the Group’s continued success. Through their attendance at, or participation in strategy, production, safety 
and health meetings at site level, employees are kept up to date with the performance and progress of the Group, the contribution to 
the Group made by their site and are advised of safety and health issues. The Group publishes in 11 languages, via the Group intranet, an 
electronic magazine for all staff detailing the Group’s activities, performance and some of its personalities. Under the Group’s Open Door 
Line employees’ concerns can be voiced over the phone on an anonymous basis in the local language. Approximately 3,600 Bodycote 
employees are connected to the Bodycote intranet, which improves knowledge of Group activities, and assists greatly with technology 
exchange and coordination. It is the Group’s policy to give full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons, 
having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities, and to encourage the training and career development of all personnel employed 
by the Group, including disabled persons. Should an employee become disabled, the Group, where practicable, will seek to continue the 
employment and arrange appropriate training. An equal opportunities policy is in operation in the Group.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Details of greenhouse gas emissions are included within the Corporate responsibility and sustainability section of this report. 
Donations
There were no political contributions in 2012 or 2013.

In accordance with the provisions of section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution for the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as Auditor 
is to be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this Annual Report 
confirms that:
  so far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware; and
  each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and 
to establish that the Company’s Auditor is aware of that information.
This statement is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

Report of the Nomination Committee
Role of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is a sub-committee of the Board whose principal purpose is to advise on the appointment and, if necessary, 
dismissal of Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The Committee’s terms of reference, which are listed on the Company’s website, 
include all matters required by the UK Corporate Governance Code. Further information on “The Code” can be found on the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website www.frc.org.uk. The terms of reference are reviewed periodically by the Company Secretary and the Chairman 
and any changes are then referred to the Board for approval. No changes were made to the terms of reference during the year. 
Composition of the Nomination Committee
As recommended by the Code, the Chairman of the Board acts as the Chairman of the Committee which also comprises Messrs J. A. 
Biles, S.C. Harris, Dr. R. Rajagopal and Ms. E. Lindqvist. The Chairman may not chair the Committee when it is dealing with the matter of 
succession to the Chairmanship of the Company. Only members of the Committee have the right to attend the Committee meetings. Other 
individuals and external advisers may be invited to attend for all or part of any meeting as and when appropriate. The quorum necessary for 
the transaction of business is two, each of whom must be an independent Non-Executive Director.
The Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee.
The Committee has the authority to seek any information that is required, from any officer or employee of the Company or its subsidiaries. 
In connection with its duties, the Committee is authorised by the Board to take such independent advice (including legal or other 
professional advice, at the Company’s expense) as it considers necessary, including requests for information from, or commissioning 
investigations by, external advisers.
Policy on appointments to the Board
Board appointments are made on merit, against objective criteria. The issue of diversity was debated by the Board in 2012 and a formal 
policy adopted. Further details on diversity can be found in the corporate governance statement on page 34. The Board’s policy is to appoint 
the best possible candidates whilst embracing diversity in all its forms, but has chosen not to set any measurable objectives.
The process of identifying candidates for Board appointments commences with drawing up a job specification which includes, in the 
case of Non-Executive appointments, an estimate of the time commitment required. The Committee will then engage executive search 
consultants to assist in ensuring a comprehensive listing of potential candidates from a range of backgrounds. 
As a number of our Non-Executive Directors have a tenure of over 6 years or are close to it, we have started the search process and plan to 
refresh the Board step by step over the next three to four years.
Main Activities of the Nomination Committee
In 2013 the Committee formally met three times and reviewed the skills of the Board, with a view to considering the current and future 
skills and experience which the Board might require.
The committee discussed succession planning, Board diversity and reviewed the performance of the Chief Executive and other senior 
executives. In particular, the need to broaden the Board membership with respect to gender, ethnicity and age was discussed. 
The Committee considered and authorised the potential conflicts of interest which might arise where a director has fiduciary responsibilities 
in respect of other organisations. The committee concluded that no inappropriate conflicts of interest exist. The Committee also assigned 
the Chairman to review and agree with the Chief Executive the Group’s objectives for the forthcoming year.
In December 2013 the Nominations committee reviewed the Board’s size and composition, the frequency of the process for Board and 
committee meetings, best practice for the handling of a number of Board issues including drawing up a training programme for the 
directors. The terms of reference of the Committee were reviewed earlier in the year and updated broadly in line with the Model Terms of 
Reference issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators in June 2013. 
Following 2012’s external Board Evaluation the Board agreed to undertake an internal evaluation in 2013. Further details of the review can 
be found in the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report. Recommendations arising from the 2013 Board Evaluation have been 
addressed or are in the process of being addressed.
As Chairman of the Committee I will be available at the 2014 Annual General meeting to answer questions relating to the work of the 
Committee.

Report of the Audit Committee
Introduction
Our Committee has continued to focus on the integrity of Bodycote’s financial reporting, risk management and internal controls and on 
the quality of the external and internal audit processes. We will continue to keep our activities under review as the regulatory environment 
changes. This year I have given more emphasis to the work actually done by the Committee in addition to the other matters we report upon.
Membership
The members of the Audit Committee are J. A. Biles, Dr K. Rajagopal and E. Lindqvist, all of whom are independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Their biographical details are shown on page 33 and their remuneration on page 59. The Company Secretary is the Secretary to 
the Audit Committee. 
Mr Biles has been Chairman of the Audit Committee since 16 August 2007 when he was appointed a Director of the Company. The Board 
considers that Mr Biles has recent and relevant financial experience. He qualified as a Chartered Accountant with Price Waterhouse & Co, 
served as a plc Finance Director (FKI PLC 1998-2004 and Chubb Security PLC 1991-1997) and has chaired the Audit Committees of several 
other plcs. 
Objective
The Committee’s objective is to provide effective governance over the Group’s financial reporting, including the adequacy of related 
disclosures, the management and oversight of the Group’s systems of internal control, financial risks and the performance of internal audit 
and the external auditors.
Role and responsibilities
The Audit Committee is a sub-committee of the Board whose main role is to encourage and safeguard the highest standards of integrity, 
financial reporting, financial risk management and internal controls.
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set out in its Terms of Reference, which include all matters required by the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules and the Code, and are available on the Company’s website. These responsibilities include:
  reviewing the form and content of the interim and year end accounts and results announcements; 
  reporting to the Board on the appropriateness of the Group’s accounting policies and practices and significant areas of judgement;
  advising the Board on whether the Committee believes that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s strategy, business model and 
performance;
  reviewing risk management and internal controls;
  overseeing the relationship with the external auditors; and
  assessing the performance and reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of internal audit. 
Committee meetings
The Audit Committee met four times during 2013 and in February 2014 and all members attended all meetings. The Committee Chairman 
also invited the Chairman, Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Financial Controller and Group Head of Risk to attend all 
meetings. Other Executives from the Group were also invited, as appropriate, to attend certain meetings to provide a deeper level of insight 
into key issues. The Committee Chairman also invited the external auditors, Deloitte LLP , to every meeting. 
Mr Biles also had preparatory meetings separately with Deloitte and the Group Head of Risk prior to most Committee meetings to review 
their reports and discuss issues in detail. 
Main activities of the Committee during the year
As part of the process of working with the Board to carry out its responsibilities and to maximise effectiveness, meetings of the Committee 
generally take place just prior to Board Meetings.
At its meetings, the Committee focused on the following main areas:
Financial reporting 
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting has been to review with management and the external auditors the 
appropriateness of the interim and annual financial statements concentrating on, amongst other matters:
  the quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices;
  the application and impact of significant judgements or matters where there was significant discussion with the external auditors;
  the clarity of disclosures and compliance with Financial Reporting Standards; 
  whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s strategy, business model and performance; and
  correspondence with the Financial Reporting Council.
Reports from management were considered on significant matters, including in respect of litigation, treasury and tax matters and also 
reports from the external auditors on the outcome of their work. The committee challenged both management and Deloitte to ensure that 
the scope of the audit was appropriate and Deloitte had applied the necessary level of professional scepticism in their work.

Principal areas of judgement
The principal areas of judgement considered by us in relation to the 2013 accounts were as follows.
  Impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible fixed assets. The Committee challenged the assumptions, particularly the discount rate 
and growth factors, used in the discounted cash flow calculations for each cash generating unit, the sensitivity analysis applied and the 
projected future cash flows used to support the carrying values of the goodwill and intangibles and tangible assets.
  Restructuring, reorganisation and environmental provisions. The Committee received reports and challenged the basis and completeness 
of the assumptions used to calculate the provisions. In particular the Committee considered the increase in the reorganisation provision, 
relating to the transfer of accounting to the Shared Service Centre in Prague. The Committee discussed with management the key 
judgements behind all provisions and agreed with their recommendations.
  Taxation. A number of judgements are involved in calculating tax provisions and the level of deferred tax assets to be recognised. 
The Committee reviewed the associated risks and challenged management’s assessment concerning the Group’s key tax risks and 
management’s forecast of the future profitability of the relevant businesses. 
  Going Concern. The Committee challenged the validity of the Going Concern assumption used in preparation of the Annual Report 
and Accounts, in particular considering the Group’s forecast liquidity position, available borrowing facilities, covenant compliance and 
sensitivity analysis.
  Pension Liabilities. Management took external professional advice in determining pension liabilities. The Committee challenged the 
assumptions used, particularly in respect of inflation, the discount rate and life expectancy.
Risk management
The Group’s risk assessment process and the way that significant financial risks are managed and mitigated is a key area of focus for the 
Committee at each meeting. The committee work on risk was guided by the Group’s assessment of its principal risks and uncertainties. 
At each meeting the Committee reviewed a report from the Group Head of Risk who has primary responsibility for developing the Group’s 
risk management framework. The Committee reviewed changes to significant risks and mitigating actions identified by management. 
The Committee also received quarterly reports on calls to the Open Door Line (whereby employees may report matters of concern) and 
assessed both how such calls are dealt with and whether there was any indication of material risk. The Committee also reviewed and 
challenged the effectiveness of management’s business continuity and disaster recovery arrangements.
Internal control
At each meeting the committee reviewed the process by which the Group evaluated its internal control environment. In particular we 
considered and challenged reports from the internal auditors on effectiveness of internal controls and requested certain changes to those 
controls. During the year there has been a focus on controls to minimise the risk of fraud.
Internal audit
The Group Head of Risk presented a report to the Committee at each meeting on the status of internal audit plans for the current year, 
points arising from audits completed and follow up action plans to address areas of weakness. We also received reports on actual or 
suspected frauds and thefts by third parties and employees. None had any material financial impact on the Group and where necessary, 
systems and procedures were altered to minimise the risk of recurrence. In December 2013 the plan for 2014 was presented to the 
Committee and accepted following discussion and challenge as to scope and areas of focus. 
External audit
At the April and December meetings the external auditors presented their audit plans for the interim review and year end audit respectively. 
The Committee considered and challenged both the scope and materiality to be applied to the Group audit and its components. In particular 
the Committee considered carefully the scope in respect of smaller and more remote locations. As a consequence it decided that those 
few local audits that were not previously undertaken by Deloitte LLP would be for the 2013 audit.
Cyber risk
The members of the Committee completed the cyber risk questionnaire produced by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and 
the Committee was further briefed on this important area by specialists from Deloitte LLP . 
T raining
Updates were presented to the Committee on any new accounting developments and any changes in corporate governance requirements 
that may affect the Group. Committee members also attended training briefings by accounting firms and other advisors.
Overview
The Committee reviewed the Annual Report and Accounts. Taken as a whole, in the light of their knowledge of the Group and its 
performance, the outcome of the activities described above and based on robust discussion with both management and the external 
auditors, the Committee has concluded that they are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s strategy, business model and performance, and reported to the Board accordingly.

External Audit
Appointment
The Committee considers the re-appointment of the external auditors each year and as part of this process considers the independence of 
the auditors and the effectiveness of the external audit process. Having reviewed the performance of Deloitte in 2013, the Committee has 
decided to recommend to the Board that Deloitte be reappointed for the 2014 audit and a resolution to this effect will be put to the 2014 
AGM. The Committee reviewed and agreed the fee for 2013.
The external auditors are required to change the lead partner every five years and other partners periodically in order to protect 
independence and objectivity and provide fresh challenge to the Group. The current lead partner, Mrs N. Mitchell, has been in place for four 
years.
Deloitte has been the Company’s auditor for 12 years and the Committee has decided, in accordance with the 2012 UK Corporate 
Governance Code, that the audit will be put out to tender in 2014 to coincide with the end of Mrs Mitchell’s five year tenure. 
Independence
The independence of the external auditors has been confirmed by Deloitte every half year and was last confirmed in February 2014. The 
Committee considered Deloitte’s presentation and confirmed that it considered the auditors to be independent. 
Effectiveness of the external audit process
We have adopted a formal framework for the review of the effectiveness of the external audit process and audit quality which includes the 
following aspects:
  assessment of the engagement partner, other partners and the audit team;
  audit approach and scope, including identification of risk areas;
  execution of the audit;
  interaction with management;
  communication with and support to the audit committee;
  insights, management letter points, added value and reports; and 
  independence, objectivity and scepticism.
An assessment questionnaire has been completed by each member of the Committee, by the Group Finance Director and other 
senior finance Executives. The feedback from the process is considered by the Audit Committee and provided to external auditors and 
management. The full formal questionnaire is completed every three years with key areas being completed every year.
The committee assessed the effectiveness of management in the external audit process by considering timely identification and resolution 
of areas of accounting judgement, the quality and timeliness of papers analysing those judgements and other documents provided for 
review by the external auditors and the Committee.
We have considered the FRC Audit Quality Review Team report on Deloitte dated May 2013. If our audit is selected for quality review we 
have asked to see any resulting reports.
After considering the above matters the Committee felt that the external audit had been effective.
Non-audit services 
The external auditor may be invited to provide services where their position as auditors renders them best placed to undertake the work. 
However, no contracts in excess of £20,000 can be awarded to the external auditor without prior approval from the Chairman of the 
Committee or, in his absence, another member of the Committee. Non-audit fees paid to the auditor are shown in note 3 on page 84 and 
amounted to 11% of the audit fee.

Report of the Audit Committee continued
Internal audit
The internal audit programme is managed by the Group Head of Risk and provides independent assurance over the key financial processes 
and controls in operation across the Group. The Group has engaged Ernst & Young LLP to provide additional and specialist resources. An 
annual internal audit plan is reviewed and approved by the Committee before the start of each financial year. This plan takes account of the 
Group’s strategic objectives and risks and provides the degree of coverage deemed appropriate by the Committee. Accounting centres are 
visited at least every two years and plants every five years.
Internal audit reports include control weaknesses identified, recommendations for improvements and actions agreed with management to 
improve control. The status of these actions is monitored closely by the Committee until they are completed. The Committee noted that the 
2013 programme was successfully completed and management actions were completed by agreed implementation dates.
Since the beginning of 2013, additional assurance has been obtained through control self-assessment. Internal auditors have received 
self-certification from every plant and accounting centre that internal controls have been complied with and noting any non-compliance. A 
summary of results is presented to the Committee. The accuracy of returns is monitored by Internal Audit by verification visits to a random 
sample of sites.
The effectiveness of internal audit is reviewed and discussed annually with the Group Head of Risk and the Ernst & Young engagement 
partner. In 2013 internal audit was assessed as effective.
Financial Reporting Council
In September 2013 a letter was received from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) asking for additional information and clarification in 
connection with our 2012 Annual Report and Accounts. Management provided clarification and answered all questions, which after review 
by and approval of the Audit Committee Chairman, were provided to the FRC.
In October the FRC acknowledged that their enquiries had been satisfactorily concluded. The appropriate additional information has been 
included in this Annual Report and Accounts, where material and relevant.
Committee evaluation
The Committee’s activities formed part of the review of Board effectiveness which was undertaken internally this year. Based on this and 
as a result of the work done during the year, the Committee has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference and 
carried out its responsibilities effectively.

Board report on remuneration
Introduction
As Chairman of the Remuneration Committee (“Committee”) I am delighted to present our Remuneration Report, based on the new policy 
and disclosure requirements on directors’ remuneration, as required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the “Regulations”), for which we will be seeking your approval at our Annual General Meeting.
You will see that there are two main sections to the report. The first part (Section A) summarises the policy of the Board with regard to the 
remuneration of the Directors and is a re-statement of the existing policy using the new guidelines. The second part (Section B) describes 
how that policy has been implemented during the year and will be implemented in 2014.
In accordance with the Regulations, the policy section (Section A) will be put to a binding vote at, and will then be applicable immediately 
after, the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company in April 2014. It is intended that the policy section will be put forward to 
shareholders every three years. The Annual Report on remuneration will continue to be put to the AGM each year on an advisory basis.
2013 performance and remuneration outcomes
Bodycote has made good and steady progress in 2013. Reported revenues increased by 5.4% (3.0% at constant exchange rates). Headline 
operating profit grew by 10.2% and our share price increased by 47 .9% in 2013, compared to an increase of 28.8% in the FTSE 250 as a 
whole.
2013 base salary increases for the Executive Directors in the year were 2.7% for the CEO and 2.7% for the FD. These increases were in the 
context of average 2013 salary increases across the Group of around 3%.
Annual bonuses for the Executive Directors, which are based on a mix of Group operating profit, Group cash flow and personal strategic 
objectives, paid out at the level of 59.1% and 43.9% of base salary for the CEO and FD, respectively (equivalent to 50.6% and 48.8% of 
maximum opportunity).
Awards under the Co-investment Plan (‘CIP’) made in May 2010 vested in May 2013 at 100% of maximum based on absolute Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) growth of the three financial years ending April 2013.
Awards under the Bodycote Incentive Plan (‘BIP’) made in February 2011 are due to vest in March 2014 at 98.4% of maximum based on a 
combination of ROCE and EPS growth over the three financial years ending December 2013.
Following a contractual review of pension provision during 2013, the Committee decided that the level of salary supplement in lieu of 
pension for Stephen Harris should be adjusted to 25% of salary. For David Landless, the level will be adjusted to 25%, up to the cap of the 
defined benefit pension scheme; above that amount to his actual base salary, the salary supplement in lieu of pension remains at 16%. 
Both of these changes will come into effect as of April 2014.
Changes to remuneration arrangements
From 2013, the Committee decided that participants receiving awards under the CIP and BIP will be eligible to receive dividend equivalents 
on vested shares. This change will more closely align the interests of Executives with those of shareholders as well as bringing this aspect 
of plan operation into line with typical market practice. The Committee consulted with key shareholders on this point and they were 
supportive of the change.
Apart from this, the Remuneration Committee decided not to make changes to the remuneration framework and policy this year. The 
decisions we have taken have been within the terms of our existing policies.

Section A: Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Remuneration Policy
The objective of Bodycote’s Executive Remuneration Policy is to provide remuneration that will reward and thereby retain talented people 
in the business and enable the recruitment of appropriately skilled and experienced newcomers. Therefore, the Executive Remuneration 
Policy is to set levels that attract and retain the talent responsible for executing strategy while ensuring the Company pays no more than is 
necessary. 
Executive Remuneration Policy
The table below shows the Policy to be approved by shareholders on 29 April 2014, taking effect once approved by the AGM in 2014 and 
which we expect to apply for a period of three years.
Pay table
Pay element and link  
to strategy Maximum value Operation
Base salary
To ensure competitive 
salaries to attract and 
retain the talent required 
to execute the strategy 
while ensuring the 
Company pays no more 
than is necessary 
Whilst the Committee has not set a 
maximum level of salary, ordinarily, 
salary increases will not exceed the 
average increase awarded to other 
Group employees.
Increases may be above this level in 
certain exceptional circumstances, 
which may, for example, include:
  Increase in scope or responsibility
  A new Executive Director is being 
moved to market positioning over 
time
Base salaries for Executive Directors are typically reviewed annually 
(or more frequently if specific circumstances necessitate this) by 
the Committee in December each year.
Salary levels are set and reviewed taking into account a number of 
factors including:
  Role, experience and performance of the executive
  The Company’s guidelines for salaries for all employees in the 
Group for the forthcoming year
  The competitiveness of total remuneration assessed against 
FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar size and 
complexity, as appropriate
Pension
Provides a market-
competitive benefit in 
order to attract the talent 
required to execute the 
strategy and provide a 
market-competitive level 
of provision for post-
retirement income
Company contribution (or cash 
equivalent) of 30% of salary.
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. The policy 
for Executive Directors is to make a contribution to this scheme 
or a cash allowance of equivalent value
1
. Base salary is the only 
pensionable element of remuneration.
The same general approach applies to all employees, although 
contribution levels vary by seniority.
Other benefits
Provides market-
competitive benefits at 
an appropriate cost
The Committee has not set a 
maximum level of benefit, given 
that the cost of certain benefits will 
depend on the individual’s particular 
circumstances. However benefits will 
be set at an appropriate level against 
market practice and needs for specific 
roles and individual circumstances.
The Company provides a range of cash benefits and benefits in 
kind to Executive Directors in line with market practice. These 
include the provision of company car (or allowance), private medical 
insurance, short- and long-term sick pay and death in service cover. 
This will also extend to the reimbursement of taxable work-related 
expenses, such as travel and relocation.
The provision of other benefits payable to an Executive Director 
is reviewed by the Committee on an annual basis to ensure 
appropriateness in terms of the type and level of benefits provided.
The Company provides a long-term savings vehicle into which the 
Executive Directors may elect to waive a proportion of pension 
allowance.
In the case of non-UK Executives, the Committee may consider 
providing additional allowances in line with relevant market 
practice.
Board report on remuneration continued

  Cash in lieu of pensions entitlements are, for Stephen Harris, 22% of salary and, for David Landless, 22% of salary up to the cap of the Company’s defined 
benefit pension scheme (in which he ceased to participate in April 2012) and 16% of salary above this cap. From April 2014, the Committee has determined 
that the entitlement should be 25% of salary for Stephen Harris and, for David Landless, 25% of salary up to the scheme cap and 16% above the cap.

Annual bonus
To incentivise delivery 
of corporate strategy 
and reward delivery of 
superior performance
The maximum potential is 130% of 
base salary for the CEO and 100% 
of base salary for other Executive 
Directors.
The level of bonus paid each year is determined by the Committee 
after the year end based on performance against targets. At least 
70% of the bonus will be based on the achievement of Group 
financial targets.
For 2014:
  70% of bonus is determined by Group headline operating profit 
against set targets
  10% of bonus is determined by Group headline operating cash 
flow against set targets
  20% of bonus is determined by the achievement of personal 
objectives, which may vary year-on-year to ensure that objectives 
are aligned with the business plan but our policy is to set goals 
which relate to the achievement of business strategy 
The weighting of these measures and specific targets are reviewed 
on an annual basis to ensure alignment to strategy and are set to 
be in line with budget. Information on measures and weights that 
will apply for 2013 and 2014 are shown on page 57 of the Board 
report on remuneration.
The Committee considers the performance conditions selected for 
the annual bonus to appropriately support the Company’s strategic 
objectives and provide a balance between generating profit and 
cash to enable the Group to pay a dividend, reward its employees 
and make future investments; and achieve other strategic goals to 
drive long-term sustainable return. 
At the threshold performance level there will normally be no more 
than 30% vesting. Awards commence vesting progressively from 
this point with maximum performance resulting in awards’ vesting 
in full.
Bonus payments are subject to the Committee’s Malus Policy as 
outlined on page 51 .
Bodycote Incentive 
Plan (‘BIP’)
To incentivise delivery of 
long-term shareholder 
value
Aids retention of senior 
management
The maximum face value of an award 
which may be granted under the plan 
in any year is up to 175% of base 
salary for the Executive Directors.
The BIP is our primary long-term incentive plan. Conditional shares 
are awarded annually with vesting dependent on performance 
conditions measured over at least three years. Awards will 
be based on financial (and/or share price based) performance 
conditions as determined by the Committee.
The performance conditions for awards granted in 2014 are as 
follows:
  50% of the award is subject to a return on capital employed 
(‘ROCE’) performance condition and 50% of the award is subject 
to an earnings per share (‘EPS’) performance condition.
  At the threshold performance level there will be zero 
vesting. Awards commence vesting progressively from zero 
on achievement of threshold performance with maximum 
performance resulting in awards vesting in full.
  In addition, for any award to vest (regardless of targets achieved) 
EPS must not be below a defined hurdle level.

Bodycote Incentive 
Plan (‘BIP’)
continued
The Committee reviews levels of awards and targets annually. 
In determining the performance targets applicable to awards, 
the Committee takes into account the current and forecast 
performance for the business and its sector, along with broker 
consensus to ensure stretch targets are set. Targets for each 
award are set out in the relevant section of the Board report on 
remuneration. Targets that apply to awards made in 2013 are shown 
on page 58.
The Committee considers the performance conditions selected 
for the BIP to appropriately underpin the Company’s strategic 
objectives. Due to the nature of the Company’s activities the 
Committee consider ROCE to provide shareholders with an 
appropriate measure of how well the Company is performing and is 
being managed, while EPS provides a measure of the level of value 
created for shareholders. ROCE and EPS are our top two KPIs as 
shown on page 58 of the Annual Report.
The Committee retains the discretion in exceptional circumstances 
to adjust the vesting outcome or the targets for awards as long as 
the adjusted targets are no less stretching. In such an event the 
Committee will consult with major shareholders and will clearly 
explain the rationale for the changes in the report on remuneration. 
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect of the shares which 
vest.
BIP awards are subject to the Committee’s Malus Policy as outlined 
on page 51 . 
Co-Investment  
Plan (‘CIP’)
To provide a link between 
short and long-term 
incentive arrangements 
and to provide further 
alignment with 
shareholders 
Executive Directors can receive a 
maximum matching share award of up 
to 40% of base salary.
Executive Directors are invited annually to purchase shares up to 
40% of basic salary (net of tax).
The CIP provides for the grant of awards of performance based 
matching shares to participants on an annual basis in a maximum 
ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred shares. The 
deferred shares must be held for at least three years. The matching 
shares will be based on share price related performance conditions 
as determined by the Committee.
For 2014:
The matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder 
Return (‘TSR’) performance measure which is expressed as 
percentage Compound Annual Growth Rate (‘CAGR’) in excess of 
CPI:
  Threshold performance results in a 0.5:1 match
  Maximum performance results in a 1:1 match 
The calibration of performance targets is reviewed by the 
Committee on an annual basis and is chosen in order to align with 
business strategy. Targets for the cycle vesting in respect of the 
year are disclosed in the Board report on remuneration.
Dividend equivalents are payable in respect of the matching shares 
which vest.
The Committee considers it appropriate to use an absolute TSR 
performance measure for awards made under the CIP so that 
participants are incentivised to and rewarded for providing absolute 
returns for shareholders.
CIP awards are subject to the Committee’s Malus Policy as outlined 
on page 51 .

Shareholding 
requirement
To provide alignment 
between Executive 
Directors and 
shareholders
Executive Directors are required to 
hold at least 100% of basic salary.
The Board operates a shareholding retention policy under 
which Executive Directors are expected, within five years from 
appointment, to build up a shareholding in the Company. The 
expectation is to hold at least 100% of basic salary. For the 
purposes of this requirement, only beneficially-owned shares will 
be counted.
Malus
To provide the 
Committee flexibility 
to adjust remuneration 
levels in exceptional 
circumstances
Not applicable The Malus Policy came into effect from 1 January 2013 and has 
been introduced to provide the Committee with discretionary 
powers to use malus performance based remuneration should 
exceptional circumstances occur. This Malus Policy is in respect 
of annual bonuses and long-term incentive awards. Exceptional 
circumstances necessitating malus would include:
  Fraud;
  Misconduct;
  Significant misstatement of financial results; or
  Miscalculation of performance conditions.
Should the Committee, in its opinion, consider such circumstances 
to have occurred during a performance period from 2013 onwards 
then the Malus Policy will provide the Committee discretion to 
determine that any amounts paid or awards vested by reference to 
the relevant period, shall be subject to malus. Malus will start to 
apply to awards made from 2013. 
The Committee expects the mechanism to use malus for any such 
amounts will be to reduce future annual bonus payments, reduce 
the value of subsisting awards that have, at the relevant time, not 
yet vested or by reducing the level of award to be made at the 
following grant date.
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that they are not 
in line with the policy set out on page 53 where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy came into effect or (ii) at a time 
when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration 
for the individual becoming a director of the Company. For these purposes “payments” include the Committee satisfying awards of variable 
remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment being “agreed” at the time the award is granted.
Executive Directors’ remuneration is reviewed annually and takes into account a number of factors. The Company adopts a policy of 
positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not require the Company to pay any 
more than is necessary. Senior and high performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within the organisation are invited to 
participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, which are similar to those offered to the Executive Directors to ensure 
reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance. Financial Statements Additional Information

Recruitment policy
When recruiting new Executive Directors, the Company’s policy is to pay what is necessary to attract individuals with the skills and 
experience appropriate to the role to be filled, taking into account remuneration across the Group, including other senior Executives, and 
that offered by other FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar size and complexity. New Executive Directors will generally 
be appointed on remuneration packages with the same structure and pay elements as described in the pay policy table on page 48. Each 
element of remuneration to be included in the package offered to a new director would be considered separately and collectively in this 
context.
On appointment to the Board or for a Non-Executive director taking an executive role:
  Base salary levels will be set in consideration of the new recruit’s existing salary, location, skills and experience and expected contribution 
to the new role, the current salaries of other Executive Directors in the Company and current market levels for the role;
  Pension will be considered in light of the retirement arrangements which are in place for the other Executive Director(s) with a 
contribution level considered by the Committee to be appropriate in light of the new recruit’s package as a whole, market practice at the 
time and on a broadly equivalent basis to existing provisions for other Executives;
  Other benefits will be considered in light of the provision in place for the other Executive Director(s). If it is in the best interests of 
the Company and shareholders, the Committee may consider providing additional benefits, potentially including relocation costs, tax 
equalisation or advisers’ fees;
  The initial notice period may be longer than the Company’s one year policy (up to a maximum of two years). However, this will reduce by 
one month for every month served, until the Company’s policy position is reached;
  For annual bonus, the Company would consider whether it was appropriate for the new recruit to participate in the same annual incentive 
plan applicable to the current Executive Directors. If this was considered appropriate, the same financial measures, weighting, payout 
scale and target as well as maximum bonus opportunity (as a percentage of salary) which apply to the existing director(s) would generally 
apply to the new recruit;
  The Committee will determine when long-term incentive awards will be granted during the year; and 
  The Company is required to set out the maximum amount of variable pay which could be paid to a new director in respect of his/her 
recruitment. In order to provide the Company with sufficient flexibility in a recruitment scenario, the Committee has set this figure as 
450% of base salary. This covers the maximum annual bonus and the maximum face value of any long-term incentive awards. This level 
of variable pay would only be available in exceptional circumstances, and in order to achieve such a level of variable pay, stretching targets 
would need to be met. For the avoidance of doubt, this 450% variable pay limit excludes the value of any “buyout” payments or awards 
associated with forfeited awards.
For an external appointment, although there are no plans to offer additional cash and/or share-based payments on recruitment, the 
Committee reserves the right to do so when it considers this to be in the best interests of the Company and shareholders. Such payments 
may take into account remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would reflect the nature, time horizons and 
performance requirements attached to that remuneration. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment. 
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to “buyout” awards which will be forfeited on leaving the previous 
employer. Our approach to this is to carry out a detailed review of the awards which the individual will lose and calculate the estimated 
value of them. In doing so, we will consider the vesting period, the option exercise period if applicable, whether the awards are cash 
or share based, performance related or not, the Company’s recent performance and payout levels and any other factors we consider 
appropriate. If a buyout award is to be made, the structure and level will be carefully designed and will generally reflect and replicate the 
previous awards as accurately as possible. We will make the award subject to appropriate malus provisions in the event that the individual 
resigns or is summarily terminated within a certain timeframe. An explanation will be provided at the time of recruitment of why a buyout 
award has been granted.
Shareholders will be informed of any Director appointment and the individual’s remuneration arrangements as soon as practicable following 
the appointment via an announcement to the regulatory news services.
Fee levels for a new Chairman or new Non-Executive Directors will be determined in accordance with the policy set out on page 48.
T ermination remuneration policy
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors have service contracts with a one-year notice period and terminable by one year’s notice 
by the employer at any time, and by payment of one year’s basic salary and other fixed benefits in lieu of notice by the employer. All future 
appointments to the Board will comply with this requirement.
Currently, under the terms of the Executive Directors’ contracts, the Company may at its choice, in lieu of giving notice, terminate an 
Executive Director’s service contract by making a payment equivalent to:
  One year’s annual base salary, 25% of base salary in respect of all other remuneration and benefits (other than annual bonus and 
incentives) and annual bonus equal to the average bonus paid up to three years prior to the date of notice.

Our policy is not to have a change in control clause in Executive Directors’ service contracts. Stephen Harris does not have a change 
of control clause. David Landless’ service contract was agreed in accordance with what was considered best practice at the time of its 
execution in 2001 and provides for one year’s remuneration if his employment is terminated on a change of control. This provision has been 
preserved. To the extent that executive contracts are renewed, or new appointments made, the Committee will continue to adopt a policy 
of not having change of control clauses in service contracts. In any case, legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to mitigate 
any compensation payment, covering basic salary, annual incentives and benefits, which may arise on the termination of employment of 
any Executive Director, other than payments made on a change in control or for payments in lieu of notice.
In the event that an Executive Director leaves the Company, the Committee’s policy for exit payments is to consider the reasons for 
cessation and consequently whether any exit payments other than those contractually required are warranted. 
On cessation of employment, awards under the BIP and CIP will lapse in full, unless the Committee in its absolute discretion determines 
otherwise. In instances where the Committee determines that awards should not lapse in full, the Committee will consider the 
performance conditions applying to any unvested awards and the performance period which has elapsed. Awards will usually be subject 
to some form of time pro-rating reduction to reflect the unexpired portion of the performance or deferral period concerned. Awards that 
are subject to performance conditions will usually only vest to the extent that these conditions are satisfied. Awards which do not lapse on 
cessation of employment may either vest at that time or on their originally anticipated vesting date. 
On termination, the accumulated funds invested in the Bodycote Investment Incentive Plan (further information on this long-term savings 
vehicle is available on page 57) will normally be released to the participant subject to Committee discretion.
On change of control the awards will generally vest subject to performance and time apportionment as determined by the Committee and 
in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan.

Chairman and Non-Executive Directors Policy
The Chairman and each Non-Executive Director hold letters of appointment which have been agreed which set out the terms of their 
appointment, including membership of the Board Committees, the fees to be paid and the time commitment expected from the Director.
It is the Board’s policy that the Chairman and Non-Executive fees are reviewed on an annual basis. The fees for the Chairman are reviewed 
by the Board in the absence of the Chairman. The fees for the Non-Executive Directors are reviewed by the Chairman and Executive 
Directors. When reviewing fees, the primary source for comparative market data is FTSE 250 companies and other companies of similar 
size and complexity, as appropriate.
Fees for the Chairman and Non-Executives are set at a level that will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a 
significant contribution to the Group’s affairs. The Committee seeks to recruit Non-Executive Directors with the experience to contribute to 
the Board with a balance of personal skills that will make a major contribution to the Board and it’s committee structures.
The Company’s policy is that the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive a fixed fee for their services as members of the Board 
and its Committees. The fee structure may also include additional fees for chairing a Board Committee and/or for further responsibilities 
(for example, Senior Independent Directorship). Fee levels take into account the level of time commitment and duties and responsibilities 
involved. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any 
incentive scheme. In line with the Articles of Association, accumulative Non-Executive Director fees are capped at £500,000 p.a.
Director Date of appointment Notice period
A.M. Thomson 1 December 2007 6 months
J.A. Biles 16 August 2007 6 months
K. Rajagopal 24 September 2008 6 months
E. Lindqvist 1 June 2012 6 months
Fees retained for external Non-Executive Directorships
To broaden the experience of Executive Directors, they may hold positions in other companies as Non-Executive Directors provided that 
permission is sought in advance. Any external appointment must not conflict with the Directors’ duties and commitments to Bodycote plc. 
Stephen Harris has held such a position at Mondi plc since 1 March 2011 and in accordance with Group policy he retained fees for the year 
of £82,919.45. David Landless was appointed a Non-Executive Director of Luxfer Holdings plc with effect from 1 March 2013 and retained 
fees for the year of £40,238. In addition, David Landless was given 1,924 of Luxfer American Depositary Receipts valued at $30,000 at the 
date of grant on 1 March 2013. 
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company 
The Company adopts a policy of positioning fixed pay for all its employees at a level which is competitive to market but which does not 
require the Company to pay any more than is necessary. Senior and high performing individuals at all levels and across all functions within 
the organisation are invited to participate in both annual and long-term incentive arrangements, similar to the Executive Directors to ensure 
reward strategy is calibrated to provide substantive reward only on achievement of superior performance.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when formulating Executive Director pay policy. However, it does take into 
account information provided by the Human Resources function and feedback from employee satisfaction surveys.
In formulating Executive Director pay policy, the Committee receives information on all employee pay conditions throughout the Group.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee always welcomes the views of shareholders in respect of pay policy as well as those views expressed on behalf of 
shareholders by their respective proxy advisers. The Committee documents all remuneration related comments made at the Company’s 
AGM and feedback received during consultation with shareholders throughout the year. Any feedback received is fully considered by the 
Committee and, where appropriate, amendments are made to remuneration policy.
During 2013, the Committee decided that participants receiving awards under the CIP and BIP will be eligible to receive dividend 
equivalents on un-vested shares payable at the time of vesting. The Committee consulted with key shareholders on this point and they 
were supportive of the change.

Advisers to the Committee
During the year the Committee undertook a review of the Remuneration Committee adviser and appointed Towers Watson to provide 
independent advice relating to remuneration matters. During the year, Towers Watson provided advice on matters under consideration by 
the Committee and updates on good practice, legislative requirements and market practice. Towers Watson’s fees for this work amounted 
to £26,575. Up until 1 June 2013, Ernst & Young provided advice to the Remuneration Committee. Ernst & Young’s fees for these services 
amounted to £14,376. Legal advice was provided by Eversheds and fees amounted to £915. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that 
the advice provided on executive remuneration is objective and independent and that no conflict of interest arises as a result of these other 
services. 
The Committee also received assistance from the Chief Executive and Company Secretary, although they do not participate in 
discussions relating to the setting of their own remuneration. The Committee in particular consulted with the Chief Executive and received 
recommendations from him in respect of his direct reports.

Remuneration for 2013
This section of the report explains how Bodycote’s Remuneration Policy has been implemented during the financial year.
Base salary
The base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed on an annual basis. As described in the policy section, a number of factors are 
taken into account when salaries are reviewed, principally market level salaries payable in FTSE 250 companies and other companies of 
similar size and complexity and the individual’s role, experience and performance. The 2013 base salary increases and comparative figures 
can be found in the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s letter.
Base salaries are reviewed in January every year. 
Name Position Salary from 1 January 2013 Salary from 1 January 2014
S.C. Harris CEO £470,200 £484,306
D.F . Landless FD £300,300 £309,312
Pension
Stephen Harris is entitled to a salary supplement in lieu of pension at a rate of 22% of basic salary, of which £103,444 was waived during 
the year. In addition, in the event of death, a death in service benefit of eight times basic salary will become payable.
From April 2012, David Landless ceased to participate in the Group’s UK contributory defined benefit and defined contribution pension 
schemes due to his prospectively reaching the lifetime limits. Instead Mr Landless receives a salary supplement of 22% of basic salary up 
to the defined benefit scheme cap and 16% of base salary above the cap, of which £61,840 was waived during the year.
T axable benefits
The Company provides other cash benefits and benefits in kind to Directors as well as sick pay and life insurance. These include the 
provision of company car (or allowance) and family level private medical insurance.
Name Car/car allowance Fuel Healthcare Salary supplement
S.C. Harris £13,600 £2,400 £1,364 £103,444
D.F . Landless £18,759 £1,200 £1,706 £ 61,840
Long-term savings vehicle
During the financial year the Company made discretionary contributions into the Bodycote Investment Incentive Plan. The plan is entirely 
cash based to provide an alternative long-term savings vehicle for senior Executives. The Committee considers the plan an essential tool 
to aid retention while recognising the need for Executives to have flexibility in long-term financial planning. Company contributions are 
discretionary, vary year-on-year and are made in lieu of other elements of pay and therefore are cost neutral to the Company and any risk in 
relation to the value of investments made in the plan is borne entirely by participants. 
Annual performance-related bonus
The annual bonus potential for the period to 31 December 2013 for Executive Directors was split 70% in respect of Group operating profit, 
10% Group operating cash flow and 20% on personal strategic objectives. The choice of these performance conditions, and their respective 
weightings reflected the Committee’s belief that any incentive compensation should be tied both to the overall performance of the Group 
and to those areas of the business that the relevant individual can directly influence.
The performance of the Company during the year included headline operating profit of £107 .4m (a 10.2% increase on the previous year) and 
operating cash flow of £104.6m (a 1 .6% increase on last year).
In light of the above performance, the Committee concluded that 50.6% of maximum bonus is payable to the Chief Executive and 48.8% of 
maximum bonus is payable to the Finance Director. As described in the policy section, 100% of annual bonus is payable in cash.
The Board has considered whether to include targets which applied to the bonus arrangements for Executive Directors in 2013 and which 
will apply for 2014 but determined that these figures are commercially sensitive. It is the Committee’s intention to include the 2013 targets 
in next year’s Remuneration Report. Personal objectives for the Chief Executive broadly cover driving growth, improving customer service, 
safety and implementation of major projects.

Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP) 
Awards with performance periods ending in the year
BIP awards made in 2011 had a three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2013 with 50% of the award subject to satisfaction 
of a ROCE target and 50% subject to an EPS target. The threshold and maximum targets along with the vesting schedule are set out in the 
tables below:
 
ROCE EPS
Performance target
Vesting of element 
(% of maximum) Performance target
Vesting of element 
(% of maximum)
Threshold performance 14.6% 0% 28.3p 0%
Maximum performance 20.0% 100% 39.8p 100%
Performance achieved 19.9% 96.9% 41.2p 100%
In addition, if EPS at the end of the performance period was below 16p then no awards would vest. 
Over the period, ROCE was 19.9% and the EPS figure for the year of 41 .2p represented growth of 9.9%. This performance resulted in the 
ROCE and EPS targets being achieved at a level of 96.9% and 100% respectively. This resulted in an overall vesting level of 98.5%. The 
number and value of shares which vested to each of the Executive Directors is set out on page 61 of this report.
Awards made in the year 
BIP awards of face value of 175% of salary were made to both Executive Directors in February 2013 and will vest in March 2016, subject 
to the achievement of ROCE and EPS growth performance targets. The performance period will end on 31 December 2015. The vesting 
of these awards will be based on ROCE and EPS targets summarised in the table below. The Committee has reviewed the performance 
targets and these have altered accordingly to ensure that they remain stretching and underpin the Company objectives.
 
ROCE EPS
Performance target
Vesting of element

Vesting of element

Threshold performance 18.7% 0% 42.0p 0%
Maximum performance 23.0% 100% 61 .3p 100%
In addition, if EPS at the end of the performance period were to be below 42p then no awards would vest.
The Committee has decided that the ROCE figure of 23% is a good aspiration for the Group and is cognisant of the fact that overdriving 
incentives on capital employed can lead to unintended consequences in terms of short-term capital starvation for the business. As of 2013 
dividend equivalents are payable in respect of the shares which vest.
The number and value of shares which were awarded to the Executive Directors during the year is set out on page 61 of this report.
Co-investment Plan (CIP)
Awards with performance periods ending in the year
As described in the policy section of this report, CIP awards are subject to an absolute TSR target. The CIP awards made in 2010 had a 
three-year performance period ending on 30 April 2013. The absolute TSR performance targets applicable to this award are set out below:
Absolute TSR performance Vesting level
4% CAGR + CPI 50% (0.5:1 match)
10% CAGR + CPI 100% (1:1 match)
Over the three-year period, the Company achieved absolute TSR growth of 37%. This performance resulted in the TSR targets being achieved 
at a level of 100%. The number and value of shares which vested to each of the Executive Directors is set out on page 61 of this report.
Awards made in the year
CIP awards were made to both Executive Directors in May 2013 and will vest in May 2016, subject to the achievement of absolute TSR 
targets summarised in the table below. The Committee has reviewed the performance targets and felt that they remain appropriately 
stretching. Therefore, no change has been made to the absolute TSR performance targets used in the previous year. As of 2013 dividend 
equivalents are payable in respect of the shares which vest.

Implementation of policy in 2014
Base salary is reviewed on an annual basis. The 2014 base salary increases for the Directors from 1 January 2014 were 3% for the Chief 
Executive and 3% for the Finance Director. As 2014 base salary increases for the Group take place after the publication of this report, the 
comparative figure for 2014 can only be provided in next year’s report.
As described in the Committee Chairman’s introduction, following a contractual review of pension provision during 2013, the Committee 
decided that the level of salary supplement in lieu of pension for Stephen Harris should be adjusted to 25% of salary. For David Landless, 
the level will be adjusted to 25% up to the defined benefit pension scheme cap. Above that amount up to his actual base salary, the salary 
supplement in lieu of pension remains at 16%. Both of these changes will come into effect as of April 2014. The Committee does not intend 
to change the benefit arrangements for the Executive Directors in 2014. For 2014 the Committee has determined that the annual bonus 
opportunity for Executive Directors and senior executives will again be contingent on meeting targets relating to safety, operating profit, 
cash management and personal objectives. The Committee has reviewed targets for the year to ensure they remain appropriately stretching 
and relevant for the Company’s business strategy.
The Committee will review the performance measures for awards under the CIP and the BIP in 2014 to ensure they remain appropriately 
stretching in light of the Company’s expectations of performance and those of external analysts.

 Figures relate to unvested awards under the BIP and CIP .
As described in the policy section, the Board operates a shareholding retention policy under which Executive Directors and other senior 
executives are expected, within five years of appointment to build up a shareholding in the Company. In respect of Executive Directors the 
expectation is to hold at least 100% of basic salary. For the purposes of this requirement, only beneficially-owned shares will be counted. 
As at 31 December 2013, the Committee is satisfied that Executive Directors have fulfilled this requirement.
Comparison of overall performance and pay

Directors’ responsibilities statement
Responsibility of Directors for the preparation of the Annual Report and financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Board report on remuneration and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
  properly select and apply accounting policies;
  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
  make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;
  the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face; and
  the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Independent auditor’s report
To the Members of Bodycote plc
Opinion on financial statements of Bodycote plc
In our opinion:
  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union;
  the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Statement of Group and Company Accounting Policies and the related notes 1 to 28 and 1 to 11 for the Group and Company financial 
statements respectively. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is 
applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of 
the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 23 that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
  we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is 
appropriate; and
  we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Impairment of non current assets
Given the Group’s significant asset base and the continued 
macro-economic uncertainties in certain global territories, this risk 
concerns the carrying value of intangible and tangible fixed assets. 
The Group’s assessment of the carrying value of intangible and 
tangible fixed assets requires significant judgement, as described in 
note 10 with particular attention to cash flow, growth rates, discount 
rates and sensitivity assumptions. 
We challenged the assumptions used in the impairment model 
for intangible and tangible assets, described in note 10. As part 
of our procedures we considered historical trading performance 
by comparing recent growth rates of both revenue and operating 
profit across the Group’s geographical and market segments, 
assessing the appropriateness of the assumptions concerning 
growth rates and inputs to the discount rate against latest market 
expectations, and considering management’s assertions of the 
future utilisation of assets by the Group following a review of 
the strategic plan for the business by CGU. In performing our 
procedures, we used our internal valuation specialists and third 
party evidence to assess the appropriateness of the discount rate 
applied. 
Environmental provisions
Given the nature of the Group’s operations, a risk arises in 
connection with the appropriateness, completeness and valuation 
of environmental provisions, in particular, their judgemental nature 
relative to the likely period of utilisation. 
We evaluated the environmental provisions, as detailed in note 
22 to the financial statements, by testing the basis for the 
recognition of provisions in consideration of those regulatory 
and legal requirements, assessing the value of the provision 
recognised and challenging the status and utilisation of provisions. 
As part of our audit procedures we reviewed third party evidence 
and assumptions detailing the assessment of environmental 
liabilities for the Group together with correspondence from the 
Group’s internal environmental remediation team. As part of these 
procedures we also challenged the qualifications of management’s 
experts. Where applicable, we also corroborated environmental 
provisions to regulatory and legal correspondence.

Financial Statements Strategic Report 23065.02     11 March 2014 9:16 AM     Design Shell
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
T axation
The tax risk concerns the judgements and estimates applied in 
the determination of tax balances, in particular in relation to the 
recognition of deferred tax assets for tax losses across the Group 
as disclosed in note 19 and provisions for liabilities attributed to 
specific uncertain tax positions linked to the Group’s complex 
corporate structure.
In conjunction with taxation audit specialists, we have 
considered and challenged the appropriateness of management’s 
assumptions, forecasts and estimates in relation to the likelihood 
of generating future taxable, as opposed to accounting, profits to 
support the recognition of deferred tax assets as disclosed in note 
19 to the financial statements. 
We have also assessed the assumptions and judgements 
concerning the adequacy of tax provisions for uncertain tax 
positions by viewing the latest correspondence from the different 
tax authorities and drawing on the experience of our country 
specialists in respect of similar situations.
Pensions
This risk concerns the appropriateness of actuarial assumptions 
in calculating the Group’s IAS 19 liability. The valuation of the 
Group’s IAS 19 deficit involves significant judgement as described 
in note 28, in particular in relation to the discount rate, inflation and 
mortality assumptions. 
We have considered the appropriateness of the assumptions 
underpinning the valuation of scheme assets and liabilities. 
Specifically we challenged the discount rate, inflation and mortality 
assumptions applied in calculating the scheme liabilities by using 
our internal pension specialists to assess and benchmark the 
assumptions applied against comparable third party data.
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 44.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to 
express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the 
risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that 
makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would 
be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and 
in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £6.8 million, which is below 7 .5% of adjusted 
pre-tax profit and 1% of equity. We use adjusted pre-tax profit to exclude the effect of 
volatility from our determination. Adjusted pre-tax profit excludes non-recurring exceptional 
items of £0.8 million as disclosed in note 3.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit 
differences in excess of £145,000, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our 
view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on 
disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, 
including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group 
level. Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope primarily on the audit 
work at 15 locations. In addition, following the reorganisation of a number of the Group’s 
finance functions into a Shared Service Centre in Prague, we planned and performed our 
audit work and the shape of audit teams for the countries affected to focus on direct Group 
oversight, leadership and control in the first year of transition.
As a consequence of the audit scope determined, we achieved full scope coverage of 
approximately 86% of revenue, 93% of profit before tax, and 87% of net assets. Our audit 
work at each location was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity 
which was lower than Group materiality. 
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits that has been 
designed so that a senior member of the Group audit team visits each of the locations 
included as full scope for the Group audit at least once every three years and the most 
significant of them at least once a year. In years when we do not visit a significant component 
we will include the component audit team in our team briefing, discuss their risk assessment, 
attend close meetings by conference call and video conferencing and review documentation 
of the findings from their work.

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
  the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been 
made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have 
nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual 
report is:
  materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
  apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
  otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the 
audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We 
confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 
(UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. 
Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team, and reviews by our strategically focused 
second partner and independent partner.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation 
of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Group accounting policies
Year ended 31 December 2013
Basis of accounting
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The 
financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with article 4 of EU IAS Regulation as adopted for use in the EU.
The Group has adopted Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB (IFRIC). Individual standards and interpretations have to be adopted by the 
European Commission (EC) and the process leads to a delay between the issue and adoption of new standards and in some cases 
amendment by the EC.
International Financial Reporting Standards are subject to ongoing amendment by the IASB and subsequent endorsement by the EC and 
are therefore subject to change.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, with the exception of accounting for certain financial instruments. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies 
adopted are set out below.
Going concern
The directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Finance Director’s report on page 23.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling 
shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially 
be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the 
non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even 
if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying 
amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the 
subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate 
of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the 
assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained 
earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investment 
retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent 
accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when applicable, the costs on initial recognition of an 
investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors have made the following judgements 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which 
are dealt with below) and have been identified as being particularly complex or involve subjective assessments.
T axation
The Group is subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for tax. 
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the 
final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax 
provision, deferred tax provisions and income statement in the period in which such determination is made. 
70 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2013 23065.02     11 March 2014 9:16 AM     Design Shell
Provisions for environmental liabilities
The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, or in 
other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required. The provision is reviewed annually. Due to the significant uncertainty 
associated with the future level of such environmental liabilities there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the 
provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that will be incurred. The directors take account of the advice of experts in 
quantifying the expected costs of future remediation.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed 
below.
Impairment of goodwill and fixed assets
Determining whether goodwill and fixed assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to 
which the assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The carrying amount of goodwill at the 
balance sheet date was £135.7m (2012: £131 .8m). Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of impairment are set out on page 
75.
Retirement benefit schemes
Accounting for retirement benefit schemes under IAS 19 (revised) requires an assessment of the future benefits payable in accordance with 
actuarial assumptions, which are set out in note 28. Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of retirement benefit schemes are 
set out on page 73.
Goodwill on acquisition
Accounting for goodwill arising in a business combination requires an assessment of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or associate at the acquisition date. Details of the accounting policies applied in respect of 
goodwill arising on acquisition are set out on page 72.
In establishing the fair value for intangible assets recognised on acquisition and their estimated useful lives, the Group has to make 
various subjective assessments of projected data and takes account of the individual circumstances of the entity acquired. This includes 
consideration of trading data such as historic sales and profitability levels, assessment of the discount rate used to calculate present value, 
the likelihood of loss of customers, the ability of former owners to compete, together with the estimated impact of competition.
Provisions for restructuring costs
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid 
expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to 
those affected by it.
The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring which are those amounts 
that are both necessarily required by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the Group. Uncertainty arises in the 
estimation of site clean up and dilapidation costs. The Group has to make a subjective assessment of the cost involved based on previous 
experience, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in a wholly accurate prediction of the 
actual costs that may be incurred.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through 
participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. 
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net 
assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest 
in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are 
recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment. 
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited in profit and loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision is made 
for impairment.

Group accounting policies continued
Year ended 31 December 2013
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) 
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill 
is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. If after restatement, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of 
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which 
goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be 
impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated 
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis. An impairment 
loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on 
disposal. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject 
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is 
not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. 
Revenue is recognised on the completion of services rendered.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is 
the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying 
amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholder’s rights to receive payment have been established.
Other operating income represents scrap sales, rents receivable and other operating income.
The Group as lessee
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a 
finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Group as lessor
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Group’s net investment in the leases. 
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment 
outstanding in respect of the leases.

Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:
  exchange differences on transactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see pages 75 and 76); and
  exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor 
likely to occur (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation) which are recognised initially in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate 
significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of 
transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that take a substantial period of time to get ready for their 
intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
Government grants
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit and loss over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs, goodwill impairment, amortisation of acquired intangible assets and after the 
post-tax share of results of associates but before investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional items
The Group considers exceptional items to be those which derive from events or transactions which are considered significant for separate 
disclosure by virtue of their size or incidence in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the Group’s financial performance. 
These items are including, but not limited to, impairment charges and other one off items which meet this definition. 
Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are recognized as an expense when employees have rendered service 
entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined 
contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement 
benefit scheme.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect 
of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with 
a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recorded in the statement 
of comprehensive income is not recycled. Past service cost is recognized in profit or loss in the period of scheme amendment. Net – 
interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are split into three categories:
  current service cost, past-service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements;
  net – interest expense or income; and 
  remeasurement.
The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit costs within cost of sales and administrative expenses (see note 3) in its 
consolidated income statement. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past-service cost.
Net – interest expense or income is recognised within finance costs (see note 6).
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated balance sheet represents the deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined 
benefit schemes. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of 
refunds from the schemes or reductions in future contributions to the schemes.
A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit 
and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs.

Group accounting policies continued
Year ended 31 December 2013
T axation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other 
than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such 
investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to 
utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based 
on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in other comprehensive income. 
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the 
Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets 
and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction, less their residual values, 
over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Freehold buildings 2%
Leasehold property over the period of the lease
Fixtures and fittings 10%–20%
Plant and machinery 5%–20%
Motor vehicles 20%–33%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, plus appropriate borrowing costs, less any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition 
is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as 
incurred.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. 
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance 
with relevant IFRSs.
74 Bodycote plc annual report for the year ended 31 December 2013 23065.02     11 March 2014 9:16 AM     Design Shell
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
  deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in 
accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits respectively; and
  liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
Assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for trade receivables, which do not carry any 
interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement 
using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.

Group accounting policies continued
Year ended 31 December 2013
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated 
future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
Objective evidence of impairment could include:
  significant financial difficulty of the customer or counterparty; or
  default or delinquency in payments.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past 
experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as 
observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward exchange contracts, 
to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities and the financing of those activities. The Group does not use derivative 
financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on 
the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair value on the balance sheet date. Changes 
in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement are recognised immediately in the income statement. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a 
non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 
12 months.
Hedge accounting
The Group uses foreign currency debt and cross currency swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in the underlying net assets of overseas 
operations arising from foreign exchange rate movements.
The Group maintains documentation of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument at the inception of a hedging 
transaction together with the risk management objective and the strategy underlying the designated hedge. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in 
offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment 
hedges.
Note 18 sets out the details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes.
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together 
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the income statement 
relating to the hedged item.
Cash flow hedge
Cash flow hedging matches the cash flows of hedged items against the corresponding cash flow of the derivative. The effective part of any 
gain or loss on the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the hedged item is accounted for in accordance 
with the policy for that financial instrument. Any ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred 
to net profit or loss for the period.

Net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. To the extent the hedge is effective, 
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging and translation reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is 
recognised immediately in the income statement and is included in other operating expenses.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement in the event that the foreign operation is disposed of.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, when it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows 
estimated to settle the present obligation and the effect of the adjustment is material in relation to the financial statements, its carrying 
amount is the present value of those cash flows.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected 
to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is 
recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-
settled employee benefits reserve.
General information
Bodycote plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Acts 1948 to 1980. The address of the registered 
office is given on page 33.
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are included within the Group’s Strategic report.
Information on the Group’s objectives, policies and processes are included within the Group’s Strategic report.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in the Foreign Currencies accounting policy 
above.
Adoption of new and revised Standards
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted and have affected the amounts 
reported in these financial statements.
  IAS 1 (amended) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’
The Group has applied the amendments to IAS 1 titled ‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income’. The amendment increases 
the required level of disclosure within the statement of comprehensive income.
The impact of this amendment has been to analyse items within the statement of comprehensive income between items that will not be 
classified subsequently to profit or loss and items that will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss in accordance with the respective 
IFRS standard to which the item relates. The financial statements have also been amended to analyse income tax on the same basis. The 
amendments have been applied retrospectively, and hence the presentation of items of comprehensive income has been restated to reflect 
the change. Other than the above mentioned presentation changes, the application of the amendments to IAS 1 do not result in any impact 
on the profit or loss, comprehensive income and total comprehensive income.

  IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee Benefits’
In the current year, the Group has applied IAS 19 (as revised in June 2011) ‘Employee Benefits’ and the related consequential amendments. 
The Group has applied IAS 19 (revised) retrospectively and in accordance with the transitional provisions as set out in IAS 19.173. These 
transitional provisions do not have an impact on future periods. The amendments to IAS 19 change the accounting for defined benefit 
schemes and termination benefits. The most significant change relates to the accounting for changes in defined benefit obligations and 
scheme assets. The amendments require the recognition of changes in defined benefit obligations and in fair value scheme assets when 
they occur, and hence eliminate the ‘corridor approach’ permitted under the previous version of IAS 19 and accelerate the recognition of 
past service costs. All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income in order for the net 
pension asset or liability recognised in the consolidated balance sheet to reflect the full value of the scheme deficit or surplus. Furthermore, 
the interest cost and expected return on scheme assets used in the previous version of IAS 19 are replaced with a ‘net-interest’ amount 
under IAS 19 (revised), which is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. IAS 19 (revised) also 
introduces more extensive disclosures in the presentation of the defined benefit cost.
These consolidated financial statements are the first financial statements in which the Group has adopted IAS 19 (revised). IAS 19 
(revised) has been adopted retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 ‘ Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’. 
Consequently, the Group has adjusted opening equity as of 1 January 2012 and the figures for 2012 have been restated as if IAS 19 
(revised) had always been applied. The opening 2012 retirement benefit obligation, deferred tax asset and equity are £0.5m higher, £0.2m 
higher and £0.3m lower than would have been prior to the adoption of IAS 19 (revised). The 2012 retirement benefit obligation, deferred tax 
asset and equity are £0.5m higher, £0.2m higher and £0.3m lower than would have been prior to the adoption of IAS 19 (revised). For the 
current period, the consolidated income statement is £0.2m higher and other comprehensive expense is £0.2m higher than it would have 
been prior to the adoption of IAS 19 (revised). For the comparative period, the consolidated income statement is £0.2m higher and other 
comprehensive expense is £0.2m higher than it would have been prior to the adoption of IAS 19 (revised).
  IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ 
IFRS 13 establishes a single source of guidance under IFRS for all fair value measurements. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is 
required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how to measure fair value under IFRS. IFRS 13 defines fair value as an exit price. 
As a result of the guidance in IFRS 13, the Group re-assessed its policies for measuring fair values, in particular, its valuation inputs such as 
non-performance risk for fair value measurement of liabilities. IFRS 13 also requires additional disclosures.
Application of IFRS 13 has not materially impacted the fair value measurements of the Group. Additional disclosures where required, are 
provided in the individual notes relating to the assets and liabilities whose fair values were determined.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
  IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
  IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 
  IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 
  IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 
  IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements 
  IAS 28 (revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
  Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
  Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods, except as follows:
  IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of Financial Instruments.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review 
has been completed.

2. Business and geographical segments 
  The Group has in excess of 190 locations across the world serving a range of market sectors with various thermal processing services. 
The range and type of services offered is common to all market sectors.
  In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, the segmentation of Group activity reflects the way the Group is managed by the 
chief operating decision maker, being the Group Chief Executive, who on a monthly basis reviews the operating performance of six 
operating segments, split between the Aerospace, Defence & Energy (ADE) and Automotive & General Industrial (AGI) business areas, 
as follows:
  ADE – Western Europe; 
  ADE – North America; 
  ADE – Emerging markets; 
  AGI – Western Europe; 
  AGI – North America; and 
  AGI – Emerging markets. 
 The split of operating segments by geography reflects the divisional reporting structure of the Group.
  In accordance with the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8, the operating segments are aggregated into the Group’s two key business areas, 
ADE and AGI, the split being driven by customer behaviour and requirements. Customers in the ADE segment tend to operate and 
purchase more globally and have long supply chains, whilst customers in the AGI segment tend to purchase more locally and have 
shorter supply chains.
  Bodycote plants do not exclusively supply services to customers of a given market sector. Allocations of plants between ADE and AGI 
is therefore derived by reference to the preponderance of markets served.

10.  Goodwill (continued)
  The Group recorded a £4.5m adjustment to goodwill which relates to the confirmation of various preliminary estimates for acquisitions 
made in 2012. The adjustments can be summarised as deferred tax adjustments as detailed in note 19, purchase price variances 
arising from the settlement of working capital balances against target working capital amounts and amendments to fixed asset 
values following receipt of detailed third party valuations as detailed in note 12. The adjustments were made during the 12 month 
retrospective measurement period, as permitted by IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. These adjustments are not considered significant 
in relation to the financial statements.
   Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the business units that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the Group’s 
operating segments as follows:
2013 
£m 
2012
£m
ADE:
 Western Europe 26.7 26.7 
 North America 44.7 44.9 
AGI:
 Western Europe 17 .6 17 .4 
 North America 40.5 36.6 
 Emerging markets 6.2 6.2 
135.7 131 .8 
  The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
  The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for those 
calculations are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs in respect of future cash 
flows. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the cash generating units. This rate is risk adjusted, for specific countries, where the Group perceives a risk 
premium is appropriate. The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for cash generating units are between 12.3% (2012: 11 .3%) 
and 14.3% (2012: 13.3%). The recoverable amount is the sum of the discounted cash flows as forecasted for the coming five years, 
together with a further estimate of cashflows in perpetuity.
  The forecasted sales reflect management’s expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle. The expected 
profit margin reflects management’s experience of each cash generating unit’s profitability at the forecast level of sales. As outlined in 
the Business review, these forecasts take into account the current and expected economic environment both in respect of geography 
and market sectors. Cash flows after five years are based on an estimated growth rate of 3.1% (2012: 3.2%), being the historical 
weighted average growth in GDP in the markets that the Group operates in. Growth rates by cash generating unit range from 2.75% to 
6%. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. 
  If the goodwill allocated to a cash generating unit represents more than 15% of the Group’s total goodwill carrying value then the cash 
generating unit is considered to be individually significant. The Group considers the North America ADE Heat Treatment and North 
America AGI Heat Treatment cash generating units to be significant cash generating units. The long term growth rates applied to cash 
flows after five years and the rates used to discount the forecast cash flows for these significant cash generating units are shown 
below:

 North America ADE Heat Treatment 42.1 3.2 12.3 
 North America AGI Heat Treatment 40.5 3.2 12.3 
  The Group has conducted sensitivity analyses on the key assumptions applied to the value in use calculations for each cash generating 
unit. A decline in sales of 10.9% per annum in perpetuity would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill for the Group being 
reduced to its carrying value. The directors do not believe such a decline to be likely.
  Declines in sales of 36.1% and 6.5% per annum in perpetuity for North America ADE Heat Treatment and North America AGI Heat 
Treatment cash generating units, respectively, would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill for these cash generating units being 
reduced to their carrying values. The directors do not believe such declines to be likely.
  The Board has concluded that no impairment charge is required in 2013.

12. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
 The carrying amount of leased assets is £nil (2012: £0.6m).
  The Group has pledged land and buildings having a carrying amount of approximately £nil (2012: £0.5m) to secure banking facilities 
granted to the Group.
  At 31 December 2013 the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment 
amounting to £0.8m (2012: £3.7m).
 In addition to the above, property, plant and equipment amounting to £2.3m (2012: £2.1m) has been classified as held for sale.
  It is the directors view that there are no material differences between the value of the land owned and their carrying value in the 
balance sheet. 
 Following a review of the Group accounts, the Group has restated opening cost and accumulated depreciation of certain assets related  
 to acquisitions made in 2012. There is nil effect on the net book value of the Group’s property, plant and equipment.

Year ended 31 December 2013
15.  Other financial assets (continued)
 Credit risk
 The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
  The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of 
allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on 
previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
  The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit- 
ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
  The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. 
Further disclosure of the Group’s financial instrument risk management activities is set out in note 18.
  Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £17 .9m (2012: £20.6m) which are past due at 
the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts 
are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
 The average credit terms offered to customers is 41 days, with a range from 17 days to 75 days.

  In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade receivable from the 
date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being 
large and unrelated. Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for 
doubtful debts.
  Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a gross balance of £8.9m (2012: £8.9m). 
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of 
the expected proceeds. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

  Loans and finance leases of £0.3m (2012: £0.9m) were arranged at fixed interest rates and expose the Group to fair value interest rate 
risk. The remaining borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.

 The other principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
(i) Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand. No overdrafts are secured.
(ii) At 31 December 2013 the Group has two principal borrowing facilities which are secured by upstream guarantees provided by 
subsidiaries:
(a) Drawings of £nil (2012: £nil) under a Revolving Credit Facility of £125m. This unsecured facility commenced on 27 July 2011 and 
matures on 31 August 2016. The multi currency drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 1 .15% and 2.00% 
above LIBOR (the applicable margin at 31 December 2013 was 1 .15%). 
(b) Drawings of £nil (2012: £33.5m) under a Revolving Credit Facility of €125m. This unsecured facility commenced on 18 February 
2013 and matures on 1 March 2018. The multi currency drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 1 .40% and 
2.30% above LIBOR (the applicable margin at 31 December 2013 was 1 .40%).
 At 31 December 2013 the Group had available £229.0m (2012: £192.9m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
 All borrowings are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

  The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge material future transactions and cash flows. The Group uses foreign currency forward 
contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures. The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group’s 
principal markets. The unrecognised gains and losses were not significant in either 2013 or 2012.

18. Derivative financial instruments (continued)
  In accordance with IFRS 7 ‘Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments’, the Group’s financial instruments are considered to be 
classified as level 2 instruments. Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 
1 that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
  Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities 
of the contracts.
  The Group’s interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings (fair value risk) and floating rate borrowings (cash flow 
risk). From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within 
Group policy. However, at the balance sheet date, the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.

 Financial risk management
  The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and 
counterparty risk. Treasury activities have the objective of minimising risk and treasury operations are conducted within a framework of 
policies and guidelines reviewed and authorised by the Board.
  The Group uses a number of derivative instruments that are transacted, for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury 
personnel. The use of financial instruments, including derivatives, is permitted when approved by the Board, where the effect is to 
minimise risk for the Group. Speculative trading of derivatives or other financial instruments is not permitted. There has been no 
significant change during the financial year, or since the end of the year, to the types or scope of financial risks faced by the Group.
 Liquidity risk
  Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group might not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. 
Liquidity risk arises as a result of mismatches between cash inflows and outflows from the business. This risk is monitored on a 
centralised basis through regular cash flow forecasting, a three-year rolling strategic plan, an annual budget agreed by the Board each 
December and a quarterly re-forecast undertaken during the financial year. To mitigate the risk, the resulting forecast net debt/cash 
is measured against the liquidity headroom policy which, at the current net debt/cash levels, requires committed facilities (plus term 
loans in excess of one year) to exceed net debt by 50% (minimum facilities of £75m).
  As at 31 December 2013, the Group had revolving credit committed borrowing facilities of £229.0m (2012: £226.4m) which exceeded 
net cash of £15.0m (2012: net debt of £34.2m) by £244.0m (2012: £192.2m). The Group also uses uncommitted short-term bank 
facilities to manage short-term liquidity but these facilities are excluded from the liquidity headroom policy. The Group manages longer-
term liquidity through committed bank facilities and will, if appropriate, raise funds on capital markets. As at 31 December 2013 the 
Group’s principal committed bank facilities have the following maturity dates:
  £125m Revolving Credit Facility 31 August 2016 (2.7 years)
  €125m Revolving Credit Facility 1 March 2018 (4.2 years)
  $10m Letter of Credit Facility 31 August 2016 (2.7 years)
  Cash management pooling, netting and concentration techniques are used to minimise borrowings. As at 31 December 2013, the 
Group had gross cash of £16.9m (2012: £10.0m).

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
Year ended 31 December 2013
18. Derivative financial instruments (continued)
 Interest rate risk
  Interest rate risk arises on borrowings and cash balances (and derivative liabilities and assets) which are at floating interest rates. 
Changes in interest rates could have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the Group’s net profit. Under the Group’s interest 
rate management policy, the interest rates on each of the Group’s major currency monetary assets and liabilities are managed to 
achieve the desired mix of fixed and variable rates for each major net currency exposure. The major interest rate risk is to UK rates but 
exposures also exist to rates in the USA, Europe and Sweden. Measurement of this interest rate risk and its potential volatility to the 
Group’s reported financial performance is undertaken on a monthly basis and the Board uses this information to determine, from time 
to time, an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates.
  As at 31 December 2013, 18% of gross debt and 0% of gross cash were at fixed rates (2012: 2% of gross debt, 0% of gross cash).  
The average tenure of the fixed rate debt was 3.1 years (2012: 3.5 years).
 Currency risk
  Bodycote has operations in 26 countries and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange translation risk when the profits and net assets 
of these entities are consolidated into the Group accounts.
  90% of the Group’s sales are in currencies other than sterling (EUR 36%, USD 35% and SEK 7%). Cumulatively over the year, sterling 
rates moved such that the sales for the year were £14.2m better than if sales had been translated at the rates prevailing in 2012.
  It is Group policy not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits.
  The Group’s balance sheet translation policy is not to actively hedge currency net assets. However, where appropriate, the Group 
will still match centrally held currency borrowings to the net assets. The Group principally borrows in sterling but also maintains debt 
in US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona, consistent with the location of the Group’s assets. The Group recognises foreign exchange 
movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances.
  Transaction foreign exchange exposures arise when entities within the Group enter into contracts to pay or receive funds in a currency 
different from the functional currency of the entity concerned. It is Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions in foreign 
currencies when a commitment arises, usually through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts. Even though approximately 
90% of the Group’s sales are generated outside the UK, the nature of the business is such that cross border sales and purchases are 
limited and, other than interest, such exposures are immaterial for the Group.
 Market risk sensitivity analysis
  The Group has measured the estimated charge to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease 
of 1% (100 basis points) in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the 
applicable rates as at 31 December 2013, for all financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant. This analysis is for 
illustrative purposes only. The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations.
 Interest rate sensitivity
  The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions:
  changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments;
  changes in market interest rates only affect the income statement in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest if these are 
recognised at their fair value; and
  changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
  Under these assumptions, a one percentage point fall or rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group has variable 
net cash or net borrowings at 31 December 2013 would reduce or increase profit before tax by approximately £0.2m (2012: £0.4m). 
There is no significant impact on equity.
 Currency sensitivity
  Taking the 2013 sales by currency, a 10% weakening/strengthening in the 2013 cumulative average rates for all currencies versus 
sterling would have given rise to a +£61 .7m/-£50.5m movement in sales respectively. The impact on headline operating profit is 
affected by the mix of losses and profits in the various currencies.  However, taking the 2013 operating profit mix, a 10% weakening/
strengthening in 2013 cumulative average rates for all currencies would have given rise to a +£11 .7m/-£9.6m movement in headline 
operating profit.
  Counterparty risk
  Counterparty risk encompasses settlement risk on derivative financial instruments and money market contracts and credit risk on cash, 
time deposits and money market funds.  The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings (where 
applicable) and through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure there is no significant concentration of credit 
risk. Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of A-/A3 or better. However, 
acquired businesses occasionally have dealings with banks with lower credit ratings. Business with such banks is moved as soon as 
practicable.

  Other deferred tax assets relate to provisions recognised in the financial statements that are not yet deductible for tax purposes, in 
particular in relation to restructuring charges, share-based payments and local profit differences that are expected to reverse over time.
  At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £146.5m (2012: £122.3m) available for offset against future profits. A 
deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of £12.9m (2012: £18.7m) of such losses, based on management forecasts of future 
taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions. No deferred tax asset has been recognised 
in respect of the remaining £133.6m (2012: £103.6m) of such losses where there remains uncertainty over the timing of utilisation 
relating to future profitability. The majority of losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
  A deferred tax liability of £0.4m (2012: £0.3m) relating to the temporary differences on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries 
has not been recognised as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable 
that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint 
ventures are insignificant.

  The restructuring provision relates to the remaining costs associated with the closure of various Heat Treatment sites and with the 
establishment of an accounting Shared Service Centre in Prague.
  The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, 
or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required. This provision is reviewed annually and is separated into 
Restructuring Environmental and Environmental to separately identify environmental provisions relating to the restructuring programme 
from those arising in the ordinary course of business.
  The increase in restructuring provisions is due to the ongoing implementation of the global restructuring initiatives. In addition, £0.8m 
(2012: £2.4m) of reorganisation and redundancy costs have been recognised in relation to the establishment of an accounting Shared 
Service Centre in Prague.
 The majority of cash outflows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within five years.
  Whilst the Group’s use of chlorinated solvents and other hazardous chemicals continues to reduce, the Group remains exposed to 
contingent liabilities in respect of environmental remediation liabilities. In particular, the Group could be subjected to regulatory or 
legislative requirements to remediate sites in the future. However, it is not possible at this time to determine whether and to what 
extent any liabilities exist, other than for those recognised above. Therefore no provision is recognised in relation to these items.

Weighted average share price pence 157 .5 
Weighted average exercise price pence 157 .5 
Expected volatility % 42.7 
Expected life years 3.0 
Risk-free rate % 4.0 
Expected dividends % 4.3 
  Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years. 
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
 Bodycote Incentive Plan (BIP)
  The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote 
shares up to a maximum of 175% of base salary. Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year 
period.
  Fifty percent of the award is subject to a return on capital employed (ROCE) performance condition and fifty percent of the award is 
subject to an earnings per share (EPS) performance condition.
  In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest.
  Bodycote Co-investment Plan (CIP)
  The CIP permits executives to invest in shares up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary. The CIP provides for the grant of 
awards of matching shares to participants on an annual basis in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred 
shares. Deferred shares must be held for three years and matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
target. The threshold target for CIP matching awards is TSR growth of not less than 4% per annum compound in excess of growth in 
the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) for a threshold matching ratio of 1:2. Ten percent per annum compound growth in excess of growth in 
the CPI will be required for a vesting matching ratio of 1:1 .

28. Retirement benefit schemes
 Defined contribution schemes
  The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for employees in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Canada 
and the United States of America. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control 
of trustees. Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions payable by 
the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
  The Group’s employees in Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy and the Netherlands are members of state-managed retirement benefit 
schemes operated by the governments of each country. The relevant subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of 
payroll costs to the retirement benefit schemes to fund the benefits. The only obligation of the Group with respect to these retirement 
benefit schemes is to make the specified contributions.
  The total cost charged to income of £5.8m (2012: £5.1m) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the plans. As at 31 December 2013 contributions of £0.2m (2012: £0.3m) due in respect of the current 
reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
 Defined benefit schemes
  The Group operated a number of pension schemes and provided leaving service benefits to certain employees during the year. The

 Further details of the Group’s defined benefit arrangements are given in the Finance Director’s report on pages 22 and 23.
 UK scheme
  The Group sponsors the Bodycote UK Pension Scheme which is a funded defined benefit arrangement for certain UK employees, and 
pays out pensions at retirement based on service and final pensionable pay. The scheme is funded by the Group and current employee 
members. The scheme exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market (investment) risk.
  The scheme operates under UK trust law and the trust is a separate legal entity from the Group. The scheme is governed by a board 
of trustees, composed of two member representatives, two employer representatives and one independent trustee. The trustees 
are required by law to act in the best interests of scheme members and are responsible for setting certain policies (e.g. investment, 
funding) together with the Company.
  Funding of the scheme is based on a separate actuarial valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions may differ from 
the assumptions above. Funding requirements are formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule of Contributions 
and Recovery Plan agreed between the trustees and the Group. The actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out by a qualified 
independent actuary as at 6 April 2011 and updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2013.
  The contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been £1 .5m, comprising £0.4m in respect of benefit accrual and 
£1 .1m in respect of deficit recovery and ongoing expense.
  It is the policy of the Group to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside of the profit and loss 
account and in Other Comprehensive Income.

Independent auditor’s report
To the Members of Bodycote plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Bodycote plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 which comprise the 
Parent Company Balance Sheet, Company Accounting Policies and the related notes 1 to 11 . The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
  give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013;
  have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and
  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
  the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Bodycote plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 and the information 
in the Board Report on Remuneration that is described as having been audited.

Company accounting policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable law and United 
Kingdom accounting standards. The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout 
the year and the preceding year in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Company’s financial statements. In 
accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 a separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company has 
not been presented.
Going concern
The Directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Finance Director’s Report on page 23.
Investments
Investments are held at cost less provision for impairment.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period.
Pension costs
For defined benefit and defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is the 
contributions payable in the year. For further details see note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.
Leases
Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, 
are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives. The capital elements 
of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period 
of the lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding. Hire purchase transactions are dealt 
with similarly, except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The Company as lessor
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net investment in the leases. 
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Company’s net investment 
outstanding in respect of the leases.
T angible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line 
basis, to reduce the carrying value to the estimated residual value at the point of sale, at the following annual rates:
Fixtures and fittings 10% to 20%
Software 20% to 33%
Residual value is calculated on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition.
T axation
Current UK corporation tax and foreign tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the 
balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial 
statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can 
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing 
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to 
reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured 
on a discounted basis to reflect the time value of money over the period between the balance sheet date and the dates on which it is 
estimated that the underlying timing differences will reverse. The discount rates used reflect the post-tax yields to maturity that can be 
obtained on government bonds with similar maturity dates and currencies to those of the deferred tax assets or liabilities.

Company accounting policies continued
Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 ‘Related Party Transactions’ not to disclose transactions or 
balances with wholly-owned entities of the Group.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 ‘Share-based Payment’.
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight- 
line basis over the vesting period. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments 
expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if 
any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimates with a corresponding adjustment to the 
equity-settled employee benefits reserve.

employee incentive schemes when issuance of new shares is not appropriate.
  At 31 December 2013 2,035,618 (2012: 4,373,136) ordinary shares of 17 ³/11p each were held by the Bodycote International Employee 
Benefit Trust and, following recommendations by the employer, are provisionally allocated to satisfy awards under employee incentive 
schemes. The trust waives payment of dividend. The market value of these shares was £13.6m (2012: £19.8m).
 Included in other reserves is the capital redemption reserve of £129.4m (2012: £129.4m).

 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Company for its land and buildings and motor vehicles.
10. Pension commitments
  The Company participates in a Group defined benefit scheme, the details of which are disclosed in note 28 to the consolidated financial 
statements. However, the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities and has therefore accounted 
for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. Full disclosures concerning the scheme as required by IAS 19 (revised) are 
set out in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements. These also satisfy the requirements of FRS17 ‘Retirement Benefits’.
  The contributions made by the Company over the financial year to both the defined contribution and the defined benefit schemes 
amounted to £0.3m (2012: £0.2m) and £0.4m (2012: £0.4m) respectively. As at 31 December 2013, contributions of £nil (2012: £nil) due 
in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.  
11. Related party transactions
  During the current and prior year, the Company has not entered into any transactions with related parties who are not wholly-owned 
members of the Group.

Zoffany offers a range of products of the 
highest quality including wallpaper, fabrics, 
trimmings, carpets, paint and furniture. 
The designs are inspired by the rich traditions of the past, but 
look equally at home in contemporary interiors. Zoffany is 
also able to offer a bespoke custom design service on many of 
its products, collaborating with the designer and architect.
MORRIS & Co
The Morris & Co. business has a heritage that 
dates back to the mid 19th Century when  
it was founded by William Morris, the 
acclaimed designer. 
Sanderson purchased the collection of printing blocks, 
stock and complete colour records, including both unique 
logbooks and print templates of this business in 1927. This 
important collection is contained within the Sanderson 
archive and they have carefully developed the product 
range to now include hand blocked and machine print 
wallpapers, fabrics and paints.
• Overall sales stable
• Export markets growing
• UK sales reduced
• Margins improved
• Cost reduction helped 
•  Arts and craft revival fuelling growth in all  
major markets
•  International sales growing with increased distribution 
in Europe
•  The recently launched Morris IV collection (Autumn 
2005) is the latest in a long line of successful ranges and 
is complemented by the opulence of the Morris Velvet 
collection. Current trends suggest it will become the 
top selling Morris collection in 2006

Chairman’s Statement
	“ 	These	excellent	financial	results	show	that	the	restructuring	of	 	 the	Company	is	complete.	The	start	of	the	current	financial	year	 continues	to	see	all	parts	of	the	Company	trading	profitably	and	 	 we	are	confident	of	continuing	to	develop	the	Company	into	an	 exciting,	cash	generative	and	highly	profitable	business.	Your	Board	 views	the	future	with	increasing	confidence	and	looks	forward	to	 delivering	substantial	shareholder	value.”
Overview
This	has	been	a	landmark	year	in	the	recent	history	of	Walker	 Greenbank,	and	I	am	pleased	to	report	that	the	Group	has	 returned	a	full-year	operating	profit	for	the	first	time	since	 	 the	year	2000,	following	the	considerable	losses	of	the	past	 	 five	years.	The	encouraging	return	to	operating	profit	that	 	 I	reported	at	the	half-year	stage	gathered	momentum	in	the	 second	half.	This	significant	achievement	underlines	the	Board’s	 strategy	of	re-establishing	the	Group	as	a	profitable	and	cash-
generative	business	with	an	exciting	and	sustainable	future.
The	business	is	now	fully	benefiting	from	the	total	integration	 of	Sanderson	within	the	Group	and	the	considerable	 investment	in	product	that	has	taken	place	in	this	brand	over	 the	past	two	years.	Profits	have	been	further	enhanced	by	the	 full-year	effect	of	the	considerable	cost	savings	that	have	been	 achieved	following	the	amalgamation	of	all	the	Group’s	brands	 under	the	control	of	one	management	structure	and	the	exit	 	 of	low	margin	non-core	business.	 All	parts	of	the	Group’s	business	have	traded	profitably.	After	a	 difficult	start	to	the	year,	Standfast,	our	fabric -printing	factory,	 recovered	strongly	in	the	second	half	and	posted	a	full-year	 profit.	Significant	progress	has	also	been	made	at	Anstey,	 	 our	wallpaper	factory,	following	the	reorganisation	and	cost-
reduction	exercise	that	took	place	in	the	latter	part	of	last	 	 year	and	the	refocus	of	the	business	at	the	premium	end	of	 	 the	market.	This,	combined	with	the	return	to	popularity	 	 of	wallpaper	at	the	premium	end	of	the	market,	as	the 	 fashion	for	minimalism	has	started	to	wane,	has	returned	 Anstey	to	profitability	for	the	first	time	in	six	years.
Our	brands	have	all	performed	strongly.	Harlequin,	our	mid-
market	brand,	is	gaining	real	momentum	through	increasingly	 rapid	sales	growth,	gains	in	market	share	and	more	than	a	 doubling	of	its	profits	during	the	year.	Harlequin	and	Sanderson	 are	among	the	leading	suppliers	of	home	furnishings	to	 	 the	John	Lewis	Partnership.	Sanderson	has	taken	longer	 	 to	reinvigorate	than	we	anticipated	at	the	time	of	acquisition.	 However,	following	the	substantial	investment	in	product	of	 the	past	two	years,	significant	profit	growth	has	been	achieved	 this	year.	Following	the	appointment	of	a	new	design	director,	 and	the	refocusing	of	the	Zoffany	brand	back	to	its	core	values,	 progress	has	been	made	in	re-establishing	the	business	as	a	 leading	brand	at	the	premium	end	of	the	market.
In	line	with	the	Group’s	strategy	of	disposing	of	non-core	assets,	 the	sale	of	Borge	Holding	AS	was	successfully	completed	in	 June	2005.
Results
The	operating	profit	for	the	year	was	£5,018,000	(2005:	 operating	loss	£2,690,000).	Turnover	was	up	0.8%	from	 continuing	operations,	after	the	impact	of	the	sale	of	the	 Sanderson	retail	activity	and	the	exit	from	Anstey’s	low-margin	 Cirka	business	part	way	through	last	year.	The	operating	profit	 from	continuing	operations	was	£758,000	(2005:	operating	loss	 £3,062,000).	The	profit	on	ordinary	activities	before	tax	was	 £2,625,000	(2005:	loss	£807,000).	This	was	after	charging	the	 profit	and	loss	in	the	current	year	with	an	exceptional	loss	on	 the	sale	of	Borge	Holding	AS	of	£1,281,000,	which	included	 £1,908,000	for	goodwill	previously	written	off	to	reserves	and	 after	crediting	the	profit	and	loss	with	£4,076,000	from	the	 successful	outcome	of	the	pension	liability	reduction	exercise.	 Last	year’s	pre-tax	loss	of	£807,000	included	an	exceptional	 profit	of	£2,931,000	arising	from	sale	of	the	Warner	Archive	 	 and	freehold	property	in	Milton	Keynes.
The	profit	per	share	for	the	year	was	4.51p	(2005:	loss	per	 	 share	1.48p).
The	other	finance	charge	for	the	year	was	£174,000	 	 (2005:	£205,000)	as	a	result	of	the	improved	return	 	 on	assets	of	the	pension	scheme.
Pensions
During	 the	 year,	 the	 Group	 offered	 to	 buy	 out	 the	 right	 to	 	 non-statutory	 pension	 increases	 from	 its	 active	 and	 deferred	 pensioners.	 This	 proposal	 proved	 to	 be	 attractive	 to	 the	 members	 with	 a	 70%	 acceptance	 rate.	 This	 has	 resulted	 in	 a	 reduction	 in	 the	 FRS	 17	 liability	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 of	 £5,634,000	 and	 a	 benefit	 of	 £4,076,000	 in	 the	 profit	 and	 loss,	 disclosed	 as	 an	 exceptional	 operating	 item.	 Additionally,	 the	 Board	 decided	 to	 take	 this	 opportunity	 to	 adopt	 the	 most	 up-to-date	 mortality	 tables	 in	 the	 FRS	 17	 calculation,	 which	 caused	 the	 deficit	 to	 increase	 by	 £3,196,000.	 The	 Financial	 Review	 contains	 more	 details	 of	 the	 changes	 to	 our	 FRS	 17	 pension	 deficit.	 Since	the	year	end,	additional	acceptances	have	been	received	 from	the	members	of	the	pension	scheme	that	have	reduced	 the	pension	deficit	by	a	further	£800,000.

Balance sheet
The	net	assets	of	the	Group	have	increased	by	£1,527,000.	This	 has	been	primarily	driven	by	the	reduction	of	the	pension	 deficit	following	the	settlement	of	liabilities	which	improved	 the	net	assets	of	the	Group	by	£4,076,000,	offset	by	the	 adoption	of	the	most	up-to-date	mortality	tables,	with	 	 an	impact	of	£3,196,000.	The	Group	also	disposed	of	Borge	 Holdings	AS	during	the	year	for	net	proceeds	of	£1,498,000	 	 and	profit	on	sale	of	assets	of	£532,000.
The	Group’s	net	indebtedness	reduced	during	the	year	by	 £1,389,000	to	£9,357,000	(2005:	£10,746,000).	Cash	inflow	from	 operating	activities	was	£1,643,000	(2005:	outflow	£4,060,000)	 after	payments	to	pensioners	of	£950,000	as	part	of	the	 settlement	of	liabilities.	This	cash	inflow	from	operating	 activities	was	principally	driven	from	the	operating	profit,	 working	capital	inflows	and	the	Group’s	depreciation	charge	 being	significantly	higher	than	capital	expenditure.	The	 proceeds	of	the	sale	of	Borge	Holdings	AS	reduced	the	total	 level	of	borrowings.	 Dividend
The	Directors	do	not	recommend	the	payment	of	a	dividend	 	 at	this	point	in	the	Group’s	recovery.
People
During	the	period,	Peter	Harkness	resigned	as	a	Non-executive	 Director	after	more	than	four	years’	service.	In	July,	Alan	Dix	was	 appointed	Group	Finance	Director	after	spending	seven	 months	as	Finance	Director	Designate.	 I	would	like	to	take	this	opportunity	to	thank	all	our	employees	 whose	energy,	ability	and	commitment	have	helped	to	restore	 the	Group’s	fortunes.
Outlook
The	reorganisation	of	the	Group	and	the	integration	of	 Sanderson	is	now	fully	complete.	Our	factories	have	been	 restructured	and	are	now	both	trading	profitably.	The	 substantial	investment	in	product	and	creativity	of	our	design	 teams	have	helped	our	brands	to	gain	market	share	and	to	 grow	at	a	considerable	pace.
We	have	gone	a	long	way	to	addressing	the	structural	issues	 	 on	the	balance	sheet.	The	pension	reduction	liability	exercise	 has	already	reduced	the	deficit	by	a	significant	amount.	Our	 funding	facility	with	Burdale	Financial	Ltd,	part	of	the	Bank	 	 of	Ireland,	has	greatly	supported	us	in	creating	the	headroom	 within	the	business	to	invest	strongly	in	our	brands.
Our	brands	have	gathered	real	momentum	and	are	all	at	 	 an	exciting	point	in	their	development.	There	are	many	 opportunities	for	continuing	to	leverage	our	brand	portfolio	 through	additional	organic	growth,	expansion	through	 investment	in	the	contract	and	commercial	markets	and	 further	exposure	to	the	large	North	American	market.	The	 Group	is	also	alert	to	the	acquisition	opportunities	that	can	 arise	in	a	large,	fragmented	market	that	is	ripe	for	consolidation.	 The	start	of	the	current	financial	year	continues	to	see	all	parts	 of	the	business	trading	profitably,	considerably	ahead	of	last	 year	and	well	ahead	of	our	own	internal	projections.
We	are	confident	of	continuing	to	develop	the	Group	into	an	 exciting,	cash-generative	and	highly	profitable	business.	Your	 Board	views	the	future	with	increasing	confidence	and	looks	 forward	to	delivering	substantial	shareholder	value.

Chief Executive’s Review
“	The	restructuring	of	the	Group	and	successful	turnaround	of	a	 	 loss	making	business	is	now	complete.	This	has	helped	to	deliver	 	 a	better	quality	of	earnings	on	a	stable	turnover	together	with	 significant	cost	reductions	leading	to	a	corporate	profit	for	the	 	 first	time	in	5	years.	All 	 parts	 of	 the	 Group	 are	 now	 trading	 profitably	 and	 there	 are	 considerable	 growth	 opportunities	 for	 the	 Group	 to	 	 exploit	 in	 the	 future.”
The brands
Harlequin
Harlequin	has	continued	to	strengthen	its	position	as	the	 leading	mid-market	contemporary	brand	in	the	UK	and	has	 reinforced	its	position	as	one	of	the	leading	home	furnishings	 suppliers	to	the	John	Lewis	Partnership.	It	continues	to	expand	 its	launches	across	a	broad	range	of	excellent	products	and	 	 to	take	market	share	from	its	competitors.	This	year	has	seen	 strong	growth	in	its	wallpaper	sales	for	the	first	time	in	a	 number	of	years	as	the	fashion	trend	for	wallpaper	at	the	 premium	end	of	the	market	feeds	down	into	the	mid-market.	 Decadence,	a	wallpaper	collection	launched	at	the	start	of	the	 year,	has	become	the	single	best-selling	range	within	the	brand’s	 portfolio.	With	its	increasingly	strong	product	offer,	Harlequin	 was	relaunched	in	the	US	at	the	start	of	the	year	in	a	limited	 number	of	targeted	states.	The	growth	in	the	US	is	ahead	of	our	 expectations	and	on	the	back	of	this	we	will	continue	to	further	 expand	in	the	US	in	the	current	year.	Overall	sales	gathered	real	 momentum	in	the	second	half	leading	to	year	on	year	growth	 of	13%.	Margins	have	improved	and	costs	have	been	tightly	 controlled	leading	to	more	than	a	doubling	of	profits	this	year.	 Zoffany
Zoffany	overall	has	maintained	its	sales	in	line	with	last	year.	 Sales	in	the	UK	have	reduced	very	slightly	compared	with	last	 year	while	export	sales	have	continued	to	grow.	Despite	the	 	 flat	 sales,	 margins	 are	 slightly	 up	 and	 following	 the	 amalgamation	 of	its	back-office	functions	with	Sanderson	at	a	single	site	in	 Denham,	the	business	has	benefited	from	the	full-year	effect	 	 of	considerable	cost	savings	that	have	helped	profit	improve	 significantly	over	last	year.	With	the	appointment	of	a	new	 design	team	at	Zoffany	in	the	second	half	of	the	year	to 	 January	2005,	the	business	has	been	put	onto	a	sound	footing	 to	refocus	the	brand	back	to	its	core	values.	The	new	 collections	for	2006	have	been	well	received,	but	with	most	 markets	remaining	tight,	we	see	the	current	year	as	a	year	 	 of	consolidation	before	Zoffany	returns	to	any	significant	 	 upward	trend	in	sales.
Arthur Sanderson & Sons incorporating the  
Morris & Co brand
This	has	been	a	very	encouraging	year	for	Sanderson.	The	 considerable	investment	that	has	taken	place	over	the	last	two	 years	 has	 started	 to	 drive	 sales.	 The	 sales	 growth	 seen	 in	 the	 first	 half	aided	by	the	launch	in	the	early	part	of	the	year	of	Options	 9,	Sanderson’s	flagship	collection,	has	continued	in	the	second	 half,	helping	Sanderson	to	gain	year-on-year	sales	growth	of	 10%.	Sales	in	the	UK	led	the	improvement	in	the	year	and	 export	markets	are	now	showing	similar	growth.	Licensing	 revenues	have	grown	16%,	driven	by	considerable	growth	from	 our	bedding	licensee,	a	partnership	that	was	established	during	 the	previous	year,	and	healthy	growth	from	our	established	 agreements	in	the	Far	East	and	Australasia.	This	progress	has	 been	augmented	by	new	licence	arrangements	with	a	furniture	 and	blind	manufacturer.	Margins	have	improved,	so	with	the	 benefits	of	the	restructuring	that	took	place	at	the	end	of	last	 year	and	the	merging	of	the	back-office	activities	with	Zoffany,	 a	more	than	doubling	of	profits	has	been	achieved.	The	brand	 continues	to	gain	momentum	and	we	are	confident	that	it	will	 deliver	continued	profit	growth	in	the	future.	 Manufacturing
Anstey
Anstey	has	achieved	the	transformation	into	a	profit-making	 business	after	six	years	of	significant	losses.	This	has	been	the	 direct	result	of	refocusing	the	business	to	a	producer	at	the	mid	 to	premium	end	of	the	market,	significantly	improving	factory	 efficiencies	and	further	cost	reductions.	There	has	been	a	4%	 decline	in	headline	revenues	but	this	is	due	to	the	exiting	of	 lower-margin	business.	Overall	underlying	sales	for	the	year	 have	remained	static.	However,	sales	in	the	second	half	have	 increased	by	7%	as	Anstey	starts	to	benefit	from	the	 considerable	revival	in	trend	for	wallpaper	at	the	upper	end	of	 the	market.	This	move	in	fashion	is	now	starting	to	filter	down	 into	the	mid-market	as	demonstrated	by	Harlequin’s	recent	 wallpaper	revival	and	this	augurs	well	for	the	continued	revival	 of	Anstey.
Standfast
Sales	at	Standfast	have	increased	year	on	year	by	4%.	The	 difficult	trading	conditions	of	the	first	quarter	were	not	 repeated	during	the	remainder	of	the	year	and	the	ground	lost	 in	that	period	was	more	than	made	up	in	the	second	half.	 Morris Volume IV from Morris & Co. Walker Greenbank PLC Annual Reports and Accounts 2006  Walker Greenbank PLC Annual Reports and Accounts 2006  Walker Greenbank PLC Annual Reports and Accounts 2006  Margins	have	been	broadly	maintained	despite	significantly	 higher	energy	costs.	Overhead	costs	have	been	tightly	 controlled	leading	to	an	overall	improvement	in	profitability.
Overseas
USA
Sales	have	reduced	5%	in	local	currency	year-on-year,	following	 the	cessation	of	low-margin	third-party	distribution	business.	 As	a	consequence	of	this,	margins	have	risen	and	this,	 combined	with	the	full-year	effect	of	the	overhead	reduction	 following	the	amalgamation	of	the	Sanderson	and	Zoffany	 businesses	last	year,	returned	the	business	to	profitability.	Sales	 have	benefited	from	the	relaunch	of	the	Harlequin	brand	in 	 	a	limited	number	of	states.	This	has	performed	ahead	of	our	 expectations	and	the	relaunch	will	be	further	extended	in	the	 coming	year.
The	withdrawal	from	a	third-party	distribution	arrangement	 with	a	furniture	manufacturer	has	allowed	us	to	amalgamate	 our	Zoffany	and	Sanderson	showrooms	into	a	single,	prestigious	 6,000ft	showroom	promoting	all	our	brands	within	the	D&D	 building	in	Manhattan,	New	York.	This,	combined	with	 continued	investment	in	the	American	market,	will	present	the	 business	with	considerable	growth	opportunities	in	the	future.	 Europe
Borge	Holding	AS	in	Norway	was	sold	during	the	year	 generating	a	profit	on	sale	of	£532,000	and	a	release	of	the	 	 FRS	17	pension	provision	of	£95,000.	Goodwill	previously	 written	off	to	reserves	of	£1,908,000	was	charged	through	the	 profit	and	loss	account.	Borge	Holding	AS	had	contributed	 £184,000	operating	profit	during	the	year.
Our	distribution	businesses	for	Zoffany	in	Rome	and	Sanderson	 in	Paris	broadly	broke	even	in	line	with	expectations,	although	 they	do	not	represent	a	large	part	of	the	Group.
Summary
The	restructuring	of	the	Group	and	successful	turnaround	of	 	 a	loss-making	business	is	now	complete.	This	has	helped	to	 deliver	a	better	quality	of	earnings	on	a	stable	turnover	together	 with	significant	cost	reductions	leading	to	a	corporate	profit	for	 the	first	time	in	five	years.
All	parts	of	the	Group	are	now	trading	profitably	and	there	are	 considerable	growth	opportunities	for	the	Group	to	exploit	in	 the	future.

Financial Review
Profit and loss 
The	profit	and	loss	account	has	been	set	out	in	a	columnar	 format	this	year.	This	presentation	has	been	adopted	in	order	 	 to	reflect	more	clearly	the	successful	impact	of	the	pension	 deficit	reduction	exercise	and	disposal	during	the	year	of	 	 Borge	Holdings	AS.	More	importantly,	this	disclosure	clearly	 demonstrates	the	improvement	in	the	profitability	of	the	 continuing	business	over	last	year.	Full	details	of	the	pension	 deficit	reduction	and	Borge	Holdings	AS	disposal	are	disclosed	 in	note	3	and	note	4,	respectively.
Disposals
During	the	year,	the	Group	sold	the	non-core	business	of	 	 Borge	Holding	AS	and	its	subsidiary	John	O	Borge	AS.	There	 was	a	profit	on	disposal	after	related	costs	of	£532,000.	 	 Under	FRS	17,	the	Group	accounts	showed	a	pension	liability	 associated	with	the	John	O	Borge	business,	although	under	 Norwegian	accounting	rules	there	was	a	small	pension	 	 surplus.	As	a	consequence	of	the	sale	this	liability,	£95,000	 	 is	no	longer	required	and	has	been	released.	Goodwill	 previously	written	off	to	reserves	was	expensed	in	the	profit	 and	loss	as	required	by	FRS 	 10.	 The	 goodwill	 was	 directly	 credited	 back	 to	 reserves	 as	 seen	 in	 the	 Reconciliation	 of	 Movements	 in	 Shareholders’	 Funds.
Operating cash flow
There	has	been	a	cash	inflow	from	operating	activities	during	 the	period	of	£1,643,000	due	to	the	operating	profit,	the	 depreciation	charge	during	the	period	continuing	to	be	 	 greater	than	required	capital	expenditure	and	a	reduction	 	 in	working	capital.
Net	cash	receipts	from	the	sale	of	Borge	Holding	AS	and	its	 subsidiary	 John	 O	 Borge	 AS	 of	 £1,498,000	 have	 helped	 to	 reduce	 the	Group’s	borrowings.
The	Group	made	payments	to	the	pension	schemes	of	 £799,000	to	reduce	the	deficit,	and	this	is	part	of	the	ongoing	 planned	reduction.	There	were	also	payments	made	to	the	 majority	of	active	and	deferred	pensioners	of	£950,000	as	these	 pensioners	accepted	an	offer	from	the	Group	to	buy	out	the	 right	to	non-statutory	pension	increases.	At	the	year	end	there	 were	liabilities	of	£608,000	associated	with	the	pension	 reduction	exercise.	These	covered	the	tax	that	had	been	held	 on	payments	made	to	pensioners	during	the	year	awaiting	 	 tax	clearance,	and	acceptances	received	in	January	2006	and	 paid	in	February	together	with	associated	fees.	Since	the	year	 end	tax	clearance	has	been	received	and	payments	made	of	 	 tax	withheld.	 As	a	consequence,	net	debt	in	the	Group	has	reduced	by	 £1,389,000	to	£9,357,000	(2005:	£10,746,000).
Pension deficit
The	pension	deficit	has	reduced	significantly	this	year.	The	 major	factor	was	the	reduction	arising	from	the	settlement	 	 of	liabilities	of	£5,634,000.	Contributions	from	the	Company	 further	reduced	the	liability	by	£799,000.	The	Group	has	 adopted	the	PA92	mortality	tables	when	computing	the	FRS	17	 liability,	 and	 this	 has	 lead	 to	 an	 increase	 in	 the	 deficit	 of	 £3,196,000.

Gearing 
The	gearing	level	for	the	Group	remained	similar	to	last	year,	 being	56.4%	at	January	2006	compared	to	58.4%	at	January	 2005,	after	adjusting	for	the	pension	liability.	The	Group’s	 balance	sheet	remains	underpinned	by	freehold	properties	 valued	at	£5	million.
Funding
The	Group	utilises	a	facility	provided	by	Burdale	Financial	Ltd	 part	of	the	Bank	of	Ireland.	It	is	a	three-year	facility	that	 commenced	on	23	July	2004	with	a	limit	of	£18.5m.	A	 significant	element	of	the	facility	is	linked	to	working	capital	 levels,	which	allows	the	Group	to	manage	its	cash	more	 Walker Greenbank PLC Annual Reports and Accounts 2006 15
effectively	during	the	seasonal	fluctuations	in	working	capital	 associated	with	the	industry	in	which	the	Group	operates.	 All	of	the	bank’s	facilities	remain	secured	by	first	fixed	and	 floating	charges	over	the	Group’s	assets.	 Interest
The	Group	has	continued	to	maintain	its	debt	in	floating	rate	 instruments	in	order	to	benefit	from	the	lower	rates	available.	 This	policy	remains	constantly	under	review	to	ensure	interest	 rate	risk	is	minimised.
Taxation
The	Group	tax	charge	continues	to	reflect	the	amounts	 	 borne	in	foreign	territories.	This	is	constantly	under	review	 	 to	ensure	every	opportunity	is	considered	to	minimise	 	 the	amount	incurred.	In	the	UK,	the	Group	has	substantial	 brought	forward	tax	trading	losses	and,	as	a	consequence,	does	 	 not	anticipate	paying	UK	corporation	tax	in	the	foreseeable	 future.	It	will	be	the	Group’s	intention	to	reflect	a	deferred	tax	 asset	in	the	future	as	the	Group	demonstrates	its	continuing	 improving	profitability.	 Treasury policy
The	 Group’s	 treasury	 policy	 is	 controlled	 centrally	 in	 accordance	 with	procedures	approved	by	the	Board.	It	is	run	prudently	as	a	 central	Group	function,	providing	services	to	the	other	Group	 companies	and	adopts	a	risk	adverse	strategy.
The	main	risks	covered	by	this	policy	are	interest	rate	risk,	 foreign	currency	risk	and	liquidity	risk.
Interest rate risk
During	the	year,	the	Group	has	reduced	its	fixed	rate	finance	 lease	borrowings	from	£251,000	to	nil,	thereby	eliminating	the	 proportion	of	fixed	rate	borrowings	used	by	the	Group.	All	 other	borrowings	are	on	a	floating	rate.	The	viability	of	hedging	 instruments	that	would	limit	the	impact	of	interest	rate	 movements	will	continue	to	be	reviewed	based	on	the	 	 Board’s	perception	of	future	rate	increases.
Foreign currency risk
All	foreign	currencies	are	bought	and	sold	centrally	on	behalf	of	 the	Group.	Regular	reviews	take	place	of	the	foreign	currency	 cash	flows	and	any	unmatched	exposures	are	covered	by	 forward	contracts	wherever	economically	practical.
The	Group	does	not	trade	in	financial	instruments	and	hedges	 are	only	used	for	known	cash	flows.	This	has	resulted	in	there	 being	no	significant	gains	and	losses.
Liquidity risk
The	Group	ensures	that	it	has	adequate	facilities	available	to	 cover	both	its	short-term	and	medium-term	commitments.	 These	are	fully	disclosed	in	note	23	on	pages	34	to	36.
Going concern
The	Directors	are	confident,	after	having	made	appropriate	 enquiries,	that	the	Group	and	Company	have	adequate	 resources	to	continue	in	the	foreseeable	future.	For	this	reason,	 they	continue	to	adopt	the	going	concern	basis	in	preparing	 the	accounts.
Restatement
In	prior	year	the	Group	had	charged	amortisation	of	issue	 	 costs	of	finance	of	£32,000	against	operating	profit.	In	the	 	 year,	this	has	been	reclassified	to	net	interest	payable	requiring	 restatement	of	the	prior	year	comparatives.
IFRS
The	Group	will	adopt	IFRS	for	the	year	ending	31	January	2008,	 and	its	first	reporting	under	the	new	accounting	rules	will	be	for	 the	interim	period	ending	31	July	2007.	The	Board	commenced	 a	 project	 during	 the	 year	 to	 ensure	 the	 successful	 implementation	 of	IFRS	accounting	rules	for	the	year	ending	31	January	2008.

Report of the Directors continued Walker Greenbank PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 19
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of  
the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit and loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
(i) select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
(ii) make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
(iii) state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed; and
(iv) prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the website, and legislation in the UK concerning the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdiction.
The Directors confirm that they have prepared these financial statements under the above requirements.
Directors’ Responsibilities Walker Greenbank PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 20
Independent Auditor’s Report to	 the	 Members	 of	 Walker	 Greenbank	 PLC
We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’) of Walker Greenbank Plc for the year ended  
31 January 2006, which comprise the Group Profit and Loss Account, the Balance Sheets, the Group Cash Flow Statement, the Statement of Total 
Recognised Gains and Losses and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards  
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any  
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by 
law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. This other 
information comprises only the Report of Directors, the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s Review and Financial Review. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of 
the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements:
 give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the Group’s and the parent 
company’s affairs as at 31 January 2006 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended; and
have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Notes to the Accounts
1 Accounting policies 
Accounting convention
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Companies  
Act 1985.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 January 2006. 
Transactions arising on trading between Group undertakings are excluded.
No profit and loss account is presented for Walker Greenbank PLC as provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. A loss of £1,837,500 
(2005: profit £1,466,000) has been dealt with in the accounts of the parent company.
Goodwill and intangible assets
For acquisitions made before 1 February 1998, goodwill representing the excess of the cost of acquisition of a business over the fair value of the net 
assets at the date of acquisition was written off to reserves. On subsequent disposal of all or part of these businesses, the appropriate proportion of 
goodwill is charged to the profit and loss account on disposal.
For acquisitions since 1 February 1998, goodwill representing the excess of the cost of acquisition of a business over the fair value of the net assets at 
the date of acquisition is capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years.
In the opinion of the Directors, the Arthur Sanderson and William Morris archive has an indefinite economic life and is not, therefore, subject 
to annual amortisation. The carrying value of this asset will be reviewed annually and provision made for any impairment in the carrying value  
if required.
Fixed assets
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis on the original cost (excluding freehold land) after deduction of any estimated residual value.  
The principal annual rates are:
Freehold buildings 2% 
Short leaseholds Over the unexpired period of the lease
Plant, equipment and vehicles  Between 5% and 33%
Computer assets Between 12.5% and 33% 
Land and buildings are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill
Fixed assets and goodwill are subject to review for impairment in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No.11. Any impairment is 
recognised in the profit and loss account in the year in which it occurs.
Financial instruments
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates ruling at the date of transaction or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate. All differences 
are taken to the profit and loss account. Full disclosure of the Group’s treasury policy is detailed on page 15.
Foreign currency
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The profit and loss 
accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange applicable to the accounting period. Exchange differences arising on translation of the 
opening net assets and results of overseas operations and on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Group’s investment  
in such operations, are dealt with through reserves.
Employee share option plan
Under UITF 38, interest in own shares are reclassified from fixed asset investments to profit and loss reserves.
Turnover
The Group turnover represents the invoiced value of sales to external customers excluding VAT and is recognised at the point of despatch of goods.
Royalty income
Royalties are received from licence holders under the terms of various agreements. Royalties are recognised as other operating income as they  
fall due.
Stocks
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, on a first-in, first-out basis, and 
direct labour, plus attributable production overheads based on a normal level of activity. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling prices less 
anticipated costs of disposal. Provision is made for any slow moving and obsolete items. Walker Greenbank PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 26
Notes to the Accounts continued
1 Accounting policies continued 
Pensions
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. The cost of providing retirement pensions and related benefits is 
charged to the profit and loss account in the period in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No.17, any surplus or deficit of assets over 
liabilities is recognised at the balance sheet date.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The interest element 
of the rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance 
of capital repayments outstanding. Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account as they are incurred.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, that give rise to 
an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less. No provision has been made for any further liability arising from the distribution  
of past earnings of subsidiary undertakings. Deferred tax assets are recognised in the accounts, when it is more likely than not that they will be 
recovered in the foreseeable future.
The deferred tax provision has been calculated using the average rates that are expected to apply when the timing differences reverse and the 
liability has not been discounted.

Exceptional items
During the year the Group bought out the right to non-statutory pension increases from its active and deferred pensioners. This has resulted in  
a reduction of the FRS 17 liability in the balance sheet of £5,634,000 and a benefit of £4,076,000 in the profit and loss account.
The operating loss in the year ended 31 January 2005 included £670,000 of items of a one-off non-recurring nature relating to the integration  
of the Sanderson business within the Group. This comprised £191,000 redundancy costs incurred in combining the Zoffany and Sanderson US 
operations, £295,000 redundancy costs relating to the combining of the Sanderson and Zoffany UK divisions onto one site, £127,000 removal  
costs and costs of terminating a property lease at the Zoffany UK site, and £57,000 of cost incurred in transferring Sanderson stock to the Group’s

The Arthur Sanderson and William Morris archive was purchased as part of the acquisition of Arthur Sanderson & Sons on 29 August 2003.  
It comprises an historic record of unique designs that are used to generate a significant royalty income in the business. The Directors believe  
that the valuation of this asset is substantially in excess of the £4,300,000; however, it has been capped at this level, in accordance with FRS 10, 
to avoid the creation of negative goodwill on acquisition.

Borrowing facilities
In July 2004, the Group agreed terms for a new facility from Burdale Financial Limited replacing the HSBC overdraft. The three year facility comprises 
a loan secured on the Group’s freehold property of £2 million which is being repaid on a five year profile and a facility capped at £18.5 million that 
will fluctuate depending on the level of the UK debtors and stock against which it is secured. In May 2005 the Group agreed an additional facility 
from Burdale Financial Limited secured on manufacturing plant and equipment of £655,000, which is being repaid on a five year profile. The 
utilisation of the facility at the year end was £10,198,000 (2005: £11,644,000).
The fair value of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying value due to all borrowings being subject to a floating rate. 
Gains and losses on hedges
There were no significant unrecognised or deferred gains and losses on hedges at 31 January 2006 or 31 January 2005.

31 Pension
The Company operates the following funded pension schemes in the UK: the Walker Greenbank Pension Plan, the Abaris Holdings Limited Pension 
Scheme and the WG Senior Management Pension Scheme. The Walker Greenbank Pension Plan is the biggest scheme. All schemes contain defined 
benefit sections. However, the Abaris Holdings Limited Pension Scheme also contains a defined contribution section, although this section is 
relatively small.
The pension cost charged to operating profit before exceptional items under FRS 17 “Retirement Benefits” for the year amounts to £459,000 (2005: 
£518,000). This charge is equal to the service cost of £167,000 (2005: £226,000) in respect of the defined benefit arrangements, plus contributions of 
£292,000 (2005: £292,000) paid by the Company in respect of the defined contribution arrangements. The exceptional item of £4,076,000 charged 
to the operating profit relates to the net benefit of the settlement of non-statutory pension payments. Except where stated otherwise, the 
remainder of this FRS 17 pension note relates only to the defined benefit arrangements.
During the year the Group offered to buy out the right to non-statutory pension increases from its active and deferred pensioners. This has resulted 
in a reduction in the FRS 17 liability in the balance sheet of £5,634,000 and a benefit of £4,076,000 in the profit and loss, disclosed as an exceptional 
operating item. Additionally the Board decided to take this opportunity to adopt the most up-to-date mortality tables in the FRS 17 calculation 
which caused the deficit to increase by £3,196,000. 
A full FRS 17 actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 January 2006 by a qualified independent actuary. The main assumptions used by the actuary 
for the purposes of FRS 17 were:
Financial assumptions applied when valuing the defined benefit schemes:
	 	 	 	 2006	 2005	 2004
Valuation method   	 Projected	 unit Projected unit Projected unit
Discount rate    5.0% 5.5% 5.75%
Inflation rate    2.9% 2.8% 2.8%
Increases to pensions in payment    2.9% 2.8% 2.8%
Salary increases    2.9% 2.8% 2.8%
The assumptions used by the actuary are best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, 
may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

The fair value of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they 
are realised, and the present value of the schemes’ liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently 
uncertain, were:

Volatility of FRS 17
It should be noted that the methodology and assumptions prescribed for the purposes of FRS 17 mean that the disclosures will be inherently 
volatile, varying greatly according to investment market conditions at each accounting date.

Actuarial gain/(loss)     297 (1,110)
Deficit at end of period     (7,981) (11,269)
It should be noted that the UK schemes are closed to new entrants and so the use of the projected unit valuation method required by FRS 17 
means that the current service cost (as a proportion of members’ earnings) is likely to increase as members approach retirement.
During the year, the Company contributed to the Walker Greenbank Pension Plan at the rate of 4.6% of pensionable salaries, plus additional 
amounts of £77,250 per month for the first two months, and £57,000 per month for the remaining 10 months (as allowed by the Pensions Regulator 
as part of the application to extend the Schedule of Contributions). The Company paid contributions in line with the Schedule of Contributions to 
the WG Senior Management Scheme and Abaris Holdings Limited Pension Scheme.
A deferred tax asset has not been offset against this potential liability because of carried forward tax losses that are not expected to be fully utilised 
in the foreseeable future. Walker Greenbank PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 42

After the year end there have been additional confirmed acceptances of the Group’s offer to buy out the non-statutory pension increases.  
The effect of this is a further reduction in the pension liability of £0.8m.

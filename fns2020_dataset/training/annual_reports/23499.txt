How EnQuest creates value: Track record
Turning maturing field decline into production  
growth and economic field life extension
EnQuest field optimisation: In the current oil price environment in which development of  
new production is constrained, EnQuest’s low cost approach is a competitive advantage. 
  For more on EnQuest’s low cost  
approach see pages 07, 15, 16, 17
EnQuest is the right company to turn around the performance of maturing assets, assets which had high operating costs and low levels 
of production efficiency before EnQuest took over operatorship. Here are four ‘before’ and ‘after’ examples, showing how EnQuest has 
increased production in each case. 
In 2010, EnQuest’s work programme for 
Thistle included modern seismic, the 
successful reactivation of the old drill rig, 
the drilling of new wells, a major power 
supply upgrade, the introduction of new 
and simplified process controls and safety 
systems, and integrity work on the platform 
topsides. These measures returned Thistle  
to production levels it had not achieved  
since the 1990s. In 2016, seven years after  
EnQuest started this programme, Thistle  
was still delivering very high levels of 
production efficiency. After Thistle, a similar 
approach was taken at Heather/Broom – rig  
reactivation, drilling workovers and 
new wells, a new injection flowline and 
significantly increased water injection – which 
have all materially increased production 
levels. Heather/Broom also achieved high 
levels of production efficiency in 2016.
In 2014, EnQuest acquired interests in both 
the Greater Kittiwake Area (‘GKA’) in the 
North Sea and the PM8/Seligi Production 
Sharing Contract in Malaysia, both of which 
swiftly recouped their original investment.  
At the Greater Kittiwake Area hub, EnQuest’s 
first priorities were to rejuvenate the well 
stock, to raise production efficiency and to 
reduce unit operating costs significantly, 
from over $100/bbl at the time of the 
acquisition. The Mallard well was worked 
over, the Gadwall well was side-tracked and 
dissolver treatments were implemented 
at Goosander, all of which drove gross 
production from 2,000 Boepd levels around 
the time EnQuest took over operatorship, 
to between 14,000 and 16,000 Boepd by the 
last quarter of 2015. Production efficiency 
was taken from very low levels to the very 
high levels which are regularly achieved on 
EnQuest assets, with unit operating costs   EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

substantially down, to below $30/bbl. In 
November 2016, EnQuest delivered first 
oil from the Scolty/Crathes development, 
tied back to GKA, generating combined 
gross production of over 20,000 Boepd 
on individual days in December 2016. The 
production from the Scolty/Crathes fields 
themselves, bringing this development 
onstream also extends the life of the GKA 
hub to at least 2025.
At PM8/Seligi in Malaysia, EnQuest assumed 
operatorship in October 2014 and through 
an early programme focusing on facility 
integrity, gas compressor reliability and idle 
well restoration, quickly increased gross 
production from 12,400 Boepd to 15,100 
Boepd. This has been achieved before any 
new drilling has taken place. Production 
efficiency has also been enhanced here. 
In 2016, production was again strong, a 
substantial achievement for a maturing field 
with wells which have high natural decline 
rates and in a year with no drilling, a  
further testament to the success of the 
programme of well intervention and 
topsides work, resulting in high levels  
of production efficiency.
Asset base and production 
EnQuest’s principal UK assets at the end of 2016 were its interests in the producing operated oil  
fields Heather/Broom, Thistle/Deveron, the Dons area, the Greater Kittiwake Area, Alma/Galia and 
Scolty/Crathes. In addition, EnQuest had interests in the Kraken development and also a non-operated 
interest in the producing Alba oil field. In Malaysia, EnQuest’s operated assets comprise the PM8/Seligi 
Production Sharing Contract and the Tanjong Baram Risk Services Contract.
2016 production highlights
• North Sea up 11.3%, including the first full 
year of production from Alma/Galia
 – Heather/Broom up 28.1%
 – Scolty/Crathes delivered average 6,422 
Boepd after first oil
• On days in early December 2016,  
PM8/Seligi delivered over 20,000 Boepd 
gross, its highest production yet under 
EnQuest operatorship.  06

Business model
Evolving priorities in the current
oil price environment
Since the start of the lower oil price environment  
in 2014, EnQuest has prioritised the 
implementation of its business model 
on the following areas:
Streamlining operations
Low cost operator
The oil price environment of recent years 
acted as a catalyst, driving forward innovative 
industry leading initiatives which EnQuest had 
in place to streamline its operations. A newer 
lower cost structure and approach has been 
institutionalised in EnQuest’s ways of 
doing business.
Strengthening the
balance sheet
Financial discipline
Delivering on execution
Differential capability
EnQuest has the right mix of integrated 
technical capabilities, high levels of 
production efciency and cost control to 
realise value from the substantial production and 
development opportunities in the assets it owns 
in the maturing North Sea and Malaysian basins.

As EnQuest moves from a period of heavy 
investment to one focused on realising
 production potential from existing resources
 and capabilities, it will maintain nancial 
discipline With improved liquidity and 
operating cash margins, EnQuest’s 
performance is focused on driving cash ow. 
 
In the continuing challenging macro environment and building on its successes in 2016, EnQuest has focused on its differential capabilities,
 low cost approach to operatorship, and nancial discipline. EnQuest believes that these are critical enablers for its investment proposition. 
EnQuest’s model is based on a low cost approach to its business. Its differential technical capabilities enable it to focus on low cost development and production options, 
its approach to operatorship delivers low levels of unit operating cost and its tight nancial discipline prioritises low cost, cash ow generative investment.

What makes EnQuest different and why its 
business model works
Realising value through capability
EnQuest’s model is based on a low 
cost approach to its business
Industry endorsement of EnQuest’s differential capabilities:
Talking with reference to EnQuest’s proposed acquisition of interests in the Magnus oil field and the Sullom Voe Terminal from BP , Mark Thomas, 
BP North Sea Regional President said: “Sullom Voe and Magnus have been great businesses for BP, but to maximise the economic life of these 
important assets, we believe this deal will offer them a better long-term future. With their integrated skills, operational scale, cost structures and 
high levels of operating efficiency we have seen what EnQuest can do on the Thistle, Deveron and Don fields that were previously operated by BP. 
We believe this is a good example of having the ‘right assets’ in the ‘right hands’, offering new opportunities for the assets and benefitting  
the UKCS, in the spirit of Maximising Economic Recovery (‘MER UK’). ”
EnQuest has the full spectrum of 
integrated technical capabilities needed:
• To extend field lives: Thistle/Deveron, 
Heather/Broom, GKA, PM8/Seligi
• To deliver oil field developments: The 
Don fields, Ythan, Alma/Galia, Tanjong 
Baram, Kraken
• To create solutions for fields previously 
too marginal to develop: Scolty/Crathes 
EnQuest’s capabilities combine 
subsurface, operations, facilities planning 
and drilling areas of expertise, including:
• Infill drilling, subsurface skill in identifying 
well targets
• Newer technology, new seismic
• Depth in engineering, execution and 
operations
EnQuest has an in-house focused 
organisational structure and is the operator 
of most of its assets. By aligning the interests 
of its teams and through its high level of 
direct control, EnQuest can optimise the 
efficiency of its operational performance, 
using its integrated skillsets to execute its 
business plans successfully. 
 Read more on pages 12, 20
EnQuest’s integrated technical teams enable 
it safely to deliver: 
• Redesign and upgrade of ‘used’ facilities
• Re-use of existing infrastructure; tie-backs
• Idle well revitalisation 
• Innovative and cost efficient solutions
• Low risk, near field development and 
appraisal
• Process simplification
With no harm to people and with respect 
for the environment. EnQuest has also 
institutionalised a low cost operator structure 
and seeks a low level of exposure to 
decommissioning liabilities. 
EnQuest believes that these technical skills, 
its operational scale and its high levels of 
operating and cost efficiency, all leave it well 
positioned to deliver its long term sustainable 
growth strategy.

Key risks
The Group’s current strategic focus is on deleveraging and strengthening its balance 
sheet, with the long term goal of delivering value to its shareholders. The key risks 
which the Group faces in achieving this goal are a prolonged low oil price environment 
(or a sustained decline in oil prices) and any material delay to achieving first oil or 
materially lower than expected production performance at the Kraken field. For 
further information, please see the ‘Risks and uncertainties’ section on pages 40–47.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Key performance indicators
2016 was another challenging year for 
EnQuest, with continuing pressure from the 
oil price environment. Accordingly, EnQuest 
has delivered further reductions in operating 
and capital expenditure and continued to 
streamline operations. EnQuest’s low cost 
operating structure and low cost approach 
to operatorship are integral to its way of 
doing business, whilst always retaining safe 
operations as the number one priority. It was 
a year characterised by both operational and 
financial achievements, with the successful 
financial restructuring being essential for the 
strength of the balance sheet. 
The average production of 39,751 Boepd 
in 2016 included good performances at 
Heather/Broom and at PM8/Seligi, and a 
promising start from Scolty/Crathes, following 
early delivery of first oil. A first full year 
of production from Alma/Galia increased 
UKCS production over the prior year, despite 
productivity from Alma/Galia being negatively 
impacted by well performance. Overall 
production was also affected by extended 
shutdowns. The Kraken development 
remained under budget and on course 
for first oil in Q2 2017 , with the drilling 
programme ahead of schedule. 
To help protect its capital investment 
programme, EnQuest had entered into a 
substantial hedging programme for 2016; 
this contributed $255.8 million to EBITDA 
of $477.1 million in 2016. Cost control and 
efficient management of operations drove 
further material cost reductions; average 
2016 full year unit opex was $24.6/bbl, 
compared to $29.7/bbl in 2015 and $42.1/bbl 
in 2014. 2016 cash capex was $609.2 million, 
down 19% on 2015; this final 2016 capex 
total was well down on the original estimate 
of between $700 million and $750 million, 
reflecting ongoing reduction initiatives 
throughout the year, including deferral of 
payments for Kraken and Scolty/Crathes. 
End 2016 net 2P reserves of 215 MMboe 
represented a 6% increase on the 203 
MMboe at the end of 2015. This reflected the 
impact of EnQuest producing 13 MMboe of 
hydrocarbons in 2016 and the acquisition of 
an additional 10.5% interest in the Kraken 
development from First Oil at the start of 
2016. There were also increased revisions to 
reserve estimates at the Thistle and Heather 
hubs, both due to improved predicted 
performance of infill wells based on reservoir 
simulation model outputs and decreases 
at Alma/Galia due to the levels of well 
performance. By the end of 2016, EnQuest 
had therefore converted into flowing barrels 
the equivalent 84% of the 81 MMboe of 
reserves it had at inception.
In 2017, EnQuest’s top operational priority 
is safely bringing the Kraken development 
onstream on schedule. As EnQuest begins to 
move beyond an extended period of heavy 
capital investment, its strategic priorities 
continue to be to increase production by 
delivering on operational and development 
execution, whilst also continuing to reduce 
the operating cost base. This combination 
of financial and operational discipline will 
result in increasing cash flows and in the 
deleveraging of the balance sheet, which 
continue to be the high priorities in the  
near term.

Chairman’s statement
“EnQuest has a very strong
team of people and has an
asset base with material 
growth potential.”
With the combined effect of increased 
production and acquisition related increases, 
EnQuest ended 2016 with a net 2P reserve 
base of 215 MMboe, ahead of the 203 
MMboe position at the end of 2015. This 
represents an average of 15% growth per 
annum since EnQuest’s formation seven years 
ago and a current reserve life of 17 years.
Industry context
EnQuest’s low cost capabilities have always 
been central to its business model. The 
macro environment since 2014 has acted 
as a catalyst for the North Sea oil and 
gas industry, galvanising companies into 
new, innovative and collaborative ways of 
operating. EnQuest has been at the forefront 
of these advances and initiatives and these 
more cost efficient operating methodologies 
are being institutionalised. These are lasting 
structural changes and are essential to the 
optimisation of hydrocarbon extraction from 
the North Sea and beyond. 
EnQuest supports the UK Government’s 
strategy for ‘Maximising Economic Recovery 
(‘MER’) for the UK’ and works closely with the 
Oil & Gas Authority (‘OGA’) to achieve this. In 
Jock Lennox
Chairman
Q4 2016, EnQuest brought the  
Scolty/Crathes development onstream; 
the only offshore oil Field Development 
Plan to have been approved in the UKCS in 
2015. Realisation of the potential from these 
smaller fields was enabled by cost efficiency, 
technology application and solid execution. 
EnQuest looks forward to adding further 
value to these MER (UK) initiatives through 
applying its differential capabilities to 
optimise the recovery of oil from the UKCS.
EnQuest welcomes the current programme 
to simplify and make more competitive 
the UK upstream tax regime, including 
reductions in the headline level of oil and 
gas tax rate, as set out in HMT’s ‘Driving 
Investment’ document. These are essential 
to creating certainty and to driving the still 
substantial investment needed in the UKCS. 
EnQuest believes that there is no longer 
a case for additional petroleum tax levies, 
such as the supplementary charge on UK 
upstream oil and gas activities. Such taxes 
mitigate against the realisation of MER (UK).
Reasons for the 2016 financial restructuring
The decline in oil prices since 2014 and the 
cost of the Alma/Galia development project 
have had a significant negative impact on 
the Group’s revenues, liquidity and available 
cash resources.
In response to the decline in oil prices, 
the Group set a number of strategic 
priorities, including delivering on execution, 
streamlining operations and strengthening 
the Group’s balance sheet. The Group 
focused on delivering a strong operational 
performance and also took a number of 
additional measures to address the impact of 
the decline in oil prices and the Group’s cash 
flow constraints. These included; negotiating 
the relaxation of certain financial covenants 
in the revolving credit facility (‘RCF’) and 
the retail notes; engaging in commodity 
hedging activities; divesting non-core 
international assets; reducing operating 
costs; reducing capital expenditure on the 
Kraken development; improving future cash 
flows through the development of Kraken 
and Scolty/Crathes; and deferring certain 
trade creditor obligations.
These measures were significant steps in 
maintaining the Group’s viability in the 
prevailing environment. However, a longer 
term solution was needed to strengthen 
the Group’s liquidity position, to reduce the 
burden of the Group’s cash debt service 
obligations and to enable the Group to 
continue pursuing its business strategy, 
particularly, bringing Kraken to first oil.
This led to the financial restructuring in 
Q4 2016, the key features of which were 
amendments to the RCF and to both the 
high yield and retail bonds, the renewal of 
surety bond facilities and a placing and open 
offer, to raise £82 million. On 21 November, 
the Board was pleased to announce that 
the restructuring had been successfully 
completed and was effective. 
EnQuest in 2016 
When I became Chairman of EnQuest in 
September 2016, I said that EnQuest’s priority 
was to deliver a business and a balance sheet 
which were robust in the prevailing oil price 
environment. In November 2016, EnQuest 
was pleased to announce the successful 
completion of a financial restructuring 
designed to deliver such a robust balance 
sheet. This was a comprehensive package of 
measures which, combined with an extensive 
and ongoing cost saving programme, put 
EnQuest’s business on a strong footing, well 
placed to deliver the Kraken development 
and to deliver value to shareholders in the 
medium term.
I also said that I was pleased to become 
Chairman of a company with an asset base 
which has material growth potential and with 
such a strong team of people. In 2016, our 
people again performed well in a challenging 
environment, with EnQuest delivering 
production up 9% on 2015, whilst at the same 
time significantly further reducing costs, 
with unit operating costs down 17% on the 
prior year.   EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The EnQuest Board
On 8 September 2016, EnQuest announced 
that after over six years in the role, Dr James 
(‘ Jim’) Buckee was retiring as Chairman of the 
Company and that I was to become EnQuest’s 
new Chairman, both with immediate effect. 
The Board and I reiterate our thanks to Jim for 
his important contribution to the Company 
since its inception. During his tenure, EnQuest 
grew reserves from 80.5 MMboe at the start, 
to 203 MMboe at the end of 2015. For my part, 
I was indeed pleased to become Chairman 
at such an important time in the Company’s 
development and I was warmly welcomed into 
my new role by EnQuest’s Chief Executive, 
Amjad Bseisu, and the rest of the Board.
On 15 December 2016, EnQuest announced 
the appointment of Carl Hughes as a  
Non-Executive Director and that Neil 
McCulloch was being appointed as Chief 
Operating Officer (‘COO’) and was to join 
the Board as an Executive Director at the 
2017 AGM. The appointment of Carl Hughes 
as a Non-Executive Director of the EnQuest 
Board was effective on 1 January 2017 . Carl 
was previously a vice chairman and senior 
audit partner at Deloitte, based in London; 
he was also global leader of Deloitte’s energy 
and resources practice. Prior to his promotion 
to COO, Neil was EnQuest’s President, 
North Sea. Neil’s previous responsibilities for 
EnQuest’s North Sea operations, expanded 
to include production from Kraken and 
EnQuest’s operations in Malaysia. I am 
delighted to welcome Carl to EnQuest 
and I look forward to working with him as a 
member of the Board. I am also pleased to 
congratulate Neil, both on his appointment to 
the role of COO and on being invited to join 
the Board.
In March 2016, as part of the planned rotation 
of the Board, Clare Spottiswoode retired 
from the Board. I would like to repeat the 
Board’s gratitude to Clare for her valuable 
contributions during her tenure with EnQuest. 
In conjunction with an independent search 
firm, the process of building on our rotation 
plans continues. 
Our people
The Directors assess and evolve EnQuest’s 
strategy as appropriate, taking key decisions 
on its implementation. 
In 2016, the strategic focus was again on 
positioning the business for the prevailing 
oil price environment, whilst also ensuring it 
continued to achieve its operational targets. 
Delivery against these objectives has only 
been possible due to EnQuest’s people. 
The Board and I would like to express our 
gratitude to everyone at EnQuest for having 
worked so diligently and innovatively to 
address the challenges presented by the oil 
price environment.
In particular, we are grateful to the EnQuest 
leadership team for their energy and 
dedication in navigating into place the 
complicated restructuring and capital raise. 
We are pleased that these arrangements 
have put EnQuest in the position where it 
can continue doing what it is known for and 
what it does so well, creating value from 
opportunities in maturing oil fields.
Following the capital restructuring, the Board 
also worked with the management team on 
the proposed EnQuest acquisition of interests 
in the Magnus oil field and the Sullom Voe 
Terminal. Again, this transaction is a significant 
demonstration of the stamina and ingenuity 
of our people – your Company is led by a high 
quality team. 
Governance
The Board believes that the manner in which 
it conducts its business is important and 
it is committed to working to the highest 
standards of corporate governance for the 
benefit of all of its stakeholders. Ensuring 
that the Board works effectively remains 
a key areas of focus. EnQuest’s values 
underpin a working environment where 
people are safe, creative and passionate, 
with a relentless focus on results. 
2016 saw the inception of a new Committee 
of the Board, the Risk Committee. The 
primary purpose of the Risk Committee is to 
provide a forum for in-depth examination of 
non-financial risk areas (financial risk being 
within the scope of the Audit Committee). 
Over the course of the year, the Committee 
has reviewed a number of areas such as asset 
integrity, subsurface risks and morale.
EnQuest’s corporate responsibility is 
focused on five main areas. These are, 
first and foremost, Health and Safety, 
People, Environment, Business Conduct 
and Community. The Board has approved 
EnQuest’s overall approach to Corporate 
Responsibility and specific developments 
and updates in each are brought to the 
Board’s attention when appropriate. The 
Board receives regular information on 
EnQuest’s performance in these areas, 
and specifically monitors health and safety 
and environmental reporting at each 
Board meeting. EnQuest’s HSE&A Policy 
is reviewed by the Board annually and 
all incidents, forward looking indicators 
and significant HSE&A programmes are 
discussed by the Board.
Culture is an area of increased focus 
given the impacts of the current oil price 
environment and the growth in operations, 
as both the Alma/Galia and Kraken 
projects add scale to EnQuest’s business. 
Furthermore, EnQuest is now working 
to complete its acquisition of operating 
interests in the Magnus field and the Sullom 
Voe Terminal, transitioning to take over 
operatorship and absorbing significant 
additional numbers of personnel into the 
business. It is therefore important to set 
the right tone and to foster among the 
workforce high morale, common values and 
a focus on efficient and ethical achievement. 
Furthermore, EnQuest took considerable 
care to ensure that the processes adopted 
during a rationalisation of the workforce in 
Aberdeen were, and were seen to be, fair 
and understanding. 
Dividend
The Company has not declared or paid any 
dividends since incorporation and does not 
plan to pay dividends in the near future. Any 
future payment of dividends will depend on 
the earnings and financial condition of the 
Company and on such other factors as the 
Board of Directors of the Company considers 
appropriate at the time.
A return to sustainable growth
In January 2017, with a view to continuing 
to build its growth options, EnQuest 
announced the acquisition of interests in 
the Magnus oil field and the Sullom Voe 
Terminal (‘SVT’), for both of which EnQuest 
is set to become operator, subject to the 
necessary approvals. The acquisition has an 
innovative structure, recognising EnQuest’s 
current balance sheet constraints. The 
vendor, BP , endorsed EnQuest’s capabilities, 
highlighting that EnQuest is a natural 
operator of mature assets in the North Sea, 
well placed to improve production and to 
prolong the life of such assets in the UKCS. 
 
With Magnus and SVT being added to the 
portfolio and with the 2016 restructuring 
implemented, EnQuest is positioned with the 
right assets and the right team for the next 
phase of its growth. EnQuest has the high 
efficiency and low cost capabilities required 
for this environment; it has restructured its 
operations and its ways of doing business 
such that even modest increases in oil prices 
can have a significant positive impact on 
future cash flows and growth. 
 
In 2017, EnQuest’s top operational priority 
is safely bringing the Kraken development 
onstream on schedule. As EnQuest begins to 
move beyond an extended period of heavy 
capital investment, its strategic priorities 
continue to be to increase production by 
delivering on operational and development 
execution, whilst also continuing to reduce 
the operating cost base. This combination 
of financial and operational discipline will 
result in increasing cash flows and in the 
deleveraging of the balance sheet, which 
continue to be the high priorities in the  
near term.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Chief Executive
Alma/Galia being negatively impacted by 
well performance. Overall production was 
also affected by extended shutdowns. The 
Kraken development finished 2016 under 
budget and on course for first oil in Q2 
2017, with the drilling programme ahead 
of schedule. 
To help protect its capital investment 
programme, EnQuest had entered into a 
substantial hedging programme for 2016; 
this contributed $255.8 million to EBITDA 
of $477.1 million in 2016. Cost control and 
efficient management of operations drove 
further material cost reductions; average 
2016 full year unit opex was $24.6/bbl, 
compared to $29.7/bbl in 2015 and $42.1/bbl 
in 2014. 2016 cash capex was $609.2 million, 
down 19% on 2015; this final 2016 capex 
total was well down on the original estimate 
of between $700 million and $750 million, 
reflecting ongoing reduction initiatives 
throughout the year, including deferral of 
payments for Kraken and Scolty/Crathes. 
“Following delivery of Kraken, EnQuest 
will begin moving from a period of 
heavy capital investment into one 
focused on cash generation and 
deleveraging the balance sheet.”
2016 was another challenging year for 
EnQuest, with continuing pressure from the 
oil price environment. Accordingly, EnQuest 
has delivered further reductions in operating 
and capital expenditure and continued to 
streamline operations. EnQuest’s low cost 
operating structure and low cost approach 
to operatorship are integral to its way of 
doing business, whilst always retaining safe 
operations as the number one priority. It was 
a year characterised by both operational and 
financial achievements, with the successful 
financial restructuring being essential for the 
strength of the balance sheet. 
The average production of 39,751 Boepd 
in 2016 included good performances at 
Heather/Broom and at PM8/Seligi, and 
a promising start from Scolty/Crathes, 
following early delivery of first oil. A first 
full year of production from Alma/Galia 
increased UKCS production over the 
prior year, despite productivity from 
Even though EnQuest had been successful in 
making significant reductions to its cost base, 
the Company also needed to restructure its 
financial position. In October 2016, EnQuest 
announced proposed amendments to the 
revolving credit facility and to both the 
retail notes and the high yield notes, as well 
as a placing and open offer. In November 
2016, EnQuest successfully completed the 
restructuring. This provided EnQuest with 
a stable and sustainable capital structure, 
reduced cash debt service obligations and 
enhanced liquidity. The revolving credit 
facility was restructured into a $1,125 million 
term loan facility and a $75 million revolving 
credit facility. The terms of the high yield 
bonds and retail bonds were amended, with 
extended maturities and interest to be paid 
in kind rather than in cash when oil prices 
are below $65/bbl in the six month period 
prior to determination. The placing and open 
offer also raised gross aggregate proceeds 
of £82 million. The restructuring was key 
for EnQuest and significantly improved its 
liquidity position. EnQuest finished the year 
with net debt of $1,796.5 million, as at  
31 December 2016.
End 2016 net 2P reserves of 215 MMboe 
represented a 6% increase on the 203 MMboe 
at the end of 2015. This reflected the 
impact of EnQuest producing 13 MMboe of 
hydrocarbons in 2016 and the acquisition of 
an additional 10.5% interest in the Kraken 
development from First Oil at the start of 
2016. There were also upward revisions to 
reserve estimates at the Thistle and Heather 
hubs, both due to improved predicted 
performance of infill wells based on reservoir 
simulation model outputs and decreases 
at Alma/Galia due to the levels of well 
performance. By the end of 2016, EnQuest 
had therefore converted into flowing barrels 
the equivalent 84% of the 81 MMboe of 
reserves with which it began its business  
with in 2010.
Health, Safety, Environment and 
Assurance (‘HSE&A’)
EnQuest maintained its commitment to the 
delivery of continual improvement in HSE&A 
performance in 2016, with excellent results 
in many areas, but with some areas requiring 
fresh actions to be undertaken. 
EnQuest’s Lost Time Injury (‘LTI’) performance 
remained strong: the Kittiwake, Northern 
Producer and EnQuest Producer assets in 
the North Sea all recorded an LTI free year. 
EnQuest’s Malaysian operations recorded 
zero LTIs and were pleased to achieve a Total 
Recordable Incident Frequency (‘TRIF’) for 
the year which was better than targeted. 
In the UK, a comprehensive HSE&A 
audit programme was completed, with 
findings being part of the 2017 continual 
improvement programme. This underlines 
EnQuest’s focus on improvement through 
the detection and resolution of issues. 
EnQuest’s focus on HSE&A continues to be 
a priority.

these, underlying production at PM8/Seligi 
increased year on year, a substantial 
achievement for a mature field with wells 
which have natural decline rates. Especially 
in a year with no drilling, this is a testament 
to the success of the programme of well 
intervention and topsides work and high 
levels of production efficiency. 
Financial performance KPIs
In 2016, EnQuest generated EBITDA of  
$477.1 million compared with $474.2 million in 
2015; the negative impact of lower oil prices, 
being mitigated by hedging income of  
$255.8 million and also by the significant 
action taken on costs. 
Cost reduction measures led to EnQuest’s 
average unit production and transportation 
cost being reduced again, down to $24.6/bbl 
compared to $29.7/bbl in 2015. 
As at 31 December 2016, EnQuest had total 
net debt of $1,796.5 million.
2017 year to date
The Kraken FPSO arrived in the North Sea in 
early January, having completed its journey 
from Singapore within the scheduled number 
of days. The vessel was berthed in Rotterdam 
for post voyage inspection and final 
preparations prior to sailing. The FPSO then 
sailed to the Kraken field once good weather 
conditions were anticipated for the hook 
up of the STP buoy mooring system to the 
FPSO. This was completed and a full rotation 
test performed so that by mid-February the 
vessel was on station and securely moored. 
Work is continuing in the turret area, as is 
topsides commissioning work. Following 
completion of the turret area work subsea 
commissioning will commence. Handover 
of FPSO systems from commissioning to 
operations continues.
In January 2017, EnQuest was pleased to 
announce an agreement to acquire from BP 
an initial 25% interest in the Magnus oil field 
representing c.16 MMboe of additional net 
2P reserves (gross reserves of 63 MMboe) 
with net production of c.4,200 Boepd in 2016 
(gross production c.16,600 Boepd) as well as 
a 3.0% interest in the Sullom Voe oil terminal 
and supply facility (‘SVT’) and additional 
interests in related North Sea pipeline 
infrastructure. EnQuest already had interests 
of 3.0% in SVT. EnQuest is to become the 
operator of these assets. The transaction is 
subject to certain regulatory, government 
authority, counterparty and partner 
consents. The consideration for these 
interests is $85 million, subject to working 
capital and other adjustments, which will be 
funded by deferred consideration payable 
from the cash flow of the assets being 
acquired. There are no requirements for cash 
from EnQuest, other than as generated from 
these assets. 
The transaction capitalises on EnQuest’s 
strengths in realising value from the 
management of maturing oil fields, as 
underlined by BP’s confidence in proposing 
a change of operatorship to EnQuest. 
Magnus is a good quality reservoir; it has 
large volumes in place, with potential for infill 
drilling and for the revitalisation of wells, and 
scope for field life extension. Magnus is a 
producing asset that will materially increase 
EnQuest’s reserve base. There is long term 
potential in Magnus and there would be a 
significant increase in cash flow at higher 
oil prices. Operationally and financially 
SVT is an important asset to EnQuest and 
taking over operatorship gives significant 
influence over its long term future. EnQuest 
is a natural strategic partner to BP for 
maturing assets and this innovative structure 
represents a natural evolution of EnQuest’s 
business. EnQuest believes the innovative 
transaction net cash flow sharing structure 
can also become a template for transferring 
maturing assets from other majors to 
efficient operators such as EnQuest. Since 
this proposed acquisition was announced, 
the process of transitioning operatorship 
of these assets and securing the necessary 
regulatory, government, counterparty and 
partner consents has begun and continues.
North Sea operations
In 2016, EnQuest produced an average of 
30,603 Boepd in the North Sea, an 11.3% 
increase on the previous year and a generally 
good performance with high levels of 
production efficiency. 2016 production 
benefitted from the drilling programme in 
H2 2015 and from the new Scolty/Crathes 
development, brought onstream ahead of 
schedule and under budget. Production was 
negatively impacted by third party shutdowns 
for maintenance, which were delayed and 
took longer than anticipated, also by the 
well performance issues at Alma/Galia, and 
reliability issues with its electrical submersible 
pumps (‘ESP’s). EnQuest monitors its projects 
to ensure that lessons learned from past 
projects, such as Alma/Galia, are used as 
inputs to the structuring of new ones; hence 
at sanction, most of the Kraken development 
was structured using lump-sum fixed price 
contracts, with remuneration for the vessel 
provider being determined by delivery and 
functionality key performance indicators.
Heather/Broom performance was one of 
the highlights of the year, with production 
of 5,948 Boepd, up 28.1% on the prior year. 
This was due to increased plant and water 
injection reliability and the continuing 
benefits of the 2015 wells workover 
programme. Driven partly by this increased 
production, but also by the ongoing cost 
reduction programme, Heather/Broom 
significantly reduced its unit operating costs.
Kraken 
In 2016, the Kraken development progressed 
well, finishing the year ahead of budget 
and on schedule for first oil in Q2 2017. The 
conversion programme for the Kraken FPSO 
vessel continued and on 23 November, the 
FPSO left Singapore, en route to the North 
Sea. Drilling for the project was ahead of 
schedule on drill centres 2 and 3 (‘DC-2’ 
and ‘DC-3’), following completion of well 
activities at drill centre 1 (‘DC-1’).
Earlier in the year, the subsea installation 
programme was completed, with all 
three drill centres fully connected to the 
submerged turret production (‘STP’) buoy for 
hook up to the FPSO and the last mooring 
pile and wire/chains installed. 
The drilling programme made excellent 
progress in 2016, with the results from the 
producer and injector wells which were 
drilled and completed meeting pre-drill 
expectations. This good progress on drilling 
and also on the execution of the subsea 
programme were key factors in the  
$375 million of additional Kraken gross 
project capex savings announced in 2016, 
reducing gross capex to c.$2.5 billion.
Malaysia
Total production of 9,148 Boepd in Malaysia 
was slightly ahead of the prior year. 
Production of 7,960 Boepd from PM8/Seligi 
was slightly lower than the prior year’s 8,689 
Boepd, as a result of additional maintenance 
shutdown days in 2016, as well as reduced 
volumes of gas and condensate, which 
are ad hoc in their nature. Adjusting for 
1 EBITDA is calculated on a business performance 
basis, and is calculated by taking profit/loss from 
operations before tax and finance income/(costs) 
and adding back depletion, depreciation, foreign 
exchange movements and the realised gain/loss 
on foreign currency derivatives related to capital 
expenditure. The prior year EBITDA has been 
restated on a comparable basis by adding back 
realised losses on foreign currency derivatives 
related to capital expenditure of $9.4 million. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

In the continuing 
challenging macro 
environment and building 
on its successes in 2016, 
EnQuest is focused on its

its low cost approach  
to operatorship and  
its financial discipline. 
EnQuest believes that  
these are critical enablers 
for its business.
2017 and beyond
In the continuing challenging oil price 
environment and building upon its 
successes in 2016, EnQuest is focused on its 
differential capabilities, low cost approach 
to operatorship, and financial discipline. 
The agreement with BP to acquire interests 
in, and operatorship of, Magnus and SVT 
is confirmation of the effectiveness of 
EnQuest’s capabilities and its potential to 
add value for both EnQuest and for other 
business partners.
The Kraken project remains under budget 
and on track for delivery of first oil in Q2 2017.
In December 2016, it was announced that Neil McCulloch, then EnQuest’s President, North 
Sea, was being promoted to the Group position of Chief Operating Officer, with effect from 
the start of 2017 . It is intended that Neil will join the EnQuest Board, as an Executive Director, 
at EnQuest’s 2017 Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). Neil’s responsibilities for EnQuest’s 
North Sea operations have expanded to include production from Kraken and also EnQuest’s 
operations in Malaysia. 
EnQuest remains on course to achieve 
average production in the range of 45,000 
Boepd to 51,000 Boepd for 2017. This is 
based on six operated producing hubs in 
the UK and the PM8/Seligi hub in Malaysia, 
with the level of 2017 production being 
dependent upon the timing of first oil 
from Kraken. A full year contribution from 
Kraken in 2018 should substantially increase 
production again that year.
Six million barrels have been hedged for 
2017, at an average of c.$51/bbl.
EnQuest remains on course to reduce 
average unit opex further in 2017, in the 
range of $21/bbl to $25/bbl including Kraken 
production. EnQuest continues to seek cost 
reductions across the supply chain.
Chief Executive’s report continued
Cash capital expenditure will reduce in  
2017 and is expected to be in the range  
of $375 million to $425 million, the majority 
of which is being invested in the Kraken 
development.
Following delivery of first oil from Kraken, 
EnQuest looks forward to beginning the 
process of deleveraging the balance sheet to 
levels which are sustainable over the longer 
term. EnQuest’s combination of integrated 
technical capabilities and high levels of 
production efficiency and cost control, 
ideally positions us to realise production 
potential from the assets we own.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

STRATEGIC REPORT
EnQuest has the right mix of 
integrated technical capabilities 
and of high levels of production 
efficiency and cost control to 
realise value from the substantial 
production and opportunities in 
the assets it owns in the 
maturing North Sea and 
Malaysian basins.
EnQuest’s differentiation is apparent in key 
areas across the organisation and closely 
interlinks with its goals of focusing on 
financial discipline and managing costs.
EnQuest’s differentiation is evident in 
its wells delivery programme. EnQuest 
has created competent, experienced 
and motivated teams which have 
worked rigorously and at pace to deliver 
exceptional results in 2016. This was 
exemplified by the excellent drilling 
performance in the Central North Sea 
and Kraken activities and the idle well 
restoration programme at PM8/Seligi.
Differential 
capability
It is equally evident in how EnQuest  
manages risk. EnQuest has established new 
commercial models with its supply chain, 
supporting sustainable operations for the 
long term. For example, EnQuest has 
sought to de-risk projects through the use 
of proven off-the-shelf technologies, rather 
than unnecessarily high cost bespoke 
solutions. As an example the use of 
ultra-deep resistivity imaging tools 
significantly de-risked the Kraken and 
Scolty/Crathes developments. 
Engaging more deeply with suppliers 
and service providers has created a 
more focused supply chain. It provided 
the backdrop against which, EnQuest 
secured $60 million of capex savings on the 
Scolty/Crathes development sanctioned at 
a gross development cost of $250 million 
– while bringing it in ahead of schedule. 
The project has, in turn, extended the 
operational life of the GKA fields. 
Allied to this is EnQuest’s distinctive 
project execution model. EnQuest 
establishes core teams that are small  
in constituent numbers, but which  
are empowered to build relationships  
with contractors that are defined by trust, 
honesty and a mutual readiness to engage 
and challenge. 
EnQuest has changed its own organisation, 
restructured to reduce spend and refocused 
for the future shape of the business. 
EnQuest has evolved from a business 
in which the majority of people were 
contractors, to one which now primarily 
comprise the Group’s own staff. This 
deepens EnQuest’s influence and more 
closely aligns all the people who work for 
EnQuest with its differentiated approach. 
EnQuest has broadened its horizons, 
working with the wider industry to 
maximise economic recovery in the North 
Sea. EnQuest is an active player, for 
instance, in the Operational Gas Group,  
a multiple operator collaboration which  
has successfully sourced a common supply 
of extra fuel gas to address a shortage in 
the northern North Sea. 
Together, measures such as these enable 
EnQuest to achieve its goal of Safe 
Results: reliable and efficient production 
performance, delivered safely.
Industry perspective on EnQuest: BP group 
chief executive Bob Dudley commented: 
“EnQuest’s experience of investing in and 
extending the life of mature assets in the 
North Sea make them a natural operator  
of Magnus and Sullom Voe in this later phase 
of their life. We believe this will enable them 
to prolong the life of the assets, benefiting 
the region and creating additional value  
for both EnQuest and BP shareholders.  
In addition to investing in and growing our 
core businesses, BP will continue to seek 
innovative opportunities such as this to work 
with partners to maximise value creation 
from our entire portfolio. ”
Business model focus areas EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
 16
The oil price environment of 
recent years acted as a catalyst, 
driving forward innovative 
industry leading initiatives  
which EnQuest has in place to 
streamline its operations.  
A lower cost structure  
and approach has been 
institutionalised in EnQuest’s 
way of doing business. 
EnQuest’s business model is based on the 
assumption of operatorship of maturing 
assets and the transformation of their 
performance, by addressing high operating 
costs and low levels of production and 
operating efficiency. 
A core element of EnQuest’s operating 
cost reduction strategy is its approach 
to supply chain management. EnQuest 
pursues its objective of sourcing better 
quality at lower cost, by building strategic 
partnerships with the wider industry and  
by improving internal efficiencies.
Under the former, EnQuest’s activities 
take several forms. They include an annual 
supplier forum that provides a platform for 
dialogue with around 40 strategic service 
providers. The initiative has been the 
catalyst for spend reductions of more than 
$90 million.
This partnership approach also features 
the adoption of ‘open book’ contracts. By 
promoting collaboration through financial 
transparency, EnQuest has seen substantial 
reductions in supplier rates.
EnQuest is collaborating with operators 
of a similar size and philosophy to itself, 
to reduce its North Sea cost base. This is 
proving effective in areas ranging from 
contract benchmarking for specific services 
to the initiation of an inventory sharing 
platform that enhances efficiency in spares 
management.
A new model for the provision of helicopter 
services in support of EnQuest’s Northern 
North Sea assets led to improved service 
availability.
To improve internal cost performance, 
the business has embarked upon a cost 
efficiency initiative which optimised 
value by focusing heavily on post-award 
Unit opex to be 
between $21/bbl 
to $25/bbl in 201 7
Low cost operator
contract management. For example, the 
business carries out detailed audits of the 
implementation of contracts, helping to 
improve invoice processing and recovery  
of payments due.
EnQuest has also adopted a ‘hub’ 
approach, to consolidate some of the 
support services for all of its Northern 
North Sea assets, and therefore minimise 
mobilisation/demobilisation costs. 
This focus on internal efficiencies has also 
featured the introduction of a refreshed 
platform supply vessel strategy and the 
formation of a centralised procurement 
function which has resulted in better cost 
control processes and which has reduced 
the administrative demands on the time of 
key technical personnel.
EnQuest actively explores alternate 
geographical markets, beyond its historical 
conventional sources, identifying and 
achieving sustainable cost reductions. The 
strategy encourages EnQuest’s traditional 
suppliers to become more efficient and 
competitive, and therefore supports the 
wider industry goal of reducing the cost 
base of North Sea operations.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Financial discipline
As EnQuest moves from a 
period of heavy investment  
to one focused on realising 
production potential from 
existing resources and 
capabilities, it will maintain 
financial discipline. With 
improved liquidity and 
operating cash margins, 
EnQuest’s performance is 
focused on driving cash flow. 
Financial discipline has always been a 
cornerstone of EnQuest’s operating model 
and it is one which assumed even greater 
significance in 2016.
Against the backdrop of continuing low oil 
prices, the business successfully completed 
a financial restructuring exercise, with 
very high levels of support from financial 
stakeholders. This comprehensive package 
of measures placed EnQuest on a strong 
footing to deliver the Kraken development 
in Q2 2017 and, more strategically, to be 
able to deliver value to shareholders in the 
medium and long term. After Kraken has 
been brought onstream, EnQuest plans to 
begin to reduce debt, restoring its balance 
sheet to levels which are more appropriate 
and sustainable for the longer term.
EnQuest is moving from a period of 
heavy capital investment into one of 
cash generation – a natural evolution 
and one which has been given greater 
impetus by the prevailing macro economic 
environment in the oil and gas industry. 
EnQuest has potential for growth from 
its existing assets. Its ability to deliver 
has been underpinned by the improved 
liquidity secured from the capital 
restructuring and by the cash positive 
operating margins on all assets secured by 
business wide cost efficiency measures. 
Two years ago, in H1 2014, EnQuest’s  
unit operating costs were over $45/bbl. 
EnQuest has undertaken an all 
encompassing programme to address 
those cost levels. This has been successful 
to the extent that in 2017, the year in which 
Kraken comes onstream, unit operating 
costs will be in the range of $21/bbl to  
$25/bbl. EnQuest will continue to seek 
further efficiencies in both operating  
and capital expenditure. 
EnQuest will remain highly focused on 
delivery and the realisation of cash flow 
from its assets. EnQuest’s key performance 
indicators and performance targets have 
been set accordingly. 
EnQuest’s operating model remains robust 
and effective, with an unrelenting focus 
on cost management and production 
efficiency across the organisation. It is a 
distinctive model that positions EnQuest 
among the top North Sea performers in 
these areas and sets the foundations for a 
sustainable and successful future for the 
business.

bringing EnQuest’s total interest to 70.5%.
2016 
In 2016, the Kraken development progressed 
well, finishing the year ahead of budget and 
on schedule for first oil in Q2 2017. 
In October 2016, following mechanical 
completion, shore based commissioning 
activities onboard the Kraken Floating 
Production, Storage and Offloading vessel 
(‘FPSO’) were completed at the quayside in 
Singapore. The vessel was then moved to 
deep water anchorage to undertake further 
commissioning work, following which, on  
23 November, the FPSO sailed away en 
route to the North Sea. By this stage, drilling 
for the project was progressing to plan on 
Drill Centres 2 and 3 (‘DC-2’ and ‘DC-3’), 
following completion of well activities at  
Drill Centre 1 (‘DC-1’).
Earlier in the year, the subsea installation 
programme had been completed, with 
all three drill centres fully connected to 
the submerged turret production (‘STP’) 
buoy for hook up to the FPSO and the last 
mooring pile and wire/chains installed. 
The drilling programme made excellent 
progress in 2016 and this efficient execution 
was a key factor in the project capital 
expenditure reductions announced. The 
results from the producer and injector 
wells drilled and completed met pre-drill 
expectations. At year end, four producers 
and five water injectors had been completed 
since drilling commenced on the project. 
2017 and beyond 
The Kraken FPSO arrived in the North Sea in 
early January, having completed its journey 
from Singapore within the scheduled 
number of days. The vessel was berthed 
in Rotterdam for post voyage inspection 
and final preparations prior to sailing. The 
FPSO then sailed to the Kraken field once 
good weather conditions were anticipated 
for the hook up of the STP buoy mooring 
system to the FPSO. This was completed 
and a full rotation test performed so that by 
mid-February the vessel was on station and 
securely moored. The risers and umbilicals 
have now been successfully pulled in. 
Work is continuing in the turret area, as is 
topsides commissioning work. Following 
completion of the turret area work, subsea 
commissioning will commence. Handover 
of FPSO systems from commissioning to 
operations continues.
All drilling is now complete on DC-1 and 
DC-2 and the rig next moves to DC-3.  
At start up 13 wells will be available 
comprising 7 producers and 6 injectors.  
As with all developments of this scale, 
wells will be brought onstream in 
a phased manner in line with good 
reservoir management practices. Drilling 
performance to date has significantly  
de-risked delivery of the project to and 
beyond first oil.
The project continues to be under budget 
and on schedule for first oil in Q2 2017.

North Sea  
operations
“In the North Sea in  
2016, EnQuest focused 
on streamlining 
operations, delivering  
on execution and  
on strengthening 
the balance sheet.”
Neil McCulloch
President, North Sea
“ At the start of 2017 , I was 
delighted to take up the 
Company wide role of Chief 
Operating Officer, leading 
the North Sea and Malaysia 
business units at a time  
when operational delivery is 
paramount. The operations 
team continues to work 
closely with the Kraken 
development team and in 
2017 we look forward to  
the safe delivery of first oil 
from Kraken.”
In the North Sea in 2016, EnQuest focused 
on streamlining operations, delivering on 
execution and on strengthening the balance 
sheet. It was an intensely busy year and the 
team has much to be proud of. Successes 
included continued excellent drilling 
performance and high aggregate production 
efficiency. EnQuest portfolio in the North 
Sea is assessed to again have exceeded the 
Oil and Gas Authority’s stated target of 80% 
production efficiency.
Scolty/Crathes represented a particular 
achievement; this was the only offshore 
pure oil Field Development Plan (‘FDP’) 
approved in the UK North Sea in 2015 
and first oil was achieved approximately a 
year after the FDP was approved and the 
project was sanctioned. With the support 
of EnQuest’s partner, the collaboration 
of our own team with our contractors and 
sub-contractors, the timely delivery of this 
‘small pools’ project was enabled through 
cost efficiency and the application of 
technology, sustaining the wider Greater 
Kittiwake Area (‘GKA’) and infrastructure. 
It is an excellent example of Maximising 
Economic Recovery (‘MER’) in practice. 
With unit capital costs under $20/bbl, 
Scolty/Crathes also demonstrates in practice 
the capital discipline that is essential at this 
stage in EnQuest’s evolution, focused on a 
limited capital expenditure programme and 
on cash flow generating activities.
EnQuest reached its highest level of 
production in 2016, but below initial targets. 
Production was affected by longer than 
forecast third party shutdowns and also by 
disappointing productivity from Alma/Galia.
The cost reduction programme to streamline 
operations continued in 2016, helping to 
drive Group unit opex to the mid $20s per 
barrel, down almost 50% on the levels of early 
2014. This was delivered by many initiatives 
and innovations across the operations and 
supply chain, including further reductions 
in service unit rates, supplier forums, open 
book contracts, and additional incentivised 
contract structures linking payment to 
performance. Payment compliance audits 
were used to ensure that contract terms were 
rigidly and correctly enforced. Centralising 
the procurement team has taken advantage 
of lower global costs. 
In 2016 in the UK, an HSE&A audit 
programme was completed, with findings 
being part of the 2017 continual improvement 
programme. This underlines EnQuest’s focus 
on improvement through the detection and 
resolution of HSE&A issues. 
Magnus and Sullom Voe 
In January 2017, EnQuest was delighted 
to announce the proposed acquisition 
of interests in the Magnus oil field in the 
northern North Sea and in the Sullom Voe 
Terminal (‘SVT’) on Shetland, from BP . 
Magnus has well understood reservoirs 
with significant high quality subsurface data 
including 4D seismic. EnQuest sees upside 
potential in Magnus’ resource base and 
has the necessary skills to realise the latent 
value therein. There are currently three 
mature drilling targets with the potential 
to be onstream in 2018. Two of these wells 
will expand the existing Water Alternating 
Gas (‘WAG’) scheme. Beyond this, there 
are significant further opportunities, 
including further expansion of WAG, which 
EnQuest expects to be realised in the 
future. EnQuest’s proven ability to reliably 
drill low cost wells will be instrumental 
in commercialising Magnus’ remaining 
resource potential.
EnQuest materially reduced its unit 
operating costs between 2014 and 
2016, whilst also delivering high levels of 
operating efficiency. EnQuest anticipates 
being able to apply the same approach 
to Magnus, significantly reducing unit 
operating costs and increasing operating 
efficiency. EnQuest also expects economies 
of scale from combining with its existing 
operations, including savings in logistics, 
contracts and overhead, creating further 
efficiencies across EnQuest’s Northern 
North Sea portfolio.
Building on the work that BP as operator 
and EnQuest and other owners have done 
in recent years, EnQuest expects to be able 
to improve efficiency and costs and extend 
the life of the Sullom Voe oil terminal. 
In so doing, this will extend the lives of 
EnQuest’s Northern North Sea oil fields. 
Such operating improvements will have 
a wider effect and benefit adjacent fields 
and infrastructure helping to rejuvenate 
northern North Sea operations generally. 
This would also be a further demonstration 
of EnQuest’s commitment to the region and 
of its capabilities. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

* Under the terms of EnQuest’s proposed acquisition 
of interest in the Magnus oil field and the Sullom 
Voe Terminal, EnQuest has an option to receive 
$50 million in cash in exchange for undertaking 
the management of the physical decommissioning 
for Thistle and Deveron and making payments by 
reference to 6% of the gross decommissioning 
costs of the Thistle and Deveron fields.
2016 
Across 2016, average production from 
Thistle/Deveron was 7,533 Boepd. 
2016 reflected the benefit of the 2015 drilling 
programme; the planned Southern Fault 
Block P2 sidetrack was however halted at 
the start of the year due to slot recovery 
issues. In Q1 2016, one of the Thistle power 
generation turbines was overhauled and 
other maintenance and integrity projects 
continued throughout the year. Further 
production enhancing field life extension 
work was scheduled for the middle of 2016, 
during a Thistle production shutdown 
planned to coincide with a third party 
shutdown of the Brent Pipeline System 
(‘BPS’). However, the BPS shutdown was 
delayed to the end of the year, thereby 
delaying Thistle production enhancements. 
The BPS shutdown itself proved to be 
considerably longer than expected, resulting 
directly in four weeks of lost production. 
Bad weather in late December then also 
affected production start up by a further 
week. In December, Thistle started and 
successfully commissioned new process 
plant and associated controls. Water 
injection remained offline during this period 
to support essential electrical maintenance 
and to address flexible flowline integrity.
2017 and beyond
On both Thistle and Heather there is a 
programme to abandon redundant well 
stock, co-funded by EnQuest’s partners. 
This will both reduce risk and present 
opportunities in the future to drill further 
infill wells when circumstances allow. The 
related Thistle programme of partial well 
abandonments will continue throughout 
2017, starting with the abandonment of well 
A05/25, which commenced in January 2017. 
The phased approach to decommissioning 
utilises EnQuest’s ability to execute low 
cost well work for the benefit of all Thistle 
stakeholders and is an important new 
component of Thistle’s life extension 
strategy. 
The BPS operator is planning a further 
shutdown in 2017, currently expected to 
result in a Thistle shutdown in Q3.

* Following the default of First Oil plc in February 
2016, a process was initiated which resulted in the 
transfer to EnQuest of 15.15% of First Oil’s working 
interest in the West Don field. The transfer was 
completed on 2 August 2016, increasing EnQuest’s 
stake from its previous 63.45%.
2016
Across 2016, average production from the 
Don fields was 5,404 Boepd. 
2016 reservoir performance for the Don 
wells was above expectations, particularly 
with the benefit of the Ythan production 
well, drilled last year. However, the delay 
and extension of the third party BPS 
shutdown also affected the Don fields, with 
planned Dons production enhancement 
projects considerably delayed and with 
an extended 32 day Dons shutdown at 
the end of H2 2016. The 2016 Dons work 
programme included chemical treatment 
programmes and routine maintenance 
throughout the year. 
Heather/Broom
 • Working interest at end 2016:

 – Broom 63%
 • Fixed steel platform
 • Daily average net production:
 – 2016: 5,948 Boepd
 – 2015: 4,643 Boepd
2016
Across 2016, average production from 
Heather/Broom was 5,948 Boepd.
The strong production performance 
resulted from a combination of work to 
increase water injection reliability and 
increased injectivity from the wells drilled 
and worked over in 2015. The Heather 
Alpha platform also had outstanding 
reliability with no unplanned outages. 
Maintenance and integrity projects 
continued as normal. 
2017 and beyond
Following on from the Thistle well 
programme, the drill crew will move to 
Heather in the second half of 2017 to start a 
similar programme of well decommissioning. 
Removing legacy wells will safeguard  
current sustained high water injection 
efficiency. EnQuest is pleased to have 
gained decommissioning partner funding 
for this important life extension work.
A Heather hub shutdown for routine 
inspection and maintenance is expected 
Q3 2017 .
The start of gas import benefitted 
production in the first half of the year, 
increasing plant efficiency and reducing 
production costs. A water injection 
line failure on Don Southwest reduced 
production with a temporary repair being 
successfully completed in November. 
2017 and beyond

2016
Across 2016, average production from GKA 
was 2,988 Boepd.
Production at the start of the year 
benefitted from continuing improvements in 
production efficiency, strong performance 
of the recently sidetracked Gadwall 
well, and from chemical treatments on 
Goosander conducted in 2015. The 
work programme at the start of the year 
focused on operational upgrades and on 
offshore construction on the Kittiwake 
platform in readiness for the tie-back of 
the Scolty/Crathes fields. H2 2016 included 
the planned three week shutdown, which 
included preparation for Scolty/Crathes 
delivering production on 21 November. GKA 
encountered gas compressor issues which 
resulted in Grouse being shut in for part of 
H2 2016, before being brought back online 
after the compressor was reinstated. In Q2 
2016, EnQuest undertook the drilling of the 
nearby Eagle exploration well, which was 
confirmed as a discovery.
2017 and beyond
The work programme in GKA for 2017 will 
be focused on optimising production across 
the assets and concluding the minimal scope 
of work remaining from the Scolty/Crathes 
project: the replacement of the associated 
gas compressor (‘A-Gas’). Grouse would also 
be offline during the gas system shutdown. 
No drilling is planned on GKA in 2017. 
Evaluation of the potential from the Eagle 
discovery is ongoing.
A chemical treatment (scale squeeze) is 
planned in the summer of 2017 for the 
Mallard well to coincide with the planned 
three week GKA shutdown in Q3 2017.

Data is based on the net production since 
first oil from Scolty/Crathes on 21 November 
2016, as averaged over the full year.
2016
In 2016, the Scolty/Crathes development 
progressed ahead of schedule and under 
budget, with excellent drilling performance 
on both wells. On 21 November 2016, 
EnQuest delivered first oil from  
Scolty/Crathes, which had previously  
been anticipated by the end of H1 2017. 
Early production has been consistent with 
pre-drill modelling and field development 
plan assumptions; average production in 
2016 from 21 November to 31 December 
was 6,422 Boepd. 
2017 and beyond
The 2017 programme for Scolty and 
Crathes will be focused on optimising 
production across the two fields, as part of 
this process the Scolty well is currently shut 
in. Production will be affected by the same 
outages as are planned for GKA in 2017.

a production performance enhancement 
work programme was established. The 
K2 (AP5) well cleaned up naturally after a 
number of weeks of production resulting in 
significantly better performance. K1 (AP4) 
required a chemical treatment which was 
successful and the workover of the K3Z (AP1) 
well further increased production. Well 
K6 was not completed due to mechanical 
issues and was replaced by well K7 (AP6) 
which came onstream late in Q4. K7 (AP6) 
overall productivity has been broadly as 
anticipated.
Productivity from Alma/Galia has been 
negatively impacted by well performance 
including ESP reliability. In October 2016, 
the EnQuest Producer was brought onto 
permanent power with the boiler and steam 
turbines online.
2017 and beyond 
In 2017, the final phase of the power 
optimisation and the produced and sea 
water injection optimisation projects will 
be completed on the EnQuest Producer. 
Discussions are ongoing with the ESP 
supplier, on rectification plans to address 
the pump reliability issues. An unscheduled 
shutdown took place in January/February 
as a result of damage from severe winter 
storms; Alma/Galia performed well after 
being brought back onstream. A two week

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Proposed acquisition of interests in the Magnus oil field and in the Sullom Voe T erminal
On 24 January 2017, EnQuest PLC 
announced an agreement to acquire from 
BP an initial 25% interest in the Magnus oil 
field representing c.16 MMboe of additional 
net 2P reserves (gross reserves of  
63 MMboe) with net production of c.4,200 
Boepd in 2016 (gross production c.16,600 
Boepd) as well as a 3.0% interest in the 
Sullom Voe oil terminal and supply facility 
(‘SVT’), 9.0% of Northern Leg Gas Pipeline 
(‘NLGP’), and 3.8% of Ninian Pipeline System 
(‘NPS’). Prior to this transaction, EnQuest 
had existing interests of 3.0% in SVT, 5.9%  
in NLGP and 2.7% in NPS. 
EnQuest is to become the operator of these 
assets and; the transaction is subject to 
certain regulatory, government authority, 
counterparty and partner consents. The 
transition for the change in operatorship 
is anticipated to take between 6 and 12 
months from the date of the announcement.
Magnus
Magnus is a maturing asset with significant 
remaining potential.
Facilities
The Magnus platform is located in Block 
211/12A and is the most northerly installation 
in the UKCS, its closest neighbours are 
Northern Producer (c.12 miles) and Thistle 
(c.19 miles). Magnus started operations in 
1983. It has integrated production/drilling/
accommodation facilities. Since 2010, its 
levels of operating efficiency have been low 
(30%–70%). 
Reservoir and wells
The majority of hydrocarbons in place 
sit within the high quality Upper Jurassic 
turbidite Magnus Sandstone Member 
(‘MSM’). Significant other resources sit in 
the Lower Kimmeridge Clay Formation 
(‘LKCF’). Overall the Magnus field has 2.0 
billion boe hydrocarbons initially in place 
(‘HCIIP’), with an 54% Recovery Factor 
(‘RF’). Over 100 well penetrations have 
been drilled in over 30 years, there are 28 
platform slots and five subsea wells. It has 14 
active gas-lifted producers and 10 injectors. 
Water Alternating Gas(‘WAG’) enhanced 
oil recovery (‘EOR’) started in 2002 within 
the MSM. It has been monitored using 4D 
seismic surveys, the most recent of which 
was in 2013.
Sullom Voe Terminal (‘SVT’) 
A strategic infrastructure hub 
SVT was commissioned in 1978 and receives 
East of Shetland (‘EoS’) oil via two pipelines: 
the Brent Pipeline System (‘BPS’) which 
services Brent, Thistle, Northern Producer, 
Alwyn and TENCCA, and the Ninian Pipeline 
System (‘NPS’) which services Ninian, 
Magnus and Heather. EoS oil is stabilised, 
stored and offloaded to tankers. The peak 
EoS processing rate was 1.5 million bpd in 
1985; the current rate is c.130,000 bpd. 
 
Since 1998, the terminal has also provided 
services to West of Shetland (‘WoS’) fields. 
Schiehallion crude was tankered to SVT 
and used tanks and jetties. An additional 
oil pipeline from Clair was commissioned 
in 2005. Clair oil does not require 
stabilisation, but uses tanks and jetties. 
Gas from Foinaven Schiehallion and Clair is 
‘sweetened’ at SVT before being shipped 
to Magnus, for EOR and onward export. 
The terminal has recently started to process 
condensate from Total’s Laggan-Tormore 
development. 
EnQuest people
Working collaboratively is the key to our

2016
Across 2016, average production from 
PM8/Seligi was 7,960 Boepd.
Overall 2016 field performance was strong. 
Average annual production volumes 
were reduced by 21 days of maintenance 
shutdowns, compared to 3.5 shutdown days 
in 2015, and by lower gas sales, (325 Boepd), 
due to lower demand.
A total of 17 idle well strings were  
re-activated during 2016, adding an 
additional c.5,000 Boepd of gross 
production. This included two  
add-perforation jobs in November which 
added over c.1,000 Boepd of gross 
production. As a result of the successful 
idle well activation programme and 
improvements to plant stability at Seligi-A 
platform, the field achieved very strong 
levels of oil production. 
2017 and beyond
EnQuest will continue to enhance 
production by investing in low cost well 
interventions and facility projects to 
improve production efficiency, including 
gas compression control system upgrades 
to improve reliability. In addition, robust 
maintenance and integrity inspection 
campaigns of platform structures, topsides, 
and subsea pipelines will continue to ensure 
safe operations. This includes a planned 
annual maintenance shutdown in Q3 2017.
Longer term, EnQuest will extend field 
life through further investment in idle well 
restoration, facility improvements and 
upgrades and technical studies supporting 
development drilling and secondary 
recovery projects to increase ultimate 
recovery. During 2017, the first new drilling 
projects will be defined for execution in 
2018, and significant progress will be made 
on rebuilding of static and dynamic reservoir 
simulation models in support of longer term 
field redevelopment.

Financial overview
Following the significant decline in oil prices from late 2014, EnQuest  
has focused on delivering on execution targets, streamlining operations 
and strengthening the balance sheet. During 2016, the Company 
delivered its highest annual production since the Company started 
in 2010, brought the Scolty/Crathes development to first oil ahead of 
schedule and under budget, reduced its operating costs further and 
completed a comprehensive financial restructuring. This restructuring, 
which included amendments to the credit facility and bonds, as well as 
a placing and open offer, puts EnQuest in a stronger position to deliver 
the Kraken development in Q2 2017 and ensures that the Company is 
well placed to deliver value to shareholders in the medium term.
Production, on a working interest basis, increased by 9% to 39,751 
Boepd, compared to 36,567 Boepd in 2015. This reflects a full year of 
production from Alma/Galia and Tanjong Baram, initial production 
from Scolty/Crathes, increased production from Heather/Broom, 
partially offset by the impact of longer shutdowns at other fields, 
mainly due to maintenance on third party infrastructure.
Reflecting EnQuest’s drive to streamline operations, together with the 
increase in production volumes, unit operating costs reduced by 17% 
to $24.6 per barrel.

EBITDA for the year ended 31 December 2016 was $477.1 million, 
compared with $474.2 million in 2015. Although increased production 
and lower operating costs have driven a higher EBITDA, this was 
partially offset by the impact of lower oil prices in 2016. The Group 
manages its exposure to oil prices by entering into commodity 
hedging contracts. This hedge portfolio contributed $255.8 million 
to EBITDA in 2016 (2015: $261.2 million).

production from Alma/Galia and Tanjong Baram, contributing 6,740 
Boepd and 1,188 Boepd, respectively (2015: 1,083 Boepd and 373 
Boepd, respectively). Productivity at Alma/Galia, which achieved first oil 
in October 2015, has been negatively impacted by well performance this 
year. Heather/Broom demonstrated strong production performance, 
contributing 5,948 Boepd (2015: 4,643 Boepd), resulting from increased 
water injection reliability and the continuing benefits of the 2015 
wells workover programme. Scolty/Crathes, which achieved first oil in 
November 2016, has made a promising start, contributing 719 Boepd 
to annual production. Production at other fields was adversely affected 
by longer shutdowns than in 2015, including the impact of maintenance 
carried out on third party infrastructure taking longer than anticipated.
On average, oil prices in 2016 were lower than in 2015. The Group’s 
blended average realised price per barrel of oil sold excluding 
hedging was $44.3 for the year ended 31 December 2016, compared 
to $50.9 during 2015. Revenue is predominantly derived from crude 
oil sales and for the year ended 31 December 2016 crude oil sales 
totalled $577.8 million compared with $634.3 million in 2015. The 
decrease in revenue was due to the lower oil price, offset partially by 
higher production. Revenue from the sale of condensate and gas was 
$3.6 million (2015: $1.9 million) and tariffs and other income generated 
$12.4 million (2015: $9.2 million).
The Group’s commodity hedges and other oil derivatives generated 
$255.8 million of realised income (2015: $261.2 million). This includes 
$31.2 million of non-cash amortisation of option premiums and  
$2.5 million of hedge accounting gains deferred from 2015 (2015: 
$111.6 million of non-cash amortisation of option premiums). The 
Group’s average realised oil price after hedging was $63.8 per barrel 
in 2016 compared with $72.0 per barrel in 2015.
Revenue and other operating income also includes an unrealised loss 
of $51.5 million recognised within exceptional items in respect of the 
unrealised mark to market loss on the Group’s commodity contracts 
(2015: unrealised gain of $1.9 million). This relates mainly to swap 
contracts in place at 31 December 2016 hedging 2017 production, 
where 6 MMbbls were hedged at an average fixed price of $51 per bbl.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales, on a business performance basis, was as follows:

(1) Calculated on a working interest basis.
Business performance cost of sales was $653.5 million for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 compared with $733.4 million for 2015. 
Although production has increased year-on-year, operating costs 
decreased by $23.9 million, reflecting EnQuest’s ongoing cost saving 
initiatives and the benefit of a weaker Sterling exchange rate, partially 
offset by an increase in realised losses on foreign currency derivatives 
related to operating costs of $25.8 million. On a per barrel basis, the 
Group’s average operating cost per barrel has decreased by 17% to 
$24.6 per barrel, reflecting the cost reductions and foreign exchange 
benefits above, together with the impact of 9% higher production.
Cost of sales include realised losses on foreign currency derivatives 
related to capital expenditure of $47.3 million, reflecting the 
significant devaluation of Sterling against the US Dollar since June 
2016 (2015: loss of $9.4 million).
The Group’s overlift position decreased significantly during the year, 
primarily reflecting the unwind of the balances that had accrued at  
31 December 2015 on Thistle and GKA. The impact of this movement 
on the change in lifting position recognised in cost of sales was offset 
by the impact of higher oil prices on the valuation of the position at 
31 December 2016 compared to 31 December 2015, resulting in an 
overall $2.8 million expense in 2016 (2015: $28.5 million).
Depletion expense of $240.6 million was $58.3 million lower than the 
prior year, reflecting the impact of impairments recognised for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 on the average depletion rate, which 
decreased from $22.4 per barrel to $16.6 per barrel, partially offset by 
the impact of increased production.
Other cost of sales, which principally include the supplemental 
payment due on profit oil in Malaysia, decreased by $9.9 million, 
reflecting the impact of lower oil prices on the supplemental payment.
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses were $10.9 million during the 
year ended 31 December 2016, compared with $14.4 million reported 
in 2015. The decrease reflects the benefit of the devaluation of Sterling 
against the US Dollar on UK costs and the recovery of overheads. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
 32
Other income and expenses
Other income of $51.9 million almost entirely comprises net foreign 
exchange gains, which relate primarily to the revaluation of Sterling 
denominated amounts in the balance sheet following the devaluation 
of Sterling against the US Dollar.
Taxation
The tax credit for the year ended 31 December 2016 of $5.2 million 
(2015: $129.3 million tax credit), excluding exceptional items, is 
primarily due to Ring Fence Expenditure Supplement on UK activities 
and the tax effect on foreign exchange gains.
Finance costs
Finance costs of $122.2 million (2015: $176.4 million) include  
$110.5 million of bond and loan interest payable (2015: $80.2 million), 
$14.1 million unwinding of discount on provisions and liabilities (2015: 
$22.3 million), $36.5 million relating to the amortisation of premium  
on options designated as hedges of production (2015: $70.0 million),  
$5.9 amortisation of arrangement fees for the bank facilities and 
bonds (2015: $7.3 million) and other financial expenses of $10.5 million 
(2015: $11.0 million), primarily commitment and letter of credit fees. 
The Group capitalised interest of $55.3 million in relation to the 
interest payable on borrowing costs on its capital development 
projects, primarily the Kraken development (2015: $14.4 million).
Finance income
Finance income of $1.4 million includes $0.3 million of bank interest 
receivable and $1.0 million unwinding of the discounts on financial 
assets (2015: $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively).
Remeasurements and exceptional items
Remeasurements and exceptional items resulting in a net profit 
of $101.0 million before tax have been disclosed separately for the 
year ended 31 December 2016. These mainly include a net reversal 
of impairments of $147.9 million following the recovery of oil prices 
since last year, unrealised losses on commodity and foreign currency 
derivative contracts of $22.0 million, a $16.2 million loss on disposal of 
the Avalon asset, a $22.9 million credit arising from the derecognition 
of an onerous contract provision for the Stena Spey drilling vessel, 
reflecting the contracted days having been utilised in full, and a 
$3.4 million credit arising from the derecognition of a provision for 
contingent consideration in relation to the Eagle prospect, no longer 
expected to be payable. Exceptional items also include a $38.1 million 
loss on extinguishment of the Group’s credit facility as a result of 
the debt restructuring completed 21 November 2016, comprising 
the write-off of unamortised costs at the date of restructuring of  
$15.0 million, plus the expensing of costs associated with the 
restructuring of the facility of $23.1 million.
A tax charge of $37.3 million has been presented as exceptional, 
comprising a tax charge of $56.6 million relating to the tax impact of 
the above exceptional items and a tax credit of $19.3 million related 
to the recognition of UK tax losses previously written off, offset by the 
decrease in the supplementary charge on UK oil and gas production 
to 10%, with effect from 1 January 2016, and the decrease in 
Petroleum Revenue Tax (‘PRT’) to 0%, with effect from 1 January 2016.
Earnings per share
The Group’s reported basic earnings per share was 22.7 cents for  
the year ended 31 December 2016 compared with loss per share of  
98.0 cents for the year ended 31 December 2015. The Group’s 
reported diluted earnings per share was 22.1 cents for the year ended  
31 December 2016 compared with diluted loss per share of 98.0 cents 
for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Cash flow and liquidity
The Group’s net cash flow from operating activities for the year ended 
31 December 2016 was $379.5 million compared with $244.6 million 
for the same period last year. In part, this is due to the increased 
production and lower operating expenditure. Cash generated from 
operations also includes an inflow of $198.8 million from commodity 
hedging and outflow of $66.9 million from foreign exchange hedging 
(2015: inflow of $68.6 million and outflow of $3.2 million, respectively).
Net debt at 31 December 2016 amounted to $1,796.5 million 
compared with net debt of $1,548.0 million at 31 December 2015. 
The movement in net debt was as follows:

(2) Pursuant to the Restructuring, effective 21 November 2016, $27.5 million of 
accrued, unpaid interest was capitalised and added to the principal of the high 
yield bond and $0.2 million of accrued, unpaid interest was capitalised to the 
principal of the credit facility as an amount payable in kind (‘PIK Amount’) (refer 
note 19 of the Group financial statements).
It is anticipated that the underlying effective tax rate for 2017 will be 
below the UK statutory tax rate of 40%, excluding one-off exceptional 
tax items, due to UK tax reliefs and profits charged to tax at a lower 
rate in Malaysia. In the current environment and with the investment in 
the North Sea, the Group does not expect a material cash outflow for 
UK corporation tax on operational activities. This is due to the benefits 
from tax deductible first year capital allowances in the UK, available 
investment allowances and accumulated tax losses which are largely 
attributable to the Group’s capital investment programme to date.
Cash outflow on capital expenditure is set out in the table below:
2016

A total of $428.8 million was spent during 2016 on the Kraken 
development, where the subsea installation programme has now 
been completed and excellent progress was made on the drilling 
programme. Other significant projects undertaken during the year 
included the completion of the Scolty/Crathes development, drilling 
of the K7 (AP6) well and workover of the K3Z (AP1) well at Alma/Galia 
and drilling the Eagle exploration well.
On 21 November 2016, the Company concluded a comprehensive 
financial restructuring comprising: amendments to the credit facility, 
high yield bond and retail bond; renewal of surety bond facilities; 
and a placing and open offer (the ‘Restructuring’). The Restructuring 
significantly improved EnQuest’s liquidity position and included the 
following measures:
• the placing and open offer resulted in the issue of, in aggregate, 
356,738,114 new ordinary shares at an issue price of 23 pence per 
share and generated gross cash proceeds of $101.6 million;
• $176.3 million available for drawdown under the credit facility, as 
at the restructuring date, with maturity extended to October 2021, 
the amortisation profile amended and certain financial covenants 
relaxed;
• accrued, unpaid interest on the high yield bond as at the 
restructuring date of $27.5 million was capitalised and added to 
the principal amount of the bond;
Financial review continued  EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
• future interest payments due on the both retail and high yield 
bonds will only be payable in cash where the average prevailing oil 
price (dated Brent future, as published by Platts) for the six month 
period immediately preceding the day which is one month prior 
to the relevant interest payment date being at least $65 per barrel; 
otherwise interest payable is capitalised to principal, repayable at 
maturity; and
• option exercisable by the Company to extend the maturity date 
of the high yield bond and retail bond from April 2022 to April 
2023 with a further automatic extension of the maturity date to 
October 2023 if the credit facility is not fully repaid or refinanced 
by October 2020.
EnQuest has assessed that the Restructuring has resulted in a 
substantial modification of the terms of its credit facility. Accordingly, 
extinguishment accounting has been applied, resulting in the 
derecognition of the carrying value of the facility, including 
unamortised arrangement fees of $15.0 million, and the recognition 
of a new financial liability for the revised facility at fair value. Costs 
of $23.1 million associated with the renegotiation of the facility have 
been expensed to the income statement as exceptional finance costs.
The impact of the Restructuring on the high yield bond and retail bond 
has been assessed as not being substantial, resulting in $5.9 million of 
costs associated with the renegotiation of the bonds being deducted 
from the carrying values of the bond liabilities in the balance sheet. 
These costs, along with previous unamortised arrangement fees, will be 
amortised to the income statement over the revised term of the bonds.
The Group has remained in compliance with financial covenants  
under its debt facilities throughout the period and managing  
ongoing compliance remains a priority.
Balance sheet
The Group’s total asset value has increased by $148.7 million to 
$3,926.0 million at 31 December 2016 (2015: $3,777.3 million).
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment (‘PP&E’) has increased to $2,963.4 million 
at 31 December 2016 from $2,436.7 million at 31 December 2015.
The increase of $526.7 million is composed of additions to PP&E of 
$632.5 million, acquisitions of $40.7 million in respect of additional 
interests in the Kraken and West Don fields acquired from First Oil, an 
additional $26.0 million primarily in respect of the Kraken contingent 
carry recognised during the year, a decrease of $74.8 million for net 
changes in estimates for decommissioning, the KUFPEC cost recovery 
provision and other provisions, offset by depletion and depreciation 
charges of $245.8 million. In addition, the recovery of the oil price 
since last year, together with the positive impact on the Group’s North 
Sea cost base of the weakening of the GBP/USD rate, has led to a net 
reversal of $147.9 million of impairments booked in the prior year.
The PP&E capital additions during the period, including capitalised 
interest, are set out in the table below:
2016 
$ million
Kraken 476.6
Scolty/Crathes 76.4
Thistle 18.5
Alma/Galia 49.1
Other North Sea 7.5
Malaysia 4.4
632.5
Intangible oil and gas assets
Intangible oil and gas assets increased to $50.3 million at 31 December 
2016 from $46.5 million at 31 December 2015. The increase of  
$3.8 million comprises additions of $18.8 million, disposals of  
$17.6 million relating to the Avalon discovery, which was sold for  
$1.5 million, an increase of $3.6 million for change in 
decommissioning provision and write-offs, impairments and other 
movements of $2.0 million. Additions mainly relate to the Eagle 
exploration well, drilled on a 100% working interest basis in the 
Greater Kittiwake Area. The Eagle well has been confirmed as a 
discovery and further assessment of the results are underway.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables have decreased by $149.2 million to 
$202.7 million at 31 December 2016 compared with $351.9 million at  
31 December 2015. The decrease relates mainly to capital expenditure 
related prepayments, which are capitalised based on the timing of 
work performed, a decrease in trade receivables due to the timing  
of crude oil sales and other working capital movements.
Cash and net debt
The Group had $174.6 million of cash and cash equivalents at  
31 December 2016 and $1,796.5 million of net debt (2015: $269.0 
million and $1,548.0 million, respectively). Net debt* comprises the 
following liabilities:
• $191.3 million principal outstanding on the £155 million retail bond;
• $677.5 million principal outstanding on the high yield bond, 
including capitalised interest of $27.5 million pursuant to the 
Restructuring;
• $1,037.5 million carrying value of credit facility, comprising amounts 
drawn down of $1,037.3 and interest of $0.2 million capitalised as 
an amount payable in kind (‘PIK Amount’);
• $40.0 million loan facility drawn down from a trade creditor during 
the year; and
• $24.9 million principal outstanding on the Tanjong Baram project 
finance facility.
*   Net debt excludes accrued interest and the net-off of unamortised fees  
(refer note 19 of the Group financial statements).
Provisions
The Group’s decommissioning provision decreased by $12.9 million  
to $493.9 million at 31 December 2016 (2015: $506.8 million).  
The movement is explained by additions of $49.8 million for Kraken, 
Scolty/Crathes and Eagle based on drilling and development carried 
out during the period, $15.2 million arising from the acquisition of 
additional interests in the Kraken and West Don fields, reductions 
of $6.4 million for decommissioning carried out during the year and 
$82.2 million due to changes in estimates, including the impact of  
the devaluation of Sterling against the US Dollar, partially offset by  
$10.7 million unwinding of discount.
A liability of $26.6 million was provided for at 30 June 2016 following 
an independent reserves determination to assess the contingent 
consideration payable for Kraken, with a corresponding addition 
recorded in PP&E. Following payments made during the second half 
of the year, $5.5 million remained outstanding at 31 December 2016.
An onerous contract provision of $22.9 million for the Stena Spey 
drilling vessel was derecognised during the period, as the contracted 
days were utilised fully.
Income tax
The Group had no UK corporation tax or supplementary corporation 
tax liability at 31 December 2016, which remains unchanged from  
31 December 2015. The income tax asset at 31 December 2016 
represents UK corporation tax receivable in relation to non-upstream 
activities and the income tax payable is in relation to the activity  
in Malaysia.
Deferred tax
The Group’s net deferred tax asset has increased from $79.3 million 
at 31 December 2015 to $191.7 million at 31 December 2016. This 
movement includes the re-recognition of deferred tax assets totalling 
$48.8 million, following the improvement in the forecast profitability 
of the Group, a reduction in deferred tax assets of $29.5 million 
due to the reduction in the statutory PRT rate and the reduction in 
supplementary charge on UK oil and gas production, a reduction 
in deferred tax liability on realised hedges of $134.2 million and an 
increase in deferred tax liabilities of $73.8 million due to write back of 
previously impaired assets. Total UK tax losses carried forward at the 
year-end amount to approximately $2,893.7 million. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
 34
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables have decreased to $452.8 million at  
31 December 2016, of which $42.6 million are payable after more 
than one year (2015: $543.5 million, all payable within one year). 
The decrease mainly reflects the settlement of invoices for capital 
expenditure at Kraken and Scolty/Crathes, for which payment 
was previously deferred in accordance with supplier agreements. 
Remaining deferred amounts at 31 December 2016 of $176.8 million 
are contractually due for settlement in instalments over 2017 and 2018.
Other financial liabilities
Other current financial liabilities have increased by $35.1 million 
to $44.3 million. The increase relates primarily to mark-to-market 
movements on commodity derivatives hedging 2017 production.
Other non-current financial liabilities of $19.8 million (2015: $7.7 million) 
relate mainly to waiver fees payable to credit facility lenders and  
also to the Group’s liability to carry PETRONAS Carigali for its share  
of exploration or appraisal well commitments in relation to the  
PM8/Seligi asset in Malaysia.
Financial risk management
Oil price
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in Brent crude oil 
prices on its revenue and profits. EnQuest’s policy is to manage the 
impact of commodity prices to protect against volatility and allow 
availability of cash flow for reinvestment in capital programmes that 
are driving business growth.
During 2015 the Group entered into commodity hedging contracts 
to hedge a portion of its 2016 production against fluctuations in oil 
prices. This included bought put options over 8 MMbbls with an 
average strike price of $68 per barrel and oil swap contracts to sell  
2 MMbbls at an average fixed price of $67 per barrel. These contracts, 
to which hedge accounting was applied, matured over the course of 
2016 and realised $237.2 million of revenue and operating income. 
A gain of $2.5 million generated in 2015, which had been deferred in 
the cash flow hedge reserve at 31 December 2015 to match the timing 
of the underlying production being hedged, was also recognised as 
realised revenue and operating income in 2016.
At 31 December 2016, the Group’s commodity derivative contracts 
included swap contracts to sell 6 MMbbls at an average fixed price of 
$51 per barrel, maturing through 2017. The Group has elected not to 
apply hedge accounting to these contracts, which had a negative fair 
value and generated an unrealised mark to market loss of  
$40.5 million, recognised in revenue and other operating income.
Outside of its core hedge portfolio, during 2016 the Group also 
entered into call options, swaps contracts and futures, accounted 
for at fair value through profit or loss, which generated $7.6 million of 
revenue and other operating income.
Finance costs of $5.4 million have been recognised, representing 
the movement in the time value of put options which have been 
designated as effective hedges of production.
Foreign exchange
EnQuest’s functional currency is US Dollars. Foreign currency risk 
arises on purchases and the translation of assets and liabilities 
denominated in currencies other than US Dollars. To mitigate the 
risks of large fluctuations in the currency markets, the hedging policy 
agreed by the Board allows for up to 70% of the non-US Dollar portion 
of the Group’s annual capital budget and operating expenditure to 
be hedged. For specific contracted capital expenditure projects, 
up to 100% can be hedged. The Group has hedged its exposures to 
Sterling, Norwegian Kroner and the Euro in line with this policy.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group’s foreign currency 
hedging portfolio realised a loss of $66.9 million, recognised 
within cost of sales, of which $19.6 million related to hedges of 
operating expenditure and $47.3 million related to hedges of capital 
expenditure. The loss arose principally in relation to contracts to 
purchase Sterling, which devalued significantly against the US Dollar 
from June 2016 onwards. Changes in the fair value of these contracts 
also resulted in an unrealised credit of $7.8 million to cost of sales.
At 31 December 2016, the Group had foreign exchange forward 
contracts in place over NOK37.1 million at a fixed rate of NOK7.82/$. 
These contracts had a negative net fair value of $0.5 million at  
31 December 2016 and expire during the first half of 2017.
In the first half of 2016, the Group entered into a chooser structure 
covering the first half of 2017. The counterparty can choose to sell 
£47.5 million to EnQuest at an exchange rate of $1.4:£1.0 or purchase 
1,320,000 barrels of oil at $58/bbl. The contract had a negative fair 
value of $9.3 million at 31 December 2016. Subsequent to year-end,  
the Group entered into a similar chooser contract covering the 
second half of 2017 where the counterparty can choose to sell 
£66.0 million to EnQuest at an exchange rate of $1.2:£1.0 or purchase 
1,500,000 barrels of oil at $60 per barrel.
EnQuest continually reviews its currency exposures and when 
appropriate looks at opportunities to enter into foreign exchange 
hedging contracts.
Surplus cash balances are deposited as cash collateral against in-
place letters of credit as a way of reducing interest costs. Otherwise 
cash balances can be invested in short term bank deposits and AAA-
rated liquidity funds, subject to Board approved limits and with a view 
to minimising counterparty credit risks.
Going concern
The Group closely monitors and manages its funding position and 
liquidity risk throughout the year, including monitoring forecast 
covenant results to ensure it has access to sufficient funds to meet 
forecast cash requirements. Cash forecasts are regularly produced 
and sensitivities considered for, but not limited to, changes in crude 
oil prices (adjusted for hedging undertaken by the Group), production 
rates and development project timing and costs. These forecasts and 
sensitivity analyses allow management to mitigate any liquidity or 
covenant compliance risks in a timely manner.
On 21 November 2016, EnQuest announced a restructuring 
which comprised the implementation of the RCF Amendments, 
the Note Amendments, the renewal of the Surety Bond Facilities 
and the completion of a placing and open offer (collectively ‘the 
Restructuring’).
The completion of the Restructuring provides the Group with a 
more stable and sustainable capital structure, reduced cash debt 
service obligations and greater liquidity. These will all contribute to 
ensuring that the Group is in a stronger position to pursue its strategy 
of targeting mature and marginal oil assets and its focus on cost 
efficiency during a prolonged period of low oil prices. In particular, 
the Restructuring enables the Group to complete the Kraken project.
Following the significant decline in oil prices from late 2014, 
management has continued to take action to implement cost saving 
programmes to reduce planned operational expenditure, general and 
administrative spend and capital expenditure in 2017 and 2018.
At year end, the Group had available cash and bank facilities of  
$330.9 million and headroom on its related financial covenants under 
the RCF Amendments. The Group’s forecasts and projections take into 
account the actions described in the preceding paragraph, and reflect 
the assumption that the Group’s major projects remain on track.
This going concern assessment is prepared on the basis that the 
Facility providers continue to provide access to funding for the 
duration of the period under review. The Group’s business plan (base 
case) which underpins this assessment assumes Kraken first oil in Q2 
2017 and uses an oil price assumption of $55/bbl throughout 2017, 
and $60/bbl in the first quarter of 2018 and this has been further 
stressed tested under a plausible downside case (downside case) as 
described in the viability statement. The Directors consider the base 
case and downside case to be an appropriate basis on which to make 
their assessment.
The base case and downside case indicate that the Company will 
be able to operate within the headroom of its existing borrowing 
facilities for 12 months from the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts. Should there be any potential covenant breaches 
Financial review continued  EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
the Directors are confident that such breaches would be avoided or 
remedied by either executing other funding options or asset sales 
(mitigating actions) or obtaining waivers and/or consents from the 
Facility providers in order to ensure that the Facility remains available. 
The Directors believe that the mitigating actions would be achievable 
in the necessary timeframe or, if required, that the waivers and/or 
consents would be forthcoming.
The Directors therefore continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
Viability statement
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three-
year period to March 2020. This assessment has taken into account 
the Group’s financial position as at March 2017, the future projections 
and the principal risks and uncertainties. The Directors’ approach to 
risk management, their assessment of the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties, and the actions management are taking to mitigate 
these risks, are outlined on pages 40 to 47.
The period of three years is deemed appropriate as it provides a 
sufficient time horizon to assess the performance of the Kraken project 
and covers the period within which the Group’s Facility will be due to 
be partly repaid or refinanced.
Based on the Group’s projections, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to March 2020.
The Group’s business plan process has underpinned this assessment 
and has been used as the base case. The business plan process takes 
account of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, and has 
further been stress tested to understand the impact on the Group’s 
liquidity and financial position of reasonably possible changes in 
these risks and/or assumptions.
This also assumes that the Facility providers will continue to provide 
access to sufficient funding for the duration of the three year period 
under review. The forecasts which underpin this assessment use the 
same oil price assumption as for the going concern assessment with a 
longer term price assumption for the viability statement being aligned 
to the current forward curve. The base case reflects significant steps 
already underway to reduce operating and capital expenditure in 
light of continuing lower oil prices. The position is consistent with the 
statement made at the time of the Restructuring that if oil prices were 
to stay at the levels at that time of approximately $50 per barrel or if 
oil prices were to decline, it is highly likely that the Company would be 
unable to return any value to its shareholders.
The Directors draw attention to the specific risks and uncertainties 
identified below, which, individually or collectively, could have a 
material impact on the Group’s viability during the period of review. 
In forming this view, it is recognised that such future assessments are 
subject to a level of uncertainty that increases with time and, therefore, 
future outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted with certainty. 
The impact of these risks and uncertainties, including their combined 
impact, has been reviewed by the Directors and the effectiveness and 
achievability of the potential mitigating actions have been considered.
• Oil price volatility
 To mitigate oil price volatility, the Directors hedged 6 MMbbls of 
2017 production at an average price of $51 per barrel. As further 
mitigation the Directors, in line with Group policy, the Group will 
continue to pursue hedging at the appropriate time and price.
• Project execution
 The Group’s planned capital expenditure during the three year 
period covered by the viability assessment principally relates to 
the remaining expenditure to first oil on the Kraken development 
(which remains on track) and the future phases of the drilling 
programme on Kraken. Much of this expenditure has been 
contracted under fixed price lump sum contracts, therefore there 
is limited risk that this capital expenditure could exceed that 
projected and/or that commissioning of projects, in particular 
Kraken, could occur later than projected.
 The Directors and management team monitor project progress 
against key milestones and ensure timely intervention as appropriate.
• Access to funding
 The Directors recognise the importance of ensuring medium term 
liquidity and in particular to protect against potential future declines 
in the oil price. EnQuest has a diversified funding structure and, 
following the Restructuring, it has a committed $1.125 billion Tranche 
A Term Loan and a further Tranche B $75 million Revolving Credit 
Facility. Repayment of the Facility commences in April 2018 with the 
final repayment due in October 2021. In addition, the maturity dates 
of the $650 million High Yield Bond and the £155 million Retail Notes 
have been amended to April 2022, with an option exercisable by the 
Company (at its absolute discretion) to extend the maturity date by 
one year and an automatic further extension of the maturity date 
to October 2023 if the Existing RCF is not fully repaid or refinanced 
by October 2020. A further condition to the payment of interest in 
cash is based on, amongst other things, the average prevailing oil 
price (dated Brent future (as published by Platts)) for the six month 
period immediately preceding the day which is one month prior to 
the relevant interest payment date being at least $65/bbl; otherwise 
interest payable is to be capitalised.
 Should there be any potential covenant breaches, the Directors 
are confident that such breaches would be avoided or remedied 
by either executing other funding options or asset sales (mitigating 
actions) or obtaining waivers and/or consents from the Facility 
providers in order to ensure that the Facility remains available.
 The Directors believe that the mitigating actions would be 
achievable in the necessary timeframe or, if required, that the 
waivers and/or consents would be forthcoming.
In conducting the viability review, these risks have been taken into 
account in the stress testing performed on the base case described 
above.
Specifically the base case has been subjected to stress testing by 
considering the impact of the following plausible downside risks:
• a 10% discount to the oil price forward curve;
• a 5% reduction in production (excluding Kraken as this is already 
risked in the base case); and
• a 5% increase in operating costs except for fixed costs related to 
the Kraken FPSO.
A scenario has been run illustrating the impact of the above risks on 
the base case. This plausible downside case indicates the need for 
mitigating actions to be undertaken for the Group to be viable in the 
three year period.
In light of this, the Directors are also pursuing a number of mitigations 
to improve medium term liquidity. These options include, but are not 
limited to:
• asset sales; and
• other funding options.
The Directors believe that there are a number of options available 
to them and that only a small number of the potential asset sales or 
funding options would need successfully to be executed in order for 
the Group to remain viable for the three year period.
The Group would also seek to modify or temporarily waive existing 
covenants and loan amortisation should the need arise. The 
lenders continue to be supportive as demonstrated by the recent 
Restructuring. There is also regular dialogue with lenders to ensure 
that they remain informed of progress on the key projects and 
operations and the projections underpinning the liquidity position.
Having reviewed the Group’s financial position as at March 2017, 
the future projections, the principal risks and uncertainties and the 
mitigating actions, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period to March 2020 and therefore support 
this viability statement. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Evidence of our continued commitment to 
improvement was demonstrated through the 
following outcomes against our 2016 HSE&A 
Continual Improvement Plan:
• Continued focus on coaching our 
workforce to identify, understand and 
control hazards in the workplace 
• Further developing the capabilities of 
elected Safety Representatives and 
Environment Representatives through 
structured engagement sessions
• The launch of Life Saving Rules to 
underline the importance of maintaining 
standards and encouraging procedural 
compliance
• Demonstration of our commitment 
to industry simplification and 
standardisation initiatives by adopting 
industry standard tools for observational 
safety and tool box talks.
Other 2016 milestones included:
• Successful completion of a statutory 
evaluation of our Emergency Pollution 
Control systems and capabilities by 
The Secretary of State’s Representative 
for Marine and Salvage Intervention 
(‘SOSREP’). 
• Independent verification of our 
Environmental Management System 
(‘EMS’), a statutory requirement of the 
Convention for the Protection of the 
Marine Environment of the North-East 
Atlantic (‘OSPAR’).
• The launch of SAFE Behaviours, the 
next evolutionary step in our HSE 
improvement journey.

“EnQuest’s comprehensive UK  
HSE&A audit programme underlines 
our focus upon improvement through 
the detection and resolution of issues 
before they potentially materialise  
as incidents.”

The EnQuest Board receives regular 
information on the HSE&A performance of the 
Company, and specifically monitors health and 
safety and environmental reporting at each 
Board meeting. In 2016, EnQuest maintained 
its commitment to the delivery of continual 
improvement in HSE&A performance, with 
excellent results in many areas, but with some 
areas running below target and requiring fresh 
actions to be undertaken. 
Our Lost Time Injury (‘LTI’) performance 
remained strong: our Kittiwake, Northern 
Producer and EnQuest Producer assets in 
the North Sea all recorded an LTI free year. In 
October, Kittiwake also marked an industry 
leading 11 years without an LTI.
In our Malaysian operations, we recorded 
zero LTIs and were pleased to achieve a 
below target Total Recordable Incident 
Frequency (‘TRIF’) for the year. 
By contrast, the year presented challenges in 
relation to hydrocarbon releases in our North 
Sea operations, despite focused efforts to 
deliver a reduction. After underperforming 
our targeted number of releases in the first 
half of 2016, we revisited and restated our 
Hydrocarbon Release Prevention (‘HCRP’) 
Improvement Plan. This was preceded by the 
appointment of a full time HCRP coordinator, 
further scrutiny of lessons learned from 
incident investigations and the identification 
of gaps in our management systems through 
detailed audits.
Although there was no significant reduction 
in the number of oil and chemical releases to 
sea across the full year 2016, we witnessed 
a significant improvement in the mass of oil 
released, recording a 56% reduction on 2015 
levels. This provides robust evidence that 
our focus on reducing this type of release 
has been effective. Chemical releases to sea 
were predominantly (71% by mass) caused by 
the inadvertent release of subsea hydraulic 
fluids that have negligible environmental 
impact and are designed so that any such 
discharges to the sea are innocuous.
We completed a comprehensive UK 
HSE&A audit programme, with outcomes 
fed into our 2017 Continual Improvement 
Programme. This underlines our focus upon 
improvement through the detection and 
resolution of issues before they potentially 
materialise as incidents. 
In Q2 2016 in Malaysia, we pre-emptively shut 
down the PM8/Seligi asset to perform safety 
checks and inspections that were deemed 
prudent and we worked proactively to close 
down associated audit findings; following 
which production returned to good levels.   EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

People
The business wide strategy of cost 
management was also reflected in our people 
management activities. These nonetheless 
also continued to be focused proactively on 
optimising the performance of the workforce 
and supporting staff in the achievement of 
their professional development goals.
The challenges posed by the prevailing 
economic conditions required a reduction 
in overall North Sea staff numbers early in 
2016. EnQuest sought to keep job losses 
to a minimum and to complete the process 
with due consideration and respect for those 
directly impacted. 
Cost efficiencies were achieved in a range 
of ways. These included the relocation of 
the accounts payable function to Dubai 
– following the transfer of the purchasing 
support work there in 2015 and restructuring 
exercises in several departments, including 
finance and human resources.
A number of our people have transferred 
to other organisations under Transfer of 
Undertakings Protection of Employment 
(‘TUPE’) regulations. They are performing the 
same roles in support of EnQuest operations 
but this change represents a means of 
sourcing specialist services more cost 
effectively in specific areas. 
We have continued to examine the capabilities 
of the people who work for EnQuest and 
have sought to capitalise on their collective 
competencies and experience. As part of 
this exercise, more of our contractors were 
encouraged to, and elected to, become direct 
EnQuest employees during the year. This 
ensures that our key employees are all aligned 
behind the business deliverables and priorities 
and supports one of our aims to manage our 
own talent pool directly.
Our Central North Sea operations have, as 
planned, adopted an equal time rota in 2016. 
This aligns them with our Northern North 
Sea assets, which moved to an equal time 
rota in 2015. 
Throughout the year, close and regular 
engagement with staff remained a priority 
and a variety of mechanisms was used 
to deliver on this ongoing commitment, 
including weekly briefings, quarterly 
townhalls and opportunities to meet with 
senior leaders on a formal and informal basis. 
There was a specific focus in our UK 
operations upon performance management, 
to enable individuals to make the most 
of their skills and capabilities and make 
the greatest possible contribution to 
the next phase of EnQuest’s operational 
development, whilst ensuring that 
underperformance has been managed.  
This was equally the case in Malaysia.
Competency levels offshore remain a priority 
in both the UK and Malaysia, with systems 
being built to ensure the appropriate level of 
assessment and development of our people. 
In Malaysia, we formed a partnership with 
capability service provider Institut Teknoloji 
Petroleum PETRONAS (‘INSTEP’) and 
capability metrics for offshore installation 
managers, defining the skills required for the 
role, were established in partnership with the 
operations team.
In Malaysia, we also built our capabilities by 
recruiting in key subsurface, operations and 
finance roles and focused on succession 
planning with a baseline assessment related 
to critical positions. 
We made good on our commitment 
to engage with the Malaysian initiative 
Programme for the Development of 
Ingenious Young Talent (‘PRODIGY’), bringing 
two sponsored graduates into our process 
operations and wells functions. We also 
initiated the first petroleum engineering 
internship programme with a student from 
the Universiti Teknoloji PETRONAS.
EnQuest remains committed to fair treatment 
of people with disabilities in relation to job 
applications. Full consideration is given to 
applications from disabled persons where the 
candidate’s particular aptitudes and abilities 
are consistent with adequately meeting 
the requirement of the job. Additionally, 
EnQuest offers opportunities to disabled 
employees for training, career development 
and promotion. In the event of an existing 
employee becoming disabled, it is EnQuest’s 
policy to provide continuing employment 
whenever practicable in the same or 
an alternative position and to provide 
appropriate training to achieve this aim. 
Additionally, EnQuest remains committed 
to diversity, including diversity of skills, 
experience, nationality and gender in its 
appointments to the Board and within the 
Executive/Senior management teams and 
will continue to do so, recruiting individuals 
on merit and their suitability for the role and 
cognisant of the skills and experience of the 
rest of the Executive and Senior management.
Community
EnQuest focused in 2016 upon sustaining 
and enhancing its long term relationships 
with partner organisations in our local 
community in Aberdeen.
We donated over 400 books to the city’s 
Tullos Primary School in support of its 
objective to create a literary rich environment 
for pupils. Augmented by donations of books 
by individual members of EnQuest staff, the 
contribution equated to a book for every 
child at the school.
EnQuest has supported the school for six 
years and again in 2016 organised a visit for 
youngsters to a division of contractor Subsea 7 .  
The objective of the tour at remotely 
operated vehicle (‘ROV’) provider i-Tech was 
to introduce pupils to the energy industry and 
show the career opportunities it offers. The 
visit included opportunities for the youngsters 
to participate in simulator operations and 
view subsea tooling equipment. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

EnQuest provided further support for the 
charity Archway. We have a long standing 
partnership with the organisation, which 
provides services for children and adults with 
learning disabilities. A series of fund raising 
events during this year has brought the total 
we have realised for the Aberdeen based 
charity, since our involvement began, to 
over £162,000.
Among the other organisations supported 
by our charity committee in 2016 was 
the Grampian Transport Museum Young 
Engineers Club, which runs a variety of 
initiatives to promote science, technology 
and engineering to secondary school pupils.
EnQuest encourages and supports its 
employees to actively contribute to society, 
focusing particularly on local communities. 
In 2016, we made charitable donations in 
support of employees who took part in a 
wide variety of sporting and charitable events, 
including the Edinburgh Marathon, a cycle trip 
from Land’s End to John o’ Groats and a 50 
mile duathlon in the Scottish Highlands.
Several of our staff also encourage 
engineering as a profession through careers 
fairs and talks held under the auspices of the 
Energy Institute. 
In Malaysia, an inspiring corporate social 
responsibility (‘CSR’) project involved local 
staff visiting a Centre for the Disabled 
in Kemaman, Terengganu. Organised 
in collaboration with Jawatankuasa

event involved approximately 175 people 
in total, including children who attend the 
centre, family members, EnQuest staff 
and centre personnel.

itinerary included a series of fun activities. In 
line with our CSR principles, EnQuest made 
a tangible contribution to the centre by 
providing equipment for its sewing, cooking, 
physiotherapy and academic classes as well as 
donating goodie bags and t-shirts to the young 
people. The children delivered memorable 
individual and group performances for their 
guests at the end of the visit.
In 2017, our staff in Malaysia are planning a 
CSR project in support of a local orphanage.
Business conduct
EnQuest has recently revised and re-issued 
its Code of Conduct to its personnel. The 
EnQuest Code of Conduct sets out the 
behaviour which the organisation expects  
of its Directors, managers and employees,  
of our suppliers, contractors, agents and 
partners. We are committed to upholding  
the highest ethical standards, complying  
with all applicable legal requirements and  
to acting with complete integrity at all times.
Our employees and everyone that we work 
with create and support our reputation and 
ensure our progress and success. This code 
addresses our requirements in a number 
of areas including the importance of health 
and safety and environmental protection, 
compliance with applicable law, anti-
corruption, addressing conflicts of interest, 
ensuring equal opportunities, combatting 
bullying and harassment and the protection 
of privacy. 
The Group’s induction procedures cover the 
Code of Conduct and the Group runs both 
ad hoc and scheduled periodic training for 
personnel to refresh their familiarity with 
relevant aspects of the Code of Conduct 
or specific policies and procedures which 
support the Code (such as the Group’s 
anti-corruption programme). As part of the 
Group’s Risk Management Framework the 
Board is supplied annually with an ‘assurance 
map’ to provide the Board with an insight into 
the status of the main sources of controls and 
assurance in respect of the Group’s risk areas.
Whilst this provides some formal assurance 
as to how Group reinforces its requirements 
in respect of business conduct, the Board 
also recognises the importance of promoting 
the right culture within the Group and this 
has become an area of increased focus 
for the Group. Please see page 40–47 for 
further information.
The Code also includes details of the 
independent reporting line through which 
any concerns related to the Group’s practices 
or any suspected breaches of the Code 
or other policies and procedures can be 
raised. Where concerns are raised (whether 
through this reporting line or otherwise), the 
General Counsel, reporting for this purpose 
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, is 
required to look into the relevant concern and 
investigate and take action as appropriate. 
In recent months, concerns raised in relation 
to potential conflicts of interest and safety 
practices as well as more routine interfaces 
with regulatory authorities, have been 
reported to the Board and addressed.
The Code has been refreshed and now 
includes a confirmation of EnQuest’s 
commitments to adhere to applicable tax 
laws as well as the Group’s stance against 
slavery and human trafficking. The Group 
has zero tolerance of such practices and 
expects the same of all with whom it has 
business dealings; for example, in relation 
to procurement, by requiring suppliers to 
confirm their commitment to anti-slavery 
before being qualified to supply the Group. 
The Group has supplemented its procedures 
to provide further assurance that it is able to 
identify and manage human rights risks in its 
supply chain and will be publishing a further 
slavery and human trafficking statement on 
its website.
Further detail on EnQuest’s Corporate 
Responsibility policies and activities,  
including the area of Business Conduct,  
is available on the Corporate Responsibility 
section of EnQuest’s website at

Risks and uncertainties
Management of risks and uncertainties 
The Board has articulated EnQuest’s strategy 
to deliver value by targeting maturing assets 
and underdeveloped oil fields. EnQuest has 
prioritised its strategic focus to deliver on 
execution targets, streamline operations and 
strengthen its balance sheet. As EnQuest 
moves from a period of heavy investment to 
one focused on realising value from existing 
resources and capabilities, it will strictly 
maintain financial discipline and focus on 
driving cash flow. 
In pursuit of this strategy, EnQuest has 
to face and manage a variety of risks. 
Accordingly, the Board has established a 
Risk Management Framework to enhance 
effective risk management within the 
following overarching statement of risk 
appetite approved by the Board:
• We aim to deliver consistently above 
median investment performance 
• We will manage the investment portfolio 
against agreed key performance 
indicators consistent with the strategic 
objectives of enhancing net revenues  
and strengthening the balance sheet
• We seek to avoid reputational risk by 
ensuring that our operational processes 
and practices reduce the potential for 
error to the extent practicable
• We seek to embed a risk culture within 
our organisation corresponding to the 
appetite for risk which is articulated for 
each of our principal risks 
• We seek to manage operational risk by 
means of a variety of controls to prevent 
or mitigate occurrence 
• We set clear tolerances for all material 
operational risks to minimise overall 
operational losses, with zero tolerance  
for criminal conduct
We seek to balance our risk position 
between investing in activities that may drive 
growth and the continuing need to remain a 
financially disciplined and low cost, cash flow 
generating operator as the Group reduces its 
debt and appropriate market opportunities 
present themselves. In this regard the Board 
has commenced a process to develop certain 
specific principles to guide the Company 
during the current phase of its evolution 
which tie together the Company’s thinking 
on strategy and risk. Broadly, these would 
reflect a focus by the Company on:
• Adding value to assets which are already 
in production and within geographical 
parameters
• Adhering to specific disciplines in capital 
allocation decisions and management of 
capital structure
• Management of portfolio concentration 
risks (see also page 47)
• Ensuring target setting for personnel 
aligns appropriately with the Company’s 
strategy and risk appetite
The Board reviews the Company’s risk 
appetite annually in light of changing market 
conditions and the Company’s performance 
and strategic focus. 
The Executive Committee periodically 
reviews and updates the Group Risk 
Register based on the individual risk registers 
of its members. The Group Risk Register, 
along with an assurance mapping exercise 
and a risk report (focused on the most 
critical risks and emerging and changing 
risk profiles), is periodically reviewed by 
the Board (with senior management), to 
ensure that key issues are being adequately 
identified and actively managed. In addition, 
a sub-Committee of the Board has been 
established (the Risk Committee) to provide 
a forum for the Board to review selected 
individual risk areas in greater depth. 
The Board, upon the advice of the Audit 
Committee, has reviewed the Group’s system 
of risk management and internal control for 
the period from 1 January 2016 to the date 
of this report, and is satisfied that they are 
effective and that the Group complies in 
this respect with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s ‘Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting’. 
Key business risks 
The Group’s principal risks are those which 
could prevent the business from executing its 
strategy and creating value for shareholders 
or lead to a significant loss of reputation.
The Board has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Company, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. 
Cognisant of the Group’s financial 
restructuring (and consequent strategic 
focus on deleveraging and strengthening 
its balance sheet), the Board is satisfied that 
the Group’s risk management system works 
effectively in assessing and managing the 
Group’s risk appetite and has supported a 
robust assessment by the Directors of the 
principal risks facing the Group. 
Set out on the following pages are the 
principal risks and the mitigations (together 
with an estimate of the potential impact and 
likelihood of occurrence after the mitigation 
actions and how these have changed in the 
past year) and an articulation of the Group’s 
risk appetite for each of these principal risks. 
Amongst these, the key risks the Group 
currently faces are a prolonged low oil price 
environment and/or a sustained decline in 
oil prices (see ‘Oil Price’ risk on page 45) and 
any material delay to achieving first oil and/
or materially lower than expected production 
performance at the Kraken field (see ‘Project 
execution’ and ‘Production’ risks on pages 42 
and 41 respectively).  EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Risk Appetite
Health, safety and 
environment (‘HSE’)
Oil and gas development, production 
and exploration activities are complex 
and HSE risks cover many areas including 
major accident hazards, personal health 
and safety, compliance with regulatory 
requirements and potential environmental 
harm.
Potential impact – Medium (2015 Medium)
Likelihood – Low (2015 Low)
There has been no material change 
in the potential impact or likelihood 
and the Group’s overall record on HSE 
remains robust.
The Group strives to provide a highly 
secure setting for its people and the natural 
environment and we endeavour constantly 
to improve our safety standards back to 
where we have shown we can deliver with 
zero recordable or high potential incidents. 
There is no reason for anyone associated 
with our business to take safety risks other 
than those normally associated with oil and 
gas operations and the Group has a low 
appetite for risks to HSE.
Mitigation
The Group maintains, in conjunction with 
its core contractors, a comprehensive 
programme of HSE, asset integrity and 
assurance activities and has implemented 
a continual improvement programme, 
promoting a culture of transparency in 
relation to HSE matters. The Group has 
established a Corporate HSE Committee 
which meets quarterly. HSE performance 
is discussed at each Board meeting 
and during 2016, the Group completed 
a comprehensive UK HSE&A audit 
programme, with outcomes fed into our 
2017 Continual Improvement Programme 
and, revisited and restated its Hydrocarbon 
Release Prevention Improvement Plan.
In addition, the Group has a positive and 
transparent relationship with the UK Health 
and Safety Executive and Department for 
Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.
EnQuest’s HSE&A Policy is now fully 
integrated across our operated sites and 
this has enabled an increased focus on 
Health, Safety and the Environment. There 
is a strong assurance programme in place to 
ensure EnQuest complies with its Policy and 
Principles and regulatory commitments. 
When appropriate, EnQuest will extend the 
application of its HSE&A policies, activities 
and programmes to operatorship of the 
Magnus oil field, Sullom Voe Terminal (and 
associated pipelines); see page 27 for 
further details.
Risk Appetite
Production
The Group’s production is critical to its 
success and is subject to a variety of 
risks including subsurface uncertainties, 
operating in a mature field environment 
and potential for significant unexpected 
shutdowns and unplanned expenditure 
to occur (particularly where remediation 
may be dependent on suitable weather 
conditions offshore).
Lower than expected reservoir 
performance may have a material 
impact on the Group’s results.
The Group’s delivery infrastructure in the 
UKCS is, to a significant extent, dependent 
on the Sullom Voe Terminal.
Longer term production is threatened if low 
oil prices bring forward decommissioning 
timelines.
Potential impact – High (2015 High)
Likelihood – Low (2015 Low)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood: while
reliance on the Sullom Voe Terminal has
decreased due to the Alma/Galia and
Scolty/Crathes projects coming onstream, 
and will reduce further when Kraken comes 
onstream. Production at Alma/Galia has 
been below expectations to date.
Also, until the Kraken project is fully 
onstream, the possibility of production at 
the field being below expectations cannot 
be discounted. 
Since production efficiency is core to 
our business and the Group seeks to 
maintain a high degree of operational 
control over production assets in its 
portfolio, EnQuest has a very low tolerance 
for operational risks to its production 
(or the support systems that underpin 
production).
Mitigation
The Group’s programme of asset integrity 
and assurance activities provide leading 
indicators of significant potential issues 
which may result in unplanned shutdowns 
or which may in other respects have the 
potential to undermine asset availability 
and uptime. The Group continually assesses 
the condition of its assets and operates 
extensive maintenance and inspection 
procedures designed to minimise the risk 
of unplanned shutdowns and expenditure. 
The Group monitors both leading and 
lagging KPIs in relation to its maintenance 
activities and liaises closely with its 
downstream operators to minimise pipeline 
and terminal production impacts.
Production efficiency is continually 
monitored with losses being identified and 
remedial and improvement opportunities 
undertaken as required. A continual, 
rigorous cost focus is also maintained. 
Life of asset production profiles are 
audited by independent reserves auditors. 
The Group also undertakes regular 
internal reviews. The Group’s forecasts of 
production are risked to reflect appropriate 
production uncertainties.
The Sullom Voe Terminal has a good 
safety record and its safety and operational 
performance levels are regularly monitored 
and challenged by the Group and other 
terminal owners and users to ensure that 
operational integrity is maintained. Further, 
EnQuest expects to be well positioned to 
manage potential operational risks related 
to Sullom Voe Terminal once it steps into 
operatorship of the terminal. Nevertheless, 
the Group actively continues to explore the 
potential of alternative transport options 
and developing hubs that may provide  
cost savings. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Risk Appetite
Project execution 
The Group’s success will be partly 
dependent upon bringing Kraken to 
production on budget and on schedule.
Potential impact – High (2015 High)
Likelihood – Low (2015 Low)
The potential impact has been partially
offset by the Alma/Galia and Scolty/Crathes 
projects coming into production in 2015 
and 2016 respectively. Further, although 
the Kraken project remains on time and 
on budget (the Kraken development 
FPSO is securely moored on station 
where commissioning work continues); 
until first oil is achieved, the potential 
impact remains high.
Further, as the Group focuses on
deleveraging its balance sheet, executing 
new large scale developments is not 
considered a strategic priority in the  
short term.
The efficient delivery of new developments 
has been a key feature of the Group’s  
long term strategy. Following the entry  
into production of the Alma/Galia and 
Scolty/Crathes projects, the Company 
recognises that until the Kraken 
development is in production, the Company 
continues to have considerable exposure 
to development risks associated with 
the project and that this exposure is now 
greater than had been anticipated before 
the industry oil price crisis of the past two 
years. While the Group necessarily assumes 
significant risk when it sanctions a new 
development (for example, by incurring costs 
against oil price assumptions), it requires 
that risks to efficient implementation of the 
project are minimised.
Mitigation
The Group has project teams which are 
responsible for the planning and execution 
of new projects with a dedicated team for 
each development. The Group has detailed 
controls, systems and monitoring processes 
in place to ensure that deadlines are 
met, costs are controlled and that design 
concepts and the Field Development Plan 
are adhered to and implemented. These 
are modified when circumstances require 
and only through a controlled management 
of change process and with the necessary 
internal and external authorisation and 
communication. The Group also engages 
third party assurance experts to review, 
challenge and, where appropriate, make 
recommendations to improve the processes 
for project management, cost control and 
governance of major projects. EnQuest 
ensures that responsibility for delivering 
time-critical supplier obligations and lead 
times are fully understood, acknowledged 
and proactively managed by the most 
senior levels within supplier organisations.
The Kraken development was sanctioned 
by DECC and EnQuest’s partners in 
November 2013. First oil production 
remains scheduled for Q2 2017. Prior to 
sanction, EnQuest identified and optimised 
the development plan using EnQuest’s  
pre-investment assurance processes. 
With respect to the Kraken development,
the FPSO is being provided by a third party 
on a lease basis to mitigate risk of cost 
overrun. A total of seven production and six 
injection wells have now been safely drilled 
and completed, with results in line with  
pre-drill predictions.
Risk Appetite
Reserve replacement
Failure to develop its contingent and 
prospective resources or secure new 
licences and/or asset acquisitions and 
realise their expected value.
Potential impact – High (2015 High)
Likelihood – Medium (2015 Medium)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood as oil price 
volatility and a focus on strengthening 
the balance sheet continues to limit 
business development activity to the 
pursuit of reserves enhancing, selective, 
cash-accretive opportunities (such as the 
acquisition of an interest in the Magnus oil 
field – please see page 27). 
Low oil prices can potentially affect 
development of contingent and 
prospective resources and can also affect 
reserve certifications.
Reserves replacement is an element of 
the Group’s success. The Group has some 
tolerance for the assumption of risk in 
relation to the key activities required to 
deliver reserves growth, such as drilling  
and acquisitions.
Mitigation
The Group puts a strong emphasis on 
subsurface analysis and employs industry 
leading professionals. The Group continues 
to recruit in a variety of technical positions 
which enables it to manage existing assets 
and evaluate the acquisition of new assets 
and licences.
All analysis is subject to internal and, 
where appropriate, external review. All 
reserves are currently externally reviewed 
by a Competent Person. In addition, 
EnQuest has active business development 
teams both in the UK and internationally 
developing a range of opportunities and 
liaising with vendors/government.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Risk Appetite
Financial
Inability to fund financial commitments. 
The Group’s term loan and revolving credit 
facility contains certain financial covenants 
(based on the ratio of indebtedness 
incurred under the term loan and revolving 
facility to EBITDA, finance charges to 
EBITDA and a requirement for liquidity 
testing). Prolonged low oil prices, cost 
increases and production delays or outages 
could threaten the Group’s liquidity and/or 
ability to comply with relevant covenants.
Potential impact – High (2015 High)
Likelihood – High (2015 Medium)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood: although the 
Group successfully completed a financial 
restructuring, it remains highly reliant on 
the successful completion of the Kraken 
development and production at Kraken 
being in line with expectations. Further 
information is contained in the going 
concern and viability paragraphs on pages 
34 and 35 of the Financial review.
The Group recognises that significant 
leverage has been required to fund its 
growth as low oil prices have impacted 
revenues. However, it is intent on reducing 
its leverage levels, maintaining liquidity and 
complying with its obligations to finance 
providers while delivering shareholder 
value, recognising that reasonable 
assumptions relating to external risks need 
to be made in transacting with finance 
providers.
Mitigation
During the year, the Group completed a 
financial restructuring involving:
(i) Amendments to its:
•  revolving credit facility (including, inter 
alia, an extension of the maturity date/
amendment of the amortisation schedule 
and relaxation of financial covenants);
•  retail bond (including, inter alia, making 
cash interest payments contingent on 
certain conditions (including relating to 
the oil price) being met, an extension 
of the maturity date and a removal of 
financial covenants); and
•  high yield bond (including, inter alia, 
making cash interest payments contingent 
on certain conditions (including relating to 
the oil price) being met and an extension 
of the maturity date). 
(ii)  A placing and open offer was 
successfully completed with gross 
aggregate proceeds of £82 million.
These steps together are expected to 
provide the Group with a stable and 
sustainable capital structure, reduced 
cash debt service obligations and greater 
liquidity so as to strengthen its balance 
sheet for longer term growth.
Ongoing compliance with the financial 
covenants under the Group’s term loan and 
revolving credit facility is actively monitored 
and reviewed. 
Funding from the bonds and revolving 
credit facility is supplemented by operating 
cash inflow from the Group’s producing 
assets. The Group reviews its cash flow 
requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure 
it has adequate resources for its needs. 
The Group is continuing to maintain a focus 
on controlling and reducing costs through 
supplier renegotiations, cost-cutting and 
rationalisation. Where costs are incurred 
by external service providers, e.g. at 
Sullom Voe Terminal, the Group actively 
challenges operating costs. The Group also 
maintains a framework of internal controls. 
Further, production at Scolty/Crathes and 
completion of the Kraken development 
should lead to increases in production and 
decreases in average unit operating costs 
across the Group. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
 44
Risk Appetite
Human resources 
The Group’s success continues to be 
dependent upon its ability to attract 
and retain key personnel and develop 
organisational capability to deliver strategic 
growth. Industrial action across the sector 
could also impact on the operations of  
the Group.
Potential impact – Low (2015 Low)
Likelihood – Medium (2015 Medium)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood.
As a low cost, lean organisation, the 
Group relies on motivated and high quality 
employees to achieve its targets and 
manage its risks. The Group recognises 
that the benefits of a lean and flexible 
organisation require agility to assure 
against the risk of skills shortages.
Mitigation
The Group has established a competent 
employee base to execute its principal 
activities. In addition to this, the Group 
seeks to maintain good relationships with 
its employees and contractor companies 
and regularly monitors the employment 
market to provide remuneration packages, 
bonus plans and long term share based 
incentive plans that incentivise performance 
and long term commitment from our 
employees to the Group.
EnQuest is undertaking a number of human 
resource initiatives. These initiatives are 
part of the overall People and Organisation 
strategy and have specific themes relating 
to Organisation, People, Performance and 
Culture. The culture of the Group is an area 
of increased focus given the rapid growth 
of the Group and as it absorbs a significant 
number of personnel into the business with 
its acquisition of operating interests in the 
Magnus field and the Sullom Voe Terminal.
The Group also maintains market-
competitive contracts with key suppliers 
to support the execution of work where 
the necessary skills do not exist within 
the Group’s employee base.
The focus on executive and senior 
management retention, succession 
planning and development remains an 
important priority for the Board and an 
increasing emphasis will continue to be 
placed on this. It is a Board-level priority 
that executive and senior management 
possess the appropriate mix of skills and 
experience to realise the Group’s strategy; 
succession therefore remains a key priority.
Risk Appetite
Reputation
The reputational and commercial exposures 
to a major offshore incident are significant.
Potential impact – High (2015 High)
Likelihood – Low (2015 Low)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood.
The Group has no tolerance for conduct 
which may compromise its reputation for 
integrity and competence. 
Mitigation
Operational activities are conducted 
in accordance with approved policies, 
standards and procedures. Interface 
agreements are agreed with all core 
contractors.
The Group requires adherence to its 
Code of Conduct and runs compliance 
programmes to provide assurance on 
conformity with relevant legal and ethical 
requirements.
The Group undertakes regular audit 
activities to provide assurance on 
compliance with established policies, 
standards and procedures.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Risk Appetite
Oil price
A material decline in oil and gas prices 
adversely affects the Group’s operations 
and financial condition. 
Potential impact – High (2015 High)
Likelihood – High (2015 High)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood.
The Group recognises that considerable 
exposure to this risk is inherent to its 
business.
Mitigation
This risk is being mitigated by a number 
of measures including hedging oil price, 
renegotiating supplier contracts, reducing 
costs and commitments and seeking to 
institutionalise a lower cost base. 
The Group monitors oil price sensitivity 
relative to its capital commitments and 
has a policy which allows hedging of 
its production. The Group has hedged 
6 million bbls for 2017 at a price of 
approximately $51/bbl. This ensures that 
the Group will receive a minimum oil price 
for its production.
In order to develop its resources, the Group 
needs to be able to fund substantial levels 
of investment. The Group will therefore 
regularly review and implement suitable 
policies to hedge against the possible 
negative impact of changes in oil prices 
while remaining within the limits set by its 
term loan and revolving credit facility.
The Group has established an in-house 
trading and marketing function to enable 
it to enhance its ability to mitigate the 
exposure to volatility in oil prices.
Further, as described above, the Group’s 
focus on production efficiency supports 
mitigation of a low oil price environment.
Risk Appetite
Political and fiscal
Unanticipated changes in the regulatory 
or fiscal environment can affect the Group’s 
ability to deliver its strategy and potentially 
impact revenue and future developments.
Potential impact – High (2015 High)
Likelihood – Low (2015 Low)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood.
While ‘Brexit’ appears unlikely to directly 
impact the Group materially, it has 
increased the possibility of a further 
Scottish independence referendum.
The Group faces an uncertain macro 
economic and regulatory environment. Due 
to the nature of such risks and their relative 
unpredictability, it must be tolerant of 
certain inherent exposure. 
Mitigation
It is difficult for the Group to predict 
the timing or severity of such changes. 
However, through Oil & Gas UK and 
other industry associations the Group 
does engage with government and 
other appropriate organisations in order 
to ensure the Group is kept abreast of 
expected potential changes and takes 
an active role in making appropriate 
representations.
All business development or investment 
activities recognise potential tax 
implications and the Group maintains 
relevant internal tax expertise.
At a more operational level, the Group has 
procedures to identify impending changes 
in relevant regulations to ensure legislative 
compliance. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
 46
Risk Appetite
Joint venture partners
Failure by joint venture parties to fund 
their obligations.
Dependence on other parties where the 
Group is not the operator.
Potential impact – Medium (2015 Medium)
Likelihood – Medium (2015 Medium)
There has been no material change in the 
potential impact or likelihood.
The Group requires partners of high 
integrity. It recognises that it must accept a 
degree of exposure to the creditworthiness 
of partners and evaluates this aspect 
carefully as part of every investment 
decision.
Mitigation
The Group operates regular cash call and 
billing arrangements with its co-venturers 
to mitigate the Group’s credit exposure at 
any one point in time and keeps in regular 
dialogue with each of these parties to 
ensure payment. Risk of default is mitigated 
by joint operating agreements allowing the 
Group to take over any defaulting party’s 
share in an operated asset and rigorous 
and continual assessment of the financial 
situation of partners.
 
The Group generally prefers to be the 
operator. The Group maintains regular 
dialogue with its partners to ensure 
alignment of interests and to maximise the 
value of joint venture assets. During 2016, 
the Group acquired a 10.5% participating 
interest in Kraken for nominal consideration 
from First Oil, a partner which defaulted 
on its ongoing financial obligations to the 
project. Additionally, the Group acquired 
a further 15.15% interest in the West Don 
field, also from First Oil.
Risk Appetite
Competition
The Group operates in a competitive 
environment across many areas, including 
the acquisition of oil and gas assets, the 
marketing of oil and gas, the procurement 
of oil and gas services and access to 
human resources.
Potential impact – Medium (2015 Medium)
Likelihood – Medium (2015 Medium)
There has been no material change in 
the impact or likelihood.
The Group operates in a mature industry 
with well-established competitors and aims 
to be the leading operator in the sector;  
it thus has a high appetite for this risk.
Mitigation
The Group has strong technical and 
business development capabilities to 
ensure it is well positioned to identify and 
execute potential acquisition opportunities.
The Group maintains good relations with 
oil and gas service providers and constantly 
keeps the market under review.
Risks and uncertainties continued  EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Risk Appetite
Portfolio concentration
The Group’s assets are concentrated in the 
UK North Sea around a limited number of 
infrastructure hubs and existing production 
(which is principally only oil) is from mature 
fields. This amplifies exposure to key 
infrastructure, political/fiscal changes and 
oil price movements.
Potential impact – High (2015 Medium)
Likelihood – Medium (2015 Medium)
The acquisition of an interest in the Magnus 
oil field and Sullom Voe Terminal (and 
associated pipelines) has elevated this risk 
in the long term (by further concentrating 
the Group’s portfolio in the UK North Sea); 
further, although production from Alma/
Galia and Kraken (where the Group now 
has an increased exposure due to the 
acquisition of an additional working interest 
of 10.5%) represent new production hubs 
for the Group, both projects further extend 
geographic concentration of the Group’s 
production in the UK North Sea.
Although the extent of portfolio 
concentration is moderated by production 
generated internationally, the majority 
of the Group’s assets remain relatively 
concentrated in the UK North Sea and 
therefore this risk remains intrinsic to 
the Group.
Mitigation
This risk is mitigated in part through 
acquisitions. For all acquisitions, the Group 
uses a number of business development 
resources to evaluate and transact 
acquisitions in a commercially sensitive 
matter. This includes performing extensive 
due diligence (using in-house and external 
personnel) and actively involving executive 
management in reviewing commercial, 
technical and other business risks together 
with mitigation measures. 
The Group also constantly keeps its 
portfolio under rigorous review and, 
accordingly, actively considers the potential 
for making disposals and divesting, 
executing development projects, making 
international acquisitions and expanding 
hubs where such opportunities are 
consistent with the Group’s focus on 
enhancing net revenues, generating cash 
flow and strengthening the balance sheet. 
The acquisition of the Greater Kittiwake
Area in 2014 which produces via the 
Forties Pipeline System (‘FPS’) and the 
start-up of Alma/Galia which produces 
to shuttle tankers reduced the Group’s 
prior concentration to the Brent Pipeline 
System (‘BPS’) and the Sullom Voe Terminal. 
Start-up of the Kraken field, which also 
exports via shuttle tankers, will reduce 
further any concentration risk in 2017. 
Although, on successful completion of the 
Group’s planned acquisition of the Magnus 
field and Sullom Voe Terminal from BP, the 
Group will see a further concentration in 
SVT, as the Magnus field produces via the 
Ninian Pipeline System (‘NPS’) this will not 
concentrate risk further in BPS. It should 
also be noted that the Heather and Broom 
fields also produce via NPS. Although the 
Group has concentration risk at Sullom 
Voe Terminal, taking operatorship of the 
terminal will put the Group in a position of 
more direct control of such risk.
Risk Appetite
International business
While the majority of the Group’s activities 
and assets are in the UK, the international 
business is still material. The Group’s 
international business is subject to the 
same risks as the UK business (e.g. HSE, 
production and project execution); 
however, there are additional risks that 
the Group faces including security of staff 
and assets, political, foreign exchange 
and currency control, taxation, legal and 
regulatory, cultural and language barriers 
and corruption.
Potential impact – Medium (2015 Medium) 
Likelihood – Low (2015 Low)
There has been no material change in the 
impact or likelihood.
In light of its long term growth strategy, 
the Group seeks to expand and diversify 
its production (geographically and in 
terms of quantum); as such, it is tolerant 
of assuming certain commercial risks 
which may accompany the opportunities 
it pursues. However, such tolerance does 
not impair the Group’s commitment to 
comply with legislative and regulatory 
requirements in the jurisdictions in which 
it operates. Opportunities should enhance 
net revenues and facilitate strengthening 
of the balance sheet. 
Mitigation
Prior to entering into a new country, 
EnQuest evaluates the host country to 
assess whether there is an adequate and 
established legal and political framework 
in place to protect and safeguard first its 
expatriate and local staff and, second, any 
investment within the country in question.
When evaluating international business 
risks, executive management reviews 
commercial, technical and other business 
risks together with mitigation and how risks 
can be managed by the business on an 
ongoing basis.
EnQuest looks to employ suitably qualified 
host country staff and work with good 
quality local advisers to ensure it complies 
within national legislation, business practices 
and cultural norms while at all times ensuring 
that staff, contractors and advisers comply 
with EnQuest’s business principles, including 
those on financial control, cost management, 
fraud and corruption.
Where appropriate, the risks may be 
mitigated by entering into a joint venture 
with partners with local knowledge and 
experience.
After country entry, EnQuest maintains 
a dialogue with local and regional 
government, particularly with those 
responsible for oil, energy and fiscal matters, 
and may obtain support from appropriate 
risk consultancies. When there is a significant 
change in the risk to people or assets within 
a country, the Group takes appropriate 
action to safeguard people and assets.

Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board of Directors (the ‘Board’), I am pleased to 
introduce EnQuest’s Corporate Governance Report.
I would like to thank my predecessor Dr Jim Buckee, who retired 
as Chairman of the Company in September 2016, for leading the 
Company from its inception in 2010 with great energy and passion. His 
contributions are appreciated by EnQuest staff and the Board alike.
A significant focus of the Board during the latter part of 2016 has 
been the financial restructuring of the Company, as described on 
page 10, and I would like to thank the Board members, management 
and staff for their dedication during this challenging period. This 
process required considerable time and focus from the Board, who 
attended numerous ad hoc calls and meetings as the project was 
developed. Throughout the process the Board, together with the 
Company’s advisers, paid great attention to the protection of the 
interests of our stakeholders, including ensuring that the related 
party transaction aspects of the restructuring (as described in 
more detail on page 134) were fully addressed and approved by 
the shareholders at the Company’s Extraordinary General Meeting 
(‘EGM’) on 14 November 2016.
Corporate governance
The Board believes that the manner in which it conducts its business 
is important and it is committed to delivering the highest standards 
of corporate governance for the benefit of all of its stakeholders. 
Ensuring that the Board works effectively remains a key focus of 
the Company. EnQuest’s Company values underpin a working 
environment where people are safe, creative and passionate, 
with a relentless focus on results.
The following pages provide information on the operation of the 
Board and its Committees. A summary of their work is found on 
page 58 and the individual reports are on pages 60–65 (Audit), 
pages 66–81 (Remuneration), and pages 82–84 (Nomination). 
2016 saw the inception of a new Committee of the Board, the 
Risk Committee. The primary purpose of the Risk Committee is 
to provide a forum for in-depth examination of non-financial risk 
areas (financial risk being within the scope of the Audit Committee). 
Over the course of the year the Committee has reviewed a number 
of areas such as asset integrity, subsurface risks and morale. The 
work of the Risk Committee is further discussed on page 59.
EnQuest’s governance framework also contains several non-Board 
Committees, which provide advice and support to the Chief 
Executive, including an Executive Committee and an Operations 
Committee.
Board composition and succession planning
When Dr Buckee retired from the Board last year I became Chairman 
(following a succession process led by Helmut Langanger as Senior 
Independent Director) and Philip Nolan stepped in to become  
Chairman of the Audit Committee pending the appointment of a new 
Non-Executive Director to become the Audit Committee Chairman 
on a permanent basis. In January 2017 , after a rigorous search process, 
EnQuest was delighted to welcome Carl Hughes to the Board as 
a Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
Carl brings a wealth of experience to the Company, as a former 
vice chairman and senior audit partner at Deloitte with particular 
experience in the energy sector. Neil McCulloch, formerly President,

Review
As part of a planned rotation of the Board, Clare Spottiswoode 
stepped down as a Non-Executive Director during 2016 and I would 
like to thank her for her valuable contribution. In conjunction with an 
external search firm, the process of building on our rotation  
plans continues.
The Board regularly considers how it operates and whether there 
is an appropriate composition and mix around the Board table. 
Rotation of, and succession for, the Directors is kept under review by 
the Nomination Committee, which is also reviewing the succession 
planning processes in place in relation to senior executives.
Board evaluation
The Board held an internal evaluation in 2016, following an externally 
facilitated review in 2015. The Board identified a number of areas for 
consideration and these are summarised on page 58. In addition, 
the Senior Independent Director conducted a review of my 
performance since I became Chairman of the Company and this is 
also found on page 58. 
Corporate responsibility 
The Company’s corporate responsibility is focused on five main 
areas. These are, first and foremost, Health and Safety, People, 
Environment, Business Conduct and Community. The Board 
has approved the Company’s overall approach to corporate 
responsibility and specific developments and updates in each are 
brought to the Board’s attention when appropriate. 
The Board receives regular information on the performance of 
the Company in these areas, and specifically monitors health and 
safety and environmental reporting at each Board meeting. The 
Company’s HSE&A Policy is reviewed by the Board annually and 
all incidents, forward looking indicators and significant HSE&A 
programmes are discussed by the Board. We report on these areas 
specifically on page 36. 
Culture 
This is an area of increased focus given the stresses occasioned 
by the oil price crisis and rapid growth as both Alma/Galia and 
Kraken projects add scale to EnQuest’s business. Furthermore, the 
Company is now working to complete its acquisition of operating 
interests in the Magnus field and the Sullom Voe Terminal, 
transitioning to take over operatorship and absorbing significant 
additional numbers of personnel into the business. It is therefore 
important to foster among the workforce high morale, common 
values and a focus on efficient and ethical achievement. Over the 
past year the Board and its Committees have reviewed progress 
in implementing cultural engagement in a number of areas such 
as safety practices, anti-bribery and risk management. An exercise 
to seek feedback on morale was undertaken and a number of 
measures are being implemented in response to this. The Board 
have also recently approved the updated Company Code of 
Conduct which sets out the behaviours that all staff are expected to 
follow. Furthermore, the Company took considerable care to ensure 
the processes adopted during a rationalisation of the workforce in 
Aberdeen were, and were seen to be, fair and understanding.
Strategy
The Board continued to provide strategic guidance to executive 
management throughout the year, which culminated in EnQuest’s 
annual Board strategy day in October 2016. The focus of the day 
was to address the adjustment of the Company as it focuses on 
consolidating rapid and ongoing growth, and on cash generation 
and debt repayment. The key output of the day was the initiative 
to develop a number of tenets to guide the Company’s strategic 
direction while also enhancing granularity in relation to the 
Company’s risk appetite. Please see page 40 for further details.
It is therefore intended that, in 2017, we will continue to build on our 
governance processes and strategic priorities as the information 
contained on the following pages demonstrates.

Corporate Governance Statement
Statement of compliance
The Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) published a revised UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) in April 2016, which was 
effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 17 June 2016. 
The Company has adopted the Code early and is pleased to report 
that all principles have been complied with in the period under review. 
As a premium listed company, EnQuest is committed to complying 
with the Code and views corporate governance as an essential  
part of its framework, supporting structure, risk management and 
core values.

Leadership
The long term success of the Company is the collective responsibility 
of the Board. 
The role of the Board
The Board is the custodian of the Company’s values, its long term 
vision and provides strategic direction and guidance for the Company 
in order to deliver long term shareholder value. 
The Board is responsible for:
• the Group’s overall strategy;
• review of business plans and trading performance;
• approval of major capital investment projects;
• examination of acquisition opportunities and divestment policies;
• review of significant financial and operational issues;
• review and approval of the Company’s financial statements;
• oversight of control and risk management systems (supported by 
the Audit and Risk Committees); and
• succession planning and appointments (supported by the 
Nomination Committee).
The Board held six scheduled Board meetings in the year ended  
31 December 2016, five of which were held at the Company’s 
registered office in London and one was held offsite in conjunction 
with the strategy day in October. In addition, the Board held a 
number of further Board meetings throughout the year, largely as a 
result of the financial restructuring. In total there were an additional 
24 Board meetings which were largely fully attended. All Directors 
are expected to attend scheduled Board and relevant Committee 
meetings and the Company’s AGM. Details of Board and Committee 
membership and attendance at scheduled meetings can be found on 
page 57.
All Directors are covered by the Company’s Directors’ and Officers’ 
insurance policy.
A clear division of responsibilities 
There is a clear division between the role of the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive; this has been set out in writing and agreed by 
the Board. The Chairman was independent upon his appointment 
to the Board, and the Board continues to consider him to be an 
independent Non-Executive Director. The Chairman is responsible for 
the leadership of the Board, setting the Board agenda and ensuring 
the overall effective working of the Board. The Chief Executive is 
accountable and reports to the Board. His role is to develop strategy 
in consultation with the Board, to execute that strategy following 
presentation to, and consideration and approval by, the Board and to 
oversee the operational management of the business. 
The role of the Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors combine broad business and 
commercial experience from oil and gas and other industry sectors. 
They bring independence, external skills, objective judgement and 
constructively challenge the actions of senior management. This 
is critical for providing assurance that the Executive Directors are 
exercising good judgement in delivery of strategy and decision 
making. The Board considers that all the Non-Executive Directors 
continue to remain independent and free from any relationship 
that could affect or appear to affect their independent judgement. 
Information on the skills and experience of the Non-Executive 
Directors can be found in the Board biographies on pages 50–51.
The Chairman holds one-to-one and group meetings with the Non-
Executive Directors, without the Executive Directors present, at least 
once a year. 
The role of the Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director (‘SID’) is available to shareholders 
if they have concerns where contact through the normal channels of 
the Chairman, the Chief Executive or other Executive Directors has 
failed to resolve an issue or where such contact is inappropriate. In 
his role as the SID, Helmut Langanger conducted the process for the 
appointment for the Chairman (see page 84 for more detail) and runs 
the annual review of the performance of the Chairman. He continues 
to provide a sounding board for the Chairman as well as act as an 
intermediary with other Directors when necessary. 
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board, 
through the Chairman, on all Board procedures and governance 
matters. In addition, each Director has access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary is 
instrumental in facilitating the induction of new Directors and assists 
with the ongoing training and development of the Board.
Effectiveness 
Board composition and changes
There were a number of changes to the composition of the Board 
over the year and the Nomination Committee, as one of its duties, 
regularly reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board. 
At the date of this Report there are seven Directors, consisting of 
two Executive Directors and five Non-Executive Directors (including 
the Chairman). As explained in the Chairman’s statement, Clare 
Spottiswoode stepped down from the Board at the 2016 AGM and 
Dr Buckee stepped down in September 2016. On 1 January 2017 
Carl Hughes was appointed as a Non-Executive Director and it is 
proposed that Neil McCulloch, Chief Operating Officer, be appointed 
as an Executive Director on 25 May 2017 at the 2017 AGM. More 
detail on Board biographies is set out on pages 50–51, while Board 
composition is found on page 55. The work of the Nomination 
Committee, which includes the Board’s activities relating to diversity, 
is found on page 83. STRATEGIC REPORT

Board activities during the year
How the Board operates
During 2016 the Board held six scheduled meetings and a number 
of ad hoc meetings were arranged to deal with matters arising 
between scheduled meetings, in particular in relation to the financial 
restructuring of the Company. Scheduled Board meetings are 
preceded by a day of Committee meetings and a technical review 
which allows for a deep dive on a particular topic of interest, such 
as well performance, project updates and drilling. This pattern of 
meetings is intended to support the Board’s focus on strategic and 
long term matters, while ensuring that it discharges its monitoring and 
oversight role effectively through intensive high quality discussions 
and high quality information flow.
All Board papers are published via an online Board portal system. This 
offers a fast, secure and reliable method of distribution, which helps 
lower the Company’s environmental impact through the reduction of 
printing and lowers costs associated with printing and postage. Board 
agendas are drawn up by the Company Secretary in conjunction with 
the Chairman and with agreement from the Chief Executive. Board 
members also receive a monthly report on performance, irrespective 
of a meeting taking place, which allows them to monitor performance 
regularly; monthly updates on major projects are also provided. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
 58
Board Committees
The Board delegates a number of responsibilities to its Audit 
Committee, Remuneration Committee, Nomination Committee and 
Risk Committee. Membership for each Committee is found on page 
55. The Chairman of each Committee reports formally to the Board on 
its proceedings after each meeting and makes recommendations that 
it deems appropriate to the Board for its consideration and approval. 
There are formal terms of reference for each Committee, approved by 
the Board. The terms of reference for each of these Committees set 
out the scope of authority of the Committee, satisfy the requirements 
of the Code and are reviewed internally on an ongoing basis by 
the Board. Copies of the terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website www.enquest.com.
The Committees are provided with all necessary resources to 
enable them to undertake their duties in an effective manner. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committees, and 
minutes of all Committee meetings are available to all Directors.
In addition to the four Board Committees, EnQuest has several 
non-Board Committees, which assist the Chief Executive in the 
development, implementation and monitoring of strategy. These 
include the Executive Committee, Operations Committee, Investment 
Committee and a quarterly HSE&A Review.
Delegation of authority
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the Group as part 
of the business management system and through an authority matrix 
which sets out, inter alia, delegated authority levels, segregation of 
duties and other control procedures. This was reviewed by the Board 
in March this year and updated.
Board performance evaluation
Each year the Board is required to carry out an evaluation of its own 
effectiveness as required by the Code. Following the externally 
facilitated review of the Board and Committees in 2015, the review 
in 2016 was carried out internally. The Chairman met with each 
Director individually and Directors were also asked to complete a 
questionnaire. 
Key areas of consideration were:
• strategy;
• internal control, risk management and governance;
• administration, support and development;
• membership and proceedings; and
• interaction with shareholders and stakeholders.
The results of the evaluation were discussed at the January 2017 
Board meeting and it was concluded that the Board and Committees 
were well constituted and had demonstrated good performance 
during a challenging year. A number of topics were debated which 
have now been worked into the Board agenda for 2017. The most 
significant of these are:
• continue the succession planning for the Board and extend to 
senior management;
• review strategy in light of the financial restructuring;
• evolve the process for production forecasting; and
• develop further the risk appetite and shape into strategic tenets.
The Board appreciates the extent of access to senior management 
and the technical review process that operates the day before the 
Board meetings.
The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent 
Director, also carried out a performance evaluation of the Chairman 
and concluded that during his first few months as Chairman he had 
performed well, with a balanced view on all issues of importance and 
ensured that there was constructive rapport between the Executive 
Directors and the Board members.
Induction, information and support 
The Directors may consult with the Company Secretary at any time on 
matters related to their role on the Board. 
On joining EnQuest, Non-Executive Directors receive a full 
and tailored induction to the Company. The induction programme 
consists of a comprehensive briefing pack, which includes 
Group structure details, the constitution of the Company, the 
Group governance map, a guide to Directors’ duties, terms of 
reference of each Committee, Group policies and the Company’s 
delegation of authority. In addition to this, each Director receives 
an introduction to the Company’s resource centre (including all 
external communications, such as investor presentations, reports 
and corporate responsibility reports) and a schedule of one-to-one 
meetings with each of the Executive Directors, members of senior 
management and external advisers. Visits to the Aberdeen and 
overseas offices are also arranged as appropriate.
All Non-Executive Directors have access to the Company’s senior 
management between Board meetings and the Board aims to 
hold at least one meeting each year in one of the business units 
to allow Non-Executive Directors to meet and engage with local 
staff. In addition, the continuing development of Board members 
is supported through regular briefings on key business, industry, 
governance and regulatory developments which in 2016 included 
training on the Market Abuse Regulations which were introduced 
in July 2016. Board meetings are also preceded by informal Board 
dinners which provide the Board an opportunity to discuss a broad 
range of issues relevant to the Group amongst themselves and 
with senior management. The Chairman monitors the breadth of 
knowledge, skills and experience of the Board and its Committees 
to ensure that they can fulfil their obligations.
Accountability
Conflicts of interest
The Company has established procedures in place through the 
Articles of Association and the Company’s Code of Conduct which 
identify and, where appropriate, manage, conflicts or potential 
conflicts of interest with the Company’s interests. In accordance with 
the Directors’ interests provisions in the Companies Act 2006, all the 
Directors are required to submit details to the Company Secretary of 
any situations which may give rise to a conflict, or potential conflict, of 
interest. The Board is satisfied that formal procedures are in place to 
ensure that authorisation for potential and actual conflicts of interest 
are operated efficiently and considers the issue of conflicts at the 
start of every Board meeting. In addition, the Directors are required 
to obtain the approval of the Chairman before accepting any further 
appointments.
Anti-bribery and corruption
The Company is committed to behaving fairly and ethically in all of its 
endeavours and has policies which cover anti-bribery and corruption. 
The overall anti-bribery and corruption programme is reviewed 
annually by the Board and a corruption risk awareness email is 
sent out annually by the Chief Executive reminding staff of their 
obligations and also to prompt them to complete an obligatory online 
anti-corruption training course.
The Company also encourages staff to escalate any concerns and,  
to facilitate this, provides an external ‘speak-up’ reporting line which is 
available to all staff in the UK, Malaysia and the UAE. Where concerns 
are raised, these are investigated by the Company’s General Counsel 
and reported to the Audit Committee.

Risk
EnQuest has continued throughout the year to implement and 
develop its comprehensive Risk Management Framework, and 
has conducted a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group; see pages 40–47 of the Strategic Report for further 
information. 
The Company established an additional Committee of the Board, the 
Risk Committee, in January 2016 and its primary responsibility is to  
act as a forum for engaging in thorough analysis of particular material 
risk areas that the Board believes merits analysis and discussion in 
greater depth than is ordinarily practicable within the agendas of 
full Board meetings. For example, during 2016 the Risk Committee 
looked at asset integrity and subsurface risks, the processes which  
the Company has in place to manage such risks and how these may 
be improved.
The Audit Committee remains responsible for the following risk 
management related tasks:
• reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and 
risk management systems;
• reviewing and approving the statements to be included in the 
Annual Report concerning internal controls and risk management; 
and
• monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal audit capability in the context of the Company’s overall 
risk management system.
Remuneration
The work of the Remuneration Committee, which is currently 
comprised of four Non-Executive Directors, is set out in the Annual 
Report on pages 66–81.
Relations with shareholders 
Engagement with shareholders
EnQuest maintained an active and constructive dialogue with its 
shareholders throughout the year through a planned programme 
of investor relations activities. As normal, in 2016 the Chairman and 
the Company’s Senior Independent Director offered to engage with 
institutional investors on corporate governance or indeed any other 
matters and a number of such meetings were held early in the year. 
The Board was then updated on the outcome of those meetings as 
they are routinely updated on investor feedback by the Company’s 
investor relations team, which keeps the Board informed of broker 
and analysts’ views, and presents a paper at each Board meeting. 
Following his appointment in September 2016, EnQuest’s new 
Chairman contacted institutional shareholders to introduce himself 
in his new role; a number of related calls and meetings subsequently 
took place. Engagement with investors was particularly active during 
the successful financial restructuring process.
EnQuest’s investor relations team and Company Secretarial 
department field daily queries from shareholders and analysts  
and there is a section of the website dedicated to shareholders:  
www.enquest.com. EnQuest’s registrars, Capita, also have a team  
of people to answer shareholder queries in relation to technical 
aspects of their holdings, such as shareholding balances. 
All of the Company’s financial results presentations are available on 
the website at www.enquest.com and shareholders can register on 
the website to receive email alerts.
Across 2016 numerous investor and broker sales team and analyst 
meetings were held, including presentations at investor conferences 
and results. Results meetings are followed up by investor roadshows 
with existing and potential new investors. Executive Directors 
and other members of management routinely hold meetings in 
London, Edinburgh and Stockholm, where EnQuest’s investor base 
is concentrated, and from time to time in other financial centres, 
including North America. Meetings are also held at EnQuest’s offices 
in London and Aberdeen and site visits take place at a range of 
EnQuest locations. Investor meetings are organised directly by the 
Company, via brokers and in response to incoming investor requests; 
they take place throughout the year, other than during close periods.
As part of the process of updating its remuneration policy every 
three years and ahead of the 2017 AGM, around the end of 2016, 
EnQuest offered to make available meetings with the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee for discussion of its new remuneration 
policy proposals and again on any governance or other matters; some 
such meetings took place in early 2017.
2016 Annual Report
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements and consider that, taken as a whole, 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements are fair, balanced 
and understandable and provide the necessary information 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s AGM is attended by the Board and senior 
management and is open to all EnQuest shareholders to attend. 
It provides the Board with an important opportunity to meet with 
shareholders. All of the Directors are expected to attend and will  
be available to answer questions from shareholders attending  
the meeting. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Audit Committee Report
“We will remain focused on continuing 
to monitor closely the Group’s financial 
position, liquidity and covenant 
compliance as well as overseeing the 
execution of our risk-based internal 
audit plan.”
Dear Shareholder
It is a great privilege to have been invited to join your Company’s 
Board and to chair the Audit Committee, with effect from 1 January 
2017. I am very aware of the financial and audit challenges and risks 
which the marketplace, the industry and our operations present for 
the Company. This report explains the way in which the Committee 
addressed these challenges and risks during 2016 under the 
chairmanships of Jock Lennox and Philip Nolan, and also looks 
ahead to those matters which I expect that the Committee will need 
to consider in the forthcoming year. 
As explained further on the Company’s website www.enquest.com 
under About us – corporate governance, the Audit Committee’s 
core responsibilities are to:
• review the content and integrity of the annual and interim 
financial statements and advise the Board on whether they are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the necessary 
information for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy; 
• review the appropriateness of the significant accounting policies, 
judgements and estimates;
• monitor and review the effectiveness of the internal control and 
risk management systems;
• monitor and review the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function; 
• oversee the relationship with the external auditor; and 
• monitor and review the process of the assessment of the Group’s 
proven and probable reserves by a recognised Competent 
Person.
Our full terms of reference are available on the Company’s website 
www.enquest.com under investors/shareholder centre.
The Committee’s work in 2016 was focused on the implications 
of the challenging economic and oil price environment for the oil 
and gas industry for the Group and its financial condition and the 
impact thereon of the successful debt restructuring and equity 
raise completed in November 2016. We have taken this into account 
in our review of the going concern assumption and our viability 
assessment. Additionally, through internal audit, we reviewed 
the financial control environment of the Group, to ensure that 
appropriate controls are in place and operating effectively. 
The continued relative weakness of the oil price means that we are 
maintaining our attention on ensuring that certain key judgements 
and estimates made in the financial statements, such as the 
recoverable value of the Group’s assets, are carefully assessed. 
Details of these judgements and estimates, and how we satisfied 
ourselves as to their appropriateness, are set out in detail on the 
following pages, together with further information on how the 
Committee discharged its responsibilities during the year.
With oil price uncertainty expected to continue during 2017, we 
will remain focused on continuing to monitor closely the Group’s 
financial position, liquidity and covenant compliance, as well as 
overseeing the execution of our risk-based internal audit plan. 
I anticipate that time will also be committed to considering 
the accounting implications of Kraken moving from being a 
development to a producing asset, and the implications for the 
development of the Group’s internal control and risk management 
systems, and our approach to internal audit, in the context of the 
Group’s continued growth as a major North Sea operator.

Committee composition
As required by the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’), the Committee is exclusively comprised of Non-Executive Directors, 
biographies of whom are set out on pages 50 and 51. The Board is satisfied that the incoming Chairman of the Committee, previously an energy 
and resources audit partner of Deloitte, a Big Four professional services firm, and a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England 
and Wales, meets the requirement for recent and relevant financial experience.
Membership of the Committee and attendance at the three meetings held during 2016 is provided in the table below:

Notes:
1 Jock Lennox stepped down as Chairman of the Committee on 8 September 2016 when he was appointed Chairman of the Company. He remained a member of the 
Committee until Carl Hughes joined on 1 January 2017.
2 Philip Nolan acted as interim Chairman of the Committee from 8 September 2016 to 31 December 2016. 
Meetings are also normally attended by the General Counsel and Company Secretary, the Chief Financial Officer, the external auditors Ernst & 
Young (‘EY’) and other key finance team members as required. The Chief Executive and Chairman of the Board also attend the meetings when 
invited to do so by the Committee. PricewaterhouseCoopers (‘PwC’), in their role as internal auditors during 2016, attended the meetings as 
appropriate. The Chairman of the Committee regularly meets with the external audit partner (this included focus on going concern and longer

An internal Board effectiveness evaluation was conducted during 2016, and further details on this are outlined in the Corporate Governance 
Report (refer to page 58).

Fair, balanced and understandable
A key requirement of our Annual Report and Accounts is for the report to be fair, balanced and understandable. The Audit Committee and the 
Board are satisfied that the Annual Report and Accounts meet this requirement, as appropriate weight has been given to both positive and 
negative developments in the year.
In justifying this statement, the Audit Committee has considered the robust process which operates in creating the Annual Report and Accounts 
including:
• clear guidance and instruction are provided to all contributors; 
• revisions to regulatory requirements, including the Code, are communicated and monitored; 
• a thorough process of review, evaluation and verification of the content of the Annual Report is undertaken to ensure accuracy and 
consistency; 
• external advisers, including the external auditors, provide advice to management and the Audit Committee on best practice with regard to 
creation of the Annual Report and Accounts; and 
• a meeting of the Audit Committee was held in March 2017 to review and approve the draft 2016 Annual Report and Accounts in advance of 
the final sign-off by the Board. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Financial reporting and significant financial statement reporting issues
The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting is to assess, amongst other things:
• the appropriateness of the accounting policies selected and disclosures made, including whether they comply with International Financial 
Reporting Standards; and
• those judgements, estimates and key assumptions that could have a significant impact on the Group’s financial performance and position, or 
on the remuneration of senior management.
We consider these items together with both management and our external auditors, who both provide reports to the Audit Committee in 
respect of these areas at each Committee meeting. The main areas considered during 2016 are set out below:
Significant financial statement reporting issue Consideration
Going concern and viability
The Group’s assessment of the going concern assumption and 
viability is based on detailed cash flow and covenant forecasts. 
These are, in turn, underpinned by forecasts and assumptions in 
respect of:
• production forecast for the next three years, based on the 
Group’s latest risked production forecast;
• the oil price assumption of $55/bbl (2017), $60/bbl (2018),  
$65/bbl (2019) and $70/bbl (Q1 2020);
• opex and capex forecasts based on the approved 2017 budget 
and plan; and
• other funding activities including certain asset portfolio 
activities.
The Board regularly reviews the liquidity projections of the Group. 
The detailed going concern and longer term viability analysis, 
including sensitivity analysis and stress testing, and explanations and 
justifications for the key assumptions made were presented at the 
March Audit Committee meeting. The external auditors presented 
their findings on the conclusions drawn.
This analysis was considered and challenged, in detail, by the Audit 
Committee, including the appropriateness of the assumptions made. 
The wording in the Annual Report concerning the viability statement 
and going concern assumption (see pages 34–35) was reviewed and 
approved for recommendation to the Board.
Potential misstatement of oil and gas reserves
The Group has total proved and probable reserves at  
31 December 2016 of 215 MMboe. The estimation of these 
reserves is essential to:
• the value of the Company;
• assessment of going concern;
• impairment testing;
• decommissioning liability estimates; and
• calculation of depreciation.
At the March meeting, management presented the Group’s 2P 
reserves, together with the report from Gaffney Cline, our reserves 
auditor.
We considered the scope of the work performed by Gaffney Cline and 
their independence and objectivity.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
Significant capital expenditure is incurred on projects and the  
fair value of these projects is a significant area of judgement.  
At 31 December 2016, a total of $3.0 billion had been capitalised 
in respect of oil and gas and other fixed assets, and $0.2 billion in 
respect of goodwill. The recovery of these amounts is dependent 
upon the expected cash flows of the underlying assets. 
Owing primarily to the recovery in the oil price compared to the 
same time last year, impairment testing has been performed 
resulting in a net impairment reversal of $0.1 billion of tangible oil 
and gas assets. Included within this number are further impairments 
of $0.2 billion and impairment reversals of $0.3 billion.
These impairment tests are underpinned by assumptions regarding:
• 2P reserves (as reported on by Gaffney Cline);
• oil price assumptions (forward curve until 2020 and $70 real 
thereafter);
• life of field opex and capex; and
• a discount rate driven by EnQuest’s weighted average  
cost of capital.
Management presented to the Committee, in the March meeting, the 
key assumptions made in respect of impairment testing, and the result 
thereof. The Committee considered and challenged these assumptions. 
Consideration was also given to EY’s view of the work performed by 
management.

Significant financial statement reporting issue Consideration
Adequacy of the decommissioning provision
The Group’s decommissioning provision of $0.5 billion at  
31 December 2016 is based on a discounted estimate of the future 
costs and timing of decommissioning the Group’s oil and gas assets. 
Judgement exists in respect of the estimation of the costs involved, 
the discount rate assumed, and the timing of decommissioning 
activities.
During 2016 the Group commissioned Wood Group PSN to estimate 
the costs involved in decommissioning each of our operated fields 
and excluding Kraken. These estimates were reviewed by operations 
personnel and adjustments were made where necessary to reflect 
management’s view of the estimates. The estimates in respect of 
decommissioning the Group’s well stock was determined internally 
by appropriately qualified personnel.
The estimate for PM8 was internally developed, and then reviewed 
for reasonableness by a third party.
For Alba, our non-operated asset, the provision is based on 
estimates provided by the operator, adjusted as necessary by our 
own operations personnel, to ensure consistency in key assumptions 
with our other North Sea assets.
For Kraken, the estimates have been extrapolated from the 
estimates for other comparable assets within the Group’s portfolio.
We reviewed the report by management summarising the key findings 
and their impact on the provision. Regard was also given to the 
observations made by EY as to the appropriateness of the estimates 
made.
Tax
At 31 December 2016 the Group carried deferred tax balances 
comprising $1.3 billion of tax assets (primarily related to tax losses)  
and $1.1 billion of tax liabilities.
The recoverability of the tax losses has been assessed by reference 
to the tax projections derived from the Group’s impairment testing. 
Due to the improvements in the underlying profitability of most of 
the Group’s assets, ring fence losses totalling $214 million ($86 million 
tax-effected) were written back following this assessment. Mainstream 
(outside ring fence) tax losses totalling $216 million ($37 million  
tax-effected) were derecognised due to uncertainty of recovery.
Given the complexity of tax legislation, risk exists in respect of some 
of the Group’s tax positions.
We received a report by the Group’s Head of Tax, outlining all uncertain 
tax positions, and evaluated the technical arguments supporting the 
position taken by management. We also took into account the views of 
EY as to the adequacy of our tax balances.
We evaluated the transparency of the Group’s tax exposures, reviewing 
the adequacy and appropriateness of tax disclosures presented by 
management. Regard was also given to the observations made by EY as 
to the appropriateness of the disclosures made. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Internal controls
The Code requires that the Board monitors the Company’s risk 
management and internal control systems and, at least annually, 
carries out and reports on the results of a review of their effectiveness. 
The Board has oversight of risk management within EnQuest, 
and page 40 provides more detail on how the Board, and its Risk 
Committee, have discharged its responsibility in this regard.
Responsibility in respect of internal control is delegated to the Audit 
Committee. Key features of the Group’s internal control framework, 
the effectiveness of which is reviewed continually throughout the year, 
include:
• clear delegations of authority to the Board and its sub-
committees, and to each level of management;
• setting of HSE&A, operational and financial targets and budgets 
which are subsequently monitored by management and the Board;
• a comprehensive risk management process with clear definition 
of risk tolerance and appetite. This includes a review by the Risk 
Committee of the effectiveness of management controls and 
actions which address and mitigate the most significant risks;
• an annual risk-based internal audit programme developed in 
conjunction with management. Findings are communicated to 
the Audit Committee and follow up reviews are conducted where 
necessary; and
• further objective feedback provided by the external auditors and 
other external specialists.
Obtaining assurance on the internal control environment
Since the flotation in 2010, the Group has outsourced its internal 
audit function and following a re-tender process in 2013 PwC were 
appointed to act as our internal auditors. The Committee remains 
satisfied that outsourcing this function, rather than building an in-
house team, remains the most appropriate action for a company of 
this size. We will continue to keep this under review.
The Group’s system of internal control, which is embedded in all 
key operations, provides reasonable rather than absolute assurance 
that the Group’s business objectives will be achieved within the 
risk tolerance levels defined by the Board. Regular management 
reporting, which provides a balanced assessment of key risks and 
controls, is an important component of assurance.
In respect of the work performed by the internal auditors, we set 
the internal audit plan each year. When setting the plan we consider 
recommendations from management, the internal auditors, and have 
consideration of the risks impacting the Company, which are reviewed 
by the Board and Risk Committee. During 2016 internal audit 
undertook various projects, including reviews of:
• the design and operating effectiveness of a selection of the key 
financial controls within the Group;
• the Group’s purchase to pay processes and controls; and
• follow up reviews of the previous year’s reviews of:
 – controls in the trading and marketing function
 – inventory management.
Audit Committee Report continued
In all cases the audit conclusions were that the systems and processes 
were satisfactory or where potential control enhancements were 
identified, the Committee ensured that appropriate action was being 
taken by management to implement any agreed improvements. 
After considering the priorities in 2017, we have directed internal audit 
to focus on, among other areas, readiness for Kraken operations, 
compliance with the Group’s renegotiated revolving credit facility, 
cyber security, and an ongoing rotational review of the financial 
control framework.
External audit
One of the Committee’s key responsibilities is to monitor the 
performance, objectivity and independence of EY, which has been 
the Group’s external auditor since 2010. Each year the Committee 
ensures that the scope of the auditors’ work is sufficient and that 
the auditors are remunerated fairly. The process for reviewing EY’s 
performance involves interviewing, each year, key members of the 
Group who are involved in the audit process to obtain feedback 
on the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of EY’s audit services. 
Additionally, the Committee members take into account their own 
view of EY’s performance when determining whether or not to 
recommend their reappointment. 
The effectiveness of EY was formally evaluated during the 
Committee’s meeting in August, and it was concluded that the 
Committee continues to be satisfied with EY’s performance and the 
firm’s objectivity and independence. 
In its evaluation of EY, the Committee also considered the level 
of non-audit services provided by the firm during the year, the 
compliance with our policy in respect of the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor, and the safeguards in place to ensure 
EY’s continued independence and objectivity. In recommending the 
reappointment of EY for 2017, the Committee recognised the non-
recurring increase in the absolute size of non-audit fees (from $50,000 
in 2015 to $370,000 in 2016). This increase was attributable to the work 
required of EY for the Group’s equity raise prospectus, including 
their working capital review, and reporting accountant’s services. 
These services are typically provided by a company’s auditors, and 
the Committee concluded that shareholder value was best served by 
appointing our auditors for this work. The ratio of non-audit fees to 
audit fees over the last three years is 52%, which remains below the 
70% cap outlined in the Company’s policy in respect of non-audit 
services provided by the auditors. STRATEGIC REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
65
In respect of audit tendering and rotation, the Committee has 
adopted a policy which complies with the EU Audit Regulation 
and Competition and Markets Authority ‘The Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory 
Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities)’ Order 2014. This policy requires an annual 
assessment of whether an audit tender is required on the basis of 
quality or independence, a mandatory tender after ten years, and 
rotation of audit firms at least every 20 years. As noted above, EY 
has been the Group’s auditor since 2010, and the external audit has 
not been tendered in this time. Following the results of our annual 
evaluation of EY, a decision was taken not to tender the 2017 audit. 
While no tender is required until 2020, the Committee will continue  
to evaluate the appropriate time to conduct a tender.
Use of external auditors for non-audit services
The Audit Committee and Board believe that the external auditors’ 
independence and objectivity can potentially be affected by the 
level of non-audit services to EnQuest. However, the Committee 
acknowledges that certain work of a non-audit nature is best 
undertaken by the external auditor. To ensure objectivity and 
independence, and to reflect best practice in this area, the Company’s 
policy on non-audit services now reflects the EU Regulations which 
were introduced during June 2016. As a consequence of this the 
Committee took the decision to discontinue using EY for tax services, 
other than in exceptional circumstances.
As part of the Committee’s process in respect of the provision of 
non-audit services, the external auditors provide the Committee 
with information about their policies and processes for maintaining 
independence and monitoring compliance with current regulatory 
requirements, including those regarding the rotation of audit partners 
and staff. EY have reconfirmed their independence and objectivity.
The key features of the non-audit services policy, the full version of 
which is available on our website, are as follows:
• a pre-defined list of prohibited services has been established;
• a schedule of services where the Group may engage the external 
auditor has been established and agreed by the Committee; 
• any non-audit project work which could impair the objectivity or 
independence of the external auditor may not be awarded to the 
external auditor; and
• fees for permissible non-audit services provided by the external 
auditor for three consecutive years are to be capped at no more 
than 70% of the average Group audit fee for the preceding 
three years. 
Delegated authority by the Audit Committee for the approval of non-
audit services by the external auditor is as follows:
Authoriser
Value of services per non-
audit project
Chief Financial Officer Up to £50,000
Chairman of the Audit Committee Up to £100,000
Audit Committee Above £100,000
Raising concerns at work 
Throughout the year, our whistleblowing procedure, titled the 
‘Speak Up’ reporting line, has continued to be in place across the 
Group. This allows employees and contractors to raise any concerns 
about business practices in confidence through an independently 
appointed third party. Any concerns raised under these arrangements 
or otherwise are investigated promptly by the General Counsel and 
notified to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, with follow-up 
action being taken as soon as practicable thereafter. As noted on 
page 58 of the Corporate Governance Statement, there have been 
a limited number of instances where such issues have been elevated 
and the Committee has been kept appraised of how these have 
been addressed.  EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Dear Fellow Shareholder 
On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present EnQuest’s report 
on its remuneration policy and practice for the financial year ended 
31 December 2016.
This year our report has three main sections:
1. My annual statement as Chairman of the EnQuest Remuneration 
Committee.
2. The policy report which sets out EnQuest’s policy for the 
remuneration of our Executive Directors. The policy report will 
be subject to a binding shareholder vote at the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting (‘AGM’) and, if approved, takes effect from 
25 May 2017.
3. The annual remuneration report of the Executive Directors 
and Non-Executive Directors during 2016. This will be subject 
to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2017 AGM. This section 
also includes the governance and implementation of executive 
remuneration at EnQuest, and key details of the implementation 
of our new policy in 2017.
Our approach to remuneration 
In 2016 EnQuest announced the successful completion of a 
financial restructuring that was designed to deliver a strengthened 
balance sheet, maintain our commercial viability and preserve 
long term shareholder value. We were only able to deliver this 
by having excellent Executive Directors, tirelessly assisted by a 
strong team behind them, who worked closely with supportive and 
understanding shareholders and investors. 
When seen with our continued cost reduction success and a 
simultaneous increase in production of 8.7%, 2016 was our positive 
response to an oil price that remains substantially less than it was 
when we first asked shareholders to approve our 2014 remuneration 
policy. A number of our competitors have not survived this 
challenging period, as our TSR competitor list confirms.
While 2016 was a key year, 2017 will be as well, but for different 
reasons. Our 2017 operational priority is to bring Kraken to first oil in 
Q2, while maintaining sensible downward operating cost pressures 
in line with our model of high efficiency. We aim to continue our 
long term record of year on year production growth and therefore 
generate the cash we need to start reducing our debt and 
deleverage our balance sheet.
2017 is a good time for EnQuest to update its executive 
remuneration policy. We have therefore taken the opportunity to 
move away from a philosophy of lower salaries, higher bonuses and 
average Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) awards that was suited for 
a younger business, driven by high capital investment and rapid 
reserves and production growth. EnQuest needs a longer term 
remuneration approach appropriate for a maturing business that 
continues to retain and attract high calibre people critical to delivery 
against challenging operational and financial targets. 
Shareholder consultation and new 2017 policy 
Our refinancing work in 2016 allowed many shareholders to fully 
appreciate the unique commercial circumstances surrounding 
EnQuest, and this facilitated a good and constructive remuneration 
policy consultation. We were able to get clear and early feedback 
on our proposals so that our 2017 policy now incorporates three key 
changes specifically suggested by our shareholders:
• The implementation of a lower than proposed Executive Director 
salary increase in 2017
• The rebalancing of the overall executive remuneration package 
– from short term bonuses towards longer term PSP awards – will 
now be phased in two rather than a single business year
• The introduction of significantly improved retrospective bonus 
disclosures for Executive Directors.
Executive remuneration – 2017 policy
Our new remuneration policy supports our evolution to a 
commercial model of delivering on execution, continuing to 
streamline costs and strengthening the balance sheet. We therefore 
intend to rebalance and shift overall executive remuneration from 
short to longer term compensation to support delivery against 
these priorities over time.
“EnQuest needs a longer term 
remuneration approach appropriate for 
a maturing business that continues to 
retain and attract high calibre people 
critical to delivery against challenging 
operational and financial targets.” STRATEGIC REPORT

 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

The full details of our new 2017 policy are set out in the later policy 
and report sections. However, while our overall remuneration 
structures and elements remain essentially unchanged, the main 
highlights I wish to draw to your attention are: 
• Annual bonus levels will reduce from 100% (target) and 225% 
(maximum) for business year 2016, to 85% (target) and 175% 
(maximum) in our 2017 business year. This will be followed by a 
further and final reduction to 75% (target) and 125% (maximum) 
for 2018
• Our PSP share maximum will increase from the current 200% 
normal and 300% exceptional levels, to 250% and 350% in 2017
• For bonus awards paid in 2018, based on performance in our 
2017 business year, our deferral policy will be updated so that the 
entire annual bonus award above 100% of salary is deferred into 
EnQuest shares for two years. This creates a cash award cap
• We are introducing a new 200% of salary shareholding 
requirement for Executive Directors, while noting that both of 
them comfortably meet this requirement already
• Our malus and clawback terms in our policy and share plan rules 
will be updated to be appropriate for our market, and will be 
presented to shareholders for approval at our May 2017 AGM
• Debt is an important issue for both EnQuest and our 
shareholders. Following supportive shareholder feedback we 
have decided to proceed with adding a debt metric to our 2017 
annual bonus plan, and we will also update our remuneration 
policy for PSP shares so that future PSP awards can include debt 
as a metric if and when required.
Performance and remuneration outcomes for 2016 
2016 was not just a year of financial restructuring, but one where 
EnQuest continued to deliver. Another year of increased production 
– to 39,751 Boepd – was combined with excellent opex and opex 
per barrel results, which continue to support our low cost operating 
model. We also continued our progress delivering Kraken, laying a 
good foundation for first oil in Q2 2017.
2016 annual bonus – payable in 2017
The Executive Directors’ annual bonus awards are based on a 
combination of financial and operational results and the achievement 
of key objectives. Awards of 74% of base salary (33% of maximum) 
for Amjad Bseisu, and 104% of salary (46% of maximum) for Jonathan 
Swinney have been made in respect of 2016. The Committee feels 
that these levels of awards are appropriate in light of the financial 
restructuring and continued cost containment. Full details of how 
these awards were determined are included in the report. 
2014 Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) vesting
The 2014 PSP award, which had a three year performance period 
ending 31 December 2016, vested at 56.1% of the original award. 
While our production performance condition was completely met 
and our reserves condition was partially met, our TSR condition was 
missed. Full details of the satisfaction of these three performance 
conditions are included in the report. 
Executive Director remuneration in 2017 
2017 base salaries
The salaries of both Executive Directors will be increased by 5%  
in 2017.
We do plan however over the period of this new policy to adjust 
salaries towards median of peer companies in our market to 
continue to retain and attract top people who can deliver superior 
results under ongoing challenging conditions for our industry. 
We will revert later in 2017 to shareholders on this issue.
2017 PSP awards
PSP will form a larger part of an Executive Director’s remuneration as 
we will rebalance reward towards the longer term. The Committee 
wishes to grant 250% of annual salary PSP award in June 2017 to 
both Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney. These 2017 awards  
will include net debt as a key metric for the first time, so will be 
granted when, and if, shareholders support our new policy at our 
May 2017 AGM. 
Outstanding Executive Director deferral awards
EnQuest recently discovered that its systems had failed to vest 
and process a number of past deferred bonus share awards for its 
Executive Directors. These amounts are neither new nor additional 
awards. They are simply the deferred bonus awards that have 
already been fully disclosed in earlier Annual Report and Accounts 
for the four years of 2010 to 2013. However, settlement is long 
overdue to both our Executive Directors, and while EnQuest has 
spent some time correcting its internal systems issues to remedy 
this in the future, this past obligation will be addressed in the next 
few months. 
In 2016 we saw the clear benefits of transparency and a positive and 
close working relationship with major shareholders. We wish this to 
continue, and welcome your counsel, and are always prepared to 
listen and take on board suggestions that help EnQuest to continue 
to mature and develop. 
The Committee and I wish to thank all our shareholders for their 
ongoing support over the years, and I hope you will all support 
the remuneration resolutions this year on our new Directors’ 
remuneration policy and our 2016 implementation report.

GOVERNANCE
General governance
The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended in August 2013. It also describes the 
Group’s compliance with the Code in relation to remuneration. The Committee has taken account of the new requirements for the disclosure of 
Directors’ remuneration and guidelines issued by major shareholder bodies when setting the remuneration strategy for the Company. 
REMUNERATION POLICY
This new remuneration policy is being presented to shareholders for approval at our AGM on 25 May 2017 and, if approved, will take effect from 
that date.
Remuneration principles
In determining the policy during 2016 we reviewed our overall remuneration principles to ensure that they continued to be aligned to our 
strategy. EnQuest’s strategic objective is to achieve sustainable growth by focusing on exploiting its existing reserves, developing and 
commercialising discoveries, converting contingent resources into reserves, and pursuing selective acquisitions.
We also want to ensure that we operate within the appropriate culture and, therefore, the principles support and reinforce the EnQuest values. 
Our principles are clear and simple, to strengthen the link of reward for exceptional performance, as well as to emphasise the importance  
of our values.
In summary, the principles underpinning our remuneration policy are that remuneration for Executive Directors should be:
1. Aligned with shareholders.
2. Fair, reflective of best practice, and market competitive.
3. Comprising fixed pay set at or below the median and variable pay capable of delivering remuneration at upper quartile.
4. Rewarding performance with a balance of short term and long term elements, shifting the emphasis to longer term reward.
Executive Directors
General approach
The remuneration of the Executive Directors comprises base salary, participation in an annual bonus plan (paid partly in cash and partly in deferred 
shares), the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’), private medical insurance, life assurance, personal accident insurance, and cash in lieu of pension.
When setting remuneration for the Executive Directors, the Committee takes into account the performance and experience of the Director, 
as well as the Company performance, employment conditions for other employees in the Company, and the external marketplace. Data is 
obtained from a variety of independent sources.
The following table details EnQuest’s remuneration policy which will become binding from 25 May 2017, subject to approval at the 2017 AGM:

1 To include shares which are beneficially owned (directly or indirectly) by family members of an Executive Director.
Performance measures and targets
Annual bonus
The annual bonus scheme is a weighted scorecard of key performance indicators with a number of categories, under which the performance of 
the Company, and therefore the annual bonus of Executive Directors, is determined. The categories that form the scorecard may include, but 
are not limited to:
• Health, Safety, Environment and Assurance;
• financial (including EBITDA, opex and capex);
• operational performance/production;
• project delivery;
• reserves additions; 
• net debt; and
• objectives linked to key accountabilities.
The measures in each category are selected by the Committee to support the creation of shareholder value. These criteria are also aligned 
with the longer term strategy of the Company and the performance conditions of the Company’s long term incentive scheme. In addition to 
measuring performance against objectives, the Committee will consider the overall quality of the Company’s financial performance, and other 
factors, when determining annual performance pay awards. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued STRATEGIC REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
71
Amjad Bseisu’s bonus objectives are normally based solely on the corporate scorecard of EnQuest. Jonathan Swinney’s bonus objectives 
(and those of any new Executive Directors) may also include up to 50% based on additional objectives that cover their own specific area of key 
accountabilities and responsibilities.
Annual bonus and share deferrals
Executive Directors will normally receive any applicable annual bonus in cash and deferred shares. Any amount up to the equivalent of 100% 
of salary will be distributed in cash around the time of the announcement of full year results, with any amount above the equivalent of 100% of 
salary converted to EnQuest shares (without further performance conditions) and deferred for two years – subject to continued employment. 
In exceptional circumstances these awards may be settled in cash, but only with the pre-approval of the Remuneration Committee.
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
The PSP is typically awarded annually and has a vesting period of three years. Performance conditions are attached to the awards and reflect the 
longer term strategy of EnQuest. For awards granted in 2017 these will comprise:
• TSR relative to a comparator group;
• production growth per share;
• 2P (proven and probable) reserve additions per share; and
• net debt.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
In the event that the Company appoints a new Executive Director either internally or externally, when determining appropriate remuneration 
arrangements, the Committee will take into consideration a number of factors including, but not limited to: quantum relating to prior 
arrangements; the remuneration of other Executive Directors in the Company; appropriate benchmarks in the industry; and the financial 
condition of the Company. This ensures that the arrangements are in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders without 
paying more than is necessary to recruit an executive of the required calibre.
Salaries for new hires (including internal promotions) will be set to reflect their skills and experience, the Company’s intended pay positioning 
and the market rate for the role. If it is considered appropriate to appoint a new Director on a below market salary initially (for example, to allow 
them to gain experience in the role) their salary may be increased to a median market level over a period by way of increases above the general 
rate of wage growth in the Group and inflation.
The ongoing remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the remuneration package offered with the 
terms of the Company’s approved remuneration policy at the time. Different performance measures may be set for the year of joining the Board 
for the annual bonus and PSP , taking into account the individual’s role and responsibilities and the point in the year the executive joined.
Benefits and pensions for new appointees to the Board will normally be provided in line with those offered to other executives and employees 
taking account of local market practice, with relocation expenses/arrangements provided for if necessary. Tax equalisation may also be 
considered if an executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their employment with EnQuest. Legal fees and other relevant costs and 
expenses incurred by the individual may also be paid by the Company.
In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding variable pay awarded in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out according to its 
terms of grant.
The Committee may make additional awards on appointing an Executive Director to ‘buy-out’ remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving 
a previous employer. Any such payments would be based solely on remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and would reflect (as 
far as practicable) the delivery mechanism, time horizons and performance requirement attaching to that remuneration. The Group’s existing 
incentive arrangements including the 2010 Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’) will be used to the extent possible for any buyout (subject to the relevant 
plan limits), although awards may also be granted outside of these schemes, if necessary, and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, the fees will be set taking into account the experience and calibre of the 
individual.
Service contracts
Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney entered into service agreements with the Company which are terminable by either party giving not 
less than 12 months’ written notice. The Company may terminate their employment without giving notice by making a payment equal to the 
aggregate of the Executive Director’s basic salary and the value of any contractual benefits for the notice period including any accrued but 
untaken holiday. Such payments may be paid monthly and/or subject to mitigation.

External directorships
The Company recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive Directors of companies outside the Company 
and exposure to such non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge, which would be of benefit to the Company. Any external 
appointments are subject to Board approval (which would not be given if the proposed appointment required a significant time commitment; 
was with a competing company; would lead to a material conflict of interest; or could otherwise have a detrimental effect on a Director’s 
performance). Executive Directors will be permitted to retain any fees arising from such appointments, details of which will be provided in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Policy on payment for loss of office
The Company’s policy is for all Executive Directors to have contracts of service which can be terminated by either the Director concerned or the 
Company on giving 12 months’ notice of termination. In the event of termination by the Company (other than as a result of a change of control), 
the Executive Directors would be entitled to compensation for loss of basic salary and cash benefit allowance and insured benefits for the notice 
period. Such payments may be made monthly and would be subject to mitigation. The Company may also enable the provision of outplacement 
services to a departing Executive Director, where appropriate.
When Executive Directors leave the Company with good leaver status, and they have an entitlement to unvested shares granted under the DBSP 
and PSP , any performance conditions associated with each award outstanding would remain in place and are normally tested at the end of the 
original performance period. Shares would also normally then vest on their original vesting date in the proportion to the satisfied performance 
conditions and are normally pro-rated for time. Awards held by Executive Directors who are not good leavers would lapse.
Annual bonus would not typically be paid to Executive Directors when leaving the Company. However, in good leaver circumstances the 
Committee has the discretion to pay a pro-rated bonus in cash, in consideration for performance targets achieved in the year. Deferred bonus 
shares held by good leavers will normally vest at the normal vesting date. 
Similar provisions related to the treatment of incentive awards would apply on a change of control, with performance conditions normally tested 
at the date of the change of control and with pro-rating for time, although the Remuneration Committee has discretion to waive pro-rating (but 
not the performance conditions) where it feels this is in the best interests of shareholders.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but their terms are set out in a letter of appointment. Their terms of appointment 
may be terminated by either party giving three months’ notice in writing. During the notice period Non-Executive Directors will continue to 
receive their normal fee.
Remuneration Committee discretion and determinations
The Committee will operate the annual bonus scheme, Deferred Bonus Share Plan, Performance Share Plan, Restricted Share Plan and 
Sharesave Scheme according to their respective rules and in accordance with the Listing Rules and HMRC requirements, where relevant. The 
Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of these 
arrangements. These include, but are not limited to, the following:
• who participates in the plans;
• the timing of grant of award and/or payment;
• the size of an award and/or payment;
• discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction;
• applying ’good leaver’ status in circumstances such as death, ill health and other categories as the Committee determines appropriate and  
in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan;
• discretion to disapply time pro-rating in the event of a change of control or good leaver circumstances;
• discretion to settle any outstanding share awards in cash in exceptional circumstances;
• adjustments or variations required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, change of control, special dividends 
and other major corporate events); and
• the ability to adjust existing performance conditions and performance targets for exceptional events so that they can still fulfil their  
original purpose.
If an event occurs which results in any applicable performance conditions and/or targets being deemed no longer appropriate (e.g. a material 
acquisition or divestment), the Committee will have the ability to adjust appropriately the measures and/or targets and alter weightings, 
provided that the revised conditions or targets are not materially less difficult to satisfy.
If tax liabilities arise from an error or omission by the Company that is outside of the control of the executives, the Committee will have the ability 
to reimburse any such tax liabilities.
Legacy awards
For the avoidance of doubt, authority is given to the Committee to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors 
(such as the payment of a pension or the unwind of legacy share schemes) that have been disclosed to shareholders in this or any previous 
remuneration reports or subsequently agreed in line with the approved policy in force at that time. Details of any payments to former Directors 
will be set out in the Annual Remuneration Report as they arise.

Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors are consistent with the remuneration principles that have been established and are 
similar to those of the other employees of EnQuest. 
The key differences are as follows:
• Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee have their fixed pay set below or at market median for the industry (currently 
around lower quartile for the Executive Directors). Other employees typically have their salaries positioned at market median. Specific groups 
of key technical employees may have their salaries set above median for the industry.
• All employees are offered a non-contributory pension scheme. Executive Directors are given cash in lieu of pension. Non-Executive Directors 
do not participate in pension or benefits arrangements.
• Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the annual bonus scheme. 
• If applicable, Executive Directors have an element of the annual bonus automatically converted to shares and deferred. 
• All other employees may be invited to participate in the Deferred Bonus Share Plan (‘DBSP’) where they can elect to defer a defined 
proportion of their annual bonus and receive a matching amount of shares that vest over the following three years. Executive Directors are 
not eligible to receive matching share awards under this plan.
During the annual remuneration review the Committee receives a report which details the remuneration arrangements of other executive and 
senior management as well as the overall spend versus budget for all employees. This report helps to act as a guide to the Committee as to the 
levels of reward being achieved across the organisation so that they can ensure the Directors’ pay does not fall out of line with the general trends. 
Employees have not previously been directly consulted about the setting of Directors’ pay, although the Committee will take into consideration 
any developments in regulations in operating this policy. 
Statement of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee welcomes and values the opinions of our shareholders with regard to the levels of remuneration for Directors. 
The 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report was voted on at the AGM held in June 2016, where 83.5% of the votes cast were in favour of it. No 
concerns have been raised by shareholders to the Remuneration Committee during 2016.
In early 2017, the Committee consulted with shareholders representing about 46% of the Company’s shares concerning the changes to policy 
set out in the policy report and the increases in Executive Directors’ salaries. Shareholders were broadly supportive of the changes to the policy 
although, as a direct result of their feedback, our proposals were adjusted: it was decided that the bonus proposals should be phased in over 
time – hence the reductions to both the target and maximum bonus levels are now spread over two years; the salary increases in 2017 are lower 
than originally proposed; and EnQuest has committed to improving the quality of our retrospective bonus disclosures. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2016
Terms of reference
The Committee’s terms of reference are available either on our website or by written request from our Company Secretarial team at our London 
headquarters. The remit of the Committee embraces the remuneration strategy and policy for the Executive Directors, senior management, and 
in certain matters, for the whole Company. 
Meetings in 2016
The Committee normally meets at least three times per year. During 2016, it met on five occasions to consider and agree the new remuneration 
policy, to review and discuss base salary adjustments for 2017, the setting of Company performance and related annual bonus for 2016, 
amendments to the annual bonus scheme, and approval of share awards.

employment. 
2 PSP awarded on 22 April 2014 vested on 22 April 2017. The LTIP value shown in the 2016 single figure is calculated by taking the number of performance shares that have 
vested (56.1% of the performance conditions were achieved) multiplied by the average value of the EnQuest share price between 1 October 2016 and 31 December 2016, as 
the share price on 22 April 2017 was not known at the time of this report.
3 PSP awarded on 29 April 2013 vested on 29 April 2016. The LTIP value shown in the 2015 single figure is calculated by taking the number of performance shares that 
have vested (76.6% of the performance conditions were achieved) multiplied by the share price of 40.25 on 29 April 2016.

Annual bonus 2016 – paid in 2017
The Committee’s belief is that any short term annual bonus should be tied both to the overall performance of the Company and the individual’s 
performance. For Amjad Bseisu, the annual bonus for 2016 was wholly based on the Company Performance Contract. For Jonathan Swinney it 
was based on both the Company Performance Contract and an individual performance modifier comprising strategic and functional objectives 
under his individual performance contract.
The annual bonus model used for the Executive Directors is shown below:
Company Individual
Performance level Multiplier Individual performance Multiplier
Target annual bonus Stretch performance 1.2–1.5 Exceed target 1.2–1.5
On target performance 0.8–1.2 On target 0.8–1.2
Below target performance 0.0–0.8 Below target 0.0–0.8
The Committee carefully assessed the achievement of objectives against the Company Performance Contract, and Jonathan Swinney’s 
individual performance contract, to determine the overall level of annual bonus for each Executive Director.

Note that for reasons of commercial sensitivity, full details of the target ranges for the strategic Group financing measures above are not being 
disclosed; however, the Committee has sought to provide shareholders with a thorough understanding of the objectives and performance achieved.
As such, a Company performance marginally below ‘Target’ was achieved by the Company, and an individual performance between ‘Target’ and 
‘Stretch’ by Jonathan Swinney. This resulted in the following 2016 annual bonus levels being achieved:

Pension allowance
Executive Directors do not participate in the EnQuest pension plan and instead receive cash in lieu. During 2016 the level of the cash allowances, 
which had been in place since the Company’s IPO, were reviewed in light of increases in the Directors’ salaries since IPO and market norms. As 
a result of this review they both were increased, from £40,000 in Amjad Bseisu’s case and £30,000 in Jonathan Swinney’s, to £50,000. These are 
equivalent to 11.6% of Amjad Bseisu’s salary and 17.9% of Jonathan Swinney’s salary.

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2017 
Base salary and 2017 pay review
As stated in the annual statement to this report, the remuneration for the Executive Directors is geared towards variable pay, with base salaries 
currently set around the lower quartile benchmark for the oil and gas industry and comparable sized companies. In the view of the Committee it 
is therefore important to ensure that the base salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually and that any increase reflects the change 
in scale and complexity of the role as the Company grows, as well as the performance of the Executive Director.
The table below shows the change to salaries for 2017:
Name Salary for 2016 Salary for 2017 % increase
Amjad Bseisu £430,000 £451,500 5.0%
Jonathan Swinney £280,000 £294,000 5.0%
Salaries for both Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney were increased in 2017 following a consultation with major shareholders and 
representative bodies to reflect the continuing growth and performance of EnQuest and the performance of the executives in the role. The 
increases for both Executive Directors continue to position their base salaries around the lower quartile range of their peers. We do plan over 
the period of this new policy to adjust salaries towards the median of peer companies in our market to continue to retain and attract top people 
who can deliver superior results under ongoing challenging conditions for our industry. We will revert later in 2017 to shareholders on this issue. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Non-Executive Director fees
A summary of our current fees, from 1 January 2017, is as follows:
Chairman £150,000
Director fee £50,000
Senior Independent Director £10,000
Committee Chairman £10,000
These are unchanged from 2016.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus scheme for 2017 is structured as follows:
• Executive Directors (and other executive management) will have threshold, target and stretch performance levels attributed to key 
performance objectives
• Amjad Bseisu’s bonus will be determined solely by the performance of the Company 
• Jonathan Swinney’s bonus will be determined 50% on the performance of the Company and 50% on performance concerning his direct area 
of financial authority
• Each part of the bonus will represent a discrete element which will add together to determine performance
• Maximum levels of award in 2017 for the Executive Directors can be up to 175% of annual base salary applicable in the year of performance, 
and the target level will be 85%
• Stretching targets continue to apply to achieve maximum payout.
The 2017 metrics and weightings, which will determine the level of short term incentive awards for the Directors, are set out below:
Company 2017 performance measures scorecard
Category Weighting
Production 30%
Opex/capex 30%
Net debt 20%
Magnus/SVT integration 20%
Notes:
1 Precise targets are commercially sensitive and are not being disclosed in advance at this time.
2 Performance in Health, Safety, Environment and Assurance is central to EnQuest’s overall results. This category is used as an overlay on overall Company performance.
Performance share awards
2017 PSP awards
After due consideration of business performance in 2016, the continued growth of EnQuest, the performance of the Executive Directors, as well 
as other factors, the Remuneration Committee decided to award grants equal to 250% of salary for Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney. These 
awards will be granted shortly after the May 2017 AGM.
Summary of 2017 PSP performance measures and targets
The PSP share awards granted in 2017 will have four performance metrics, each of which is measured over a three year financial period:
• 30% of the award relates to TSR against a comparator group of oil and gas companies 
• 30% relates to production growth per share (on a compound annual growth, or ‘CAG’, basis)
• 10% relates to reserves growth per share (on a relative growth basis) 
• 30% relates to net debt (on an relative reduction basis)

Outstanding 2010 to 2013 deferral awards
Following an internal review, EnQuest identified an administrative oversight whereby both Executive Directors had a number of deferred bonus 
awards outstanding which were not processed. These deferrals relate to bonuses for the four business years of 2010 to 2013, that were correctly 
disclosed at that time. Amjad Bseisu’s outstanding share awards had a grant value of £600,000 and Jonathan Swinney’s had a grant value of 
£370,000. As a result of an administrative oversight by the Company, vesting of these awards was not processed at the original annual vesting 
dates from 2013 to 2016. EnQuest’s intention is, subject to approval of the new Directors’ remuneration policy at the 2017 AGM, to settle these 
outstanding vested awards in cash rather than in shares as they are well past their original vesting dates and it will assist prompt receipt and  
tax withholding.
Advisers to the Committee
Aon New Bridge Street provided advice to the Remuneration Committee on proposed changes to the policy and were selected by the 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on the basis of previous experience and marketplace reputation.
The Committee satisfied itself that the advice given was objective and independent by reviewing it against other companies in EnQuest’s 
comparator group. New Bridge Street is also a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group (‘RCG’) Code of Conduct which sets out 
guidelines for managing conflicts of interest. New Bridge Street does not provide any other services to the Company. The fees paid to New 
Bridge Street totalled £24,743 (excluding VAT) and were charged on the basis of the number of hours worked.

Nomination Committee Report
“ An area of focus for the Committee  
has been to ensure that the skills  
of the Board reflects the evolution 
of the business of the Company itself.”
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present to you the report of the work of the 
Nomination Committee during 2016.
The core work of the Nomination Committee is to ensure that 
the Board has the appropriate balance of skills, expertise and 
experience in order to support the strategy of the Company.  
We achieve this by continuously reviewing the Board composition 
and skills and ensuring that strong succession planning is in place. 
Currently the Board consists of five Non-Executive Directors and 
two Executive Directors, who collectively bring a diverse mix of skills 
and experience to the Company and collaborate to provide strong 
leadership. 
In 2015 an external Board evaluation was held and recommendations 
which have been implemented by the Committee are highlighted 
below and discussed further on page 58:
• an annual assessment of the performance of each Board member 
supplemented to the review of the performance of the Board as 
a whole will be conducted by the Chairman;
• Board Committee memberships streamlined; and
• structured Board succession planning.
Over the past year there have been a number of changes to the 
composition of the Board and Committees. As explained in my 
letter on pages 54–55, Clare Spottiswoode stepped down from the 
Board at the 2016 AGM and Dr Jim Buckee retired as Chairman in 
September 2016. Helmut Langanger as Senior Independent Director 
led the succession process for the Chairman and an explanation 
of how it was conducted is provided at the end of this Committee 
report. 
In January 2017 the Board was further strengthened by the 
appointment of Carl Hughes, who brings to the Board and Audit 
Committee, of which he is Chairman, considerable financial, 
accounting, audit and governance skills. More detail on his 
recruitment process is found on page 83. Neil McCulloch, previously 
President, North Sea, was appointed Chief Operating Officer in 
January 2017 and will join the Board of Directors as an Executive 
Director following approval by the shareholders at the 2017 AGM.  
A further search is underway for an additional Board member. 
An area of focus for the Committee in relation to Board composition 
has been to ensure that the skills of the Board reflect the evolution 
of the business of the Company itself. For example, Philip Holland 
(who was appointed in 2015) has considerable experience of capital 
projects, which has proved invaluable as the Kraken project has 
progressed and Carl Hughes brings considerable financial acumen 
now the Company is focused on deleveraging its debt. Going 
forward we will continue to follow this approach in our succession 
planning.

and was succeeded by Jock Lennox. 
Main responsibilities
The main responsibilities of the Committee are to: 
• review the size, structure and composition of the Board in order 
to recommend changes to the Board and to ensure the orderly 
succession of Directors;
• formalise succession planning and the process for new Director 
appointments;
• identify, evaluate and recommend candidates for appointment as 
Directors taking into account the balance of knowledge, skills and 
experience required to serve the Board; and
• keep under review the outside directorships and time 
commitments expected from the Non-Executive Directors.
The Nomination Committee’s full terms of reference can be found 
on the Company’s website, www.enquest.com, under Corporate 
Governance.  STRATEGIC REPORT
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Appointment of Directors
We apply a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for 
appointments of new Directors to the Board. For the appointment 
of Carl Hughes and in the search for an additional Director we have 
used Zygos, an external consultancy services firm, which has no 
connection with the Company. The Committee thoroughly reviews 
each candidate in terms of the balance of skills, knowledge and level 
of independence they would bring to the Board. The Committee 
also gives careful consideration to other existing commitments a 
candidate may have and whether they will be able to devote the 
appropriate amount of time in order to fully meet what is expected 
of them. Once the Committee has identified a suitable candidate 
a recommendation is made to the Board for appointment. The 
appointment of the Chairman in 2016 was conducted by the Senior 
Independent Director and this is detailed separately on page 84.
Committee activities during the year
The Nomination Committee met twice in 2016 and its key activities 
included: 
Assessment of the performance of each Board member by 
the Chairman 
In December 2016 we circulated a questionnaire to Board members 
to facilitate feedback on the performance of the Board. In addition 
I spoke with each of the Directors individually in order to ensure that 
each continued to contribute effectively and I remain satisfied that 
this is the case.
Structured Board succession planning
The Committee is focused on succession planning in order to ensure 
that effective planning is being undertaken in regard to the phasing 
of Non-Executive Director retirements. The Company will reach its 
ninth anniversary in 2019 and work is currently underway to ensure 
that planned rotation takes place to ensure that retirements are 
phased and there is continuity of appropriate competencies. The 
Nomination Committee also focused on the succession of senior 
management, to ensure that the Board, and the Chief Executive, 
remain fully supported in the implementation of the Company’s 
strategy. The Board and Nomination Committee remain satisfied that 
the individuals currently fulfilling key senior management positions in 
the Group have the requisite depth and breadth of skills, knowledge 
and experience to ensure that orderly succession to the Board and 
Executive Committee can take place. 
Committee membership streamlined
Another area of focus for the Committee has been to review and 
adjust the membership of the Committees of the Board. This was 
reviewed in January 2016 following the 2015 external evaluation 
and it was further updated following the departures of Clare 
Spottiswoode at the 2016 AGM, Dr Jim Buckee in September and also 
the appointment of Carl Hughes in January 2017. In addition, Philip 
Nolan stepped in to become Chairman of the Audit Committee while 
the search for a new Non-Executive Director to become the Audit 
Committee Chairman was being conducted.
Overboarding
We considered new guidance which recommended that shareholders 
vote against the re-election of Directors if they took on too many 
external non-executive roles. While we believe that the members of 
the Board do have sufficient time to fulfil their duties, the Nomination 
Committee agreed that all Directors would seek the consent of the 
Chairman before accepting an external role and that this would be 
added to all Board appointment letters.
Priorities for the coming year
The main focus of the Committee in 2017 will be to continue to 
manage the succession of the Non-Executive Directors to ensure that 
they continue to be independent and of the highest possible calibre. 
In addition, we shall continue to focus on succession planning of 
the Executive Directors, senior management and also development 
planning for high potential individuals within the Company to ensure 
that the Company’s organisation has both the necessary capacity and 
capabilities in delivering its principal activities. In conjunction with 
Zygos, the process of building on our rotation plans continues.
Boardroom diversity
In reviewing Board composition, the Board’s policy continues to 
be that while we will work hard to ensure that we recruit from a 
diverse background of candidates, not just in relation to gender, 
we will continue to recruit the best candidate available for the 
job on merit and against objective criteria in order to achieve the 
most effective Board possible. We are mindful of both the recent 
Hampton/Alexander and Parker Reviews and are seeking to achieve 
the appropriate balance of the Board as we continue our succession 
planning. We believe that our gender statistics are representative of 
the demographics of the wider oil and gas industry.

Chairman’s succession – a message from the 
Senior Independent Director
On 8 September 2016, Dr Jim Buckee retired as Chairman of the 
Company after serving on the Board for six years.
The process to appoint a successor to Dr Buckee was led by 
myself with the support of the Company Secretary. The Board 
identified that a Chairman with a financial background would be 
required, given the shift in the Company’s strategic priorities, 
and therefore initiated a succession planning exercise. It was 
concluded that an external search was not appropriate given 
the circumstances of the Company, the likely forthcoming 
restructuring and the strong qualifications of internal candidates. 
Following due process, Jock Lennox was selected as the 
appropriate candidate to ensure a seamless transition were Jim 
to step down.
Given Jim’s position as Nomination Committee Chairman, 
the decision was taken to form a sub-committee of the Board 
comprised of Non-Executive Directors to make the final approval 
as to the appointment of the Chairman once Jim’s intention to 
retire had been confirmed. Following unanimous agreement it 
was confirmed that Jock Lennox be appointed Chairman of the 
Company with effect from 8 September 2016.

Re-election to the Board
Following a formal review of the effectiveness of the Board, the 
Nomination Committee confirms that it is satisfied with both the 
performance and the time commitment of each Director throughout 
the year. We remain confident that each of them is in a position to 
discharge their duties to the Company in the coming year and that 
together they continue to bring the necessary skills required to the 
Board. Detailed biographies for each Director, including their skills 
and external appointments, can be found on pages 50–51.
Conflicts of interest
The Board operates a policy to identify and, where appropriate, 
manage conflicts or potential conflicts of interest with the Company’s 
interests. In accordance with the Directors’ interest provisions in the 
Companies Act 2006, all the Directors are required to submit details 
to the Company Secretary of any situations which may give rise to 
a conflict, or potential conflict, of interest. The Board monitors and 
reviews potential conflicts of interest on a regular basis.

Directors’ Report
The Directors of EnQuest 
present their Annual Report 
together with the Group and 
Company audited financial 
statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2016. 
These will be laid before 
shareholders at the AGM  
to be held on Thursday  
25 May 2017 .
Dividends
The Company has not declared or paid any dividends since 
incorporation on 29 January 2010 and does not have any current 
intentions to pay dividends in the near future. Any future payment 
of dividends is expected to depend on the earnings and financial 
condition of the Company meeting the conditions for dividend 
payments which the Company has agreed with its lenders and such 
other factors as the Board of Directors of the Company consider 
appropriate.
Directors
The Directors’ biographical details are set out on pages 50–51. All the 
Directors will offer themselves for election or re-election at the AGM 
on 25 May 2017. All the current Directors served throughout the year, 
except for Carl Hughes who was appointed on 1 January 2017 and 
Neil McCulloch who, subject to shareholder approval, will become 
a Director on 25 May 2017. Both Carl and Neil will therefore seek 
election by shareholders for the first time.
Employee involvement
EnQuest operates a framework for employee information and 
consultation which complies with the requirements of the Information 
and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2005. Employees 
are informed about significant business issues and other matters 
of concern via regular Town Hall meetings, by using webcasts 
on EnQuest’s intranet, as well as face-to-face briefing meetings 
at business locations. Appropriate consultations take place with 
employees when business change is undertaken. EnQuest offers 
employees the opportunity to participate directly in the success 
of the Company and employees are encouraged to invest in the 
Company through participation in a number of share schemes such as 
the Save as You Earn (‘SAYE’) Share Scheme. 63% of staff are currently 
participating in SAYE as at 16 February 2017.

Notes:
1 The increase in the number of shares reflects the acquisition of shares at a ratio 
of four new shares for every nine existing shares by the relevant individual in the 
placing and open offer which took place on 21 November 2016. More information 
on the placing and open offer can be found on page 32.
2 The shares are held by Double A Limited, a discretionary trust in which the 
extended family of Amjad Bseisu has a beneficial interest.
3 Appointed 1 January 2017.
Directors’ indemnity provisions
Under the Company’s Articles, the Directors of the Company may be 
indemnified out of the assets of the Company against certain costs, 
charges, expenses, losses or liabilities which may be sustained or 
incurred in or about the execution of their duties. Such qualifying third 
party indemnity provision remains in force as at the date of approving 
the Directors’ Report and the Company has provided indemnities to 
the Directors in a form consistent with the limitations imposed by law.
Share capital
The Company’s share capital during the year consisted of Ordinary 
shares of £0.05 each (Ordinary shares). Each Ordinary share carries 
one vote. Prior to the November 2016 placing and open offer, which 
is discussed in more detail on page 32, there were 802,660,757 
Ordinary shares in issue. Following the admission to the market of an 
additional 356,738,114 Ordinary shares on 21 November 2016, there 
were 1,159,398,871 Ordinary shares in issue at the end of the year 
(2015: 802,660,757). All of the Company’s issued Ordinary shares have 
been fully paid up. Further information regarding the rights attaching 
to the Company’s Ordinary shares can be found in note 17 to the 
financial statements on page 123. No person has any special rights 
with respect to control of the Company.
The Company did not purchase any of its own shares during 2016 
or up to and including 20 March 2017, being the date of this  
Directors’ Report.
Company share schemes
The trustees of the Group Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘Trust’) did not 
purchase any Ordinary shares in the Company during 2016 except 
for 10,739,486 shares which were acquired through the placing 
and open offer having been funded by a loan by the Company of 
£2,480,000. At year end, the Trust held 2.89% of the issued share 
capital of the Company (2015: 3.33%) for the benefit of employees 
and their dependents. The voting rights in relation to these shares are 
exercised by the trustees. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Annual General Meeting 
The Company’s AGM will be held at Café Royal Hotel, 68 Regent 
Street, London W1B 4DY on 25 May 2017. Formal notice of the AGM, 
including details of special business, is set out in the Notice of AGM 
which accompanies this Annual Report and Accounts and is available 
on the Company’s website at www.enquest.com.
Registrars
In connection with the Ordinary shares traded on the London Stock 
Exchange, the Company’s share registrar is Capita Registrars. For the 
Ordinary shares traded on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm the Company’s 
share registrar is Euroclear Sweden. Full details of both registrars can 
be found in the Company Information section on page 148.
Greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions
EnQuest has reported on all of the emission sources within its 
operational control required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. These sources fall 
within the EnQuest consolidated financial statements. EnQuest has 
used the principles of the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition), ISO 14064-1 and data gathered 
to fulfil the requirements under the ‘Environmental Reporting 
Guidelines: Including Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Reporting Guidance’ June 2013.
The Mandatory Carbon Reporting (‘MCR’) report includes assets 
which are in the operational control of EnQuest. These are:
• Heather Alpha;
• Thistle Alpha;
• Northern Producer Floating Production Facility (‘FPF’);
• Kittiwake;
• Enquest Producer FPF;
• PM8/Seligi & Tanjong Baram (Malaysia);
• drilling rigs under the control of EnQuest for exploration and 
appraisal purposes; and
• all land based offices.
All six greenhouse gases are reported as appropriate.
Note: All assets within operational control are reported for MCR purposes. Due to 
source data uncertainty not being readily available for verification, all Malaysian 
assets (PM8/Seligi, Tanjong Baram assets and associated land based offices) are 
reported outside the scope of ISO 14064-1 verification.
EnQuest has a number of financial interests, e.g. joint ventures and 
joint investments, for which it does not have operational control. 
Hence, the boundary for emissions within EnQuest’s operational 
control is different to the financial boundary. In line with MCR 
guidance this is fully disclosed.
EnQuest has voluntarily opted to have the emissions reported within 
the MCR scope verified to the internationally recognised ISO 14064-1 
standard by a UKAS accredited verification body. This increases the 
robustness of the reported emissions and provides the reader with 
more confidence in the stated figures. This goes beyond the minimum 
requirements of the guidance. As indicated above, Malaysia is not 
included within the ISO 14064-1 verification scope.
Change of control agreements
The Company is not party to any significant agreements which take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company 
following a takeover bid, except in respect of: (a) the renegotiated 
revolving credit facility agreement, which includes provisions that, 
upon a change of control, permit each lender not to provide certain 
funding under that facility and to cancel its exposure to credit which 
may already have been advanced to the Company; (b) the Company’s 
Euro Medium Term Note Programme (under which the Company 
currently has in issue Euro Medium Term Notes due 2022 with an 
aggregate nominal amount of £155 million), pursuant to which if there 
is a change of control of the Company, a holder of a note has the 
option to require the Company to redeem such note at its principal 
amount, together with any accrued interest thereon; and (c) under 
the indenture governing the Company’s $650,000,000 senior notes 
due 2022, if the Company undergoes certain events defined as 
constituting a change of control, each holder of the high-yield notes 
may require us to repurchase all or a portion of its notes at 101% of 
their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

Political donations
At the 2016 AGM a resolution was passed giving the Company 
authority to make political donations and/or incur political 
expenditure as defined in Sections 362 to 379 of the Companies Act 
2006. Although the Company does not make and does not intend 
to make political donations or to incur political expenditure, the 
legislation is very broadly drafted and may catch such activities as 
funding seminars or functions to which politicians are invited, or 
may extend to bodies concerned with policy review, law reform and 
representation of the business community that the Company and its 
subsidiaries might wish to support. 
No political donations were made in 2016 by the Company or any of 
its subsidiaries.
Directors’ statement of disclosure of information to auditor
The Directors in office at the date of the approval of this Directors’ 
Report have each confirmed that, so far as they are aware, there 
is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditor is unaware, 
and each of the Directors has taken all the steps he/she ought to have 
taken as a Director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted 
in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Responsibility statements under the DTR
The Directors who held office at the date of the approval of the 
Directors’ Report confirm that, to the best of their knowledge, the

the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and the Directors’ 
Report, Operating Review and Financial Review include a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
Independent auditor
Having reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the 
auditor, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that 
the existing auditor, Ernst & Young LLP (‘EY’), be reappointed. EY 
has expressed their willingness to continue as auditor. An ordinary 
resolution to reappoint EY as auditor of the Company and authorising 
the Directors to set their remuneration will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM. Information on the Company’s policy on audit 
tendering and rotation is found on page 65.
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 47. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flow, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Financial Review on pages 30 to 35. The Board’s 
assessment of going concern and viability for the Group is set out 
on pages 34 to 35. In addition, note 26 to the financial statements 
on pages 135 to 137 includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; 
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare Group financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law, the Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements 
under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union.
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the Group 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or 
loss of the Group for that period. In preparing the Group financial 
statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that 
the Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the Group’s financial position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that 
the Group financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, 
Directors’ Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the 
Corporate Governance Statement in accordance with Companies Act 
2006 and applicable regulations, including the requirements of the 
Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
Fair, balanced and understandable
In accordance with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors are responsible for establishing arrangements 
to evaluate whether the information presented in the Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy, and making 
a statement to that effect. This statement is set out on page 59 of the 
Annual Report.

Overview of our audit approach
Risks of material 
misstatement
• Going concern
• Estimates of oil and gas reserves
• Impairment of the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets (including goodwill)
• Complexity of the deferred taxation calculation
Audit scope • We performed an audit of the complete financial information of two components: North Sea (full scope) and 
Malaysia (specific scope)
• The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 100% of profit before tax, 
100% of revenue and 100% of total assets
Materiality • Overall Group materiality of $8.9 million which represents 2% of earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and 
amortisation (‘EBITDA’)
Our assessment of risk of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed the 
procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any opinion 
on these individual areas.

 Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Going concern (including the effect of oil 
prices, and bank covenants) (Fraud Risk)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 62); Accounting policies (page 104); 
and note 2 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts (page 104).
With the continued low oil price 
environment and capex requirements, there 
is a heightened awareness around going 
concern, in particular future projections of 
cash flows, oil prices and reserves, and the 
impact of the refinancing.
The risk has increased over the course of 
the current year due to the sustained low oil 
prices through the period and the continued 
capital expenditure on major projects but 
was significantly reduced later in the year 
by the refinancing of the borrowing facilities 
completed in November 2016.
We performed procedures to understand 
management’s going concern review 
process.
Our audit procedures included:
• obtaining and reviewing the directors’ 
assessment, including reviewing and 
challenging the liquidity position, 
mitigating factors and conclusions;
• auditing the covenant calculations 
to ensure they had been calculated 
correctly in accordance with the revolving 
credit facility agreement;
• agreeing the assumed cash flows to the 
business plan and walking through the 
business planning process and testing 
the central assumptions to external data;
• agreeing the available facilities 
and arrangements to underlying 
documentation;
• auditing key assumptions used by 
management including oil price, 
production, foreign exchange and future 
cost (capex and opex) projections;
• assessing and auditing the sensitivities of 
the underlying assumptions used in the 
going concern review and considering 
whether management has exercised any 
bias in selecting such assumptions;
• auditing the assumptions and mitigating 
factors that management have made with 
regards to potential actions to remedy 
potential liquidity shortfalls in future 
periods; and
• comparing future cash flows to historical 
data, ensuring variations are in line with 
our expectations and considering the 
reliability of past forecasts.
In our view management’s conclusion 
that EnQuest PLC is a going concern is 
appropriate.
Management have undertaken a detailed 
analysis and considered an appropriately 
challenging scenario in making this 
conclusion.
We have also concluded that management 
have made appropriate disclosures 
discussing the risks and assumptions 
associated with this conclusion.
Impact of the estimation of the quantity 
of oil and gas reserves on impairment 
testing, depreciation, depletion 
and amortisation, decommissioning 
provisions and the going concern 
assessment (Fraud Risk)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 62); Accounting policies (page 163); 
and note 2 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts (page 103).
The estimation of oil and gas reserves 
requires significant judgement and 
assumptions by management and engineers 
which could be manipulated to achieve 
desired results. These estimates have a 
material impact on the financial statements.
There is technical uncertainty in assessing 
reserve quantities and complex contractual 
arrangements dictating EnQuest’s share 
of reserves, particularly the PSA and RSA 
and joint venture arrangements in place. 
We will focus on management’s estimation 
process including whether bias exists in the 
determination of reserves and resources.
The risk has remained the same compared 
to last year.
Our audit procedures have focused 
on management’s estimation process, 
including whether bias exists in the 
determination of reserves, and the 
role of external specialists in auditing 
management’s estimations.
We carried out procedures to understand 
and walkthrough EnQuest’s internal 
process for oil and gas reserves estimation.
We assessed the competence of internal 
specialists and the competence and 
objectivity of external specialists. We 
also reviewed the report of the external 
specialist on the audit of the reserves for 
the UK North Sea and Malaysia assets as at 
31 December 2016 and held a meeting with 
them to discuss their work and findings.
We considered whether management had 
exercised any bias in assumptions used 
or the outputs produced by the reserves 
estimation exercise, including review of any 
reconciliations between internal and third 
party reserves reports.
We used the results of these procedures 
to inform our audit of asset impairment 
testing, the calculation of depreciation, 
depletion and amortisation, the calculation 
of decommissioning provisions, the 
assessment of going concern and reserve 
disclosures in the Annual Report and 
Accounts.
We have concluded that the estimation of oil 
and gas reserves are in line with appropriate 
methodology and guidelines, and have been 
determined on a reasonable basis through 
the use of competent internal experts and 
objective and competent external experts. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Impairment and impairment reversal of 
the carrying value of tangible ($2,963 
million) and intangible assets (including 
goodwill) ($240 million)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 62); Accounting policies (page 103); 
and note 11 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts (page 120).
The front end of the forward oil price curve 
has increased significantly since the prior 
year, representing a potential trigger for 
impairment reversal. In addition, the low 
oil price environment continues to be a 
potential indicator of impairment, as well 
as the ongoing potential of reduced asset 
performance, which could impact the 
carrying values of the assets.
Accounting standards require management 
to assess whether indicators of impairment 
or impairment reversal exist. Where 
indicators exist management must carry out 
an impairment test.
The risk has remained the same as last year 
given the potential for both impairments 
and impairment reversals.
The principal indicator of impairment was 
the poor performance of the Alma Galia 
and Tanjong Baram assets, while a recovery 
in short-term prices was identified as a 
potential indicator of impairment reversals.
In assessing the appropriateness of 
management’s oil price assumptions, we 
have compared their price assumptions 
with the latest market evidence available, 
including forward curves, brokers’ 
estimates and other long-term price 
forecasts.
We carried out procedures to understand 
and walkthrough EnQuest PLC’s process 
for identifying impairment triggers, reversal 
triggers and considered management’s 
assessment of indicators.
We audited management’s assessment of 
impairment indicators and whether or not a 
formal impairment test was required.
Where a formal impairment test was 
necessary, we audited management’s 
assumptions and sensitivities. This included 
specifically the determination of cash 
generating units, cash flow projections, 
oil prices, production profiles, capital and 
operating expenditure, discount rates and 
sensitivities used. In addition we engaged 
our valuation specialists to assist us in the 
audit of key assumptions.
There are a number of factors which have an 
impact on the impairment charge/reversals. 
The impairment calculations are particularly 
sensitive to both future oil prices and 
discount rates.
In our view the price and discount rate 
assumptions used by management are 
appropriate given current market conditions.
In addition, the future cost assumptions and 
production profiles are appropriate.
Consequently, we believe the impairment 
charges and reversals on both tangible and 
intangible assets are appropriate. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

 Risk Our response to the risk What we concluded to the Audit Committee
Complexity of the deferred taxation 
calculation: deferred tax expense 
$22 million (2015: $593 million credit); 
deferred tax assets $207 million (2015: 
$139 million); and deferred tax liabilities 
$15 million (2015: $59 million)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 63); Accounting policies (page 104); 
and note 7 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts (page 116).
The calculation of the deferred tax balances 
involves significant estimates, including 
phasing of cash flows, future oil prices 
and reserves, which increase the risk of 
incorrectly recording deferred tax.
The risk has remained the same compared 
to last year.
We carried out procedures to understand 
and walkthrough EnQuest PLC’s tax 
accounting process including the approach 
to calculating deferred tax.
We made enquiries of appropriate 
personnel to understand the process 
undertaken to calculate deferred tax 
and any assumptions or changes in the 
approach during the year.
We obtained and audited the deferred tax 
calculation to agree the clerical accuracy, 
ensured that the assumptions used were 
in line with expectations and that the 
calculation and recognition was in line with 
IAS 12 Income taxes.
We performed analytical review 
procedures and understood any significant 
movements that were not consistent with 
our expectations.
We challenged and audited support for 
the recoverability of material deferred tax 
assets.
We considered management’s 
interpretation and application of 
relevant tax law and challenged the 
appropriateness of management’s 
assumptions and estimates in relation 
to deferred taxation and uncertain tax 
positions.
To assist us in assessing a number of 
uncertain tax positions, we engaged our 
tax specialists to advise us on the tax 
technical issues in order to form a view 
of the risk of challenge to certain tax 
treatments adopted.
No issues have been noted in relation to the 
calculation of deferred taxation amounts and 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The scope of our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each 
entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, 
risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such 
as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial statements, of the two reporting components of the Group, we selected both components covering entities 
within the United Kingdom and Malaysia, which represent the principal business units within the Group.
Of the two components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of one component (‘full scope components’) 
which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining component (‘specific scope component’), we performed audit 
procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts 
in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.
The reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2015: 100%) of the Group’s EBITDA, 100% (2015: 
100%) of the Group’s revenue and 100% (2015: 100%) of the Group’s total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 
89% (2015: 91%) of the Group’s EBITDA, 86% (2015: 87%) of the Group’s revenue and 95% (2015: 95%) of the Group’s total assets. The specific 
scope component contributed 11% (2015: 9%) of the Group’s EBITDA, 14% (2015: 13%) of the Group’s Revenue and 5% (2015: 5%) of the Group’s 
total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have 
contributed to the coverage of significant tested for the Group.

Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the 
components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our 
instruction. Of the one full scope component, audit procedures were performed directly by the primary audit team. For the one specific scope 
components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to 
determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
The senior statutory auditor visited Malaysia. This visit involved discussing the audit approach with the component team, meeting with local 
management and attending a planning meeting with local management and the component team. The primary team interacted regularly with 
the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit including discussing any issues arising from their work, reviewing 
key working papers and being responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. This, together with the additional procedures 
performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Independent Auditor’s Report continued
to the Members of EnQuest PLC (Registered Number: 07140891)
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and 
in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be $8.9 million (2015: $9 million), which is 2% (2015: 2%) of EBITDA. We believe that EBITDA provides 
us with the most appropriate basis to use as this is a key performance indicator used by management, it is the main performance measure 
used in the covenant calculations associated with the Group’s debt and is the measure most focussed on by stakeholders. With the impact of 
the continued low oil price environment on the oil and gas industry, profit before tax is becoming more volatile and the focus for stakeholders 
(based on communications to the market) has been increasingly based on more cash based measures as pressure grows on companies in the 
lower oil price environment.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 50% (2015: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely $4.45 million (2015: $4.5 million).
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken 
based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and 
risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range 
of performance materiality allocated to components was $4.0 million to $1.34 million (2015: $4 million to $0.9 million).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We collated errors in excess of $0.4 million (2015: $0.5 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, and we agreed with the Audit 
Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $0.75 million (2015: $0.75 million), as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant 
qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts 2016 to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 90, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and explain how they 
are being managed or mitigated;
•  the Directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered 
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, 
and their identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue 
to do so over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements; and
•  the Directors’ explanation in the annual report as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the entity, over what period they have done so and why they consider 
that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a

Notes to the Group Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2016
1. Corporate information
EnQuest PLC (‘EnQuest’ or the ‘Company’) is a limited liability Company registered in England and is listed on the London Stock Exchange and 
Stockholm NASDAQ OMX market. 
The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’) are the exploration for, and extraction and production of, 
hydrocarbons in the UK Continental Shelf and Malaysia.
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of 
Directors on 20 March 2017.
A listing of the Group companies is contained in note 28 to these Group financial statements.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
Basis of preparation
The Group financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2016 and applied in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2016.
The Group financial information has been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for the fair value remeasurement of certain financial 
instruments, including derivatives, as set out in the accounting policies below. The presentation currency of the Group financial information 
is the US Dollar and all values in the Group financial information are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$’000) except where otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Further information relating to the use of the going concern 
assumption is provided in the ‘Going Concern’ section of the Financial Review as set out on pages 34 and 35.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the sole right to exercise control over the operations and govern the financial policies 
generally accompanying a shareholding of more than half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing the Group’s control. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on 
which control is transferred to the Group and are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Intercompany profits, transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Joint arrangements
Oil and gas operations are usually conducted by the Group as co-licensees in unincorporated joint operations with other companies. The Group’s 
financial statements reflect the relevant proportions of production, capital costs, operating costs and current assets and liabilities of the joint 
operation applicable to the Group’s interests. The Group’s current interests in joint operations are detailed on page 18. 
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the 
consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business 
combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Those petroleum reserves and resources that are able to be reliably valued are recognised in the assessment of fair 
values on acquisition. Other potential reserves, resources and rights, for which fair values cannot be reliably determined, are not recognised.
If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly 
identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised 
at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration 
transferred, the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration 
classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, 
is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised either in profit or loss, or as a change to other comprehensive income (‘OCI’).  
If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured at fair value in accordance with the appropriate IFRS. Contingent 
consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
New standards and interpretations
The Group has adopted new and revised IFRSs that are relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2016. The principal effects of the adoption of these new and amended standards and interpretations are discussed below:
Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements for Acquisition of Interests
The amendments to IFRS 11 require the acquirer of an interest in a joint operation in which the activity constitutes a business, as defined in 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations, to apply the principles for business combinations accounting in IFRS 3. In addition, the acquirer shall disclose 
the information required by IFRS 3 for business combinations. The amendments clarify that a previously held interest in a joint operation is not 
remeasured when an additional interest in the same joint operation is acquired, as long as joint control is retained. 
The amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest in a joint operation and the acquisition of any additional interests in the 
same joint operation and are applied prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. In August 2016, the Group acquired 
an additional interest in the West Don field. The Group considers that the activity of this joint arrangement constitutes a business and therefore 
has accounted for the acquisition of this additional interest in accordance with the business combinations principles of IFRS 3 (see note 29). 
Otherwise, these amendments did not have any material impact on the Group. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
103
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are generated from 
operating a business (of which the asset is a part) rather than the economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset. As a result, 
a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate property, plant and equipment and may only be used in very limited circumstances 
to amortise intangible assets. The amendments did not have any material impact on the Group given that the Group does not use a 
revenue-based method to depreciate its non-current assets.
Annual Improvements 2012–2014 Cycle
The improvements were adopted with effect from 1 January 2016 and did not have any material impact on the Group. 
Standards issued but not yet effective
Standards issued and relevant to the Group, but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements, are listed below. 
This listing is of standards and interpretations issued, which the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. The Group intends 
to adopt these standards when they become effective. The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have a material 
impact on the Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which reflects all phases of the financial instruments project 
and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new 
requirements for classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. Retrospective application is required, but comparative information is not compulsory. 
The adoption of IFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial assets, but will not have an impact on 
classification and measurement of financial liabilities. 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and establishes a five-step model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15 
revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods 
or services to a customer. The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measuring and recognising revenue.
The new revenue standard is applicable to all entities and will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. Either a full or 
modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Group is 
currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date.
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 Leases, issued in January 2016, sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both 
parties to a contract. It replaces the previous leases standard IAS 17 Leases and is effective from 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases, as is required under IAS 17 and, instead, introduces a 
single lease accounting model. The Group will assess the impact of IFRS 16 and plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The management of the Group has to make estimates and judgements when preparing the financial statements of the Group. Uncertainties in 
the estimates and judgements could have an impact on the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the Group’s result. The most important 
estimates and judgements in relation thereto are:
Estimates in oil and gas reserves
The business of the Group is the exploration, development and production of oil and gas assets. Estimates of oil and gas reserves are used in 
the calculations for impairment tests and accounting for depletion and decommissioning. Changes in estimates of oil and gas reserves resulting 
in different future production profiles will affect the discounted cash flows used in impairment testing, the anticipated date of decommissioning 
and the depletion charges in accordance with the unit-of-production method.
Estimates in impairment of oil and gas assets, goodwill and the estimate of the cost recovery provision
Determination of whether oil and gas assets or goodwill have suffered any impairment requires an estimation of the fair value less costs to 
dispose of the cash-generating units (‘CGU’) to which oil and gas assets and goodwill have been allocated. The calculation requires the entity 
to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU using discounted cash flow models comprising asset-by-asset life of field 
projections using Level 3 inputs (based on IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy). Key assumptions and estimates in the impairment models relate to: 
commodity prices that are based on forward curve prices for the first three years and thereafter at US$70 per barrel inflated at 2% per annum 
from 2020; discount rates derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 10% (2015: 8.5%); commercial reserves and the 
related cost profiles. As the production and related cash flows can be estimated from EnQuest’s experience, management believes that the 
estimated cash flows expected to be generated over the life of each field is the appropriate basis upon which to assess goodwill and individual 
assets for impairment.
These same models and assumptions are used in the calculation of the cost recovery provision (refer note 22). 
Determining the fair value of property, plant and equipment on business combinations
The Group determines the fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired in a business combination based on the discounted cash flows 
at the time of acquisition, from the proven and probable reserves. In assessing the discounted cash flows, the estimated future cash flows 
attributable to the asset are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects the market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset at the time of the acquisition. In calculating the asset fair value the Group will apply the forward curve 
followed by an oil price assumption representing management’s view of the long term oil price. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2016
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Decommissioning provision 
Amounts used in recording a provision for decommissioning are estimates based on current legal and constructive requirements and current 
technology and price levels for the removal of facilities and plugging and abandoning of wells. Due to changes in relation to these items, the 
future actual cash outflows in relation to decommissioning are likely to differ in practice. To reflect the effects due to changes in legislation, 
requirements and technology and price levels, the carrying amounts of decommissioning provisions are reviewed on a regular basis. 
The effects of changes in estimates do not give rise to prior year adjustments and are dealt with prospectively. While the Group uses its best 
estimates and judgement, actual results could differ from these estimates.
In estimating decommissioning provisions, the Group applies an annual inflation rate of 2% (2015: 2%) and an annual discount rate of 2.3% 
(2015: 3%).
Debt restructuring
EnQuest has assessed that Group’s debt restructuring, effective 21 November 2016, has resulted in a substantial modification of the terms 
of its revolving credit facility (refer note 20). Accordingly, extinguishment accounting has been applied, resulting in the derecognition of the 
carrying value of the facility, including any unamortised arrangement fees, and the recognition of a new financial liability for the revised facility 
at fair value. Costs associated with the renegotiation of the facility have been expensed to the income statement as exceptional finance costs 
(refer note 4).
Going concern
The Directors’ assessment of going concern concludes that the use of the going concern basis is appropriate and that there are no material 
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. 
The going concern assumption is highly sensitive to economic conditions. The Group closely monitors and manages its funding position and 
liquidity risk throughout the year including monitoring forecast covenant results to ensure it has access to sufficient funds to meet forecast cash 
requirements. Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities considered for, but not limited to, changes in crude oil prices (adjusted for 
hedging undertaken by the Group), production rates and development project timing and costs. These forecasts and sensitivity analyses allow 
management to mitigate any liquidity or covenant compliance risks in a timely manner. See pages 34 and 35 in the Financial Review for further 
details.
Taxation
The Group’s operations are subject to a number of specific tax rules which apply to exploration and production. In addition, the tax provision is 
prepared before the relevant companies have filed their tax returns with the relevant tax authorities and, significantly, before these have been 
agreed. As a result of these factors, the tax provision process necessarily involves the use of a number of estimates and judgements including 
those required in calculating the effective tax rate. In considering the tax on exceptional items, the Group applies the appropriate statutory tax 
rate to each item to calculate the relevant tax charge on exceptional items.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets on unused tax losses where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available for utilisation. 
This requires management to make judgements and assumptions regarding the amount of deferred tax that can be recognised, as well as the 
likelihood of future taxable profits. 
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (functional currency). The Group financial statements are presented in US dollars (US$), the currency which the 
Group has elected to use as its presentation currency.
In the accounts of the Company and its individual subsidiaries, transactions in currencies other than a company’s functional currency are 
recorded at the prevailing rate of exchange on the date of the transaction. At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that 
are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the rate of exchange as at the dates of the initial transactions. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the rate of exchange at the date the fair 
value was determined. All foreign exchange gains and losses are taken to profit and loss in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Cost comprises the purchase 
price or construction cost and any costs directly attributable to making that asset capable of operating as intended. The purchase price or 
construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. 
Oil and gas assets are depleted, on a field-by-field basis, using the unit-of-production method based on entitlement to proven and probable 
reserves, taking account of estimated future development expenditure relating to those reserves. 
Depreciation on other elements of property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis at the following rates:
Office furniture and equipment  20%
Fixtures and fittings   10%
Long leasehold land   period of lease
Each asset’s estimated useful life, residual value and method of depreciation are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each financial year end.
No depreciation is charged on assets under construction.  STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Oil and gas assets
Exploration and appraisal assets
The Group adopts the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation costs. Pre-licence costs are expensed in the 
period in which they are incurred. Expenditure directly associated with exploration, evaluation or appraisal activities is initially capitalised as an 
intangible asset. Such costs include the costs of acquiring an interest, appraisal well drilling costs, payments to contractors and an appropriate 
share of directly attributable overheads incurred during the evaluation phase. For such appraisal activity, which may require drilling of further 
wells, costs continue to be carried as an asset whilst related hydrocarbons are considered capable of commercial development. Such costs 
are subject to technical, commercial and management review to confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value. When 
this is no longer the case, the costs are written off as exploration and evaluation expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. When 
exploration licences are relinquished without further development, any previous impairment loss is reversed and the carrying costs are written 
off through the statement of comprehensive income. When assets are declared part of a commercial development, related costs are transferred 
to property, plant and equipment. All intangible oil and gas assets are assessed for any impairment prior to transfer and any impairment loss is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Development assets
Expenditure relating to development of assets including the construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities such as 
platforms, pipelines and development wells, is capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
Farm-outs – in the exploration and evaluation phase
The Group does not record any expenditure made by the farmee on its account. It also does not recognise any gain or loss on its exploration 
and evaluation farm-out arrangements but redesignates any costs previously capitalised in relation to the whole interest as relating to the partial 
interest retained. Any cash consideration received directly from the farmee is credited against costs previously capitalised in relation to the 
whole interest with any excess accounted for by the farmor as a gain on disposal.
Farm-outs – outside the exploration and evaluation phase
In accounting for a farm-out arrangement outside the exploration and evaluation phase, the Group:
• derecognises the proportion of the asset that it has sold to the farmee;
• recognises the consideration received or receivable from the farmee, which represents the cash received and/or the farmee’s obligation to 
fund the capital expenditure in relation to the interest retained by the farmor and/or any deferred consideration;
• recognises a gain or loss on the transaction for the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
disposed of. A gain is only recognised when the value of the consideration can be determined reliably. If not, then the Group accounts for the 
consideration received as a reduction in the carrying amount of the underlying assets; and
• tests the retained interests for impairment if the terms of the arrangement indicate that the retained interest may be impaired.
The consideration receivable on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment or an intangible asset is recognised initially at its fair value 
by the Group. However, if payment for the item is deferred, the consideration received is recognised initially at the cash price equivalent. The 
difference between the nominal amount of the consideration and the cash price equivalent is recognised as interest revenue. Any part of the 
consideration that is receivable in the form of cash is treated as a financial asset and is accounted for at amortised cost.
Carry arrangements
Where amounts are paid on behalf of a carried party these are capitalised. Where there is an obligation to make payments on behalf of a 
carried party and the timing and amount are uncertain, a provision is recognised. Where the payment is a fixed monetary amount, a financial 
liability is recognised.
Changes in unit-of-production factors
Changes in factors which affect unit-of-production calculations are dealt with prospectively, not by immediate adjustment of prior years’ 
amounts.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time 
to prepare for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended 
use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as interest payable in the statement of comprehensive income in accordance with the effective 
interest method.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets (excluding goodwill)
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its oil and gas assets to assess whether there is an indication that those 
assets may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
attributable to the asset are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but only so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of 
comprehensive income. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2016
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Goodwill
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the 
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, 
goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may be impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired is allocated to the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. Each unit or units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill 
is monitored for internal management purposes.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. Where the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit and related goodwill, an 
impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. 
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present 
condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year 
from the date of classification.
Financial assets
Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-
maturity investments, available-for-sale financial investments, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as 
appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
All assets are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs, except in the case of financial assets recorded at fair value through profit 
or loss.
Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a timeframe established by regulation or convention in the 
marketplace (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date.
The Group’s financial assets include cash and short term deposits, trade and other receivables, loans and other receivables, quoted and 
unquoted financial instruments and derivative financial instruments.
Subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described below:
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’)
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL when the financial asset is either held for trading or designated as at FVTPL. Financial assets are 
classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives are also classified as held 
for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39. 
Financial assets at FVTPL, including commodity and foreign exchange derivatives, are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on 
remeasurement recognised immediately in the income statement.
Financial assets designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL are designated at their initial recognition date and only if the criteria under IAS 39 
are satisfied.
Available-for-sale financial investments
Listed and unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair 
value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the available-for-
sale reserve with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is disposed of or is 
determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the available-for-sale reserve is reclassified to profit or loss. 
Loans and receivables 
These include trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the 
effective interest rate, except for short term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. A financial asset is 
deemed to be impaired where there is objective evidence of impairment that, as a result of one or more events that have occurred after the 
initial recognition of the asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below 
its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment. When an available-for-sale financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative 
gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period. In respect of equity 
securities, impairment losses previously recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss but through other comprehensive 
income. Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
107
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount is reduced 
through use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair 
value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
The Group categorises derivatives as follows:
Fair value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in the profit or loss, together with any changes 
in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability. 
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit or loss. Amounts accumulated in other comprehensive 
income are transferred to the profit or loss in the period when the hedged item will affect the profit or loss. When the hedged item no longer 
meets the requirements for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, any accumulated gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is 
transferred to profit and loss when the forecast transaction which was the subject of the hedge occurs.
Where put options are used as hedging instruments, only the intrinsic value of the option is designated as the hedge, with the change in time 
value recorded in finance costs within the income statement.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
When derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the profit or loss within 
‘Remeasurements and exceptional items’ profit or loss on the face of the income statement. When a derivative reaches maturity, the realised 
gain or loss is included within the Group’s business performance results with a corresponding reclassification from ‘Remeasurements and 
exceptional items’.
Option premium
Option premium received or paid for commodity derivatives are amortised into business performance revenue over the period between the 
inception of the option, and that options expiry date. This results in a corresponding reclassification from ‘Remeasurements and exceptional 
items’ revenue.
As noted above, where put options are designated as an effective hedge, the change in time value is recorded in finance costs. As the cost 
of a put option represents the initial time value of that option, option premium paid for put options which have been designated as effective 
hedges are amortised in business performance finance costs, with an offsetting reclassification from ‘Remeasurements and exceptional items’ 
finance costs.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment. 
Inventories
Inventories of consumable well supplies are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, cost being determined on an average cost basis. 
Inventories of hydrocarbons are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Under/over-lift 
Under or over-lifted positions of hydrocarbons are valued at market prices prevailing at the balance sheet date. An under-lift of production from 
a field is included in current receivables and valued at the reporting date spot price or prevailing contract price and an over-lift of production 
from a field is included in current liabilities and valued at the reporting date spot price or prevailing contract price.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, cash in hand, outstanding bank overdrafts and highly liquid interest bearing securities with 
original maturities of three months or less. 
Equity
Share capital
The balance classified as equity share capital includes the total net proceeds (both nominal value and share premium) on issue of registered 
share capital of the parent Company. Share issue costs associated with the issuance of new equity are treated as a direct reduction of proceeds. 
Merger reserve
Merger reserve represents the difference between the market value of shares issued to effect business combinations less the nominal value of 
shares issued. The merger reserve in the Group financial statements also includes the consolidation adjustments that arise under the application 
of the pooling of interest method.
Cash flow hedge reserve
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly as other comprehensive income 
in the cash flow hedge reserve. Upon settlement of the hedged item, the change in fair value is transferred to profit or loss.
Available-for-sale reserve
Gains and losses (with the exception of impairment losses) arising from changes in available-for-sale financial investments are recognised in the 
available-for-sale reserve until such time that the investment is disposed of, where it is reclassified to profit or loss. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2016
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Share-based payments reserve
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured at the fair value of the services received, and the corresponding increase in 
equity is recorded directly at the fair value of the services received. The share-based payments reserve includes treasury shares.
Retained earnings
Retained earnings contain the accumulated results attributable to the shareholders of the parent Company. 
Employee Benefit Trust
EnQuest PLC shares held by the Group are deducted from the share-based payments reserve and are recognised at cost. Consideration 
received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and the original cost 
being taken to reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of 
equity shares.
Provisions 
Decommissioning
Provision for future decommissioning costs is made in full when the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of 
plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reasonable estimate of that liability can be made. The amount recognised is 
the present value of the estimated future expenditure. An amount equivalent to the discounted initial provision for decommissioning costs is 
capitalised and amortised over the life of the underlying asset on a unit-of-production basis over proven and probable reserves. Any change in 
the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the oil and gas asset. 
The unwinding of the discount applied to future decommissioning provisions is included under finance costs in the statement of comprehensive 
income.
Other
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow 
of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset) is derecognised where:
• the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
• the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a 
third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; or
• the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either (a) has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards 
of the asset, or (b) has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of 
the asset.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
If an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender, on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new 
liability such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss. 
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement regards the terms of exchanged or modified debt as ‘substantially different’ if 
the net present value of the cash flows under the new terms (including any fees paid net of fees received) discounted at the original effective 
interest rate is at least 10% different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original debt instrument. The Group 
also considers qualitative factors in assessing whether a modified financial liability is ‘substantially different’ and where the modification is so 
fundamental, it accounts for this as an extinguishment of the original liability even though a quantitative analysis may indicate a less than 10% 
cash flow change.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are amortised 
over the life of the facility.
Borrowing costs are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial liability where appropriate. 
Bonds
Bonds are measured on an amortised cost basis.
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date. The 
arrangement is assessed for whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement 
conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.
Finance leases that transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item to the Group, are capitalised at 
the commencement of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease 
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in the income statement. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
109
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership 
by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an operating expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Revenue and other operating income
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Oil and gas revenues comprise the Group’s share of sales from the processing or sale of hydrocarbons on an entitlement basis, when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been passed to the buyer.
Tariff revenue is recognised in the period in which the services are provided at the agreed contract rates.
Rental income is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the income statement.
The Group uses various commodity derivative instruments to manage some of the risks arising from fluctuations in commodity prices. Such 
contracts include options, swaps and futures. Where these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges of underlying commodity 
price exposures, certain gains and losses attributable to these instruments are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognised in the 
income statement within revenue and other operating income when the underlying hedged transaction crystallises or is no longer expected to 
occur. All other commodity derivatives within the scope of IAS 39 are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income 
statement within revenue and other operating income. The gain or loss from commodity derivatives accounted for at fair value through profit or 
loss are included within business performance when the derivative reaches maturity and the gain or loss is realised. 
Remeasurements and exceptional items 
As permitted by IAS 1 (Revised): Presentation of Financial Statements, certain items are presented separately. The items that the Group 
separately presents as exceptional on the face of the statement of comprehensive income are those material items of income and expense 
which because of the nature or expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to 
understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends 
in financial performance.
The following items are routinely classified as Remeasurements and exceptional items (‘exceptional’):
• Unrealised mark to market changes in the remeasurement of derivative contracts are included in exceptional profit or loss. This includes the 
recycling of realised amounts from exceptional items into Business Performance income when a derivative instrument matures, together with 
the recycling of option premium amortisation from exceptional to business performance as set out in the Derivatives policy above.
• Impairments and write-offs are deemed to be exceptional in nature. This includes impairments of tangible and intangible assets, and write 
offs of unsuccessful exploration. Other non-routine write offs/write downs, where deemed material, are also included in this category.
• The depletion of a fair value uplift to property, plant and equipment that arose from the merger accounting applied at the time of 
EnQuest’s formation.
Employee benefits
Short term employee benefits
Short term employee benefits such as salaries, social premiums and holiday pay, are expensed when incurred. 
Pension obligations
The Group’s pension obligations consist of defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group 
pays fixed contributions. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The amount charged to 
the statement of comprehensive income in respect of pension costs reflects the contributions payable in the year. Differences between 
contributions payable during the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accrued liabilities or prepaid assets in the 
balance sheet.
Share-based payment transactions
Eligible employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions) of EnQuest PLC.
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. In 
valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service or performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the 
shares of EnQuest PLC (market conditions) or ‘non-vesting’ conditions, if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over the period in which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the 
vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the 
extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. 
The statement of comprehensive income charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the 
beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied. Equity awards cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date of cancellation, and any expense 
not recognised for the award at that date is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Taxes
Income taxes
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax 
rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
Group financial statements. However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is 
measured on an undiscounted basis using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and 
are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able 
to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
offset only if a legal right exists to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation 
authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.
Production taxes
In addition to corporate income taxes, the Group’s financial statements also include and disclose production taxes on net income determined 
from oil and gas production. 
Production tax relates to Petroleum Revenue Tax (‘PRT’) and is accounted for under IAS 12 Income Taxes since it has the characteristics of an 
income tax as it is imposed under Government authority and the amount payable is based on taxable profits of the relevant fields. Current and 
deferred PRT is provided on the same basis as described above for income taxes. 
Investment allowances
The UK taxation regime provides for a reduction in ring fence supplementary corporation tax where investments in new or existing UK assets 
qualify for a relief known as investment allowances. Investment allowances are only triggered when production from the field commences.  
The Group is eligible for a number of investment allowances which will materially reduce the level of future supplementary corporation taxation. 
Investment allowances are recognised as a reduction in the charge to taxation in the years claimed. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

3. Segment information 
Management have considered the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, in regard to the determination of operating segments and 
concluded that the Group has two significant operating segments, being the exploration for, extraction and production of hydrocarbons in 
the North Sea and Malaysia. Operations are located and managed by location, therefore all information is being presented for geographical 
segments. The information reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker does not include an analysis of assets and liabilities and accordingly 
this information is not presented.

(i) Fair value remeasurements include unrealised mark to market movements on derivative contracts and other financial instruments, where the Group does not classify them 
as effective hedges. It also includes the impact of recycling realised gains and losses (including option premia) out of ‘Remeasurements and exceptional items’ and into 
‘Business performance’ profit or loss. Refer to note 2 for further details on the Group’s accounting policies for derivatives, and remeasurements and exceptional items
(ii) Impairments and write-offs include a net impairment reversal on tangible oil and gas assets totalling US$147.9 million (2015: impairment of US$1,225 million), together with a 
US$0.05 million reversal of impairments on the investment in Ascent Resources (2015: US$0.6 million impairment) and a US$0.8 million impairment/write off of unsuccessful 
exploration costs (2015: US$9.1 million impairment/write off). Further details on the tangible impairment are provided in notes 10 and 11.
(iii) The Group’s restructuring was deemed to result in a substantial modification of the terms of the Group’s credit facility (see note 19). In accordance with IAS 39, the Group 
has accounted for this substantial modification as an extinguishment of the liability for the original credit facility and the recognition of a new liability for the revised credit 
facility. This has resulted in US$15.0 million of unamortised costs associated with the previous credit facility being expensed on extinguishment. The costs of negotiating 
the modifications to the credit facility, totalling US$11.1 million, were expensed. In addition, a US$12.0 million restructuring fee, payable to the credit facility lenders by 
March 2018, has been expensed. These comprise an aggregate of US$38.1 million of debt restructuring costs (see note 6 for further details).
(iv) The Group has an agreement to hire the Stena Spey drilling vessel. At 31 December 2015, based on the drilling forecasts for 2016, it was expected that the vessel would not 
be fully utilised over this period and therefore a provision was recognised for unavoidable contracted costs of US$22.9 million. During the year ended 31 December 2016, 
following changes to the Group’s drilling schedule, the contracted days were utilised in full and the provision of US$22.9 million was reversed. See note 22 for further details.
(v) During the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group disposed of its interest in the Avalon prospect for cash proceeds of US$1.5 million, resulting in a loss on disposal of 
US$16.2 million (refer to note 12). The losses on disposal in 2015 include a $2.3 million loss on the disposal of the Group’s Norwegian exploration licence areas, and an $8.5 
million loss on the disposal of Annan House. 
(vi) ‘Other’ includes the US$1.3 million depreciation of the fair value uplift (2015: US$3.8 million). It also includes other items of income and expense which, because of the 
nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial 
performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in financial performance. In 2016 it primarily includes a $3.4 million 
reversal of a provision for contingent consideration which was no longer required following the results of the Eagle well drilled during the year.
(vii) Finance Act 2016 enacted a change in the supplementary charge tax rate, reducing it from 20% to 10%, and a change to petroleum revenue tax rate, reducing it from 35% 
to 0%, both effective from 1 January 2016. Finance Act 2016 also enacted a reduction in the mainstream corporation tax rate reducing it from 18% to 17% with effect from 1 
April 2020. The impact of these changes in tax rates in 2016 was a tax charge of US$29.5 million.
(viii) At the year end the recovery of deferred tax assets was reviewed which has led to a recognition of previously impaired tax losses totalling US$48.8 million (2015: impairment 
of tax losses of US$239.1 million). This write-back reflects the increase in value of the Group’s assets following a partial recovery of oil prices.

(d) Tax losses 
The Group’s deferred tax assets at 31 December 2016 are recognised to the extent that taxable profits are expected to arise in the future against 
which tax losses and allowances in the UK can be utilised. In accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes the Group assessed the recoverability of 
its deferred tax assets at 31 December 2016 with respect to ring fence tax losses and allowances. The impairment model used to assess the 
extent to which it is appropriate to recognise the Group’s UK tax losses as deferred tax assets was run, using an oil price assumption of Dated 
Brent forward curve in the years 2017 to 2019 followed by US$70/bbl inflated at 2% per annum from 2020. The results of the impairment model 
demonstrated that it was appropriate to recognise a deferred tax asset on US$214.3 million (2015: US$478.1 million deferred tax asset not 
recognised) of the Group’s UK ring fence corporate tax losses at 31 December 2016 based on expected future profitability. The recognised 
loss amount results in a deferred tax credit of US$85.7 million (2015: US$239.1 million) for the year in respect of losses and allowances that were 
previously not recognised as a deferred tax asset.
The Group has unused UK mainstream corporation tax losses of US$285.8 million (2015: US$36.1 million) for which no deferred tax asset has been 
recognised at the balance sheet date due to uncertainty of recovery of these losses. 
The Group realised a capital loss of US$3.3 million in the year to 31 December 2015 in relation to the disposal of a subsidiary company which has 
not been recognised at the balance sheet date due to the uncertainty of recovery.
The Group has unused overseas tax losses in Canada of approximately CAD$13.4 million (2015: CAD$13.4 million) for which no deferred tax 
asset has been recognised at the balance sheet date. The tax losses in Canada have expiry periods of 20 years, none of which expire in 2017, and 
which arose following the change in control of the Stratic group in 2010.
During the year to 31 December 2015 the Group relinquished licences SB307 and SB308 in Malaysia and its only concession in Egypt. No 
deferred tax asset has been recognised at the balance sheet date in respect of tax losses of US$0.05 million (2015: US$30.0 million) in Malaysia 
due to the uncertainty of recovery. In Egypt the tax losses of US$3.1 million expired upon closure of the Branch.
The Group has unused Malaysian income tax losses of US$3.1 million (2015: US$2.1 million) arising in respect of the Tanjong Baram RSC for which 
no deferred tax asset has been recognised at the balance sheet date due to uncertainty of recovery of these losses.
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, Finance Act 2009 exempted foreign dividends from the 
scope of UK corporation tax where certain conditions are satisfied. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2016
7. Income tax continued
(e) Change in legislation
Finance Act 2016 enacted a change in the mainstream corporation tax rate, reducing it from 18% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. The 
impact of the change in tax rate in 2016 was a tax charge of US$0.7 million.
Finance Act 2016 also enacted a change in the supplementary charge tax rate, reducing it from 20% to 10% with effect from 1 January 2016 and 
a change to the petroleum revenue tax rate, reducing it from 35% to 0% with effect from 1 January 2016. The impact of the change in tax rate in 
2016 was a tax charge of US$28.9 million.
(f) Factors affecting future tax charges
The draft Finance Bill 2017 contains proposed legislation in relation to the restriction of corporate interest deductions from 1 April 2017 and 
proposed legislation to restrict relief for mainstream corporate tax losses with effect from 1 April 2017. These changes are not yet substantively 
enacted and, as drafted, the proposed legislation does not impact North Sea ring fence activities and therefore the impact on the Group tax 
charge is expected to be minimal.
8. Earnings per share
The calculation of earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during 
the period.

During 2016 the Group acquired an additional 10.5% interest in the Kraken asset and an additional 15.15% interest in the West Don field, 
resulting in aggregate purchase consideration of US$40.7 million allocated to property, plant and equipment (refer note 29).
On 28 August 2015, the Group completed the sale and leaseback of its Aberdeen property, Annan House, for US$69.5 million, resulting in a loss 
on disposal of US$8.5 million recognised during the year ended 31 December 2015. 
During the year ended 31 December 2016, a liability of US$26.6 million was recognised for the carry payable for the Kraken field following the 
finalisation of a reserve determination (note 22). The amount payable was dependent upon the dated Brent forward curve at the date of the 
reserve determination. During 2015, the previous provision of US$80.0 million was derecognised as, based on oil prices at 31 December 2015, 
no carry was expected to be payable. Change in carry liabilities also includes a US$0.5 million decrease in the liability (note 20(f)) for Malaysian 
assets (2015: increase of US$2.0 million). 
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Scolty/Crathes field received Field Development Plan (‘FDP’) approval and costs of US$16.1 million 
previously held within exploration assets were reclassified as a tangible oil and gas asset. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

(i) Amounts disclosed for Central North Sea include Alma/Galia and Alba. The impairment of Alma/Galia is primarily driven by the lower reservoir and well performance than 
had been estimated previously.
(ii) Northern North Sea includes Heather Broom, Thistle/Deveron and the Dons fields. The impairment reversals are attributable primarily to higher prices in the short term, 
and the impact of a deterioration in the GBP/USD exchange rate on the underlying costs of the assets.
(iii) The amounts disclosed for Malaysia relate to the Tanjong Baram field. 
(iv) Recoverable amount has been determined on a fair value less costs of disposal basis (refer to note 11 for further details of methodology and assumptions used, and note 2 
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements for information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to impairments see impairment of oil and gas 
assets). The amounts disclosed above are in respect of assets where an impairment (or reversal) has been recorded. Assets which did not have any impairment or reversal 
are excluded from the amounts disclosed. 
The net book value at 31 December 2016 includes US$1,536.6 million (2015: US$1,009.8 million) of pre-development assets and development 
assets under construction which are not being depreciated. 
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during the year ended 31 December 2016 was US$55.3 million (2015: US$14.4 million) and relate to 
the Kraken and Scolty/Crathes development projects (2015: Alma/Galia and Kraken development projects as well as the construction of the new 
office building). The weighted average rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation is 6.2%.
The net book value of property, plant and equipment held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts at 31 December 2016 was US$nil 
(2015: US$0.1 million) of oil and gas assets.

At 1 January and 31 December 189,317 189,317
The goodwill balance arose from the acquisition of Stratic and PEDL in 2010 and the Greater Kittiwake Area asset in 2014.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to a single cash-generating unit (‘CGU’), the UK Continental Shelf (‘UKCS’), 
and this is therefore the lowest level at which goodwill is reviewed. 
Impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill and oil and gas assets have been reviewed for impairment at the year end. In 
assessing whether goodwill and oil and gas assets have been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU for goodwill and at field level for oil and 
gas assets, is compared with their recoverable amounts. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGU and fields have been determined on a fair value less costs to sell basis. Discounted cash flow models 
comprising asset-by-asset life of field projections using Level 3 inputs (based on the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy) have been used to determine 
the recoverable amounts. The cash flows have been modelled on a post-tax and post-decommissioning basis discounted at the Group’s post-tax 
weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’) of 10% (2015: 8.5%). Risks specific to assets within the CGU are reflected within the cash flow forecasts. 
Key assumptions used in calculations
The key assumptions required for the calculation of the recoverable amounts are:
• oil prices;
• currency exchange rates;
• production volumes;
• discount rates; and 
• opex, capex and decommissioning costs. 
Oil prices are based on dated Brent forward price curves for the first three years and thereafter at US$70 per barrel inflated at 2% per annum 
from 2020. 
Production volumes are based on life of field production profiles for each asset within the CGU. The production volumes used in the calculations 
were taken from the report prepared by the Group’s independent reserve assessment experts.
Opex, capital expenditure and decommissioning costs are derived from the Group’s Business Plan adjusted for changes in timing based on the 
production model used for the assessment of proven and probable (2P) reserves. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
121
The discount rate reflects management’s estimate of the Group’s WACC. The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost of 
equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on its interest-bearing borrowings. 
Segment risk is incorporated by applying a beta factor based on publicly available market data. The post-tax discount rate applied to the 
Group’s post-tax cash flow projections was 10%.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The Group’s value is highly sensitive, inter alia, to oil price achieved and production volumes. The recoverable amount of the CGU would be 
equal to the carrying amount of goodwill if either the oil price or production volumes (on a CGU weighted average basis) were to fall by 9% from 
the prices outlined above. Goodwill would need to be fully impaired if the oil price or production volumes (on a CGU weighted average basis) 
were to fall by 13% from the prices outlined above. The above sensitivities have flexed revenues and tax cash flows, but operating costs and 
capital expenditures have been kept constant. In reality, management would be highly likely to take steps to mitigate the value impact of further 
falls in the oil price by cutting supply chain costs.

The additions in 2016 and the related change in decommissioning provision primarily relate to the Eagle well which was drilled during the year.
During the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group disposed of its interest in the Avalon prospect for US$1.5 million, realising a loss on 
disposal of US$16.2 million (note 4).
During the year ended 31 December 2015:
• the Group acquired an additional 10% working interest in the Scolty/Crathes field and, following FDP approval in October 2015, the total 
exploration costs of the field were reclassified to tangible oil and gas assets (note 10);
• the Group disposed of its 35% interest in the Norwegian licences PL758 and PL800 and its 50% interest in the PL760 and PL760B for  
US$2.1 million, resulting in a loss of US$2.3 million;
• the Group exited from its interest in Egypt and costs of US$5.0 million refunded were included within disposal of interests in licences;
• unsuccessful exploration costs of US$7.2 million were written off, primarily in relation to the Cairngorm and Elke licences; and
• the Group completed its withdrawal from SB307/308 blocks in Malaysia, for which the carrying value had been previously impaired during the 
year ended 31 December 2014. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

The investment relates to ordinary shares in Ascent Resources Plc (‘Ascent’) held since 2011. In November 2015, Ascent agreed a capital 
reorganisation whereby new shares were issued and the share capital was redenominated. The impact was to reduce EnQuest’s holding from 
160,903,958 0.1p ordinary shares to 8,045,198 0.2p ordinary shares. 
The accounting valuation of the Group’s shareholding (based on the quoted share price of Ascent) resulted in an non-cash impairment reversal 
US$0.05 million in the year to 31 December 2016 (2015: impairment of US$0.6 million).

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 15 to 30 day terms.
Trade receivables are reported net of any provisions for impairment. As at 31 December 2016 no impairment provision for trade receivables was 
necessary (2015: nil).
Joint venture receivables relate to amounts billable to or recoverable from joint venture partners and were not impaired. Under-lift is valued at 
net realisable value being the lower of cost and net realisable value. As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 no other receivables were 
determined to be impaired.
The carrying value of the Group’s trade, joint venture and other receivables as stated above is considered to be a reasonable approximation to 
their fair value largely due to their short term maturities. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

16. Cash and cash equivalents
The carrying value of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents is considered to be a reasonable approximation to their fair value due to their short 
term maturities. Included within the cash balance at 31 December 2016 is restricted cash of US$6.6 million (2015: US$11.5 million). US$6.0 million 
of this relates to cash held in escrow in respect of the unwound acquisition of the Tunisian assets of PA Resources (2015: US$6.8 million) and the 
remainder relates to cash collateral held to issue bank guarantees in Malaysia.
Cash and cash equivalents also include an amount of US$9.4 million held in a Malaysian bank account which can only be used to pay cash calls 
for the Tanjong Baram asset and amounts related to the Tanjong Baram project finance loan.

The share capital comprises only one class of Ordinary share. Each Ordinary share carries an equal voting right and right to a dividend.
On 21 November 2016, the Company completed a placing and open offer, pursuant to which 356,738,114 new Ordinary shares were issued at a 
price of £0.23 per share, generating gross aggregate proceeds of US$101.6 million. 233,858,061 of the new shares issued resulted from existing 
shareholders taking up their entitlement under the open offer to acquire four new Ordinary shares for every nine Ordinary shares previously 
held. There were no new issues of shares during 2015.
At 31 December 2016 there were 33,563,282 shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust (2015: 26,702,378): 10,739,486 shares were acquired 
on 21 November 2016 pursuant to the open offer with the remainder of the movement due to shares used to satisfy awards made under the 
Company’s share-based incentive schemes. 
18. Share-based payment plans
On 18 March 2010, the Directors of the Company approved three share schemes for the benefit of Directors and employees, being a deferred 
bonus share plan, a restricted share plan and a performance share plan. A sharesave plan was approved in 2012. The grant values for all schemes 
are typically based on the average share price from the three days preceding the date of grant.
The share-based payment expense recognised for each scheme was as follows:
2016
US$’000
2015

Deferred Bonus Share Plan (‘DBSP’)
Selected employees are eligible to participate under this scheme. Participants may be invited to elect or, in some cases, be required, to receive 
a proportion of any bonus in Ordinary shares of EnQuest (invested awards). Following such award, EnQuest will generally grant the participant 
an additional award over a number of shares bearing a specified ratio to the number of his or her invested shares (matching shares). The awards 
granted will vest 33% on the first anniversary of the date of grant, a further 33% after year two and the final 34% on the third anniversary of the 
date of grant. Awards, both invested and matching, are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the awards vest. 
The fair values of DBSP awards granted to employees during the year, based on quoted market prices at the date of grant, are set out below:

(i) On 21 November 2016, at its discretion, the Company increased the number of shares receivable by participants in the DBSP by a factor of 1.09265387 so that the value of 
their rights under outstanding awards was not adversely affected by the open offer. This resulted in the grant of 263,790 additional share awards. The fair value of these 
awards of US$0.1 million will be expensed over the remaining vesting period of the original awards to which they relate. 
There were no share awards exercisable at either 31 December 2016 or 2015.
The weighted average contractual life for the share awards outstanding as at 31 December 2016 was 1.0 years (2015: 1.1 years).
Restricted Share Plan (‘RSP’)
Under the Restricted Share Plan scheme, employees are granted shares in EnQuest over a discretionary vesting period at the direction of the 
Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of EnQuest, which may or may not be subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions. 
Awards made under the RSP will vest over periods between one and four years. At present there are no performance conditions applying to this 
scheme nor is there currently any intention to introduce them in the future. 
The fair values of RSP awards granted to employees during the year, based on quoted market prices at the date of grant, are set out below:

their rights under outstanding awards was not adversely affected by the open offer. This resulted in the grant of 1,164,647 additional share awards. The fair value of these 
awards of US$0.4 million will be expensed over the remaining vesting period of the original awards to which they relate.
The weighted average contractual life for the share awards outstanding as at 31 December 2016 was 5.6 years (2015: 1.8 years).
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
Under the Performance Share Plan, the shares vest subject to performance conditions. The PSP share awards granted during the year had three 
sets of performance conditions associated with them. 50% of the award relates to Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) against a comparator group 
of 17 oil and gas companies listed on the FTSE 350, AIM Top 100 and Stockholm NASDAQ OMX; 40% relates to production growth per share; 
and 10% relates to new 2P reserve additions over the three year performance period. Awards will vest on the third anniversary.
The fair value of the awards granted under the plan at various grant dates during the year are based on quoted market prices and allow for the 
effect of the TSR condition, a market-based performance condition. The fair values for awards granted during the year were as follows:

awards of US$1.0 million will be expensed over the remaining vesting period of the original awards to which they relate.
The weighted average contractual life for the share awards outstanding as at 31 December 2016 was 4.5 years (2015: 1.7 years).
Sharesave plan
The Group operates an approved savings related share option scheme. The plan is based on eligible employees being granted options and 
their agreement to opening a sharesave account with a nominated savings carrier and to save over a specified period, either three or five years. 
The right to exercise the option is at the employee’s discretion at the end of the period previously chosen, for a period of six months.

price of outstanding options was also reduced by multiplying by a factor of 0.91520291. The incremental fair value of these adjustments of US$0.1 million will be expensed 
over the remaining vesting period of the options to which they relate.
There were no share options exercisable at either 31 December 2016 or 2015.
The weighted average contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2016 was 3.1 years (2015: 2.9 years).
Executive director bonus awards
As detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 69, one third of the annual bonus for Amjad Bseisu and Jonathan Swinney is paid 
in EnQuest PLC shares, deferred for two years, and subject to continued employment. The number of shares receivable is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee based on the share price in effect on the 1st April following the end of the year to which the bonus relates.
The following table shows the movement in the number of share awards outstanding:
2016

settled by the Company. The Company expects to settle these awards, along with those which relate to the 2014 bonus, during the forthcoming 
financial year.
The fair value of the awards granted each year is equal to the one third portion of the previous year’s bonus that has been deferred. For the 
awards granted in 2016 in respect of the 2015 annual bonus, the fair value per share was 24 pence, determined by reference to the quoted share 
price at the date of grant (2015: 35 pence).

Credit facility
In October 2013, the Group entered into a six year US$1.7 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility (the ‘RCF’), comprising of a committed 
amount of US$1.2 billion (subject to the level of reserves) with a further US$500 million available through an accordion structure. Interest on the 
revolving credit facility was payable at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.50% to 4.25%, dependent on specified covenant ratios.
On 21 November 2016, pursuant to the Restructuring the Group entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which included the 
following terms:
• commitments split into a term facility of US$1.125 billion and a revolving facility of US$75 million (together the ‘Credit Facility’);
• maturity date extended to October 2021;
• amortisation profile amended, with 31 March 2018 the first scheduled amortisation date;
• borrowings subject to mandatory repayment out of excess cash flow (excluding amounts required for approved capital expenditure), 
assessed on a six monthly basis;
• borrowings up to US$890.7 million subject to interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 4.75%, paid in cash;
• borrowings in excess of US$890.7 million subject to interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 5.25%, paid in cash, with a further 3.75% interest 
accrued and added to the PIK amount on each 30 June and 31 December;
• Payment In Kind (‘PIK’) amount repayable at maturity and subject to 9% interest, which is capitalised and added to the PIK amount on each  
30 June and 31 December;
• accordion feature cancelled; and
• US$12 million waiver fee payable to lenders on 31 March 2018.
The Group has concluded that the above amendments to the RCF are a substantial modification, resulting in the previous loan carrying amount 
of US$1,002.3 million (US$1,017.3 million principal less unamortised issuance costs of US$15.0 million) being derecognised and a new loan of 
US$1,017.3 million being recognised at fair value. The difference of US$15.0 million, which equates to the unamortised fees of the previous loan, 
is recognised as loss on extinguishment (see debt restructuring costs, note 4). The US$12 million waiver fee along with US$11.1 million of advisers’ 
fees are directly attributable to the modification of the RCF and have also been expensed as part of the loss on extinguishment (see note 4).
At 31 December 2016, the carrying amount of the Credit Facility in the balance sheet was US$1,037.5 million, comprising the loan principal drawn 
down of US$1,037.3 million, plus US$0.2 million of interest capitalised to the PIK amount (2015: US$883.1 million, being loan principal drawn down 
of US$902.3 million, less unamortised facility fees of US$19.2 million).
At 31 December 2016, after allowing for letter of credit utilisation of US$6.4 million, US$156.3 million remained available for drawdown under the 
Credit Facility.
Tanjong Baram project finance loan
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group entered a five year US$35 million loan facility in Malaysia. Interest is payable at USD LIBOR 
plus a margin of 2.25%. 
Trade creditor loan
In October 2016, the Group borrowed US$40 million under a loan facility with a trade creditor to fund the settlement of deferred amounts for 
the Kraken project. The loan, together with accrued interest at a rate of 7% per annum, is repayable in instalments in 2017 commencing on the 
earlier of 30 days after the date of first oil for the Kraken project and 30 June 2017. A bonus of up to US$1.7 million is payable at 31 December 
2017 if the oil price is above US$75 per barrel in any period of 180 consecutive days between 1 October 2016 and 31 December 2017.
The bonus amount is accounted for as an embedded derivative, which had a valuation of US$nil at 31 December 2016.

High yield bond
In April 2014, the Group issued a US$650 million high yield bond with an originally scheduled maturity of 15 April 2022 and paying a 7% coupon 
semi-annually in April and October.
On 21 November 2016, the high yield bond was amended pursuant to a scheme of arrangement whereby all existing notes were exchanged for 
new notes. The new high yield notes continue to accrue a fixed coupon of 7% payable semi-annually in arrears but interest will only be payable 
in cash if during the six months prior to an interest payment date average dated Brent is equal to or above US$65 per barrel (the ‘Cash Payment 
Condition’). If the Cash Payment Condition is not satisfied in respect of an interest payment date, the interest due is not paid in cash and is 
capitalised and satisfied by the issue of additional high yield notes. US$27.5 million of accrued, unpaid interest as at the restructuring date was 
capitalised and added to the principal amount of the new high yield notes issued pursuant to the scheme. The Company has the option to 
extend the maturity date of the new high yield notes to 15 April 2023. Further, the maturity date of the new high yield notes will be automatically 
extended to 15 October 2023 if the Credit Facility is not repaid or refinanced in full prior to 15 October 2020.
The amendments to the high yield bond are not deemed to be a substantial modification and therefore US$5.0 million of advisers’ fees directly 
attributable to the modification of the high yield bond have been adjusted against the carrying value of the bond and will be amortised over 
bond’s remaining term.
 
The fair value of the high yield bond was estimated to be US$488.0 million. The price quoted for the retail bond was used to estimate the fair 
value of the retail bond, on the basis that since the restructuring, both bonds carry similar rights. 
Retail bond
In 2013 the Group issued a £155 million retail bond with an originally scheduled maturity of 15 February 2022 and paying a 5.5% coupon semi-
annually in February and August. For the interest period commencing 15 August 2016, in accordance with the terms of the bond, the rate of 
interest increased to 7% following the determination of the Company’s leverage ratio at 31 December 2015.
On 21 November 2016, the retail bond was amended pursuant to a scheme of arrangement whereby all existing notes were exchanged for 
new notes. The new retail notes continue to accrue a fixed coupon of 7% payable semi-annually in arrears but interest will only be payable in 
cash if during the six months prior to an interest payment date average dated Brent is equal to or above US$65 per barrel (the ‘Cash Payment 
Condition’). If the Cash Payment Condition is not satisfied in respect of an interest payment date, the interest due is not paid in cash and is 
capitalised and satisfied by the issue of additional retail notes. The maturity of the new retail notes was extended to 15 April 2022 and the 
Company has the option to extend the maturity date to 15 April 2023. Further, the maturity date of the new retail notes will be automatically 
extended to 15 October 2023 if the Credit Facility is not repaid or refinanced in full prior to 15 October 2020.
The amendments to the retail bond are not deemed to be a substantial modification and therefore US$0.8 million of advisers’ fees directly 
attributable to the modification of the high yield bond have been adjusted against the carrying value of the bond and will be amortised over 
bond’s remaining term.
 
The bond had a fair value of US$138.7 million (2015: US$95.5 million). The fair value of the Sterling retail bond has been determined by reference 
to the price available from the market on which the bond is traded.

(b) Commodity contracts
The Group uses put and call options and swap contracts to manage its exposure to the oil price.
Oil price hedging
Purchased put options are designated as hedges of the Group’s production. Where these contracts are effective from a hedge accounting 
perspective, any intrinsic value gains are deferred until such time as the production to which they relate is sold. Movements in the time value 
of these options are recognised in finance costs. A total of 8 million barrels of 2016 production (2015: 10 million barrels), was hedged via the 
purchase of put options, with a strike price of US$68/bbl (2015: US$65/bbl). Gains totalling US$193.2 million (2015: US$127.8 million) were 
included in realised revenue in the income statement in respect of these matured options. In addition, gains deferred in the prior year on the 
early close-out of effective hedges totalling US$2.5 million (2015: US$116.6 million) were recognised in realised revenue.
Mark to market losses on the time value element of these put options, totalling US$5.4 million (2015: US$119.8 million) have been recognised in 
finance costs. Of this amount, US$36.5 million (2015: US$70.0 million) has been recognised within the Group’s ‘Business performance’ results 
as it relates to the amortisation of the option premium paid, over the life of the option. The balance of the mark to market losses have been 
recognised as an exceptional credit/charge in line with the Group’s accounting policy.
In addition, fixed price oil swap contracts in respect of 2 million barrels of 2016 production, with a fixed price of $66.64/bbl, were designated as 
effective hedges at 31 December 2015. Gains totalling US$43.9 million were realised during 2016 in respect of these contracts, together with an 
unrealised gain of US$5.8 million recognised as an exceptional item in the income statement.
There were no derivative oil contracts designated as effective hedges as at 31 December 2016. 
Commodity derivative contracts at fair value through profit or loss
Commodity derivative contracts not designated as effective hedges are designated as at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (‘FVTPL’), and gains 
and losses on these contracts are recognised as a component of revenue. These contracts typically include bought and sold call options, sold 
put options and commodity swap contracts.
For the year ended 31 December 2016, losses totalling US$35.3 million (2015: gains of US$19.6 million) were recognised in respect of commodity 
contracts designated as FVTPL. This included gains totalling US$16.2 million (2015: losses of US$94.8 million) realised on contracts that matured 
during the year, and mark to market losses totalling US$51.5 million (2015: gains of US$114.4 million). Of the realised amounts recognised during 
the year, US$31.2 million (2015: US$111.6 million) was realised in business performance revenue in respect of the amortisation of premium income 
received on sale of these options. The premiums received are amortised into business performance revenue over the life of the option.
Business performance revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 included US$10.4 million of call option premium on options closed early, 
which would have been recognised in 2016 had these options not been closed early. The cost of closing these options was US$1.4 million, which 
was included in business performance revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015.
The mark to market of the Group’s open contracts as at 31 December 2016 was a loss of US$40.5 million in respect of fixed price swap contracts 
for 5,998,000 barrels of 2017 production at a weighted average price of US$51.34/bbl. The mark to market position on the Group’s other 
commodity derivative contracts (including contracts to purchase crude oil for trading purposes which are accounted for as a derivative), was an 
asset of US$8.9 million. 
(c) Foreign currency contracts
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group entered into various forward currency contracts to hedge its exposure in 2016 to operating 
and capital expenditure in Sterling, Euros and Norwegian Kroner. These contracts resulted a realised loss of US$66.9 million and an unrealised 
gain of US$7.7 million recognised in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2016 (2015: similar contracts resulted in a realised 
loss of US$3.2 million and an unrealised gain of US$2.3 million).
During the year ended 31 December 2016, the Group entered into a structure covering the first half of 2017: the counterparty can elect to 
sell £47.5 million to EnQuest at an exchange rate of U$1.4:£1 or purchase 1.3 million barrels of oil at US$58 per barrel. Based on oil prices and 
exchange rates at 31 December 2016, the counterparty would choose to exchange currency, therefore this contract has been presented with 
other foreign currency contracts. The contract resulted in an unrealised loss of US$9.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2016.
(d) Interest rate swap
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group entered an interest rate swap which effectively swaps 50% of floating USD LIBOR rate 
interest on the Malaysian loan into a fixed rate of 1.035% until 2018. The swap, which is effective from a hedge accounting perspective, has a 
net asset fair value of US$0.04 million (2015: US$0.05 million). The impact on the income statement is US$0.06 million (2015: US$0.03 million) 
recognised within finance expenses. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Other receivables
As part of the 2012 farm-out to the Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (‘KUFPEC’) of 35% of the Alma/Galia development, KUFPEC 
agreed to pay EnQuest a total of US$23.3 million over a 36 month period after Alma/Galia is deemed to be fully operational. US$9.1 million was 
received during the year ended 31 December 2016 and the remaining receivable, discounted to present value, had a carrying value of US$14.0 
million at 31 December 2016 (2015: US$22.6 million). Unwinding of discount of US$0.4 million is included within finance income for the year ended 
31 December 2016 (2015: US$0.5 million). 
In August 2016, EnQuest agreed with Armada Kraken PTE Ltd (‘BUMI’) that BUMI would refund US$65 million (EnQuest’s share being U$45.8 
million) of a US$100.0 million lease prepayment made in 2014 for the FPSO for the Kraken field. This refund is receivable in instalments, with 
US$38 million receivable between February 2017 and February 2018, and the balance payable over a two-year period commencing three months 
after the date of first production from the Kraken field. Included within other receivables at 31 December 2016 is an amount of US$43.5 million 
representing the discounted value of EnQuest’s share of these repayments.
 
Other receivables include US$2.3 million (31 December 2015: US$0.2 million) representing the fair value of a convertible loan note from Ascent.
Other liabilities
As part of the agreement to acquire the PM8 asset in Malaysia, the Group agreed to carry Petronas Carigali for its share of exploration or 
appraisal well commitments. The discounted value of US$7.4 million has been disclosed as a financial liability (2015: US$7.7 million). Unwinding of 
the discount of US$0.3 million is included within finance expense for the year ended 31 December 2016 (2015: US$0.3 million).
In addition, included in other liabilities is an accrued waiver fee payable to the Credit Facility lenders in relation to the restructuring of the facility 
in November 2016 (see note 19). The amount is payable by March 2018.
The fair value of the Group’s oil price related embedded derivatives is US$nil (2015: US$0.03 million).

Provision for decommissioning
The Group makes full provision for the future costs of decommissioning its oil production facilities and pipelines on a discounted basis. With 
respect to the Heather field, the decommissioning provision is based on the Group’s contractual obligation of 37.5% of the decommissioning 
liability rather than the Group’s equity interest in the field.
The provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs which are expected to be incurred up to 2033 assuming no further 
development of the Group’s assets. The liability is discounted at a rate of 2.25% (2015: 3.0%). The unwinding of the discount is classified as a 
finance cost (note 6).
Acquisitions during the year ended 31 December 2016 in relation to the additional interests in the Kraken and West Don fields acquired during 
the year were US$7.5 million and US$7.6 million, respectively (refer note 29). EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2016
22. Provisions continued
These provisions have been created based on internal and third party estimates. Assumptions based on the current economic environment 
have been made which management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability. These estimates are reviewed 
regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions. However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon 
future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time. Furthermore, 
the timing of decommissioning liabilities is likely to depend on the dates when the fields cease to be economically viable. This in turn depends 
on future oil prices which are inherently uncertain.
The Group enters into surety bonds principally to provide security for its decommissioning obligations. The surety bond facilities expiring in 
December 2016 were renewed for 12 months pursuant to the Restructuring, with surety bond providers committing to renew for a further 12 
months upon their expiry in 2017 subject to on-going compliance with the terms of the Group’s borrowings. At 31 December 2016, the Group 
held surety bonds totalling US$118.5 million.
Carry provision
Consideration for the acquisition of 40% of the Kraken field from Cairn (previously Nautical) and First Oil in 2012 was through development 
carries. The ‘contingent’ carry is dependent upon a reserves determination which took place in 2016. At 31 December 2015, due to the low 
oil price environment, management’s view was that no carry would be payable. When the reserve determination was finalised in 2016, the 
subsequent increase in oil price resulted in a carry amount of US$26.6 million becoming due under the arrangement. As at 31 December 2016, 
US$21.1 million of the carry had been paid and a liability for the remaining US$5.5 million is recognised on the balance sheet. The development 
carry amount payable was adjusted through the carrying value of the Kraken field in property, plant and equipment (note 10). 
Cost recovery provision
As part of the KUFPEC farm-in agreement, a cost recovery protection mechanism was agreed with KUFPEC to enable KUFPEC to recoup its 
investment to the date of first production. If, on 1 January 2017, KUFPEC’s costs to first production have not been recovered or deemed to have 
been recovered, EnQuest will pay to KUFPEC an additional 20% share of net revenue. This additional revenue is to be paid from January 2017 
until the capital costs to first production have been recovered. 
A provision has been made for the expected payments that the Group will make to KUFPEC. The assumptions made in arriving at the projected 
cash payments are consistent with the assumptions used in the Group’s 2016 year-end impairment test, and the resulting cash flows were 
included in the determination of the recoverable value of the project. In establishing when KUFPEC has recovered its capital cost to first oil, the 
farm in agreement requires the use of the higher of the actual oil price, or $90/bbl real, inflated at 2% per annum from 2012. These cash flows 
have been discounted at a rate of 2.25% (2015: 3.0%).
Contingent consideration
As part of the purchase agreement with the previous owner of the GKA assets, a contingent consideration was agreed based on Scolty/Crathes 
FDP approval and ‘first oil’. EnQuest paid US$3.0 million in November 2015, following FDP approval in October 2015. US$9.0 million is due 
on the later of first oil or 31 March 2017 and US$8.0 million is due on the later of one year after first oil or 30 January 2018. In addition, further 
payments will become due if the oil price rises above US$75 per barrel on a linear basis up to US$100 per barrel, up to a cap of US$20.0 million. 
The cash flows have been discounted using a 3% discount rate. An option model has been used to value the element of the consideration 
that is contingent on the oil price and has resulted in a credit to the income statement of US$0.7 million for the year ended 31 December 
2016 (2015: nil). The carrying value of the Scolty/Crathes contingent consideration at 31 December 2016 is US$17.3 million (31 December 2015: 
US$17.6 million).
In addition, there is consideration due subject to future exploration success. The provision at 31 December 2015 relating to this was US$8.7 
million and this has been reassessed for the year ended 31 December 2016 to US$5.3 million. The reduction of US$3.4 million, which has been 
released to the income statement, related to the results of the Eagle well drilled during the year, which indicate that no deferred consideration 
would be due on this prospect.
Surplus lease provision
In June 2015, the Group entered a 20 year lease in respect of the Group’s office building in Aberdeen with part of the building subsequently 
being sub-let with a rent-free incentive. A provision has been recognised for the unavoidable costs in relation to the sub-let space. The provision 
has been discounted using a 2.25% discount rate. At 31 December 2016, the provision was US$2.8 million (2015 US$3.5 million).
In addition, the Group has an agreement to hire the Stena Spey drilling vessel in 2016. As at 31 December 2015, the vessel was not expected to 
be fully utilised over the contract period and a provision was recognised for the unavoidable costs of US$22.9 million. Based on the actual vessel 
utilisation, the provision was reversed in full to the income statement during the year ended 31 December 2016. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Trade payables are normally non-interest bearing and settled on terms of between 10 and 30 days. The Group has arrangements with various 
suppliers to defer payment of a proportion of its capital spend. The majority of these deferred payments fall due in 2017 and the balance is 
expected to be fully settled by early 2019. 
Certain trade and other payables will be settled in currencies other than the reporting currency of the Group, mainly in Sterling.
Accrued expenses include accruals for capital and operating expenditure in relation to the oil and gas assets.
The carrying value of the Group’s trade and other payables as stated above is considered to be a reasonable approximation to their fair value 
largely due to the short term maturities.
24. Commitments and contingencies
Commitments

On 20 December 2013, the Group entered into a bareboat charter with Armada Kraken PTE Limited (‘BUMI’) for the lease of an FPSO vessel for 
the Kraken field. The lease will commence on the date of first production which is currently targeted to come onstream in H1 2017. BUMI have 
constructed the vessel and the Group made an initial prepayment of US$100.0 million during 2014. In August 2016 it was agreed that US$65.0 
million of this prepayment would be refunded (refer note 20(f)).
(iv) Capital commitments
At 31 December 2016, the Group had capital commitments excluding the above lease commitments amounting to US$267.3 million (2015: 
US$433.5 million).
Contingencies
The Group becomes involved from time to time in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of its business. Other than as 
discussed below, the Company is not, nor has been during the past 12 months, involved in any governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings 
which, either individually or in the aggregate, have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company’s and/or the Group’s 
financial position or profitability, nor, so far as the Company is aware, are any such proceedings pending or threatened. 
The Group is currently engaged in a dispute with KUFPEC, the Group’s field partner in respect of Alma/Galia. KUFPEC has commenced a 
court action in the High Court of Justice claiming an alleged breach of one of the Group’s warranties provided under the Alma/Galia Farm-
in Agreement and seeking damages of US$91.0 million (the maximum breach of warranty claim permitted under the Alma/Galia Farm-in 
Agreement), together with interest. The court proceedings are currently stayed as the parties attempt to resolve the disputed issues. In the 
event that no agreement is reached and the court proceedings are recommenced, the Directors believe that a considerable period will elapse 
before any decision is reached by the courts. 
The Directors consider the merits of the claim to be poor and the Group intends to defend itself vigorously. The Group has not made any 
provisions in respect of this claim as the Directors believe the claim is unlikely to be successful; and in any event the Directors believe the 
chances of an outcome exposing the Group to material damages are remote. There can, however, be no assurances that this claim will not 
ultimately be successful, or that the Group would not otherwise seek to enter into a settlement or compromise in respect of this claim, or that in 
the event of any such circumstances the Group would not incur costs and expenses in excess of its estimates.
The Group is also currently engaged in discussions with EMAS, one of the Group’s contractors on Kraken who performed the installation of a 
buoy and mooring system, in relation to the payment of approximately US$20.0 million of variation claims which EMAS claims is due as a result 
of soil conditions at the work site being materially different from those reasonably expected to be encountered based on soil data previously 
provided. The Group is confident that such variation claims are not valid and that accordingly such amount is not due and payable by the Group 
under the terms of the contract with EMAS. No formal court action has been commenced or threatened by EMAS. The parties are currently in 
discussions pursuant to the dispute resolution process under the contract.

26. Risk management and financial instruments
Risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities comprise trade and other receivables, cash and short term deposits, interest-bearing loans, 
borrowings and finance leases, derivative financial instruments and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial instruments is 
to manage short term cash flow and raise finance for the Group’s capital expenditure programme.
The Group’s activities expose it to various financial risks particularly associated with fluctuations in oil price, foreign currency risk, liquidity risk 
and credit risk. Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below. Also presented below 
is a sensitivity analysis to indicate sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Group’s financial instruments and to show the impact on profit 
and shareholders’ equity, where applicable. The sensitivity has been prepared for periods ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 using the amounts 
of debt and other financial assets and liabilities held at those reporting dates.
Commodity price risk – oil prices
The Group is exposed to the impact of changes in Brent oil prices on its revenues and profits generated from sales of crude oil. 
The Group’s policy is to have the ability to hedge oil prices up to a maximum of 75% of the next 12 months’ production on a rolling annual basis, 
up to 60% in the following 12 month period and 50% in the subsequent 12 month period.
Details of the commodity derivative contracts entered into during, and on hand at the end of 2016, are disclosed in note 20.
The following table summarises the impact on the Group’s pre-tax profit and total equity of a reasonably possible change in the Brent oil price, 
on the fair value of derivative financial instruments (primarily fixed price swaps over a total of 6.0 million barrels as at 31 December 2016), with 
all other variables held constant. As the derivatives on hand at 31 December 2016 have not been designated as hedges, there is no impact 
on equity.

Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign current risk arising from movements in currency exchange rates. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases 
in currencies other than the Group’s functional currency (US Dollars) and the bond which is denominated in Sterling. To mitigate the risks of large 
fluctuations in the currency markets, the hedging policy agreed by the Board allows for up to 70% of non-US Dollar portion of the Group’s annual 
capital budget and operating expenditure to be hedged. For specific contracted capital expenditure projects, up to 100% can be hedged. 
Approximately 1% (2015: 1%) of the Group’s sales and 81% (2015: 85%) of costs (including capital expenditure) are denominated in currencies 
other than the functional currency.
As at 31 December 2016, the Group’s only foreign currency hedging in place was a NOK37.1 forward contract with a strike price of NOK8.61/£1 
which matures in Q1 2017. In addition, the Group had entered into a ‘chooser’ option in June 2016, hedging either 1.3MMbbls of H1 2017 
production at $58/bbl or GBP47.5 million of H1 GBP exposure at a fixed rate of $1.40/GBP . The counterparty has the right to choose whether 
to settle the oil price hedge or the currency hedge each month. A further chooser option was entered into in January 2017, hedging either 
1.5MMbbls at $60/bbl or GBP66.0 million at a fixed rate of $1.1975/GBP .
The Group also enters into foreign currency swap contracts from time to time to manage short term exposures. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

26. Risk management and financial instruments continued
The following table summarises the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US Dollar to Sterling foreign exchange rate, with all other 
variables held constant, of the Group’s profit before tax due to changes in the carrying value of monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting 
date. The impact in equity is the same as the impact on profit before tax. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other 
currencies is not material:

Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis. Credit risk in financial instruments arises from cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial 
instruments where the Group’s exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of 
these instruments (see maturity table within liquidity risks). For banks and financial institutions, only those rated with a A-/A3 credit rating or 
better are accepted. Cash balances can be invested in short term bank deposits and AAA-rated liquidity funds, subject to Board approved 
limits and with a view to minimising counterparty credit risks.
In addition there are credit risks of commercial counterparties including exposures in respect of outstanding receivables. The Group trades only 
with recognised international oil and gas operators and at 31 December 2016 there were US$5.6 million of trade receivables past due (2015: nil), 
US$8.6 million of joint venture receivables past due (2014: US$1.5 million) and nil (2014: US$2.0 million) of other receivables past due but not 
impaired. Subsequent to year-end, US$10.9 million of these outstanding balances have been collected. Receivable balances are monitored on 
an ongoing basis with appropriate follow-up action taken where necessary.

At 31 December 2016, the Group had three customers accounting for 90% of outstanding trade receivables (2015: three customers, 65%) and five 
joint venture partners accounting for 90% of joint venture receivables (2015: five joint venture partners, 77%). 
Liquidity risk
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by reviewing its cash flow requirements on a regular basis relative to its existing bank facilities 
and the maturity profile of its borrowings. Specifically the Group’s policy is to ensure that sufficient liquidity or committed facilities exist within 
the Group to meet its operational funding requirements and to ensure the Group can service its debt and adhere to its financial covenants. 
On 21 November 2016, the Company concluded a comprehensive financial restructuring comprising: amendments to the credit facility, high 
yield bond and retail bond; renewal of surety bond facilities; and a placing and open offer (the ‘Restructuring’). The terms of the Restructuring 
are set out further in notes 17 and 19. The Restructuring was designed to provide the Group with a stable and sustainable capital structure, 
reduced cash debt service obligations and greater liquidity. In particular, the Restructuring is expected to enable the Group to complete the 
Kraken and Scolty/Crathes developments. At 31 December 2016, US$156.3 million was available for draw down under the Group’s Credit Facility 
(see note 19). 
The following tables detail the maturity profiles of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities including projected interest thereon. The 
amounts in these tables are different from the balance sheet as the table is prepared on a contractual undiscounted cash flow basis and include 
future interest payments.

Capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and equity 
attributable to the equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as in the Group Statement of Changes 
in Equity on page 100.
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to optimise the return on investment, by managing its capital structure to achieve 
capital efficiency while also maintaining flexibility. The Group regularly monitors the capital requirements of the business over the short, 
medium and long term, in order to enable it to foresee when additional capital will be required. On 21 November 2016, the Group completed a 
comprehensive package of financial restructuring measures, refer notes 17 and 19 for further details.
The Group has approval from the Board to hedge foreign exchange risk on up to 70% of the non US Dollar portion of the Group’s annual capital 
budget and operating expenditure. For specific contracted capex projects, up to 100% can be hedged. In addition, there is approval from the 
Board to hedge up to 75% of annual production in year one, 60% in year two and 50% in year three. This is designed to reduce the risk of adverse 
movements in exchange rates and prices eroding the return on the Group’s projects and operations.
The Board regularly reassesses the existing dividend policy to ensure that shareholder value is maximised. Any future payment of dividends is 
expected to depend on the earnings and financial condition of the Company and such other factors as the Board considers appropriate.
The Group monitors capital using the gearing ratio and return on shareholders’ equity as follows:

27. Post balance sheet events
On 24 January 2017, EnQuest announced that it had agreed to acquire from BP an initial 25% interest in the Magnus oil field (‘Magnus’) 
representing c.15.9 MMboe of additional net 2P reserves (gross reserves of 63.4 MMboe) with net production of 4.2 Mboepd in 2016 (gross 
production 16.6 Mboepd) as well as a 3.0% interest in the Sullom Voe oil terminal and supply facility (‘SVT’), 9.0% of Northern Leg Gas Pipeline 
(‘NLGP’), and 3.8% of Ninian Pipeline System (‘NPS’) (collectively the ‘Transaction Assets’). EnQuest currently has existing interests of 3.0% in 
SVT, 5.9% in NLGP and 2.7% in NPS.
EnQuest will become the operator of the Transaction Assets; the transaction is subject to certain regulatory, government authority, counterparty 
and partner consents. 
The consideration for these interests is US$85.0 million (subject to working capital and other adjustments), which will be funded by deferred 
consideration payable from the cash flow of the Transaction Assets. There are no requirements for cash from EnQuest other than as generated 
from the Transaction Assets. In addition, EnQuest has an option to acquire the remaining 75% of Magnus and BP’s interest in the associated 
infrastructure. EnQuest also has the option to receive US$50 million from BP in exchange for undertaking the management of the physical 
decommissioning activities for Thistle and Deveron and making payments by reference to 6% of the gross decommissioning costs of Thistle and 
Deveron fields.

Net identifiable assets 2,464 4,998 7,462
Kraken
In February 2016, the Group acquired an additional 10.5% interest in the Kraken development asset from First Oil PLC (‘First Oil’) for nominal 
consideration. As a result, EnQuest’s working interest in this joint arrangement increased to 70.5%. EnQuest also waived its right to reclaim its 
US$5.0 million share of cash calls paid on behalf of First Oil in January and February 2016. Although the asset has proven 2P reserves, as the field 
is yet to achieve first oil and the necessary infrastructure to produce oil and generate revenues is not yet in place, the Group does not consider 
that the activity of this joint arrangement constitutes a business, as defined by IFRS 3, and therefore the Group has recognised the individual 
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with their cost allocated based on their relative fair values as shown above.
West Don
In August 2016, the Group acquired an additional 15.15% interest in the West Don producing field from First Oil, resulting in a revised working 
interest of 78.6% in this joint arrangement. As the asset has proven 2P reserves and is currently in production and generating revenues, the 
Group considers that the activity of this joint arrangement constitutes a business and therefore the Group has applied the principles of business 
combinations accounting from IFRS 3 to the acquisition of the additional interest.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table above. The consideration 
of US$2.5 million, which was satisfied through a reduction of receivable balances, equalled the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed and therefore no goodwill arose on the acquisition.
The additional interest in the West Don joint arrangement contributed US$2.7 million revenue and a US$0.9 million loss to the Group’s profit for 
the period between the date of the acquisition and the balance sheet date. If this acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial 
year, US$6.0 million revenue and a US$1.5 million loss would have been contributed to the Group’s profit for the year ended 31 December 2016.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
for the Parent Company Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected 
to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under Company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In 
preparing the parent company financial statements the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the Company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2016
1. Corporate information
The separate parent company financial statements of EnQuest PLC (the ‘Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2016 were authorised for 
issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 20 March 2017.
EnQuest PLC (‘EnQuest’ or the ‘Company’) is a limited liability company registered in England and is the holding company for the group of 
EnQuest subsidiaries (together the ‘Group’). 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ 
(‘FRS 101’) and the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’). The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100, ‘Application of 
Financial Reporting Requirements’ as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. The Company has notified its shareholders in writing about, 
and they do not object to, the use of the disclosure exemptions used by the Company in these financial statements.
These financial statements are prepared under the historical cost basis except for the remeasurement of certain financial instruments to fair 
value. The functional and presentation currency of the separate financial statements is United States Dollars and all values in the separate 
financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$’000) except where otherwise stated.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to  
share-based payments, financial instruments, fair value measurement, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect 
of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. Where 
relevant, equivalent disclosures have been given in the Group accounts.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented an income 
statement or a statement of comprehensive income for the parent company. The parent company’s accounts present information about it as an 
individual undertaking and not about its group. The Company reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 December 2016 of US$42.5 million 
(2015: loss US$389.6 million). There were no other recognised gains or losses in the period (2015: nil).
Going concern
The Directors’ assessment of going concern concludes that the use of the going concern basis is appropriate and that there are no material 
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. See pages 34 and 35 in the 
Financial Review for further details.
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The management of the Group has to make estimates and judgements when preparing the financial statements of the Group. Uncertainties in 
the estimates and judgements could have an impact on the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the Group’s result. The most important 
estimates and judgements in relation thereto are:
Going concern
The going concern assumption is highly sensitive to economic conditions. The Company closely monitors and manages its funding position and 
liquidity risk throughout the year including monitoring forecast covenant results to ensure it has access to sufficient funds to meet forecast cash 
requirements. Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities considered for, but not limited to, changes in crude oil prices (adjusted for 
hedging undertaken by the Group), production rates and development project timing and costs. These forecasts and sensitivity analyses allow 
management to mitigate any liquidity or covenant compliance risks in a timely manner.
Impairment of investments in subsidiaries
Determination of whether investments have suffered any impairment requires an estimation of the assets recoverable value. The recoverable 
value is based on the discounted cash flows expected to arise from the subsidiaries’ oil and gas assets, using asset-by-asset life of field 
projections as part of the Group’s assessment for the impairment of the oil and gas assets. See Group critical accounting estimates and 
judgements.
Taxation
The tax provision is prepared before the tax return is filed with the tax authority and, significantly, before it has been agreed. As a result, 
the tax provision process necessarily involves the use of a number of estimates and judgements including those required in calculating the 
effective tax rate.
The Company recognises deferred tax assets on unused tax losses where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available for utilisation. 
This requires management to make judgements and assumptions regarding the amount of deferred tax that can be recognised, as well as the 
likelihood of future taxable profits. 
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional currency are recorded at the prevailing rate of exchange on the date of the 
transaction. At the year end, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of exchange 
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the rate of exchange as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the rate of exchange at the date the fair value was determined. All foreign exchange gains and losses are taken to 
profit or loss. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016

Notes to the Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2016
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity 
investments, available-for-sale financial investments, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs, except in the case of financial assets recorded at fair value through 
profit or loss.
Subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described below:
• Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
• Loans and receivables
• Held-to-maturity investments
• Available-for-sale financial assets
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’)
Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL when the financial asset is either held for trading or designated as at FVTPL. 
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised immediately in the income 
statement.
Financial assets designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL are designated at their initial recognition date and only if the criteria under IAS 39 
are satisfied.
Available-for-sale financial investments
Listed and unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair 
value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the available-for-
sale reserve with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is disposed of or is 
determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the available-for-sale reserve is reclassified to profit or loss. 
Loans and receivables 
These include trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
and are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the 
effective interest rate, except for short term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less any provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, cash in hand, outstanding bank overdrafts and highly liquid interest bearing securities with 
original maturities of three months or less. 
Deferred tax
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax 
rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in 
the Company financial statements. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax 
liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are 
offset, only if a legal right exists to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation 
authority and that authority permits the Company to make a single net payment.
Trade and other payables
Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods or services received, whether billed by the supplier or not.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are amortised 
over the life of the facility.
Borrowing costs are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial liability where appropriate.  STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
145
Bonds
Bonds are measured on an amortised cost basis. 
Employee Benefit Trust
EnQuest shares held by the Group are deducted from the share-based payments reserve and are recognised at cost. Consideration received for 
the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and the original cost being taken to 
reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Share-based payment transactions
Employees (including Directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees 
render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (equity-settled transactions) of EnQuest.
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. In 
valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service or performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the 
shares of EnQuest (market conditions) or ‘non-vesting’ conditions, if applicable.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised over the period in which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the 
vesting period). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the 
extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The 
profit and loss account charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of 
that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon market or non-vesting 
conditions, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied. Equity awards cancelled are treated as vesting immediately on the date of cancellation, and any expense 
not recognised for the award at that date is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The Company operates a number of share award schemes on behalf of the employees of the Group which are described in detail within note 18 
of the Group financial statements.
The reserve for the share-based payments is used to record the value of equity-settled share-based payments awarded to employees and 
transfers out of this reserve are made upon vesting of the original share awards.

The Company has recognised an impairment of its investment in subsidiary undertakings of US$11.4 million (2015: US$374.9 million). The 
impairment for the year ended 31 December 2016 has been driven by increased levels of borrowings by subsidiaries, plus a reduced hedge book 
value compared to 31 December 2015, partially offset by an increased value of the underlying oil and gas assets.
Details of the Company’s subsidiaries at 31 December 2016 are provided in note 28 of the Group financial statements.
The interest in other listed investments at the end of the year is part of the Group’s investment in the ordinary share capital of Ascent Resources 
plc, which is incorporated in Great Britain and registered in England and Wales. Refer to note 13 of the Group financial statements for more 
detail on the impairment. EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2016
